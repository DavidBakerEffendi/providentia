Talk about service! This is the most professional atmosphere I've ever experienced in a restaurant. The wait staff leaves nothing to chance and basically stands around waiting for you to need something, as soon as you do, its taken care of in seconds. The gauchos are exceptional too, they will bring you any cut at any temp, and will even see that what you want is throw on the grill, if its not already on the floor; pretty awesome. That aside, the meats are amazing; the lamb chops and bottom sirloin in particular. Don't waste your time or $$$ with the salad bar, maybe a little bread and cheese to help the feast along, but go carnivore if you're gonna spend the money. Go for lunch, same menu, but $15 cheaper
