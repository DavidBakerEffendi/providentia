My first time at an Afghani restaurant, and I was quite pleased. The atmosphere was really cozy, and we were seated as soon as we walked in. Wasn't busy at all when we got there, but picked up a bit as we ate. The food was good, and I really liked the samosas we got as starters. My dining partner got sweet doogh as well, which was excellent! The Afghani iced tea was good too, the cardamom wasn't too strong at all. So overall, I'd definitely go again.
