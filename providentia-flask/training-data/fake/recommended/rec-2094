I'm doing the infamous "over-rated" chant in my head as I type.   This was my second visit to Corner Bistro and it only confirmed my initial conclusion from a few years back: OVERRATED!! Am I supposed to be impressed b/c they make the burgers to order??  I can get Burger King to make burgers to order...  It's a typical pub burger with no distinguishing qualities about it.  and BTW that the extent of the menu besides chili and grilled chicken..  but anyway - the burger is good but I can easily name 10 places that blow it away without even breaking a sweat. Bottom line: - as I just texted a friend who swears by Corner Bistro - this place is full of hipsters all telling each other how great the burgers are and it's perceived as "cool" because it's hard to find the place b/c it has a querky address. one more time:  over-rated!
