here at minetta tavern good food is matched with a great atmosphere.  good ole eddie minetta decorated it up nice, and the present owners have kept the paraphernalia up, including hundreds of caricatures and old photos.   while atmosphere is all well and good, it really comes down to the food, doesn't it.  especially when we're looking at those 3 dollar signs.  minetta delivers.  thoughtful dishes, such as the lobster salad, a tartar plate of beef, lamb, and veal, prepare a person for great things to come.   those great things comes in the form of the cote de beouf.  now i'm not an extravagant person, but if i'm gonna eat at an expensive restaurant, i'm gonna do it right.  you've got to get this steak.  the moment the waiter brings it out for you to admire, the perfectly cooked hunk of meat looks you dead in the eye and says, 'i'm worth it.'  it may not have actually spoken to me, but its fragrance did the talking.  it was then taken away, then cut for us, with two marrow packed bones.   from that dish, you realize that richness is the name of the game here at minetta, and they do it up right. in addition, the serving seems quite flawless, even if some ass (notably me) decides to tip his glass over on the table, or a jerk (also me) pushes a water glass onto the floor.  they were on it in a second, and polite about it. the one drawback is the size of the dining room.  any place that you have to move a table out to sit down is small.  that said, once i was there it wasn't half bad... just don't get between me an my cote de boeuf.
