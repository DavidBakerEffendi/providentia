To sum up our vist: we had excellent food with a really sweet waitress who went above and beyond. We came from Virginia for the weekend and were actually going to Il Triangolo, only to arrive and see they are closed for August.  So, pulling out the Yelp app, I looked to see where else we could eat and Rincon Criollo popped up. Started with cod fish fritters and sangria which were both excellent.  Then, we decided on the pot roast and chorizo special and the ropa vieja. OMG - both were so good but the pot roast was the winner....I'm still dreaming about it - and it was my husband's dish, lol. The waitress, (who was actually the daughter of the owner) was so informative and even brought us a sample to try before we decided what to order.   For dessert we had bread pudding and espresso.  The bread pudding was good and had Zinfandel wine in it which gave it a good flavor and the espresso was delicious.   Overall, we would definitely come back. I'd love to try some of the other menu items, I have a feeling you can't go wrong with whatever you order here. Oh and just as an FYI - the only card they take is American Express or else you'll need to pay with cash.  There is an ATM at the front.
