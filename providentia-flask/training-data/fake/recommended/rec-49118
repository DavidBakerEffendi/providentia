This is in my top 10 restaurants in the city for many reasons. 1) Meatballs are one of my favorite foods, and if they are on any menu, I am probably ordering them. 2) The ambiance is super cool, with exposed brick, fun music, lively crowd, and dim lighting so you always look sexy. 3) Not only are the meat balls great, they let you build your own meal, which for someone that can sometimes be on the picker side, is amazing because everything is customizable. 4) The wine is pretty good, and even better when you see the prices. One can leave this joint with a 35 dollar tab with tip and be stuffed. 5) Although you might have to wait a couple of hours to sit, they can accommodate sizable crowds - aka I wouldn't go with more then 6/7. 6) The owners frequently are at the restaurants, busing tables, which I think is amazing and proves how dedicated they are to their business. Overall I have NEVER had a bad meal here - go if you haven't already... and soon. I love this place so much I had my caterer at my wedding recreate their pork and turkey balls for one of the stations - it was one of the hottest items on the menu.
