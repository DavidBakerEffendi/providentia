Pats was good.  Both Pats and Geno's are not big on customer service.  If I return to Philly I wouldn't visit again.  Not too much different from others who reviewed.  I went to pats first.  There wasn't anyone there so the attendant started asking me to order.  I was trying to figure out what I wanted and he kept asking so I said Philly wit onions... He said cheese? I said yes.  He said shoulda told me that... No worries.  I got my sandwich and begin to eat it.  I decided to save some for later and try Geno's.  mistake... I had the other half of my sandwich in hand and my husband was in line at Geno's to order their sandwich.  I went to get a napkin.  One of the guys said... Don't use our napkins with that pats sandwich in your hand.  Those are for paying customers only.  I apologized and tried to clear up the misunderstanding to no avail.  Me... I apologize.  My husband is in line for one of your sandwiches.  We want to compare and take the food challenge.  Another geno employee came from the back and says...we paid for those not pats.  I said I understand I think their is a misunderstanding.  The guy said no their isn't.  We don't want your money.  Ok....we left.  I wouldn't recommend either.  We will try tony lukes next time.  Have fun and tourist beware
