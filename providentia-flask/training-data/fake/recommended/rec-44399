Just went here last night as a Xmas dinner with family in from out-of-town. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was wonderful -- casual dressy -- and our waiter, Ian, was fantastic! He knew his wines and helped us find a great bottle from their interesting wine list. I had the pesto risotto with asparagus and grilled shimp, my husband had the penne bolegnese and our guests had the sea bass. We shared everything and thought all of the dishes were wonderful. Don't skip dessert -- the chocolate ganache and creme brûlée are equally as tasty as the entrees!
