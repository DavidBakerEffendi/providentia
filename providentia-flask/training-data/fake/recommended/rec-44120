the beer selection at this place allows me to forgive it for the fact that 1) it's named after a U2 album 2) it's in an absolute nightlife wasteland and 3) some of their beers are a bit overpriced. like i said, the beer here is the draw. very much geared toward the high ABV beer geek kind of crowd - often they tap rare beers that they don't even have the alcohol content posted, which is somewhat terrifying. heavy on porters, stouts (imperial, oatmeal and traditional irish), strong ales and IPAs, which is right up my alley. if you're a nerd for belgians, you're better off somewhere else - you've got a lot (read: too many) options elsewhere in the city. never had the food, but i could see it being a slight step up from your typical pub grub. i discovered today that they have "IPA fries" and i'm not quite sure what that means, but chances are better than not that i'd like it. oh, it's also across the street from my office, which is both a positive and a negative. positive because my job drives me to drink quite often, negative because i'd almost never go there on a weekend due to its proximity to work (and everything else that goes on around the ESB...). give it a shot if you like good beer and you're in the neighborhood. pretty much every neighborhood south of 59th has a similarly themed bar, though, so i wouldn't go out of my way for it.
