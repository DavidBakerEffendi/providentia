This is a gem in the mix of random bars and various Italian restaurants.  As a regular, I have yet to see an unhappy diner. The vibe is a perfect mix of perfect for a first date or a girls night out.   Things not to miss on the menu: Meatball Mondays, Gnocchi, the cheese plate (any combo), the calamari salad, Salmon Added tip: Arrive on the weekdays and have a glass of wine at the bar to get a free app.  I think it goes until 7pm.
