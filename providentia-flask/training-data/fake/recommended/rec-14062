The buttermilk biscuit sandwich was tasty and original, and I would have been a three-star happy camper had I not tasted my friend's FANTASTIC blueberry pancakes. Listed simply on the menu as "pancakes," they were anything but that (see other reviews for detail). I pine for the day I might return and enjoy a full order of blueberry, or possibly try the banana walnut . Long lines, with reason.
