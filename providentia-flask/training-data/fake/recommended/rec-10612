Super Cute Place!!! Great place to grab a quick bite, especially if it is a nice day outside. There are about 6 tables and the whole front of the building opens up, so you feel like you are sitting outside no matter where you are (it does help that it is extremely small inside). Even thought they are known for their burgers, I had the creamy chicken with sun-dried tomato penne pasta. It was excellent! The portions were right on target, the staff was friendly, and the prices were reasonable. Defiantly a good stop! Oh and just one word of caution - if you are going to come here bring cash. They don't accept credit cards.
