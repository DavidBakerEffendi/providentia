Got the Groupon deal. Went in with two other people. Server served water after 20 mins. Sorry Sir, we dont have coffee..... Seriously???? Ordered Trio Mixed Grill. I got 6 pieces of chicken. They were smaller than Mcnuggets. $12 for that? After placing the order, server came back and said that they ran out of lamb. Hmmm. Naan didnt look fresh. It got hard like a taco 5 mins after it was served. Service was bad. I asked for spicy but I got all tomato puree filled curries. Not even spicy. I will never go here again. WORST was their Mango Lassi. It was not even sweet, It tasted very bad milk. They do give small quantity. $90 bucks for three entrees is very pricey. There are much better places around Hartford other than this.
