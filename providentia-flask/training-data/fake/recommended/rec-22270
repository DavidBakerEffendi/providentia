I've lived in New Haven for two years now, but I initially avoided Claire's because of what seemed like mediocre reviews. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the excellent customer service! It definitely has a local, neighborhood feel that I find unusual among restaurants so close to the Yale campus. If anything, I've encountered more staff in restaurants being annoyed with students. Can't say I blame local businesses for that, but all the more impressive that Claire's maintains its cool. You feel like you have a staff of family members working behind the counter, ready to take care of you. The menu is indeed large as others have mentioned, but I don't see that as a negative. It amazes me that there are so many great-sounding options for vegetarians and vegans alike! I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, but I wanted healthier eating options as someone who watches her weight and pays attention to nutrition! If you want some tasty but diverse low-calorie options, Claire's is the place! You can eat more than just rabbit food and water. ;) I've tried their veggie burgers--the All-American and California Burgers--and I LOVED it. Mine came with a lovely beet salad and their veggie patty has great flavor. I don't normally like veggie patties, but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and a lot of thought was put into what makes that patty satisfying to the stomach. It won't taste like a beef burger obviously--but it's the next best thing when you can't afford to consume any more saturated fats or empty calories! BONUS POINTS: The owner herself heard my friends and I laughing and enjoying ourselves, came out to greet us, and gave us a free cupcake just because she thought we sounded like we were having fun. She wanted to reward us just for being us! :) It doesn't get much better than that. I definitely think Claire's deserves more credit than it has so far received!
