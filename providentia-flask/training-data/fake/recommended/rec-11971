I recently discovered that David Chang's from my hometown in Virginia, giving me yet another reason to be overenthusiastic for the guy and his restaurants.  Not that I really needed another reason.  They are all top-notch.  But you probably already knew that.  ANYWAY: The food: I had Virginia country ham, pork buns, beef tendon, fried brussels sprouts, and the pbj dessert with two OB's.  The ham was laid out charcuterie style with mustard and a little bread.  It needed no embellishment, to add any would be to detract from the dish, so it was very tasty.  The pork buns really need no description.  Just get them.  The beef tendon was served cold with a lot of cilantro, scallion, and probably several other things I was too busy wolfing down to notice.  Anyway, the taste was bright and fresh while tendons were very tender and easy to eat.  The person I was eating with found them to be fatty, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment.  The brussels sprouts were fried with lots of garlic and bear no resemblance to your mom's over-boiled brussels sprouts.  They were crispy and amazing.  A great dish.  If I had to say I was disappointed with one thing, it would be the pbj dessert.  The desserts I've had at noodle bar and ko were amazing, so I was expecting some sort of alchemy from this one.  Unfortunately, I just didn't feel that the flavors really came through.  It was basically a "jelly" flavored pie with crumbled up ritz crackers and a smear of peanut butter underneath.  The peanut butter was bland and the jelly pie just didn't have a strong enough flavor for me.  But no matter, the rest was amazing. The atmosphere, like any Chang place, was great.  Totally casual with cool music.  Definitely much more comfortable and chill than most restaurants that serve food on the same level as Ssam.  Plus you can't beat the playfulness and exuberance that comes through in nearly every dish (conceptually, at least).  The dude is a treasure.  Vienna, VA represent.
