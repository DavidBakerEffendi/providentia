Really great lunch! We got an appetizer sampler- humus, zucchini, babaganoush, grape leaves. It was surprisingly delicious! We could tell it was all freshly made. We also got fried calamari and lentil soup. Both were equally amazing. We will definitely be back! They should be very successful with such delicious food!
