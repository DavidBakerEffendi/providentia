As a UWS girl, I was always very hesitant to trek all the way over the UES for food and drinks. But I am so glad I tried the Drunken Munkey. Something I love about NYC is that every bar/restaurant you walk into is inventive and unique. This place is an Indian restaurant but also one of the best cocktail bars I've ever been to! It has a dark, speakeasy vibe that I'm always drawn to. While I can't speak for the food (though the chili cheese toast we had was SO good!), the cocktails blew me away. The army + navy and the aviation were my two favorites. Loved the sugary aftertaste of the former! Everyone on the UES (and everywhere else in NYC) check this place out!
