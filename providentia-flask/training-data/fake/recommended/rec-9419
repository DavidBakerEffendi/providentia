Review based on dinner! Great food and super cute location. I did not have to wait long for food and the service was on point. I absolutely love how there are great eateries everywhere in walking distance in this city!! The mac and cheese was perfectly done, perfectly cheesy, and that truffle oil made it perfectly upscale comfort food. The nice chicken meatball sandwich was delicious, the pesto added a great flavor to the toasty bread and amazing homemade meatballs. The best part about this restaurant is all of the creative and funny names of their dishes. It always makes me happy to see witticisms in play as I ponder my food selection. I will definitely have to return for brunch someday soon! Must try's- sweet peas Mac and cheese, nice chicken meat ball sandwich Yummilicious Factor = A
