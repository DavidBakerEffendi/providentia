One word: KickAssMeatballs. I don't eat in at this place. I just get takeout. And what do I take out, you might inquire? Well, I'll tell you. I order their giant delicious kick ass meatballs. And I take them home. And I eat them. It bothers my boyfriend, quite a bit, that I prefer Villa di Roma's meatballs over his (there is no sexual innuendo going on in this sentence, I promise you). But it's a sad fact that his balls just don't measure up - in fact, it's not even a contest. Villa di Roma knows how to do meatballs. Sorry, boyfriend. I've had some other things here, chicken parm for example and that was good too. But I'm in law school and thus, extremely poor, and so what I do is make my own spaghetti and sauce at home, and then go pick up a few meatballs from Villa di Roma. It's a pretty cheap meal that way but having special meatballs makes it feel more special. And I enjoy that special feeling that these meatballs give me. And that's why I like Villa di Roma.
