Di Fara is a slice of heaven. It is perfect without any toppings. Get whatever slice is ready - regular or square - if you don't want to wait - you can't go wrong! It is always fun to watch Dom do his magic while you wait - and sometimes you will have to since they can be busy. It is best to get a slice, since getting a pie can take some time although you can call ahead.
