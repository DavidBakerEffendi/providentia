Most Excellent!  I loved it.  I have been craving crab and this spot didn't let me down!! The Alaskan crab was fresh, slightly sweet,perfectly seasoned and just the right amount to share.  The crab roll is da bomb! It is buttery and couldn't be seasoned better.  The hot and spicy shrimp are super yummy as well and are fresh and sweet! This spot is run by two beautiful black women!  Please go out and support them.  I will definitely be back and will bring friends,  This is a must try and soon before everyone knows about it.
