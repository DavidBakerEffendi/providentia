Kudos to a place that can make you enjoy the idea of the (I'm assuming) urban myth that you die with up to 10 pounds of red meat in your colon. The BBQ is tasty. Brisket was delicious and not dry. Had to go with the three meat platter and that was the best of the three. The burn ends and pulled pork were tasty, too. Would like to see a slightly better vegetable selection. It would make it higher on my list of places to go when I'm not feeling red meat decadent. Back yard looks like it has some potential, but that will have to wait for warmer weather, so stay tuned.
