I love the octopus , very tasty and tender !..amazing !...the dips are very large and tasty !...fried calamari just perfect !...my guest had a chicken soulaki, it was cooked well and very flavory...my swordfish with spinach Â was okay...I was expecting much better ...but I will definitely go back !..it's a good environment and overall great food !
