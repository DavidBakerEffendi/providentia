Food is fantastic.  Staff is very attentive.  Prices are reasonable.I have tried a variety of vegetarian dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed.  Thier malai kofta is to die for.  Seriously.  I've already informed my family that, on my death bed, this is to be my last meal.  I want to site with the flavor of thier malai kofta in  my mouth.  No joke.  Now go try it.  Now.
