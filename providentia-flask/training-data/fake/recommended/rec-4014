A friend, who lives in South Brooklyn, is excited to come up to Greenpoint to eat at Paulie Gee's. He calls it "Jesus Pizza." As in, "As Awesome As Jesus Is" Pizza. What can I say, he grew up in the south and went to seminary. Paulie Gee's pizza is really good. The space is awesome. The wine (especially the gragnano, which is just perfect wine for pizza) is well selected and quite affordable. About the only problem with Paulie Gee's is that everyone else knows about it as well, and wants to get in at the same time you do. The pies aren't exactly traditional, which is in their favor. Try some of the more wacky pizzas, like the "Hellboy", which is basically a pepperoni pizza with spicy honey on it. It's more awesome than it even sounds. In a similar vein, the Cherry Jones, with gorgonzola, prosciutto, dried cherries, and orange blossom honey. It sounds kind of freakish at first, but it's a well-put together pie. Paulie Gee's is one of my favorite two pizza places in Brooklyn (Roberta's in Bushwick is the other, making similar crazy-sounding but awesome pies). And, even better, it's only blocks from where I live. You should go there immediately.
