Decor is pretty cool, especially the bar area. Gives you a very vintage feel. Having said that, here are the faults: - seats are tiny, cramped and spaced very close to each other - customer service is not very impressive - price is not proportional to tastiness (I've only tried breakfast) Not a fan but also wouldn't say avoid either.
