O.K. The restaurant is under new ownership and it is a definite GO TO again....so I retract my review of 2007, which was, sadly, rather scathing.  My friend Brenda and I dined here prior to attending the Symphony at the Bushnell in late November (I am very much remiss in my posting.)  Sadly, the place was rather empty.  But we were impeccably attended to by the owner.  We asked him for recommendations (the menu is rather expansive) and we took his lead and were not disappointed!  Everything was fresh, tasty and downright Yummy!  The Garlic Naan (also recommended by the owner) was particularly spectacular.  I sent my husband here about two weeks after we went and he was equally impressed.  This is a definite go to!  Add it to your list!
