3.5 Experience: I've been to Cuban Pete's quite a few times before my most recent visit and I must say, I'm not as pleased with it as I was after my past visits. I went to the restaurant with my boyfriend. We arrived a little before 10 Friday night ( I think it's the only restaurant on the strip that stays open super late). we didn't have reservations - HUGE MISTAKE. The "party of 2" wait was about 30 minutes. Â After giving the hostess my name, we packed on the stairs with a party of 16 because there was no where else to stand! It may seem like Service: Quick, to the point, but very friendly and polite. The manager was also a great help as well. He cut down our wait and made sure that we were seated within 20 minutes even though we had indoor seats and a 4-person table lol (4 seats) Food: Unfortunately this time, the food didn't do it for me. It seemed sort of over-cooked and over-salted. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the large crowds that were flooding the restaurant but I must say, It wasn't as good as I'd remembered it. My boyfriend and I both got chicken dishes. Mine came with a side of white rice, beans, and plantains and I must admit, the plantains were the best part Regardless of this rating, I'm going to go out on a limb and blame the food on how crowded the restaurant was. Every time in the past that I've gone to this restaurant I've gotten quality great tasting food! So I'm still recommending the restaurant to whoever is interested. I'll be back again to give Cuban Pete's another shot!
