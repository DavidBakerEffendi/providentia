I had a chance to check out this gem last night and had such a wonderful time! The food was definitely solid though needs slight readjustment. We started off with an amuse bouche of fennel and walnut slaw, which was quite nice though needed a little citrus. Then we shared the trout with cabbage tartlet, which was PERFECTLY cooked. For my entree, I had the hanger steak, which though was slightly over salted, was delish - especially the cauliflower au gratin! My friend had the sea bass, and thoroughly enjoyed it. My favorite part of the meal, however, was the dessert. The apple tarte tatin with creme fraiche, and the dark chocolate and cherry ganache were divine. Though the best thing about this place is definitely the atmosphere! Hidden behind a courtyard, it has such a wonderful air of mystery. Yet inside is anything but: warm and cozy with exposed brick and fantastic lighting. Plus the staff happened to be very good looking and helpful as well. ;) The one complaint I have really was our waitress... though she was very sweet and helpful, she was clearly new and had some trouble opening and pouring our bottle of wine. Still definitely was worth checking out - this may just become my regular spot!
