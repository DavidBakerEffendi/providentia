I'm sorry to give such a low review, but I just do not understand the hype for this place!! The only thing worth noting is the fact that it's kinda like In-and-Out and the food is created/made more "healthily." Â Honestly though, it's still burgers & fries you're chowing down, so how healthy can you really be?!?? The cajun fries are decent, but for just a little cheaper I can get better deals and varieties at Mickey D's or other fast food places.
