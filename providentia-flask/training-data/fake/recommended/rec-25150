Mighty Quinn's is proof that God is real and that he loves us. Order the brisket or the pulled pork. Brisket sandwich with pickled chilis and their bbq sauce = best decision you will make all week. Vinegar slaw is awesome. Burnt end baked beans probably cure cancer. Trust me, I'm a doctor. Go and be merry!
