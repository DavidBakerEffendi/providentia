I am not a Mexican but I love mexican food and love to cook. And thats why I went to this place. I recently moved to Hartford area, and its strange that there are not many latin stores here. Del Notre was the one that popped up first in google. So went there to get some queso blanco, choriso and other stuffs. The store is in an empty big place, looks like some factory loading or godown area off the main street. was difficult to find the place. It was dark in the evening though when I went. Its a average spaced store (not big). They have few stuffs, not a huge stock. But you can probably find the normal stuffs you need. I was not sure about the price because there were no price tags and I had to ask for the prices. And being not a spanish speaking person, I dont know if the prices told were correct. I however later found that the prices were ok. The guy (Armando was his name I think) told me about another store Viva Mexicano in Park Street. Its a good place, you can check it out. If you dont know and are trying to find something in particular, I would advice to call and know.
