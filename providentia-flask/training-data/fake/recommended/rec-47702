Fresh tomato pizza with sausage was fantastic. Salad was great, and the Amber Ale was very light, tasty, and strong.  I really can't give this pizza enough props- it is brick oven perfection. Oh- and it's not a bar. One side is, but that's separate. It's a casual restaurant.  Good for a semi-casual, date, a family, or beers and pizza with friends.  I got a salad, small pizza, and two beers. My tab was around $65 w/tip. But, I probably should have split that whole meal in half and would have felt satisfied and not so full.
