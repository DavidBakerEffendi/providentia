Was walking to another place when I walked by here and saw they had a chalkboard beer menu, which is always a good sign. Sat at the bar and the bartenders were both friends and I believe Irish (the noise made it difficult to tell). The beer selection was extensive of both local and national/international craft beers. The food and cocktail menus both looked exquisite. Little wonder this place is popular, which lends to it being a rather loud place. Only minus was the annoying chick-clique sitting next to me clucking while ordering the "Hurricane and Hotdogs" special (pretty brilliant, btw). Out of the way for me, but I plan on returning.
