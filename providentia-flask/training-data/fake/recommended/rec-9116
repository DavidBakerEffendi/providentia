I don't think my taste buds are advanced enough to understand what i ate. Although my selection was small - arugula salad, pork trotter, and pork belly buns. I did not leave the joint satisfied. I actually left confused. Thinking - what the heck is a trotter and why was it in my mouth? I really liked the salad, but needless to say - no one comes to a place named "salt & fat" for greens. like seriously? The pork belly buns was a lot of bun, for very little belly. I think the place itself is cute and its a nice addition to a neighborhood overall. no more are the days of drunk hs kids drinking on the corner! ;)
