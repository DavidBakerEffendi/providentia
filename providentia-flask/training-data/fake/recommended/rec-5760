After a long, cold day in Philly we found ourselves in the warm and vibrant Reading Terminal Market.  We had only come to browse, as we had planned to eat dinner at the Continental, but our hunger quickly caught up to us and we soon found ourselves drooling over Beck's southern delicacies. Now, I'm no expert on Southern food, far from it.  But to my credit, I have enjoyed Southern cuisine in New Orleans, so I think that buys me just a little bit of respect.   That said, I found Beck's surprisingly good. The wait staff was incredibly friendly, offering samples of just about anything we wanted and patiently waiting for us to decide on what we'd like.  We ended up going for the gator gumbo and shrimp crawfish pasta--both excellent!  Gator gumbo was rich, flavorful, and had a good amount of meat and rice.  Shrimp crawfish pasta was simple with a tasty sauce. The only knock is that it's a little pricey given the quantities.  But if you live around Philly and you're craving some good Southern food, this is a solid choice.
