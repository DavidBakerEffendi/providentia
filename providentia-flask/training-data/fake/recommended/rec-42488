Always great meals and great pizza from this restaurant. Haven't actually sat down and eaten anything here yet, though. It's all been take-out or delivery. I'm in love with the fact that my lazy butt can order my food online through their website and pick a time-frame for it to be delivered in. They're pretty darn good about arriving on time, and the food is always hot when it gets to the house. Their pizza with bacon and pepperoni = heaven! The Veal parm is delicious! The salads are great, especially the Ceaser (one of Â most flavorful I've had from an Italian chain) and Greek (they are VERY generous with the feta cheese, which is fantastic for me!). All around a great restaurant and I will continue to order from this place. :-)
