i stumbled upon this pizzeria as it's directly across from the Barnes Foundation. The pizza was so scrumptious, che delizioso! I dug in to a prosciutto secco slice with gorgonzola and had enough energy to sustain my epic museum visit and the rest of my evening errands. The crust was thick and flavorful. I loved that they were playing late 90's hip-hop and I would definitely recommend it.
