Nice clean atmosphere.  Friendly waitstaff. Simply delicious food.  Doesn't quite have that flair for me to give it a fifth star, but I would definitely come here again and certainly recommend it to others. Definitely try the thousand-layer bread.  We had the vatana bean paste for dipping and it was seriously good.  The two of us shared two main dishes: Burmese cold noodle and spicy eggplant.  Would recommend both.  And would also recommend sharing if you're a small party.  You get to try more stuff!
