I went here on a date after hearing really good things about it. The decor was beautiful and the food was excellent. I wish they had a longer imported beer section for my friend but they had the usual domestic beers so that was fine. I really liked the set up as well. It was a restaurant, lounge, and bar all in one; for the crowd just getting off work (although I can't imagine it being a spot for non-Penn professors since that's the only thing around there). Oh, and the servers was pretty attentive, unlike other foreign-foods spots. There was this one waiter that made sure we had our water without being too hype about it. They also spoke enough English to joke around with us. They even have really nice bathrooms. That's always a plus in my book.
