I had an amazing meal at Panino last week. Everything was fantastic. I highly recommend the E4 salad (that ginger dressing is amazing)! I can't remember the number of the panini I had but it was made with grilled chicken, avocado and a balsamic glaze. Amazing! I would recommend splitting the paninis as others have also recommended. This will help save room for the fresh crepes. Go with the apple and add vanilla gelato! I can't wait to go back to this gem.
