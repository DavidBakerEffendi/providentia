Went again; Very similar experience, with some additions: Once again, food was wonderful, spic and complex, went great with a Yuengling lager. And again, service was almost comically bad. Other things we tried: Rabbit with peanuts: a delicious appetizer of VERY spicy succulen--yet-crunchy (a la carnitas) rabbit in a very spicy sesame sauce with crunchy peanuts. Also: pork belly in soy broth. Less spicy, with a generous helping of pork fat, a cold meat appetizer that could have been an entree.
