My friends and I just left this place over a hour ago and seeing as how there was only ONE waiter working the service was ok. The decor was nice, but that brown shag carpet in the center of the restaurant rubbed me the wrong way... The Chicken and Waffles that so many of you other reviewers were raving about was just...BORING! The chicken tasted like a Knock Off version of KFC...The Waffle on the other hand was good and I made sure to ask for a Whole Waffle instead of the half they normally give. On the upside the Mac & Cheese is very good, the breadcrumbs on top are not really needed. Overall this restaurant is pretty overrated in my opinion!
