Loving the Johnny Mac decor in the restaurant being a tennis lover myself.  The steamed pork was the better of the two buns we had, the other being bbq.  Shanghai noodles we  could have gone without.  service was good.  We went on a saturday night and didn;t wait more than 20 minutes but it was just the two of us, we saw groups of 3 waiting for around an hour at 845-9.  The text message paging system was nice, all though we did just wait inside.  Not sure how we'd like sitting in communal style at a table, we were lucky enough to sit at the bar.
