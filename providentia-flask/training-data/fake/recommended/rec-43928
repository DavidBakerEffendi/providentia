A friend and I meet here for lunch regularly.  The lunch menu has a great selection for low prices....im a fan of the pork shops entree with the fried chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer.  They also make the best thai iced tea here!!  The atmosphere is very nice...i bet this place shines at night...
