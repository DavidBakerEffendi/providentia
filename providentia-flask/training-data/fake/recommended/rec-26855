We stopped in for a quick lunch. The menu had an extensive listing of empanadas, as well as other South American specialties.   We tried the recommended spicy chicken, Brasil, chorizo, ragaeton, and the Cuban. Prices were $3.00 to $3.75 each. All were really flavorful and tasty, easily the best empanadas I have had.  They came with a complimentary green sauce and a red sauce on the side, which added another layer if flavor. We also ordered a chimichurri sauce (+0.95). Two per person would be a light lunch, three just right and four a full lunch. Great little place, nice vibe, friendly servers, and tasty food. Recommended.
