It's 10 pm after a 30 minute wait for a table so it's an understatement when I say we were HUNGRY! Placed our orders and the drinks came promptly and that's where it all went downhill. Half an hour later still waiting for our food.. Appetizer and entrees came out together. Meanwhile other patrons that were seated after us are already working on their dessert. No apology from our waiter because who needs customer service, right? The only redeeming quality is the food but then again their customer service leaves much to be desired.
