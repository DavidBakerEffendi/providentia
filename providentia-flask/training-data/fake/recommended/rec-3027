I love this place. When my family came to visit me a few months ago, I came here for the first time to buy some fresh linguine and a new container of EVOO. I got a great deal on the olive oil; for a two-liter jug of Cento, I paid only $15. I don't think you can even get a container that large in the grocery store for that price. The pasta was some of the best I've had. Their directions on how to make the pasta were easy to follow (which was necessary for me, since I've never cooked fresh pasta before), and my family was really impressed. Too bad I'm an honest person, or I would have taken the credit for making the pasta myself! I will definitely be back here, especially since it's just a few block from my apartment!
