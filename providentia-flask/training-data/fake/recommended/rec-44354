My boyfriend and I took a wrong turn and ended up here - WOW were we surprised! Best wrong turn we ever took.  Everything was great from the atmosphere, staff, to the food.  Had the kale salad, which was amazing! Cheese plate, sausage pasta and sprouts.  We absolutely can't wait to get back to try the pizza, my mouth watered every time one passed by!
