I've been told that there are places out here that serve awesome pizza without the long wait. But I still had to visit Grimaldi's because it's Grimaldi's. The wait outside was about 45min. They let us cut to the front since we were a party of two and okay to sit at the bar. The wait after ordering was another 30min. We were so hungry, the two of us split a large (3-4 people) and killed it. Water never got refilled. The host made me laugh though because he reached for my bicep and asked if I work out. What's this I hear about artichoke pizza though?
