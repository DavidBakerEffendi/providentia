I do not know why I continue to go here, but my children get a kick out of the seating, bathrooms and decor.  We have been dining at Continental Midtown for several years, and every time it gets worse, and every time I leave and say "I am never coming here again."  The wait staff (like most Starr Restaurant wait staff) is ridiculous; from moronic and aloof to outright obnoxious and nasty.  My husband and I take our 4 children (not small children, so no big mess or noise) there, order a meal and drink for all, and the waiter still adds 20% gratuity.  He did not deserve 20%! Everyone was brought their food by some other waiter, and my meal was forgotten (veggie burger, noting complicated!). Our waiter finally came to check on us 15 minutes later, and when I told him my meal was not delivered yet, he curtly replied that he would check on it.  He brought it out 5 minutes later, no apology.  He never once refilled our coffee's, or the children's drinks.  I guess he knew he was getting 20% no matter what, so why give good service!? I wish I could of NOT given him a tip at all.  This time I swear it...I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!! Between the bad service, sub-par food, ripped upholstery on the booth seats and disgusting stained ceiling tiles, there are so many better places to go.  Stephen Starr, you must close this place, it is really bringing your entire name down.
