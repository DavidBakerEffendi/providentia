We have been planning for this restaurant for a while, but eventually made to it last weekend. I was along with my wife, my friend and his wife. We were warmly welcomed by the manager.  They have an open kitchen, so that the aroma reaches the nose before the food reaches the mouth :) We ordered Vegetable Pakoras and Samosas for appetizer. They were very well cooked, and come with 2 kinds of sauces, sweet and mint. For the main course we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Kadhai Paneer, Chicken Biryani, Garlic Naan Bread, and Mango Lassi. My wife loved Kadhai Paneer, and we all enjoyed the Chiken Biryani as the chicken was perfectly cooked and spices were well captured in every grain of rice. For the Dessert, we ordered Lahori Kheer.  They usually serve this cold, but you can ask them to heat it, if you like eating it warm. The service is impeccable which makes this place a perfect destination for any kind of celebration or a regular meal with friends and family. The food overall was outstanding. The total check came to about $15-$20 per head. The location is little challenging to reach, but worth the efforts!! I also get a chance to meet the owner and learned that he is in to the restaurant industry for 20+ years and also owns 3 additional restaurants in Philadelphia area, along with Mood Café at Cedar Park, a 5 star yelp rating.
