Came here about a year ago with friends for lunch. Wasn't that hungry so all I got was the onion rings which were really good. They had a decent selection of beer so that was a plus for me. My wife got a sardine sandwich (yuck!!!) which she liked a lot. She wanted me to try it but I am not a sardine guy....sorry. Overall I thought it was good but being that I am a picky eater I thought their menu could have been better.
