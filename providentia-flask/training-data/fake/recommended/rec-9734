So, a friend of mine was raving about this place and had me come and check it out. I was told that it is ranked the #2 best ramen spot in the city and with that comes an hour long wait in a long line outside of the restaurant for this supposedly awesome bowl of ramen. I wasn't too convinced as I had never been really into waiting for a long time even for food, especially when I am hungry. Once inside we were promptly seated and our order was taken. For appetizers we had the Japanese poached egg, which was my first, and wow -- was it amazing or what! I never imagined that an egg could possibly taste so incredibly delicious... I have got to find the recipe and method of making this and try myself. Then, we had a seaweed salad that was made of seaweed and filet-thin slices of cucumber. Then, the entree came. I ordered their classic "Paltan" ramen bowl ($9.75) with toppings (addtional $) of avocado and mushroom. The soup was thick, creamy and full and the noodles were perfectly cooked. I've never had ramen soup that was so thick and filling before - definitely was not a let down and lived up to the hype. There is a choice between pork and chicken and I chose the pork. Prices are very affordable and reasonable, despite this spot being rated and ranked #2! Take a look at their menu, peruse it and perhaps when you have an hour or two to spare, make a stop! ;)
