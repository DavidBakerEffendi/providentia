First, they have applejack drinks - which in my mind, and my boyfriends, sets them up at a high standard already.  The drinks are priced a little over average, but do have an interesting assortment on their cocktail list.  In addition they have a tasty grub menu featuring burgers, fries and some uber cheesy mac and cheese for a great price.  The place gets packed early, making seating a bit difficult.  However, even when packed the place has a terrific relaxed atmosphere.  The best time to come for a quiet drink is right after the daily commute.  I haven't tried brunch yet, but am looking forward to it!
