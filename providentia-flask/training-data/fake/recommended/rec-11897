The short story: brilliant food. Simple, clean, fresh, and damn near perfectly prepared. I look forward to eating my way through the rest of their menu. The whole story: went on a Monday night so it was quiet and there was no wait. Grilled octopus: meaty and tender all at once. It slowly melts in your mouth and it's no doubt due to some serious marinating and charcoal grilling skills. Tzatzki: zing! Refreshing but with a nice punch. Whole grilled branzino (Mediterranean sea bass): all you have to do is look at it (or any fish) and you know it's going to be amazing. Very tender, balanced seasoning that allows the essence of the fish to shine through rather than completely hiding it. Eat the cheeks...and the eye if you're so inclined. Just don't voraciously attack the poor fish like I did ;] Dandelion greens on the side are a nice, light accompaniment. Very mild in flavor and vaguely reminiscent of artichoke somehow.
