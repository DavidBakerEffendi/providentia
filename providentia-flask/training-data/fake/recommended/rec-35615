I've been here 3 times now.  I applaud them for changing their menu because quite honestly, is was incredible pretentious at first especially based on the neighborhood.  Now, I'm a huge fan of good dog.  The reason I say this is because, although Industry has an interesting and attempting menu, the food is really just average at best. I can't for the life if me understand this considering good dog is so good. Every time I've eaten here I've been underwhelmed and left with a "meh" feeling.  I will give them props on decor and they're drinks though.  And the clever door handle is one of the coolest I've seen. But unfortunately the food is just not up to par.  So for now, I'll just frequent for drinks only.
