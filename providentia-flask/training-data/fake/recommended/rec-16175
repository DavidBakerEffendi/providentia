pho real is the best sandwich ever. i've been to this spot twice in a week.  the best part is that they are open 24 hours.  it's cash only so make sure you take a trip to the atm before heading all the way over.  if you forget they always have an atm machine but then again you'd be paying a surcharge not to mention bank fees. so don't do it. yeah...you're welcome.  jk. anyways, there are so many different sandwiches, all of which are tasty. the biden is solid.  all the sandwiches are about $7-$8 which for bodega prices is usually a bit steep but it's alphabet city and it's a specialty sandwich so don't complain.  the pickles are horrendous but that's an easily forgivable offense.
