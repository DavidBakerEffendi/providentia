I really like diners so I was excited to try a new one. Well....I came here was greeted and seated kindly, pondered over the huge menu, and ordered an monte crisco. It was a disgusting sandwich! It was one of the worst things I've ever eaten. The lady I was with hated her food as well. Do not come here!
