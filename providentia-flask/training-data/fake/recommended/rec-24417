There are several seating options here: the main floor,  the second floor and through the kitchen into an enclosed area.  The latter section is entirely different than the first two, and I have suspicion that most of the raving comments regarding the ambiance and atmosphere at Alta is reserved for those areas.  While walking through the kitchen was neat,  our party of 4 was led into a brightly lit room and seated in a claustrophobic alcove with another party of 6. There was no music,  no hum of diners...nothing really to add to the environment. Dissapointment with the setting aside, I brushed it off in hopes of some amazing tapas.  We ordered several dishes, included the dates, goat balls,  paella,  hamburgers and gnocchi.  Overall the dishes were tasty, but do not come here if you are hungry. The portions were decent (ex: the goat balls and dates were appropriately dished out to share between 2) but some dishes were laughably small.  Yes, tapas means small tastes,  but at $18 a plate we were expecting more than 1 person being able to taste it.  These tapas were not for sharing.  45 minutes later (the food came out way too quickly) we checked out and ended up finished our dinner elsewhere. So in summary: make sure to be seated in the main area and come here for drinks and treat the tapas as a prelude before you move to your next dinner location.
