My wife and I love ramen and our native DC has GREAT ramen (Toki Underground, Sakuramen, and others). Compared to DC and NYC ramen, this place was just average. It was very crowded and the staff seemed overwhelmed by that. They were super nice but forgot to take our order for a long time and spilled soup on me. There weren't many ramen options and if you get grossed out by unusual food, there's really only one ramen to choose from.
