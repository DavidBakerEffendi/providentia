X-) Yum. If you go early or on a cold and rainy day, there might not be a line, but Penelope is a fantastic Brunch place I would wait for Rain or Shine. Indeed, if you don't want to wait, just go early.. before 9:30.. // But who wakes up that early on a weekend? ..If you are a snoozer, like me, 10:30 will probably do, and the wait should be between 30-40 min for a 3-4 party. But, if you really want to get seated ASAP, just go with one other person; that line zips along~ Ok, who wants to partner up this Sunday? :D
