One of the most memorable Birthday I ever spent in a restaurant.  Once you walked in, I felt like its a whole new era. Their this shelf with real apples, colorful paintings on the wall...its beautiful. The Foie Gras was amazing.  Porcini Flan with Alaska Live Dungeness Crab, Black Truffle Dashi, mushrooms, Whipped Fingerling Potatoes, Steak, Lobster...everything was so good!  They had this Bread Trolley going around whole time.  The Olive bread pistachio bread were very tasty.  We had 2 complimentary appetizers and a dessert. The Dessert are to die for.  They called it Strawberry Cloud.  It was made with Strawberry Sorbet and Pineapple Cappacio and Oxygen with Milk and White Chocolate (it's one of them Molecular Gastronomy). Its like Heaven!  Their services were excellent. And at last, we were given a small gift with Chef made Raisin Bread covered with sugar powder. Delicious! I am so happy my boyfriend took me there for my Big 30th Birthday :)
