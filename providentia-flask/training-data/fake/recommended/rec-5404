I really enjoyed my experience at public. Started off the evening in The Monday Room - the wine bar attached to the restaurant. The atmosphere in The Monday Room was totally my style, comfy leather chairs, dark wood and candlelight. The wine by the glass list is great here (much more than is offered in the restaurant). Then we headed off to the restaurant. Only really complaint was it was a bit tough to hear the conversation because it was a bit loud, but nothing too bad. We started with the scallops, which were excellent. Then, I had the duck breast as the main course. It was great! Perfect blend of asian flavors. We ended with the pumpkin cheesecake which was a great way to end and not too big. Service was great and perfectly timed. I look forward to coming back to Public!
