The decor is cool, the bathrooms are cool, the swinging chairs in the bar area are cool, but it feels like the Continental is trying too hard. The atmosphere didn't reflect to hoppin' interior decorations, which left a little more to be desired. So minus one star for that. The food was good. The tuna tartare, shrimp tacos, and seaweed salad were winners. I've never had bad seaweed salad, and theirs wasn't anything different but it was good. The Rad Na Thai Chicken was kind of a disappointment. It was just noodles and lettuce (kind of random!) with a tiny bit of chicken and sweet soy glaze. No spices or anything exciting. Minus a half star for that. But the dessert was fab-u-lous. S'mores--I will never forget you. Ever. Crumbly, cakey graham cracker cake with cool fudgey chocolate pudding and warm rich marshmallow on top. The various textures and temperatures of this dessert sent me to heaven. We had two other desserts that were also really good (they were all small desserts, but NOT as small as our waiter had said) but I don't remember which ones they were. That just shows how fab the S'more is. Go get yourself one now. I'm taking away another half star for the service. Our waiter was bro-y and not very personable. The Continental is unlike any restaurant, so I would recommend it to anyone. But be prepared for a few imperfections during your visit.
