Thought twice about writing a review because we wanted to keep this awesome place for ourselves.   Everything we had for lunch was great. Had the Pho Bo and my wife had the Singapore Laksa with spare ribs on sugar came skewers, steamed dumplings, and grilled eggplant for our appetizers.  The lunch special was $8 with an appetizer! And the beers $3 and cocktails $8 for happy hour!  Yeshi our server recommended the best drinks, try the Fig-a-tini. Overall great service, awesome drinks and food. We're planning on coming back for dinner...on the same day.
