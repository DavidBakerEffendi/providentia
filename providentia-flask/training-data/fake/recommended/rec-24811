Went here with NYE with a rather large party of 7 (large for the space) and at no fault to Rouge, we weren't seated until 25 minutes after our reservation. The party before us was enjoying their dinner and taking their time. They did offer us a cocktail while we waited, which was lovely. We ordered the 5 cheese platter which was lovely; great cheeses, although I have no idea what was what! Next was the seafood apps- calamari, escargot, and mussels. I'm not as adventurous with calamari, but I liked it. The mussels were delicious and bread was plentiful for dipping in the sauce, but I have to say the escargot with goat cheese was hands down the BEST escargot I've ever had. EVER. I told my boyfriend I wanted to come if only for wine and escargot. Main course was next! There were a good amount of NYE specials, but I opted for the salmon and kale. Kale was perfect, salmon was great. I also got to try one of the NYE specials of scallops and a truffle oil risotto. It. was. epic. I'm a huge fan of truffle oil and wish I could have had more. Over all, top notch experience and I look forward to going back, and perhaps some alfresco dining in the spring and summer!
