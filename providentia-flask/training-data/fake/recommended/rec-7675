We went out with a couple who had never been before and they were really impressed. What's not to like- one of the most beautiful places in New York- where can you get this view without it bring a tourist trap. We had the squid ink past (I always get this- always say I'll try something else next time but never do) the duck which was way too salty and husband and guest had pork chop which was incredible. Manager Jonathan was great and so was our waiter. All in all one of my favorite places.
