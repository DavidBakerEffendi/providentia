GO HERE. We had dinner here for our first wedding anniversary and it is easily one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate and the chef and our server were so warm and accommodating. Â Our server even gave us a heads-up that we might be ordering too much which is always appreciated. We got to sit right in front of the head chef and it was incredible to watch him prepare everything and talk to him about how he creates the dishes. The cocktails are outstanding and our server was exceptionally helpful with recommending drinks we would enjoy. Now onto the food! We had the hamachi, the octopus, the cauliflower toast, and the hen of the woods. Everything was delicious but the octopus and hen of the woods were incredible. I'm super picky about octopus and this was the best I've ever had-it had such a rich flavor it almost tasted like steak! The hen of the woods is a must if you like mushrooms. We finished with the cinnamon rolls which were out of this world. I am really into dessert and this is one of the best I've ever had. A couple of things that didn't bother me but may be worth noting for some people-it is a small space so the seating is tight. If you are someone who hates NY restaurants where you may have to squeeze a bit to sit down this could be a drawback. The music is not your typical restaurant soundtrack-the night we went it was mostly alt. rock and and rock from the 80s or 90s. We didn't find it intrusive but it wasn't what we were expecting.
