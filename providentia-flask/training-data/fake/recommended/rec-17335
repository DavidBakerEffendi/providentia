Let me start by saying that the reason I gave this place a shot was due to the fact that I had a restaurant.com gift certificate and this was one of the only local Mexican places available. Otherwise I usually stay away from places with mixed reviews such as this one. I ordered arroz con pollo and my girlfriend ordered carne asada. In addition we ordered guacamole. The guac was ok and nothing special. Maybe a bit to much lime.  The salsa was watered down and the chips were average at best. The main problem was with dinner. My arroz con pollo was nothing more than a plate of yellow rice that had probably sat there for hours with pieces of shredded chicken. They threw 3 plantains on top which were also old. The veggies were not fresh either and consisted of peppers, corn, and onion. I barely ate any of it as I was grossed out completely. My girlfriends dish was even worse.  The steak was horrible and uneatable. It looked like a piece of rubber and tasted bland. It was so tough it was almost impossible to chew. You know you have bad steak when its covered completely in onions and some watered down red sauce so you can't even recognize what your eating. The service was ok as the waitress was nice. Although she forgot to bring our drinks and never asked how my girlfriend wanted her steak cooked. I will never go back and hope that other yelpers will read my review and stay away as well.
