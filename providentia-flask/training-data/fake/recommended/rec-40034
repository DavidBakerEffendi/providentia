I've been here twice and have had great experiences on both occasions.  The food and drink are good and the waitstaff is friendly.  We went this past Saturday night with a group of 12 and they were able to quickly seat us and take care of us.  The atmosphere is cool and it's a good place to kick off a night of bar crawling around Old City.
