This is probably one of my favorite burger joints in NY. The burgers are cheap and mouth watering. The meat patty is damn amazing, the patty is soo juicy and tender. If you are a bacon lover, you HAVE TO GET THE BACON! The bacon is seriously what makes the burger taste even better. The bacon is cooked to perfection! Not only the bacon is amazing, the pickles are pretty damn good too. It's crisp and not too sour. It does get crazy busy, but be patient. It is definitely worth the wait! Btw, Royale definitely kicks The Corner Bistro's ass in the burger category.
