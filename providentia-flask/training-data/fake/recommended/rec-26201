I've been here twice. I consider it Fusion Thai. They have an outdoor area, but despite it being a warm day, they refused to sit us outside :( They have an open kitchen which is neat to watch. Let's talk food. I ordered soup, a noodle dish, and a fresh summer roll. All were lacking in taste and quality. What looked divine on the menu failed to meet my expectations when it hit the table. How can you screw up Thai food, people? Really? No thank you. Not again, Michelle!
