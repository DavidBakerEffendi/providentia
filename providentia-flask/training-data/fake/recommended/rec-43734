Last time I visited the Flatiron location, the menu was set, as I was with a big group. I decided to try out the Soho location and I picked dishes from the paper menu (which changes almost daily). _the food: 4 stars Grilled octopus skewers were delicious. The octopus was cooked perfectly; it wasn't too chewy or gummy and the seasoning was spot on. Cod with sweet potato puree was my favorite dish. The sweet potato puree was an interesting compliment to the delicate cod. My friend wanted to try the Patatas Bravas (crispy potatoes, "salsa brava" Â with roasted garlic all i oli). I was not a huge fan at all. The potatoes were cooked well, but it was basically fried potato chunks with a garlic sauce. _the ambiance: 4 stars 8pm on a Friday night and practically no wait. The tables in the back are cramped.. almost comfortably so, but manageable. The mood was lively and enjoyable. Definitely check it out if you're in the mood for/want to try tapas.
