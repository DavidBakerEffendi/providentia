As we left Dover on Saturday night and walked out into the rain, I believe the word "exceptional" was used over and over again to describe our experience. Awesome service (attentive but not cloying), fantastic food (the squid ink tagliatelle and the striped bass were winners), and unmatched value (two amuse bouches to start off and a cookie at the end) all made Dover a really amazing meal. I'll definitely be back, and next time I'll try the tasting menu.
