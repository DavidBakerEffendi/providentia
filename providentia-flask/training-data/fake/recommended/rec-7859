I will give this 2 stars only because the apple pumpkin spice soup is amazing. I went with a friend for lunch and it took 5 minutes for anyone to even give us water, half and hour for us to order and an hour for the food to come. They gave us a free sangria which my friend had as I was already nursing a hangover. Her food was cold when it came, not just cool but actually cold. Our lunch overall took 2 and a half hours and it was 54 dollars to boot! 54 dollars for soup, a hummus plate, French toast, home fries and a mimosa ? I will most certainly not be returning- we are in college and wanted a tasty meal but now we are both broke and upset it took so long to eat. Our waiter, tommy, was very apologetic which was very sweet and I know it wasn't his fault but come on!
