Can't say enough good things about this place. Been there at least a dozen times. It's a couple blocks from my house and its awesome for eveything, from a great dinner to a good night of drinking. It has the beer garden in the summer which is never as cramped as Frankford Hall, and they play the Phillys games on a projector. Seriously love this place.
