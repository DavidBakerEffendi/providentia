Had a horrible dining experience on a Tuesday night. My companion ordered the chicken thighs that, when cut, were ice cold inside -obviously cooked prior and partially warmed up.  We flagged the wait staff and made them aware of this.  The chicken came back out of the kitchen within minutes --micro waved with all the sauce removed and the chicken inedible.  My pork was also fairly greasy and flavorless.  Expectations were unfortunately set with great empanadas --but quickly dashed with the main courses. When we brough this to the attention of the wait staff, they did nothing up to and including reducing the bill.  Just stuck it to us.  We felt bad not leaving a tip, but need some response.  Service was also quite bad --probably because the wait staff was avoiding us once that they understood what was going on. I would suggest that Yelpers eat elsewhere near Yale or in New Haven
