I expect a lot from my pizza, especially in BK. The pizza was nothing special and the sauce tasted like tomato juice....no seasoning at all. I get that this place us famous and The antipasto was not worth it, the bread was too hard and the salami wasn't of high quality. The mozzarella was dry, but the olives were tasty. Also, their alcohol license is pending (has been for a while). I was lucky to not wait in line, but typically there are many tourists in line. NOT worth the wait. If you like bland sauce on top of your pizza, no bar, and waiting for mediocre pizza, then this is your place. Really, grab a slice from Fascati's down the street, or there are a few other pizza places very close to try as well.
