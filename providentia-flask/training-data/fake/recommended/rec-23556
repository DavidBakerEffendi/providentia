Went for lunch today with six other coworkers. Arrived at 12:00 and when we arrived only 4or five tables were seated. We waited 25 minutes before the waitress came back to table to take drink order and food order. 10 min later still no drinks. Drinks arrived at 37 min. Simple burger and fries food order arrived at the 1 hour mark. My thin patty double cheese burger ordered medium well was BARELY medium rare. After that, more waiting and waiting for the check until one of our party asked and dour waitress seemed irritated at us asking for check at the 1:35 min mark. Checks at 1:40 then wait wait until I had to go ask for status for the debit card receipt to sign at 1:50. Still only 5-6 tables seated so they were not really busy. Dour waitress seemed again irritated. I did tell the fellow at the cash register that it really isnt OK to make lunch into a two hour waiting thing for folks who are working. I did not even bother to mention super under cooked beef. $24 for a burger, fries and two smallish glasses of IPA. Sorry, but that's a fail in my book. Burlington has SO many superior options that I recommend skipping this subpar performance.
