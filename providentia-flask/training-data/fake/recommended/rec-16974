I have eaten here twice and here's why it's a 3 star: 1- the waitresses are generally nice and attentive, but the people behind the register Â were lazy and useless. 2- one of the men working there (not sure if he's a waiter or manager) didn't cater to my order instead he questioned my special request, very odd. he was also yelling at the waitresses - awkward 3- food is pretty good, but I wouldn't come back just for that 4- the space inside is pretty tight, slightly annoying
