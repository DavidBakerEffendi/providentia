Delicious deli food? Check. Delivery for when you're feeling lazy? Check. Baking done on premises, by Alan himself? Check. Free lunch on your birthday? Check. (C'mon, it's cute.) Open during convenient hours? ... The hours kind of suck for my schedule, but this is still a GREAT deli. The sandwiches and fixings are always fresh, there's a decent selection of coffees, Alan himself runs the place and is personable beyond belief, and it's conveniently located across from a movie theater for a quick stop on a Saturday afternoon. Hey Alan--I'll petition Yelp to add a special sixth star for you if you open the place on Sundays...
