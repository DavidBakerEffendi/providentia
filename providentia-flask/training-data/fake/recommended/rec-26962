Good meat! You get to cook it yourself, which is a little stressful because you have to remember to save it from burning and eat at the same time. But fun, anyway. I took my 13 year old nephew here and he had a good time, though we both got in trouble for playing with our chopsticks (I'm a drummer, give me a break). You can get a bottle of wine for $20, hooray for that! Plan on spending $40 a person with everything included, folks.
