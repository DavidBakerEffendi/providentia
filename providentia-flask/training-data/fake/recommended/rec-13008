Yes these blueberry pancakes with maple butter sauce are TOTALLY worth it to wait 30 minutes or so for. Don't let the humble appearance of the restaurant itself discourage you from what may be one of the best breakfasts you'l have for dinner! I also had it with the fried chicken, wasn't exactly the star of the show but it sure did make a pretty good sidekick. The ambiance during the night makes for a perfect kooky first date or just a cozy place to catch up with a Â good friend.
