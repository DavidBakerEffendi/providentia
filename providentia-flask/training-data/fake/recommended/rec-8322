Originally, I had written the review listed below. Shortly after posting, the owner of Aita reached out to me to address my review. The fact that she took the time to do so was greatly appreciated. It is obvious how much she cares about her restaurant and customer experience/satisfaction. She was very gracious in her response and did point out an inaccuracy in my review. I was inaccurate about the wine list not providing bottles for less than $40. They do, in fact, have many bottles listed in the $33-$38 price range. Also, the restaurant took to heart my criticism of the lack of vegetarian entree options and has since decided to have veg options on the specials menu. She also is working with the chef to better the pasta dish my boyfriend had. Like I wrote below, my dish was delicious, and 5 others in my party also loved their dishes. I plan on revisiting Aita soon. Their dedication to ensuring diners have an excellent experience makes Aita a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Overall, this place is decent, the atmosphere is really romantic and the decor beautiful. I recently went with a group of 8 people and most of us loved our food. I got the bucatini with bolognese sauce, which was pretty delicious. However, my boyfriend, who is a vegetarian, got the only vegetarian option on the menu and it was super disappointing and completely without flavor. Also, I felt like the bottles of wine were overpriced; I feel like it's good to provide a wide price range of bottles and definitely options that are less than $40. The worst offense, though, was our waitress. She was completely rude to us the entire evening, even going so far as to fight with my friend over which app she ordered. I've lived in this neighborhood for close to 10 years, and I'm not super impressed with a restaurant moving in that is exactly like so many others you can find in Manhattan.
