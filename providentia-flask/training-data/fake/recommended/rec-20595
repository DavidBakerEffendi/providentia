This is why Jersey is so great. Holsten's has that old time ice cream parlor feel with some of the best ice cream you will ever have. The onions rings are awesome and the patty melts are to die for. If you need a gift for an occation the chocolate candies are wonderful. I have had many days after a rotten day at work and stopped by for my milk chocolate caramels and I am back on top. Variety and freshness makes Holstens a Bloomfield staple.
