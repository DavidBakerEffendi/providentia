Stumbled on to this place and glad that we did !!  Fantastic service, great sangria for a good price and super delicious latin food.  We had the shrimp salad and churrasco.  The place is small and cozy with character.  We will be returning to this place most definitely.  Oh, and the flan was almost close to just unbelievable.
