The chicken! OMG!! From the empanadas to the mussels, everything was so great! We always go with the matador combo and there's never anything left (well, maybe some of the salchipapa...not my favorite). The flan is to die for and the red sangria is very refreshing and strong enough. Whenever you go make sure to try THE CHICKEN...seriously it's like god's gift to earth!!!
