Cantina Los Caballitos...I love you. Your margaritas are delicious and come in many assorted flavors. My goal is to try each one. Your nachos are in-fucking-credible. I have a lot of sour cream love and your sour cream is distinctly delicious and creamy to me. I am actually craving a return visit. I hear there are half-price margarita pitchers during happy hour...I may be there imminently.
