Am I a food snob or is this burger really not that good? I know there are tons of reviews saying this burger is AMAZING. Don't know how I feel about this burger. It is a typical no frills hamburger, nothing more, nothing less. But I would encourage everyone to try it once and see for themselves. On a side note the McSorley was a tasty beer. I don't drink alcohol but I had a sip of my friends and it was pretty good.
