What a fabulous find!  This intimate wine bar is a little off the beaten path on 52nd Street between 10th and 11th, but well worth seeking out.  The small plates are delicious, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the service is perfect, smooth, accommodating, and unintrusive.  There are two rooms, one with a bar and high tables and another with lounge sofa seating.
