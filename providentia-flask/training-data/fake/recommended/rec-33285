Best brunch in Brooklyn. Period. End of story. Go f***ing eat there. Gay seahorse for life!!! (Regulars will know what I'm talking about ) Favorites: Lamb hash Butternut squash soup Spanish pizza Bloody Mary Bacon wrapped, almond stuffed dates These guys know how to balance favors like goddamn bosses. EAT HERE! Give them your money and be thankful. P.S. Ignore the desserts and coffee. Okay but not great.
