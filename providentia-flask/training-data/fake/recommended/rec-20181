Came here for dinner a week ago.   Initially it feels like a great ambiance since it's pretty lively with a lot of hip patrons.  Unfortunately it is extremely dark, so dark in fact that neither my girlfriend nor myself could actually read the menu without holding the table candle up to it.   I thought it was just us but I noticed later people seated next to us had to do the same thing as well. I got the three course menu.  The soup wasn't very interesting or tasty.  I got the buttermilk fried chicken for the entree.  Normally I love fried chicken but in this case it wasn't delicious.  It wasn't bad just not really good either (most of the food was like that).  My girlfriend got a pasta special and was equally not excited.  The pecan dessert WAS delicious which bumps the rating up a bit.  Drinks are on the pricey side for the most part. Service was good but probably won't come back unless they change up the menu a lot.
