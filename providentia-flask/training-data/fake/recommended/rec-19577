we took my in-laws here, and the whole time my mother-in-law kept going on about how she much loved belgium and wanted to go there. i think she might just love fries and beer, which she only allows herself to eat if it qualifies as an cultural experience (i.e. in europe or at a european establishment). that said, the fries and mussels are flippin delicious. and service is much better than at the spot's predecessor, good old tavern on green. i do wish they had one of two more "in between" meal options. dinner is either really heavy food or salad.
