MAJOR FAIL!!!  Ordered a filet cooked medium plus on New Years Eve...served to me nothing short of RARE on first try. Sent it back, was returned nothing short of MEDIUM RARE.  Sent it back...ended the night early. Waiter did not seem concerned.  They did pay for a round of drinks and offered a free desert but at this point we couldn't wait to get out of there.
