Maybe I'm spoiled because I grew up eating noodles in the greatest Chinatown in the country, Chinatown, NYC.   But this place fails in comparison to anything I have ever tried.  This is the second noodle place that I have tried in the New Haven area and again I have left disappointed.  I figure in a relatively diverse town like New Haven there would be a decent noodle restaurant, wrong.  I will not be going back and will make the two hour trip to Chinatown for some good noodles.
