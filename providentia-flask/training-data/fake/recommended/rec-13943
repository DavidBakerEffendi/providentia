Why in god's name this place gets 4 stars is beyond me.  Yes, in theory, I do like the idea of a resturant on the ground floor of a brownstone.  Yes, in theory, I do like that there is a graden space in the back with the interior being made by the owner.  And yes, I do like prix fixe menu's.  In reality, the "brownstone" its on Union street, a major street with buses in Park Slope.  The tables that were "hand made" are just tacky looking.  The garden like thing is well... not a garden.  And alas, the food from the prix fixe for the most part was at most ok.  The tuna-ish fish I got was mezzo mezzo, flavorless, and a waste of money.  The meat-ish like thing that allegedly called steak was as chewy as an old shoe.  The wine we got suspiciously smelled like washed feet per one of the people we were with.  I just don't know.  2 stars because one of the fish dishes was good ( of course not mine), and the chiken stewish thing was good.  Once was definately more than enough.
