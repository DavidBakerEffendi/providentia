The best sub shop in NJ. I have eaten here off and on since high school (and I'm in my 40s now). Neither Lenny or John are here very much now- I believe it's their kids that run it now. The quality is still great, they always have very fresh topping and the topping/condiment ratio is always right on. Be aware they close early some days when they run out of bread (which they get fresh every morning). I dread getting there after the lunch rush and seeing the "out of bread" sign written on a paper plate taped to the door. I agree with other reviewers that you should try the tuna first. Tuna with everything is as good a sub as you could get anywhere. I have high school friends that have since moved to Florida and when the visit first stop is for a L & J tuna. 'nuff said.
