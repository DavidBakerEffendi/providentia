Best place in Burlington to grab a quick breakfast. Their bagels are amazing, particularly the Asiago Red Pepper and the Whole Wheat Everything. Best low-fat veggie cream cheese I've ever had in my life. The breakfast sandwiches with eggs are also really good but I love the veggie cream cheese so much that it's hard for me to not just stick to a standard bagel with cc. But they have amazing veggie sausage here.... the eggs/veggie sausage/cheese bagel sandwich is HUGE and delicious. I know this may sound a little redic, but one of my fav parts of being in Burlington for work is getting breakfast from here.
