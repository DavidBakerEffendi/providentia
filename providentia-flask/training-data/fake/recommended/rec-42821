I love the ambiance of the Spotted Pig, I have been here several times and it is super cozy and cute. It is great to go with a few friends but larger groups can be hard. We did not have a reservation and waited about an hour for our table. The wait was not bad as there is a large bar on the first floor and we hung out and had a few drinks. I had the halibut which was pan seared to perfection. I also tried some of my friends skirt steak and shoestring fries which were also great choices.
