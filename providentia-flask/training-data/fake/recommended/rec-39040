Needed a place to eat dinner quickly before we headed to Brooklyn for a show. Came in with a large group, no res, they accommodated us quickly. Check in deal for the free beer was pretty sweet. I got the steamed buns with pork belly since I wasn't too hungry, really enjoyed them. Sampled some sushi from a friend. Quick in and out dinner, hit the spot.
