Didn't give a 5th star only because I had a light lunch here, although I wish I had a full meal.  The menu is simple, with all the delicious middle eastern specialties you would expect.  Wanting only a light lunch I ordered mint tea and hummus with ground lamb.  The service was prompt and polite, bringing me another cup of tea before I finished.  The hummus was wonderful.  Homemade, creamy, and flavorful.  The ground lamb was perfectly seasoned, adding another layer of flavor to the dish.  Eaten with fresh warm pita, of course, the dish was just enough to satisfy my cravings.  I'll be stopping by again when I'm in Philly next... And with a bigger appetite!
