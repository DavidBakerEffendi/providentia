If you are into food and cooking, sit at the counter near the grill. (It is hot but the A/C is adequate). The whole grilled sea bass was the best I've had in years. The grilled octopus, scallops and tomato basil salad were excellent. Every dish that came by made us wish we had ordered it. At $68 for two people without drinks, it is not cheap but well worth it. I plan to return with my teenagers who are now fascinated with cooking. Otherwise it is not a place for kids.
