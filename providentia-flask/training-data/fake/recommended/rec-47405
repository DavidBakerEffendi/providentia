I will never say no to a trip to Corner Bistro.  I can't count the number of Saturday or Sundays when I've had to make the trek out just for a bite of that delicious burger, often arriving right as they opened at about noon.  We always sit at the bar and get the cheeseburger with McSorley's Ale, share a side of fries.  Hangover contained and the rest of my day gets brighter.  If you go at night or even for lunch, prepare for a wait, the place is not big and is often crowded.  Worth the wait.
