Coming from the west coast and having an abundance of bomb sushi places here, I was so happy to find Fat Salmon. I read the Yelp reviews before coming and made a reservation when I went on a Friday night. This place is pretty average priced in my opinion, but their miso soup was really cheap! My boyfriend loved it and he doesn't rave about just any sushi place. The decor is super modern and cute! A small place but that doesn't bother me because it makes it more intimate.
