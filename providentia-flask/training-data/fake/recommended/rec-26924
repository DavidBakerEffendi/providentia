Market Table belongs to that little family of restaurants that people rave about, wait to be seated at, and are all located in Greenwich Village. The family includes Little Owl, Joseph Leonard, Fedora, Jeffrey's and Pearl Oyster Bar. I do fear that I suffer from "over-hyped Village restaurant fatigue" and Market Table, alas, is the first full-blown outbreak of this curious disease. I went for brunch today with a friend. I had the poached eggs, he had the falafel, we shared a side of fries and drank tap water. The bill came to $55. That is WAY overpriced. My eggs were tiny little ping pong balls resting on a midget muffin, covered in a drizzle of hollandaise sauce. A sad little mixed salad filled out the plate. My friend's falafel was essentially a large patty of fried falafel with a mixed salad next to it as well. We ordered the fries because we were hungry, and our dishes were underwhelming. I just feel like I've seen it all before... the spaced out menu with small-case lettering, the bottle of tap water served in a big bottle with a rubber top, the "urban market" feel, the fries with parsley, the small portions. The quality of the food was fine. Nothing stood out, really. The only thing I was glad about was the lack of a wait. This might be due to the rainy weather. I would definitely not want to line up for the food that is served here.
