This place is pretty disgusting actually, so I am a bit surprised by the ratings. Sushi Gallery on the same street, but closer to the subway is cheaper and way better. At the Iron Chef, the quality of the fish used for sushi and sashimi is quite low, as is the quality of the rice. moreover, the noodles taste like cheap chinese food from the cart. I've given them a few tries, and each time the food was on the low side of mediocre.
