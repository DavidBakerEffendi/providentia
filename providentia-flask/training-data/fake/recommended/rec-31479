After the third visit I decided it's time to give it the ol' 5-star review. Superb neighborhood Italian joint. Simple, well-executed dishes like gnocci and beet salad are extremely satisfying. The mussels are on the small side but my companion loved the preparation. Family-owned atmosphere and consistently fine service. Not too many tables so it's best to make a reservation; although early dinner on a Sunday proved no problem for my party of 6. BYO makes it even more budget friendly. If you're lucky they will be pouring Limoncello on your way out!
