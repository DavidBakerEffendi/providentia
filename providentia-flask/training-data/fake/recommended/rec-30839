The food here is excellent and cheap.  I've been coming once a week for the last several months since I discovered it.  The vermicelli salad is a favorite, with the daikon radishes, carrots, cucumber, bean sprouts and grilled pork.  I must confess that I would come MORE often and recommend it more highly to my friends if the customer service wasn't for the most part, unwelcoming.  One day I came in and the server behind the bar was on her phone while I tried to get her attention to give my order.  When I did get her attention, it was without greeting and the most stone cold I hate you face.  Not what I expect when I picture South East Asian people, who I consider to be jewels among mankind for their warmth and hospitality.  And, I am, after all, a regular.  I realize you're dealing with thousands of the self-entitled, obtuse brats of NYU all day, which would incite homicidal tendencies in any human being, but try to be consistent despite their obvious flaws (if only, condescendingly).
