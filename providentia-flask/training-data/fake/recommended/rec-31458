My new favorite gluten free place!  Fabulous food, comfortable and casual atmosphere, friendly service.  This place is worth the trip!  It takes my husband and I about 35 minutes each way to get there but we don't mind.  We've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here.  The gluten free french toast is worth the trip alone, the chocolate chip belgian waffles - wow, the sausage with peppers and onions - whoa, chicken piccata - yummy!  Don't forget the chocolate milkshake or the root beer float!  The most extensive gluten free menu that we have ever seen (and we have been looking for over 15 years).  Is there anything that they can't make gluten free?  It is unbelievable!  I can't wait until we return again.  I wonder what we'll try next...  love Love LOVE the Cozy End!!!
