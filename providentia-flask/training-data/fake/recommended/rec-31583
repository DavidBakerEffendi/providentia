I like the overall feel of this place, but that can only go so far. The actual bar area is very small so it gets really packed. Don't even think about moving cuz you can't. I've been there to eat twice and both times I was disappointed. And it's expensive. And it's hard to find parking. And it's really loud. And you're gonna wait for a really long time. And...just go somewhere else.
