Whatever you do, DO NOT GO HERE. These people are racist who straight up tell you that if you don't speak English you are not welcome to order at their counter. in fact, there is a sign right there as you are getting ready to pay that they "want to take back their country" DISGUSTING. If you want to support racist idiots who are BIGOTS go for it. the cheese steak SUCKED by the way.limp and flavorless. GO TO PATS.
