Not worth the trouble. The Gigantes were bland and cold.  The Pastichio was a dried brick of tasteless blunder. It had definitely been made at some point previously, frozen, then microwaved. Nothing tasted fresh, much had been microwaved...volcanic hot on the edges and ice cold in the middle.  It is little more than a store front for frozen dinners.
