Over promise, under-deliver?  Many people may disagree with my review but it's ok, it's Yelp.  From what I heard this was "THE spot" to be.  Friends dragged me here and we waited in line for about 10 minutes before we could place the order.  I was expecting an orgasmic food experience! Ok, the food wasn't bad and I would even say it's very good.  Most halal cart places either overcook the lamb or put too much salt.   The way they serve their lamb is different from other people.  They seem to finely chop the meat so not only is it easier to eat, i think that actually brings out the flavor more too. Parking is hard to come by in that area unless you happen to be going there around 10pm or later.  They're situated on the corner right by an outdoor fountain and other seating areas.  (Ingenius location planning or just dumb luck?).  Good luck finding a seat though.  What's pretty awesome is everyone there seems to just be genuinely having a good time and you even see strangers striking up conversations!   Another awesome feature the Halal Guys have is on the side of the court, you have your self-serve "white sauce" and "hot sauce".  Go ahead, go nuts! Gave it 3 stars only because i didn't buy into the hype.  I'll come again if my friends would drive me again but i wouldn't go out of my way.  Then again, I don't really like halal food and if it's another halal guy, i'd give them a 1.  (And i really hate to give 1's).
