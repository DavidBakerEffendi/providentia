It gets an extra star for being in an area without too many similar options, but the food was a bit uninspiring and unexciting. Considering the price for a few small plates, it wasn't up to par. It's not that the food was bad, it's just that if I wanted a fun and unique menu, I would go into Brooklyn or the city and get it better for about the same price. Basically it's a good neighborhood place but not worth traveling for.
