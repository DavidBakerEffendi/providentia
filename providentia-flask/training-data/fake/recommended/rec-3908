Very cute little place near the subway. I met a friend here for brunch before PS1 and was pleasantly surprised. It has a very farmhouse sort of feel. The brunch menu is small, but everything sounded so good. I got the two eggs (scrambled) with hash browns and toast, and my friend got the roasted chicken sandwich. Both of us loved our meals. AAANNND they bring out a complimentary small bread plate, which included mini chocolate croissants and homemade strawberry black pepper preserves. YUM YUM. They sell jars of their homemade preserves and pickled stuff near the front door, so you can take some home with you. Super cute. Super tasty. Eat here.
