Had to try this place out based on all the rave reviews. It did not disappoint. Had the tempura fish taco, breakroom fries & both my friends had the classic burger. Everything was delicious! Will be back to try the rest of the menu. Only disappointing thing about the meal was the mint lemonade, it was a tad too sweet but then again we came for the food not the drinks! :)
