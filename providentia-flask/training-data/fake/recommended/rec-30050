I just want to note that in order for the overall valet process to work, the valet has to reserve at least some spots for valet only.  To make this deal more attractive, the valet would probably block off the closer spots so that it would make sense to valet to save you a walk...  If a valet just lets everyone park until the spots are full, THEN kick into action... it wouldn't work as a business model because the valet would not make enough tips...  Please don't hate the valets!
