Sooo! I love this place! I couldn't decide whether I wanted yakitori or an avocado salad and she have me both!! Half and half she said! And charged me for one! The food is excellent. Always fast and fresh. I'm eating and typing and I dot know witch one I'm doing faster!!! I own a local business here in Hartford, and one time they took like forever to deliver but it was due to a language barrier, and it was like the first 3 dys they were open... Now I was disappointed but they gave me my 40$ order half off, and that really made up for it! The yakitori is a little fattier than I would wish but the flavor is better than any chicken terriaki I've ever had else where. They load it with sea same seeds in witch I love, but if you have an allergy just have them sub them. The sushi is wonderful and I'm a happy yelper!
