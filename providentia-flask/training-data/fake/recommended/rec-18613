Came here for the first time and loved it. My friend and I split a special appetizer off the menu - arctic char tartar with homemade chips. Wow. For our main, I tried the pan roasted chicken. I was going back and forth between the chicken and the applejack braised pork shoulder but the waiter recommended the chicken and am gad I went with it! It was heavenly. Crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. My friend tried the atlantic swordfish and loved it as well. The ambiance is fantastic. Nice decor and very clean. Service was well-timed and friendly. I will definitely be back! You should go too.
