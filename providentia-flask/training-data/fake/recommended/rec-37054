Hey Yelpers, I checked this spot out for the first time and I must say it's LITTTT, I went on a Saturday night with some friends. The Review: *$5 cover (I went on a Saturday, idk if it's every night, but that's nothing). *FREE coat check, yes FREE. *Friendly staff, good bartenders and cool bouncer. *Layout: easy access large center isle bar, small designated dance floor in the back by Dj booth and seats all around the bar. *Drinks were around $6-$10 which is pretty cheap for a city spot and were strong. *Diverse crowd but slightly more Asians and yes fellas lots of ladies were there. *Dj played mostly top 40 and reggae but he also mixed in some old school hip hop. Had the crowd rocking. Summery: Random chick bought me a shot, got two numbers, wasted for a great price and danced most of the night. I'm def coming back, this place is LIVE. Yelp on!
