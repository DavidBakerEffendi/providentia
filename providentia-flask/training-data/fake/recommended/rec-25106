Here is the down low.  I have been to India and worked as a cook in an Indian restaurant.  I am trained in Indian cooking. To the untrained American eye and palate this place is exciting, and will probably due for a one time dive.  Upon subsequent visits you will likely find the food to taste like it has been microwaved.  The rice is dry!  The breads are probably the safest bet. You may or may not be seated properly upon arriving.  The restaurant is dirty, with an occasional bit of rice or crumbs left on the table or seat from the previous customer. I recommend the Shalimar of India instead.  If you have to eat here stick with a vegetarian dish and a nan.
