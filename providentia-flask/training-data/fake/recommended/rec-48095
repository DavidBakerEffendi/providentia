I really wanted to like Pascolo, but after going twice I don't think I'll ever go back. The third star is for sourcing local foods (otherwise I would give it two). The best thing they have going is the foccica bread and saratoga olive oil that they bring to each table. I've had the house salad, spaghetti, tagliatelle with mushroom sauce and nothing amazed me. It was just misssing anything that made it special and worth the price. I'm not that big on salt, but I had to salt my soup because it was too bland. I'm a sucker for homemade pasta, but wasn't impressed. The service was also a little slow (on a non-busy weeknight). The bartender was nice when I went and their wine selection seems decent, but otherwise I'd recommend going to the original farmhouse or Trattoria Delia if you want Italian. The food is decent but not worth the price, you can find better "just-OK" Italian.
