I have been a loyal customer of Juventinos and was utterly disappointed with my experience tonight.  When I arrived with a friend, the place was empty and the owner/manager told us we had to sit in the back of the restaurant, even after we asked to sit in the front near the window. The place was empty most of our meal and we couldnt understand why we had to sit in the way back.  Now my friend and I are two good  looking cats so we took it as some personal knock. Food could have been better and Juventino even gave us a complimentary dessert cause we think he felt bad.  I ate the choco mousse because I felt obligated as it came from Juventino himself.  Bad idea because Ive been feeling sick for the last two hours since we left.   Dont think I will be back as I felt betrayed being a loyal customer and getting tossed in the back. We even had appetizers and a bottle of wine but will not support an establishment as I was treated tonight.  Your loyal customers always come first.
