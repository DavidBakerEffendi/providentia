Respectable Thai for reasonable prices, in gigantic portions. I've been here twice and didn't have a wait either time, which to me is a mostly acceptable tradeoff to how much the staff here hurry you through your meal in their quest to turn tables. It does get pretty loud when the dining room is full. I get that hard-edged modern lines are part of their aesthetic, but does ear-piercing volume have to be as well? All it would take to temper the noise is investing in a few soft surfaces.
