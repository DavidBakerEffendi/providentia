THE buffet in town (the only?). My dad loved going here. Seriously.. Guy Fawkes Day? "If you were going to attempt to blow up Parliament, you would probably want a plethora of food options. Royal Buffet offers a great selection so that everyone can get what they want. Guy Fawkes would go." Easter? "Uh.. let's go to Royal Buffet."... Parent's anniversary? "What's that place by.. you know.. where Pathmark used to be?" "Royal Buffet?" "Yeah.. Yeah let's go there." Yell "Fudge" at the Cobras in North America Day? "You know.. Well I.. Well.. oh whatever. Let's just go to Royal Grill whatever." I still go there whenever I'm in town. I mean it isn't the best of the best.. but like the other 2 reviews have pointed out.. HUGE selection.. great price. I've never waited more than 5 minutes or so during peak periods.
