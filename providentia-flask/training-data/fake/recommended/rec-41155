I've always wanted to know what as across the street from Solas and finally got my chance today.  Came here for Mother's Day dinner tonight. We were a party of five so instead of sitting at the lively counter, we opted for the table as we had flowers and it was easier to share food that way...next time if I come back I'm def. looking for some counter space. As many other people mentioned, this place will def put a dent in your wallet if you're looking to be full or eating with a group.  We ordered 3 rice bowls (sea urchin, salmon roe & salmon, and chicken), a full grilled porgy fish, hot udon, an appetizer, 3 vegetables, and 6 meats (lamb, steak and duck).  The dishes were all generally well made and my favorites were definitely the sea urchin rice, brussel sprouts, sweet potato, duck and steak.  The full porgy fish was a good size for a table of 5 and more cost efficient in my opinion than getting multiple smaller fish dishes.  (My huge fear here would be that i get a $28-$33 full sized fish that was the size of a dollar pancake...but the porgy was the right size).  The flavors of the food weren't strong but everything was fresh in my opinion. Overall the vibe was pretty and the servers were very helpful, though I did feel slightly hustled into ordering more than what I originally planned on...but it was an overall good amount. Would come back for special occasions or a need for an interesting dining experience.
