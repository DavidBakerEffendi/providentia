While shopping in downtown Princeton with my daughter, we decided to have soup and a sandwich since the menu looked to have man;y choices.  We ordered the combo soup and 1/2 sandwich, the service was slow, the soup split pea soup had an unusual taste and the clam choice had very little clams in it.  We asked for tap water, our lunch came, no water, the server said he would be back with it, never did show up, we finally approach counter and asked for it.  Bad service, not the quality of food we expected and very overpriced!
