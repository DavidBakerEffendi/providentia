I'm from Vietnam and this place has the "pho" that tastes most similar to the authentic "pho." The broth is light, delicate, not sugar-sweetened, and is served with the right type and form of beef. Only the noodle is too thin in comparison with that in Vietnam, but oh well, that's the only type of noodle they can get here. People are friendly, too. I've eaten at other places, and they all taste Americanized in a weird way... But this place serves the best pho and it makes me feel so happy.
