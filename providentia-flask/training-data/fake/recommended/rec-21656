I was really in the mood for a nice cheesesteak so I went on Yelp to do my duty and look a place up. Maybe it's because I strayed from the typical experience of the reviewers of Italian Touch and didn't go there for dinner or pizza, but the cheesesteak and side of fries I got were definitely closer to "meh" than "yum". The fries were a bit overcooked and dry and lacking in salt. The cheesesteak itself was nothing to tell your friends about -- meat and veggie filling was fairly bland, the cheese used was bland (I'm not even sure what kind of cheese because it had melted into a thin saran wrap around my bread), and the bread tasted packaged. This place would do a good thing for itself in baking it's own bread or getting it from the local bakery. All in all it was a huge disappointment, especially because I spent the time driving from Edison to Iselin just to try this place. Next time I know to go to the local spot down the street which isn't exceptional but certainly better than this.
