If you were thinking of travelling to the Greek Isles but find yourself a little short of cash, travel instead to Boubouki at the Essex Street Market . One taste of their spinach pie  and you will be instantly transported  to the shores of the Agean. Don't forget one of the delicious desserts or you risk feeling like Hawkeye when he forgot the coleslaw from Adam's Ribs.
