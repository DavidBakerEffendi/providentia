The hours are sporadic and I hadn't made it here once in a few months since noticing it. I finally made it to lunch one day and now go at least twice a week. Lunch prices are incredibly cheap. The food is all absolutely delicious, not too heavy, and comes in perfect portions. From tomato mozzarella salad to homemade raviolis.. I could eat every single item on the menu. The head waiter is very sweet and the service is fantastic. My new favorite neighborhood restaurant!
