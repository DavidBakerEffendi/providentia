Being an Indian from India, my expectations for kathi rolls is rather high and I can't say this place met my expectations, but I will say it came close. It tasted a bit Americanized and lacked the true flavor of a kathi roll. Tried the chicken tikka kathi which was decent sized but one may not fill you up if you are looking to have a full meal. Would have given it 3 stars, but +1 for being open late making it a good after bar food option. ~$5-6 for a kathi roll, $11 for 2.
