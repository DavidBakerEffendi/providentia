Loved it! Went here on a whim after watching a late movie. They were very pleasant and accommodating for how late we came in. The menu had a lot of options and the waitress told us her favs and I tried some of her recommendations. It was all good, good food, good presentation, and good waitress. No complaints. The dessert was the real winner for me tho...omg hello can you say FRIED CHEESECAKE it was like an eggroll with cheesecake inside..like Â a sweet cheese pierogi on crack. It was SO good I would go back there just for that. I also tasted the chocolate mousse cake, it was decadent. I love chocolate and this was def rich, it was like a giant godiva truffle candy. Double MMM!
