This place looks so divey from the outside but it's awesome inside.  Yeah it's definitely a gritty, down to the nails kind of place,  but it's really a very good spot. The food is fantastic and you HAVE to try the mac and cheese.  The pulled pork is freaking bomb. And the food is so so cheap for olde city.
