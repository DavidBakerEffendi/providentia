I used to like this place, rated it as one of the best in my previous review.. but of late, my experience has been abysmal.. the food i ordered was dry and tasteless. The service was poor, the waiter had difficulty understanding me. I would not recommend this place any more. It is cheap, definitely. But not worth it.
