I have been there several times before without an issue. Todays meal (or attempt at one) was AWFUL.Besides the fact that I had to wait over 10 minutes for coffee that was Â ordered with my meal , my partners meal came on a FILTHY dirty and down right crusty plate! When a complaint to the owner was made he actually laughed it off. Nope, never going there again!
