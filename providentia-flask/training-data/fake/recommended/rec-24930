I've been a pretty regular attendee at Marco Polo's karaoke nights for almost two years or so now. It's a laid back environment, but it's not a total dive either. Karaoke is held in the bar/lounge area. The staff makes you feel like you're part of the family, and the Thursday $1 draft special can't be beat! Right now as of this review, Thurs, Fri, Sat & Sun are karaoke nights. They start somewhere around 9 or so. Sundays have been dubbed "Suck It Up Sunday" because it's a bit slower and it's a good chance to try new songs. As far as food goes, all of what I've tried off the bar menu has been tasty. The tuna melt is one of my favorites.
