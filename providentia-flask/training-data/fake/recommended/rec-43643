It took over an hours to get seated and although I would have moved right alone to a different place; the wait was definitely worth it. This place is absolutely delicious. Bacon and figs, embutido de jam√≥n, gambas, bread tomato spread. Yum! Good service; it gets pretty packed and the the place is not too big. Very good food!
