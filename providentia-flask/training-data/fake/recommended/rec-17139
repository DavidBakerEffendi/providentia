First time here, super busy place, great music playing. There were six of us so to avoid the 2 hour wait we sat outside which was fine. Food was amazing got the churrasco no rice with black beans and plantains. Yummy. Tried my Dad's pork which was good, garlic sauce made it. The only problem was the end, I think it took longer to get our bill and pay than it did to get the food and eat. Would definitely go again when I'm back in NJ visiting my brother.
