We went there based on reviews on Yelp & it was disappointing. The service was great & the staff was super friendly & nice ambiance. Based on reviews I expected old style Italian but it wasn't fresh or good. I had image of old family restaurant, which it seems to be but I don't think cooking that made name for place or quality is same. My first clue was cold bread- that is always a sign to me. Plus it wasn't like a fresh loaf, just store bought sliced bread. The salad had brown lettuce & even though doused in dressing you could tell. They took it off as we sent back but why would you serve that? The pasta sauce was not fresh, tasted like from a can & pasta was overcooked. I was so disappointed as Yelp usually leads me right, but after reading these reviews I am led to believe most have never eaten good Italian food? I don't need fancy just wanted good old style Italian but it wasn't good. Mostly I feel let down by Yelp & think next time I will search other sources or get suggestion from friend.
