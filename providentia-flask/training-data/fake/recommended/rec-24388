From the scent of fresh lillies and roses that permeated the air from the moment we entered, to the incredible candle light placement throughout the restaurant, to the background music, this must be one of the most romantic restaurants in NYC. :) Â (And yes, I've been to quite a lot.) My new, absolute favorite. The food is delicious - my go-to menu: braised lamb with rice cake, baked goat cheese, popcorn-crusted octopus. I've been here four times by now and had that braised lamb with rice cake every single time (ok, I'll admit - the first time we actually ordered it twice, we loved it so much!). That said, the desserts are somewhat disappointing, compared to the amazing quality of the appetizers/main courses. During my last visit, I discovered the flowers are delivered weekly from Ecuador. Wow. The smell is just spectacular. :)
