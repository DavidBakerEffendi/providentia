Food was good as expected since I've been to the other Pio Pio locations in NY. I was very disappointed with the manager. My friend's son bit his glass cup and broke it with his mouth. Thankfully, the kid is ok but the manager made it sound like it was our fault. He said these glasses are very dainty and flicking it would break it. He didn't even apologize or offer to comp any of our food. Next time give the kid a plastic cup!
