I think my hunger was the only reason why I found the cheesesteak so delicious.  All the locals told me to try Jim's but unfortunately it was already closed and I was only visiting for the day. The service was extremely fast but there was nothing spectacular about this cheesesteak at all.  The bun was soggy and all I could really taste was cheese whiz so that's probably why my mind thought it was good.  I've eaten frozen cheesesteaks that taste better plus when I make them I don't have to worry about rude service. I wish I would have went to Pat's across the street.
