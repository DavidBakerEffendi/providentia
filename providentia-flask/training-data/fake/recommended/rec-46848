Oh snap!  They pretty much have created breakfast Mecca here.  My two favorites are the apple cheddar omelette and the stuffed French toast.  The apple cheddar omelette has hints of cinnamon that pair nicely with the apple and the cheddar. The stuffed french toast is intense and I often share it with a friend.  I also appreciate the turkey bacon they use.  Nice thick pieces simmered to perfection.  Round it out with a solid cup a coffee and you have a winner.
