What a charming and wonderful inn!!  Every room is more beaurtiful than the next with cozy down comforters, gas fireplaces or gas stoves, immaculate bathrooms, big terry cloth robes and TV/WiFi.   The food is out-of-this world cuisine!!  Each meal is a gourmet delight with farm-to-table fresh ingredients.  I also loved the apple pancakes with warm maple syrup in the morning.   Most importantly, the owners, Richard and Marilee Spanjian are delightful hosts that make you feel so comfortable and welcomed in their beautiful inn.   Stay a night, I guarantee it will bring you a smile!  One of Vermont's true treasures!!!
