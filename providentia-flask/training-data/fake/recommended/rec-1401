It's fine. Bread was good. Steak was okay though difficult to eat due to the size of the pieces. Fried onions were fine. I can't understand the cheese whiz thing to save my life so I skipped that and did provolone. I am new to the area and will try them all until I find the one that makes me understand why this city famous for cheese steak.
