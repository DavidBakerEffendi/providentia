This place is great it's open 24 7 and has great music...... service is fast and with a smile. I am never disappointed when I come here the guacamole and plaintain chips are my favorite thing to order. Big portions and it comes out on a huge beautiful white dishes. I would eat here all the time and never get sick of it. No wonder it's open 24 7 we need them to be. Great when you have been out all night with your friends and suddenly your starving and there is nothing that great to eat when you get home. If your in the area try it you won't be disappointed. It's packed all the time but what did you expect?! Â You can take your food to go as well.
