They don't honor their own coupons.  I had never been here and decided to go based on a coupon in the Entertainment book.  The food was ok and I was impressed enough to possibly come back, but the service took a major nose dive when it came time to pay.  The waiter took a look at my coupon and said they don't take the discount (which was just effective 6 days earlier as of November 1, 2013) and he then proceeded to mumble about some notice on the door.  I didn't want to argue, so just paid and left.  I did look at the notice on the door on the way out and it mentioned something about presenting dining certificates at the time of order.  I'm sorry, but I shouldn't be required to read every bit of fine print on the front of the restaurant before I enter, nor do I think that a coupon is a "dining certificate", so I'm not sure what the waiter was mumbling about.  I think he had wanted me to give him the coupon before I ordered anything, but his lack of communication made it quite unclear as to what issue he had with the Entertainment book coupon.  Needless to say, they just wanted my money rather than my repeat business when it came time to pay.   I was seated directly across from the lunch buffet and the pakoras looked disgusting and there was a 45 minute gap in between people coming in to eat, so I felt sorry for the people who came in and had to eat food which had been sitting around for a while.  Music was nice, but decor left something to be desired.
