Delicious, authentic Japanese soul-food. This place (as least as far as I can tell with my...ahem...Western palate), is as authentic and as delicious as it gets. Every single item we've had here has been delicious- Â from the hot sobas, down to the plum-wine mimosa (ask for it!). The hot soba (with additions of course: mushrooms, shiso, etc) is absolutely crave-worthy. Often, you can watch one of the chefs roll and cut fresh soba noodles, which is fun to watch and adds to the atmosphere. We stop by whenever we're in the area! Highly recommended.
