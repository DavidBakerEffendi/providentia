Jimmy made us feel like family. Phenomenal food, outstanding service ,great value! My boyfriend called from Boston to make reservations for my birthday and he set us up with a window table, sent over a birthday drink and also sent over dessert with a candle in it we left there and hugged Jimmy goodbye because we felt so welcome . We can't wait to go back!!!!!!
