Excellent place to have a lively tasty dinner. Service was excellent and our server was super friendly and accommodating. Sangria was delicious and a great way to get your buzz on for a sat night. We had the platanos relleno, salmon roll and the mussels. Loved everything and was a lot of food for two hungry guys. This is the kind of restaurant that is sorely lacking in California. Would come back and bring friends next time I'm back in NYC. Thanks for a great meal and good times Yuca!
