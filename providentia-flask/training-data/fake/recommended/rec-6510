What a gem of a French cafe! My boyfriend and I wanted to find a place to brunch in our hood and we stumbled upon this cafe that serves brunch food, entree meals, sandwiches and crepes galore. First of all, I was amazed at the prices. For about $9-$11 for a brunch item, you can get a tastefully amazing meal. What a deal! The best part is that the food was not heavy at all. I wanted to try their cappucino/mochas but thought that it might be filling. Oh well, next time! I ordered the choose your three items in a crepe dish. My crepe was filled with goat cheese ($2 extra), ratatouille and chicken. It was light and delicious. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict with salmon. We ended our meal with a chocolate/banana crepe that we shared. I left the cafe feeling great, because not only did we spend $36 with tip and tax between the two of us, the food did not weigh us down and we felt like we were dining in a quaint French cafe in Paris. That's how cool this cafe is and it's a short 5 minute walk away from my apt.
