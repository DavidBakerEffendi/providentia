Went to dinner on saturday night and the food was great. We had to wait about 30min which we didnt mind, once we got a seat and ordered a few things we forgot everything about the wait. We loved everything from the greek salad to the greek beer. Everything was amazing. Will be back...... This is hands down one of the best Greek places in NYC.
