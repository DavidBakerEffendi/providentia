Loved the cozy atmosphere. Great food. Shrimp appetizer, delicious  Tofu appetizer cleverly made with lime, cilantro, mint and a little kick of chili. The Tom yum soup was very flavorful and  full of small shrimp loves.  Very friendly helpful owners and staff. Before you leave you already want to come back.  I will definitely be back. Great addition to the neighborhood.
