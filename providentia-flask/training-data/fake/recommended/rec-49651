We got here with high expectation following the 4.5 start rating but...what a disappointment. 1. Food:      a. Appetizers - we had the Grilled Lobster & Corn Salad and the Tempura Prawns, the first was not more than OK the Prawns were barley eatable. And they ran out of the Duck Liver Pate     b. Entree - we had the Seared Diver Scallop and Risotto the Scallops were really ok (not worth $38) the Risotto - after one bite me and my wife looked at each other with disappointment, was really bad. We had to send it back and asked for the Gnocchi instead it wasn't match better but at this point we understood that this place is not what we hoped for and gave up..     c. Dessert - we really wanted to try one and hoped it will leave us with a better taste, but for more than 15min the waiter didn't even bother to come and ask us what we want, we ask for the check and went to a different place for dissert on our way home (Libertador), that was the best culinary decision of the night. 2. Service - It seem to me that most personal in the restaurant was actually very nice and wanted the meal to be good experience unfortunately our waiter was rude, not attentive at all and forgot to give us the complimentary bread in the start of the meal (probably the best part of the meal after we asked for it from a different waiter) 3. The caipirinha they made was good Over all - below average food, for a place with above average prices. This meal worth maybe $80 and not $170 as we paid there.
