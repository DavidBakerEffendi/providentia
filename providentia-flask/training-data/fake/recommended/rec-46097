Nice spot in an area with the unlikely but apt name of Podunk. The Mill on the River is a low ceiling building with a somewhat dark interior.  While I suspect it is generally casual; on Sunday most folks were dressed nicely. The service is excellent. Our waitress was really on the ball. They start you out with a roll and garlic olive oil which is awesome (best all sample since it is powerful). They are very accommodating of special requests. The honey seared Salmon salad was top notch. Prices are fair, parking plentiful and the menu extensive. They need to work on their martinis a bit but  other than that this is one of those places to take your grandmother. She will love it.
