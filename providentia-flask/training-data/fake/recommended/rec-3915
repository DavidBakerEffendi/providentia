Went here with friends for a Sunday brunch.  Service (on the weekends, anyway) is harried but has good intentions. The host made a special effort to seat our party at tables next to one another, which was not only incredibly considerate but a monumental feat.   Loved the coffee-while-you-wait service.  I ordered a bacon omelette, which, according to the signage should have knocked my socks off, but I found it extremely overcooked.  Too bad-- having come from NJ, I usually judge a diner on its eggs.  However, my friends enjoyed their food, the home fries were decent, and the place gets points for being an institution and having a broad and interesting menu.  I'd like to come back here some time-- say, a Tuesday mid-morning-- and see how they do their eggs when they're not getting slammed.
