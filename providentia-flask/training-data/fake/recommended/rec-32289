My boyfriend and I just got out of our restaurant week lunch at Garces trading Company. Most of the food was pretty good, with the sharp Sardinian pecorino with lavender truffle honey being the shining dish out of everything we ordered. Funny, that's the plate that didn't involve any actual cooking. The major issue I take with this place is the strange feel to it: it's got an upscale chain restaurant vibe. Garces has many restaurants in this city and it seems like he uses a formula. I don't want my dining experience to be formulaic. If you want your run-of-the-mill center city pomp with mediocre food, head on in. If you're looking for bright, exciting, thought-provoking cuisine, look elsewhere.
