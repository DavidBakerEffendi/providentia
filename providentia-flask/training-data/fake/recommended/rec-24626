This dimly lit spot is meant for date night or an intimate evening chatting it up with a few friends. It's Park Slope's rendition of "grown and sexy" while still attracting a young and hip crowd as well as people who are a little more, um, seasoned! The menus are all stapled inside of full-length novels, which is a fantastic way to keep yourself occupied while awaiting the arrival of a friend (or date), or if you're waiting for one of the fantastic barkeeps to mix you up on of Wolf and Deer's sippable speciality cocktails. My favorite is the Barnyard Dance. It could be the tequila, but it's probably the paprika salt around the rim that keeps me coming back for this spicy delight. Ideal evening: pick three cheeses paired with a baguette and order your choice of cocktail, beer, or wine, then let the good vibes flow. Make it a point to pack light when Wolf and Deer is your destination. There's not a lot of space in this cozy gem so keep the baggage to a minimum!
