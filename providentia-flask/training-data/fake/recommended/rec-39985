Went for breakfast the place wasn't too crowded. I was greeted with good customer service. Â The prices are average and recession proof.The customers must frequent a lot due to being known on a first name basis I got the egg, cheese and sausage on a onion bagel very tasty along with the worlds strongest coffee lol. I am wide awake now what a great way to start my morning.
