After dinner here on a Saturday night I am in love with the place. I had friends visiting from out of town and we wanted to go to Lombardi's across the street for pizza. We didn't have reservations and the wait was really long so after wandering around we found Emporio and I could not have been happier! They brought us a little thing of olives in addition to bread and olive oil, which was really nice and delicious. For wine we had the Flavio Rodollo (I think it was $40). The wine list was extensive and there was a good range of prices as well as wines from different regions of Italy. The cocktail list also looked good, and I would definitely come back for drinks. I think I read something about happy hour specials?      To start we had the Fritto Misto (calamari) and it was delicious and not fishy or rubbery. They served it in a paper cone and I'm not sure why since it made it harder to share.     For my meal I ordered the pizza with zucchini and goat cheese. The server said it was for one, but I definitely could have eaten half and been satisfied. One of my friends had the pizza with guanciale and mushrooms, which I also tried. It was good but way too rich to eat the whole thing. The zucchini pizza had a really thin crust and was a little salty (I love tons of salt though, so for me it was perfect). I ended up eating the whole thing.     Our waiter (I don't know his name) was really nice and ran after us on the street when my one friend forgot his credit card. Really nice and great Italian food. I will definitely be back.
