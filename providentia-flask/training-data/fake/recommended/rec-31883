This place was deliciousness all around. The prices were a bit steep for me, but since the food was so great I don't really care..I can spoil myself once in a while :3 My friend and I sat at the bar and our cocktails (me, an old fashioned, Kristen...something spicy, I have no clue)  were stiff but that's the point, right? The rye bread we got as a starter was so soft and fluffy, probably just out of the oven, delicious! We didn't order any entrees, but we did get 3 different appetizers; a salad with bacon, walnuts, cabbage (??) and blue cheese dressing which I ate but wasn't too crazy about ate anyways, crab cakes  adorned with pinapple and tomatoes and this incredible green sauce (OMG too good) and the best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten in my life. It was to die for. Our bartender was super sweet and attentive the entire time and split our checks with no hassle at all. Decor has an old timey feel to it, which I loved.
