got the truffle burger and it did not disappoint. truffle out of my ears delicious. my friend got the umami and it was similarly appreciated, though she could have done without the onions. I understand the reasoning for a smaller bun - both optically and gastronomically, less bread is more desirable, but this makes for a mess from the first bite onward. we also ordered some summery cocktails which we downed quickly - were they v good or were we just v thirsty remains to be seen. The scene was a surprising one - quiet and half empty for a hyped up place. Hoping Umami sticks around bc the looks of it on this visit was a bit discouraging.
