I swear balthazar had been on my restaurant to go list for months!! I read reviews beforehand and everything, I was disappointed by the lack of flavor. I was wondering if they seasoned their food. I had the steak frites and my friend had the duck confit.. I enjoyed the maitre de butter on the steak although I felt it was too red and most of the French fries were overcooked and I couldn't/Didn't want to eat them. I tasted the duck and wished I had gotten that tho he didn't eat much of the food besides the duck. It had a nice crunch on the outside. If I go back I would get that. My meal was about $38 and with those french fries I really can't understand why. They were a lot but still. My Drink was average as well. Overall it was an average experience, I just find it insane that I've had TASTIER steak and fries at restaurants like Friday's and red lobster then an 'expensive' French restaurant.
