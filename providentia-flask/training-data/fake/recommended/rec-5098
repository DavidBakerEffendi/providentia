Happy to have this place in the hood. Bring the fried dough. Bring the melted Edam cheese. Bring the schnitzel, wurst. Bring the German pilsners. Bring the free live jazz. The menu is not healthy, but it is good. The best thing on their menu is the original fried burger. It's a grilled burger wrapped in fresh dough and then deep fried.
