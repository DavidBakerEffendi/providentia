Outstanding experience here last night.  The service was impeccable, the drinks were great, the food was inventive and delicious, and the scene was polished without being pretentious. A few highlights of the evening:  for drinks, the Rhubarb Gin Mule was amazing, though a touch sweet.  The brisket "tots" appetizer was delicious -- highly recommend ordering this to share.  For entrees, had the Casarecci with suckling pig ragu, which was simply out of this world.  One of the best pasta dishes I have had, with rich and interesting flavors.   Nice to see a new restaurant get off to such a good start.  I will definitely be coming back here again.
