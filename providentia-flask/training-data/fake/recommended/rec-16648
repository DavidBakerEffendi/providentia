I went to Graffiti last night since its been recommended by multiple friends of mine who are ardent foodies in NYC. I had high expectations but I have to admit Â the food blew even them away! Chef Jehangir Mehta's menu is small but each dish on the menu is uniquely crafted (yes, I said crafted). The flavors are absolutely amazing, subtle yet perfectly balanced. The creations are unusual but each of them works. There were many points during the meal where my friend Clyde and I just looked at each other in absolute amazement at the mouthful of some new dish we had just tasted. I highly recommend this place to any serious foodie. It is typical NYC, a little cramped and so popular that you will be rubbing shoulders with other gourmets. Absolutely worth it. A real jewel. Can't wait for Jehangir to open up his new location at the end of September 2010.
