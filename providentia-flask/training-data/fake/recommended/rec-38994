My father and I were walking back to our car when we noticed this little restaurant. After looking at the menu, we decided to try it. We were so glad we did! The decor is modern, beautiful, and open. We were seated right next to a window, which was very pleasing. It was overall a really good atmosphere. We shared the Buttered Lettuce; while my dad got the Shortribs for his meal and I got the chicken. We both loved the Buttered Lettuce. My dad was incredibly impressed with his decision, and, after tasting a small piece, so was I. The sauce was fantastic and the dish was perfectly seasoned. The meat was also melt-in-your-mouth good. My chicken was really good as well. It was cooked well and the sauce was fantastic. Additionally, the spinach that came with it was delicious. We both cleaned our plates. As I was finishing up my chicken, my father and I noticed that there was a group of men at the table over that were tasting various dishes. We decided that they must be tasting a new menu. After expressing our envy to the waitress, the owner allowed us to taste a couple of the new dishes! All of the staff were extremely friendly. My waitress was very good-- friendly and attentive. The men at the table besides us (owners and managers?) were really awesome and talked to my dad for a while. My dad even said that his latte was great! Overall, great food and awesome staff. I would definitely recommend it. The food on their new summer menu is going to be killer. We will go back, no doubt.
