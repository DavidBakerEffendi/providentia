My experience at the Fat Buddha left an oozing, pus-filled blemish on my birthday night. I had gone to No Malice Palace (5/5 stars...go THERE) last year for my birthday and wanted a similar experience this year, hence why I chose Fat Buddha. I met with a (manager?), Carlos, a few days before the event. Carlos seemed very trustworthy, promised me a table and said my birthday experience at the bar would be 'exceptional'. Fast forward to Saturday night, I walk into the bar and I was exceptionally surprised that there was no reserved table for my party! Carlos had lied right to me face...it was very busy in the bar and another table would have taken up a lot of extra space. It seems like they couldn't accommodate a table, even if they wanted to. I was baffled that Carlos lied directly to my face. Seemed like a shady move and was done to trick my party into giving the bar business. Further, the bartender wouldn't serve me or my boyfriend drinks because the bouncer  had told her we were too 'intoxicated'. If that were true, I don't think I would be able to recall this horrific experience in such excruciating detail. Last complaint, the bar was way too crowded, couldn't even dance. I know they get a lot of traffic on weekends, but it was uncomfortable even to stand. In conclusion, the Fat Buddha lied to me for whatever reason, which is unfortunate for them because not only did my 50 person party leave the bar after 15 minutes, but I'm  pleased to blemish their Yelp page with this review.
