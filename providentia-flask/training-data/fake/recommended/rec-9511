Came here with a friend for dinner. Both of us ordered pasta and panna cotta for dessert; would say the food was pretty solid and the atmosphere was very intimiate and cozy--pretty cute place for dinner. Portions are a bit on the small side (I'm a big eater though) and the place is pretty fine as opposed to casual. Also there is no bread basket, which I was pretty disappointed about given that it's an Italian restaurant; however, the waiter will give you bread upon request and will "refill" it for you though again, only upon request. Kinda hefty prices in my opinion and pretty decent service.
