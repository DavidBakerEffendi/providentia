Quick brunch uptown at Greek restaurant Kefi the other weekend. Nothing too crazy, but spacious interior with a lot of breathing room and bright furnishings with a lot of standard brunch options and a few Greek-ier choices like souvlaki and pasta dishes. Portions were big, which was nice for a price point of around $9. The Egg pita wrap came with crispy kettle chips and a sizeable Greek salad, both crisp and fresh, well dressed. The wrap was soft and tender and had a good weight to it, fluffy eggs, fried potatoes and peppers and sausage. The egg outweighed the other ingredients slightly. Quiet place, average prices for a good brunch. I would like to try dinner out and some of the grilled octopus dishes, which would probably be more denotative of the restaurant. Pleasant place overall.
