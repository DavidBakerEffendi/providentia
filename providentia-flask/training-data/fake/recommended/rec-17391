I'm a regular here, absolutely love this place. The service is great, although on the weekends when it's busy they can slack a little, but the servers are always nice. The food is amazing! For apps I order the mushroom one ( I won't attempt to spell the name) and for dinner my fianc√© orders the shrimp Tibs (it's very spicy) and I get the veg sampler platter. It's BYOB, romantic, and all in all a great place. The food has a lot of spices in it so drink lots of water because the next day ull be super thirsty!
