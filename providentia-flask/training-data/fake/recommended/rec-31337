Delicious!  Gotta get Japanese eggplant , the pork belly.  I had the basil chicken and shared lobster pad thai. Honestly everything was awesome. I had a bite of everything our friends ordered 7 of us and I was not disappointed. I could have eaten all their dishes. Ambience is great too. Love the lights.
