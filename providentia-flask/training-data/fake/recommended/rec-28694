I hadn't been to Miriam for months - my last experience was great and the second visit didn't disappoint! My friend and I split the burkekas - flaky and creamy - and the babaganoush - nice and smokey with a swirl of good olive oil - while waiting for our other friend.  We hung out at the bar with a fantastic bartender, whose name I wish I had caught.  He pointed out that mezes were half off and beer and wine was two for one during happy hour from 5-8 p.  When I declined a drink and opted to stick to water, he kindly whipped up a raspberry lemonade from scratch, complete with muddled raspberries and a splash of seltzer.  It was tangy and such a nice, personal touch that you don't often see. We split the mesclun greens with poached pear, spicy calamari, zucchini cakes (delicious yogurt sauce!), hummus, and kadaif wrapped shrimp (crunchy and delicious).  My friend got the chicken shawarma, which was a ridiculously generous portion.   Zucchini cakes, babaganoush and shrimp - and the awesome bartender! - were the highlight of the meal.
