Im on fire!  Ive been way too much good food recently.  I didnt even eat here and im giving it 4 stars.  Want to know why?  My badass roommate was eating downtown with some friends at this place and brought me home some noodle duck soup.  As someone who eats a lot of soup in chinatown I put this as one of the top there is.  The duck was great and the soup was made to perfection. Now I want to go back and eat at the actual restaurant.  For 3 soups and a 2 rounds of drinks the bill was less than 30 bucks.   Count me in for coming back.  I want some dumplings with my next soup!
