If you are going to put "Burger" in your name, you better knock the socks off of your patrons with your burgers. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The burger was over salted, overcooked, and very underwhelming. Very small for a $16 burger. I've had a ton of better burgers in nyc, and all over the country. The bun is nothing special either. Other than that, some of the apps were fine, better than the burger at least. Salad and tacos were tastier. The atmosphere and design of the place are cool, which is probably the only redeeming factor, except I still won't return. Another trendy place attempting to make a burger. Sigh.
