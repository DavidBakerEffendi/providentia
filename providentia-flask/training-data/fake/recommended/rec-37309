Found this place by accident and now it's one of my favorite places to go.  Their paninis were great and so were their crepes.  I have had sweet and savory crepes and so far every time has been great.  Service was good and the people are wonderful.  Their espresso is also really good.  The latte was perfect.  Just all around great place!
