Very delicious, and very fresh cuisine.  They happen to have a garden outside (yes, right off 29th street) where I assume they get their amazing vegetables. The most notable dish was the garden salad, which tasted like nothing you could possibly get at a midtown deli (hey, I love those too but this was just plain special).  The lettuce, baby carrots, cucumbers, etc. all tasted like they had just been picked off the vine that day, it was really something. The views were fantastic, picture windows right on the East River, so you're bathed in natural light and can stare off into Queens and Brooklyn.  Unlike other spots along that strip off the river, it was very easy to get to.  Tell the cab driver to go east on 29th Street until it ends and you'll dead end right into Riverpark.
