My husband had the Nutella French toast and I had the smoked salmon benefit. Both were absolutely delicious! I loved the dill sauce that was over my Benedict. It tasted so light but full of flavour. My husband's dish was Nutella good, went so well with coffee. The restaurant is small and quaint. Had to wait 45 mins for a table but was well worth it. Can't wait to go back.
