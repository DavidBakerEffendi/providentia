There has been a recent trend of West coast eateries giving the East coast a try. Unami Burger is another such popular LA restaurant making its mark on the East Coast. The uber Â trendy in the West Village. The open airy restaurant is spacious and comfortable but with that comes the loudness of the space. During peak times it is practically impossible to have a conversation without screaming across the table. Luckily the table are fairly intimate so the strain on the vocal chords are recoverable or just sit upstairs. The service on the night I went my friend from NJ who heard about it and wanted to try it. Must be that good if the word has spread that far and wide. The service on the night we went was really good. The hostess was friendly and our cute waiter was always on top of everything without barging too much. (Not that the table minded) We had that the Fried Pickles and Truffle fries to start and shared the Royale and Truffle Especiale with Peach Margarita. The thin fries where crispy and quite good with a hint of the truffle. The batter on the pickles was crunchy and nice coating. The burgers were quite delicious. It was moist and tender. The bun slightly warm. I loved the egg on the Especiale and the short rib was equally as good. It wasn't too salty and strangely no mustard is available but the hot sauce is very good. Umami Burger no doubt puts out excellent burgers that are better than some of the mainstay popular joints in the city. My only reservation is the price point. Is it worth the price? I guess only you can determine that. For me, it isn't quite affordable on a weekly basis but once in awhile and that's ashame.
