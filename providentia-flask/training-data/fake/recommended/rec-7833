The variety of seafood options is impressive. The crab and avocado martini was the perfect accompaniment to salty tortilla chips. I then moved on to the pistachio crusted trout, which was good, but not amazing. The mashed sweet potatoes were oddly stringy. One of my dinner companions is not a seafood fan, but there were meat options (steak and chicken) and pasta (spinach ravioli). Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable. The dining room is loud, however. At times, it was hard to hear my dinner companions.
