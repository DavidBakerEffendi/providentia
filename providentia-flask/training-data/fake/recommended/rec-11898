The Smith is one of my favorite spots in the city. It's a cool, fun atmosphere and is great for dinner or brunch. Quality food, drinks and service. Perfect for a date or a night out with a group of friends. All of the desserts are delicious ice cream sundaes and there is a photo booth downstairs. What more can you ask for in a restaurant? Oh I know.. a peep hole playing dirty black & white films to keep you entertained as you wait in line for the bathroom.
