Every K-Town has an establishment that is the notorious cornerstone of the district's nightlife. L.A. has Gaam, San Jose has VIP, and N.Y. has Woorijip. It's the odd sheep among the three because it's not really a bar, but it's the perfect place to start or end your night. The choice is up to you. If you come early at night, you'll be greeted with a myriad of to-go plate options. Tteokbokki, kimbap, bibimbap, mandoo, kimchi fried rice, chicken, etc. If it's Korean, famous, and can fit in a small container, they have it. Prices are relatively cheap quality is great too. Not as great as what you would get at a legit sit-down restaurant, but good enough for a quick snack. The drinks selection is outstanding and also very cheap. Soju and beer by the bottles, flavored Milkis to mix your soju with, and plenty of other juice options. Make sure to ask for cups and shot glasses at the counter. They won't give them to you unless you hassle them about it. Staff is rude, but you're not tipping them nor interacting with them too much, so who cares? They won't hesitate to furiously throw on the table whatever you ask of them. Chopsticks, cups, sauce, etc. Woorijip skips the hassle of going through a menu, waiting for your food, and overpaying. It's simple, delicious, and cheap. With K-Town shutting down at 4 a.m., you don't have much time to waste.
