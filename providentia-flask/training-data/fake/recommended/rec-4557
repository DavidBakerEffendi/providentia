I have been here twice now, and both times the food was MAGICAL!  The menu is unique and fun, and the ambiance and decor are really chic and nice.  There is a lot of metal work around and a few feature walls made with actual dishes, which are not tacky at all...so that is nice.   The portion sizes are pretttty small, and this place is quite pricey, but the food is so very good.  I'm not in love with the service.  We were seated quickly both times I went, but the wait to order and for the food to come was pretty ridiculous.  I was actually very annoyed, as it was my birthday and they knew it, but still made no effort to provide excellent service, which is why I am giving them 4 stars.  Otherwise, this place is great.
