Pretty amazing food and service (family-owned, and they're super nice). I made the trek here in pouring rain a couple weeks back, coming all the way from Manhattan on the subway because a bunch of old friends were meeting up here for dinner. And well, the food and the company (maybe mainly the company) made the long journey to The Islands worthwhile. Jerk chicken was so good - the meat was very tender and everything was so flavorful. Portions were also huge; you can definitely split one plate between at least two people. Overall, delicious! If I'm in the area again I'm going to have to return to sample some of the other dishes.
