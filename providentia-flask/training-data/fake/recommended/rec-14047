Best brunch in NYC, hands down!  Pancakes are absurdly good, biscuits are fantastic and all of their egg dishes are great.  The wait can be daunting, but I would suggest putting your name down and wandering around the Lower East Side for 45 minutes or so (Economy Candy on Rivington is a fun stop) and then going back to check where you are on the list.   Get ready for a food-induced coma!
