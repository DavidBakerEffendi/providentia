This place is GREAT!  Hidden right off 60th street near the bridge, they have a solid beer selection and stand out amongst a neighborhood full of 2nd avenue pubs.  The bar is very very narrow but opens up to a cute garden in the back.  I have been by a few times and haven't had a chance to try the food but it looks good. Staff is always friendly and I enjoy my time at this place....nice that they are just around the corner from my place :-) cheers!
