i've been frequenting this restaurant - on average - twice monthly for a little over a year now and it has only been getting better. i've never had one single thing that i didn't like and, as a result, i get more adventurous every time i order. if you like good barbeque you won't be disappointed... Just don't expect the garden-variety, overly-sauced stuff (not that there's anything wrong with that). if there is such a thing as gourmet barbeque that's what i would call it. now that i think about it, there was one dish i didn't like: the turkey sandwich. however, it was not because it wasn't tasty, it was, but the bacon was too thick. i'm not even sure that is a complaint. i mean, as a bacon lover, it's hard to believe the bacon got the best of me. to be honest, i'm still confused about it.
