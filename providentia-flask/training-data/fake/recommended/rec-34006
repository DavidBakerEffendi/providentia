All I can say is great food & great service.  One of the co-owners waiting on us and he made the evening fun and personable.  The food was adventurous and delicious.  I ordered the snapper with yucca fries.  Crazy good!  Deep fried whole fish with a onion/lemon salsa and fish row on the head.  Fries were hardy and perfectly cooked.  The steak was buttery and melt in your mouth.  Atmosphere was happy, even if I personally like the music a little bit lower.  My water glass was never empty... service was excellent.  Overall, for an ecclectic neighborhood place, it doesn't get much better.
