Just breezing through Philly after being head butted by a horse and decided to stop into this place on the corner for a quick bite.  They serve brunch all weekend and it was absolutely scrumptious.   I settled with their house made country pate because I'm a big fan of liver (stop gagging, it's delectable).  I was expecting some pate and slices of bread not the smorgasbord that they came out with.  Not only was the liver filled with other textures but it came with a homemade honey mustard, dried fruit, brie and the bread was a type of fruit bread.  It was absolutely amazing with every single bite.  The only complaint that I had was that I wish there was more slices of bread!  With all of the wonderful things they included on the board to eat there wasn't enough bread to go around and eat with everything.
