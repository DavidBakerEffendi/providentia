I'm on a 3 star roll today. I have been to my share of good restaurants and this is simply just ok for me.  After a 20-25 min wait on a Sunday night around 8pm, we were seated at the bar.  My friend's brother took us here and told us that he liked the fish and duck here. I ordered the seafood hotpot as I don't eat pork and when you hear hot pot you are thinking a little pot/large bowl of something (ie nabeyaki udon style).  What came out was a tiny little bowl (think small Asian rice bowls) of seafood soup in a coconut lime broth.  The soup itself was really good but for $19, I could really do better. Tried the duck and it was tender but nothing special.  The brussel sprouts were way too greasy. Enjoyed my seafood hot soup but honestly I was still hungry after.  Just another overpriced NYC joint.
