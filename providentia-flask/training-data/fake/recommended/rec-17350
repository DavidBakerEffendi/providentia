After reading the RAVE reviews, I was VERY excited to try out the Pancake house. On my first time there, I was shocked at how dated the restaurant was. But I tried not to judge a book by its cover. For our meals, both my boyfriend and I had the eggs Benedict. He liked his - but he's not as picky as I am. I was not impressed. It did come with a side of pancakes which I can see where all the rave is from. Boyfriend also LOVED the fresh squeezed orange juice The second time, I vowed to only get pancakes. I got them, they did the trick. Boyfriend decided he was going to get the eggs Benedict again. One came with the most perfect egg. The other, the egg was COMPLETELY hard boiled. SOLID yolk. The waitress swapped out once we told her, but it was a good while delay until she came back to see how our food was. Not so impressed. Again. For me, if I'm CRAVING pancakes, I would go back. BUT JUST FOR THAT. Service wasn't overly impressive and like I said, we are 0 for 2 with the eggs Benedict.
