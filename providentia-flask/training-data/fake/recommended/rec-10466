awesome awesome awesome.  Have been waiting for this place to open up and the wait was totally worth it. My two fave things about Bijan's:  It's just a short walk from my place (I am very lazy) and Larry the bartender is amazing. He makes great cocktails and is hilarious. Like everyone else....I'm hoping it doesn't get TOO busy in here bc I already called dibs on my seat at the bar.  So gimme some room. Food is coming and other events like open mic nights.  Definitely worth checking out.
