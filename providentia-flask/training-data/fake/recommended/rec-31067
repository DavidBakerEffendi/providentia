This place is my guilty pleasure, and I try to steal a few minutes to grab a bowl of Pho whenever I'm taking my daughter to ballet down the street at the Rock School. I'm usually here at 5 or 6pm on a Tuesday or Thursday, so it's not usually busy. That may explain why I get my piping hot order barely before I've had time to pull out my iPad to catch up on the news (or write Yelp reviews). Seriously, the food once came so quickly that it clocked in at 20 seconds. Even when it's busier, it's pretty quick. I can't compare the food here to other Vietnamese restaurants since I've only ever been to Vietnam restaurant in Chinatown, and Pho Ha is not that. It's not trying to be. Pho Ha isn't a fine dining establishment with attentive wait staff and linen tablecloths. It's not an "impress your date/in-laws/boss to show them you are cultured and a culinary adventurer" kind of place. It's a grungy, local and loud joint with neon green plastic chopsticks, peeling metal chairs, crappy napkins, and an order-by-number menu. I only ever get one of two meals: the small chicken pho with white meat (served with a side plate of fresh basil leaves, bean sprouts, lime and sliced hots), or the sliced grilled pork with spring roll vermicelli bowl. Both dishes are more than enough for a meal, and at less than $7 apiece they are a steal. I've made authentic chicken pho from scratch before (boiled the chicken carcass, used the rock sugar, and all), and not only did it cost more than $7 per person to buy all the ingredients but also it took an entire afternoon to cook it. Why on earth should I make my own when I can pick up Pho Ha's? Or better yet, eat it there.
