I tried their meatballs during one of the events they were catering at. At first I was skeptical to have plain meatballs as a meal. But one bite and you will know this is not your run of the mill and will have you coming back for more. Unfortunately I haven't been to the actual shop, but their menu offers a wide selection of meatball options, in a roll, served by themselves, as a sampler, etc... And the prices are reasonable for a niche ny eatery.
