i'm truly perplexed by all the kvetching about the wait. you live in a large metropolitan city, people, and you're trying to get "brunch" in a neighborhood that has about 3 restaurants total that could fit the bill. have you ever tried to get food before noon anywhere in new york city? if you wanna brunch it up on the weekend, there is GOING TO BE A WAIT. deal with it or stay home. onto Morning Glory...i love this place! in terms of the prices, i think they're right on par for the quality of the food, amount etc. this isn't an everyday place, maybe not even every week, but it's a fantastic treat. the smoked fish platter, breakfast pizza, biscuits (obvi) and any combo of egg/breakfast meat/grits have all served me well on numerous occasions. oh, and as for the sabrina's-morning glory competition i've heard talk of? my opinion is: there is none. i've been disappointed many times by the taste at sabrina's...not once at morning glory. that is all.
