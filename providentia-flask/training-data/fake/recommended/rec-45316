Just enjoyed a delicious meal at Kefi.  Friendly staff, reasonable prices, a little on the noisy side, but let's call that an upbeat atmosphere. If you read the reviews below, you'll see a pattern.  The food here is simply delicious. My favorites were the sampler of dips with rustic bread and the ravioli with brown butter and sage (the pasta was more like a crepe, thin, slightly crisp, not doughy at all).  People are all having a really nice time at Kefi, and it looks like an ideal spot for large groups (which can be a challenge in Manhattan).  I see some notes about the service below, but we were there on a busy night and the service was attentive.  Definitely going back.  Advice: be aware that there is a big room downstairs, so if you're making a reservation and you're a small group, request upstairs. Downstairs is lovely, but I preferred the high ceiling and ambiance of the upstairs restaurant/bar.
