I have been here a handful of times and have always had a good experience. The chips and salsa are amazing. This place has the best margaritas in the city- cheap too! Great place to sit and drink margaritas and people watch. The food is inconsistent. Their tacos tend to be flavorless but the last time we were there I tried chicken enchiladas and they were awesome! The entrees tend to be overpriced too. I've always found the service to be great. Overall, it's a nice place to hang out, get some drinks and just chill.
