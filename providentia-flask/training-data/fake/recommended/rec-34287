I feel cheated. Yelpers, you've let me down. My dad and I ordered the combo (half chicken, half ribs) and the beef combo (half chicken, half beef). The ribs were delicious but the chicken was, ehh good but not the best and the beef.... Tougher than a piece of old chewing gum you find under your car seat. There are much better places you can go in the ironbound!
