Either Sara is thinking of somewhere else, or she hasn't realized for over two years now that Fairmount is located on 20th Street and NOT 19th. Regardless, pizza is good, sandwiches I have tried are good, and the fries are awesome. Wraps suck. Delivery and pickup are fast, and I've never had any problems. I would recommend giving it a try.
