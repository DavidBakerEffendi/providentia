This place is a new gem on South Street. It is southern cuisine at its finest, and the service is impeccable. I've had the liberty of having both brunch and lunch at this spot. The shrimp and grits were heavenly. Everyone should eat this meal before they die. If you are lactose intolerant, get extra spicy cheese sauce and slather it on because it's worth it. Just do it. For lunch, I ordered the turkey sandwich by recommendation, and I have no regrets. The sourdough bun was lightly buttered, toasted, and sprinkled with sea salt. The bun was layered with orange marmalade and avocado spread, then topped with red onion, lettuce and grilled turkey. YUM! My co-worker said the fish tacos were also amazing. Rex 1516 has so many great menu choices, from the moroccan burrito to the fried tomato and goat cheese sandwich. Let's be honest, the whole prohibition era motif has been done before and again, but I don't care. The ambiance makes me feel swanky, or that might have been the delicious mint julep the bartender concocted. Either way, this place is a must.
