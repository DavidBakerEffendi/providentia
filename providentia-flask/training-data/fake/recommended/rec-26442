Ladurée came out on top in a three way race with Bouchon and La Maison du Chocolat for Macarons.  From presentation to the taste, it won in all categories.  The meringue was crisp and light, just enough chew - great texture.  There were so many choices and the hubby and I wanted to try them all!  The price tag on these little bites put a halt on that really quickly.  A box of 8 came in at $30 and with at least 30 different flavors, it's a real hit in the pocket.   Although the cookies were well made, I was not impressed with the more traditional flavors (chocolate and raspberry), although the pistachio was good and I'm not a huge fan of pistachio.  For these, I'd still prefer the less costly Macarons from Financier.  The hubby called them more economical, best bang for the buck.   Ladurée truly shines at the less common flavors.  The cassis and especially the rose one was absolutely delicious.  When we can afford to, maybe we'll do this again and check out the Soho location. We also had the chausson aux pommes, which was nice and flaky and the gigantic palmier, which was the best ever!
