If you are looking for authentic Thai food, you have found the right place. I have only tried a few dishes but my guess is most of the dish are authentic, probably not all. The portion is authentic too. Small! like the ones you would find in noodle stalls in Bangkok. Of course it's NYC price. Dry crab noodle, Yen Ta Foe noodle soup is great. Just try it, you'll like it. (Don't forget to add the extra condiments) Great Thai iced tea.
