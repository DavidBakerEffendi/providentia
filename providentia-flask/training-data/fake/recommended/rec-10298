Mediocre at BEST!! Had a reservation.  Restaurant basically empty at 7pm and escorted to the worst table in the house next to the kitchen.  Opted to sit at the bar instead.  Ordered 3 appetiizers.  Grilled Octopus ( of which there were TWO pieces, the rest were potatoes for $8.00, sauteed cauliflower which was served ice cold :( and sauteed mushrooms (not worth it).  I ordered linguine with clams based on another review I read here.  DO NOT ORDER THIS. It is not your typical linguine with clams.  The clams are cockles, not littlenecks and are the size of a dime. The dish was also overloaded with sopressato, or pepperoni, overpowering what liitle clam flavor that was in this dish. very disappointing.  My husband ordered fettucine carbonara.   It was quoted as being over the top NOIT!!!! The entire experience was disappointing  and I can honestly say we came into Hartford to try something new and we will not return.  Would rather stay in the suburbs where at least we know the quality of food is of a much higher quality than what we got.  We tried this restaurant based on the review of Spencer Caldwell in Hartford Magazine.   Thanks but no thanks!!
