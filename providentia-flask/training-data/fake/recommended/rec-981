Gave it another try as I popped in to play Quizzo. The server we had was super friendly despite how busy it was and gave recommendations and let us know well in advance what items they had available given it was around 9 pm. I had the grilled veggies sandwich, which was delicious! A nice balance of sweet and savory! I added some sriracha to it and yummmmm. I gave it another try and I think the people here make it worth coming back.
