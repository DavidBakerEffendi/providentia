I was really excited to try Bistango out - it's right in my neighborhood and I'd walked past it dozens of times thinking that I should give it a shot. That, combined with the fact that it had good reviews on Yelp, set me up for a bit of a disappointment. Our group of 4 was seated pretty soon after we got there, but from them on, service was pretty horrible. It felt like we had gotten assigned two servers who didn't communicate - both of them asked for our orders before we had even gotten menus and kept pestering us for drink orders even though we asked for a few minutes. My friend ordered two appetizers as her entr√©e, and they ended up bringing them both out to her well before our meals were ready. The food itself was pretty good, but not anything to rave about. I had the rigatoni with ragu and the rest of the table had the spaghetti vongole, which they really enjoyed. I thought it would have been a nice touch for them to offer us dessert on the house after the bad service, but no luck. While I really appreciate that Bistango is a restaurant that's friendly to gluten allergies, I would suggest going elsewhere if you're a happy-gluten-eater. I got the impression that they were happy being a niche restaurant but weren't going to go above and beyond to satisfy all customers with the experience.
