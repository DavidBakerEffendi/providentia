Came with gf after work around 6pm (made a reservation and was seated at a table). Waiter was sweet, gave us some recommendations. Started with salad and then grilled fish set which was yumz. Tried the cheesecake, really good. The crepe dessert was just OK. We lingered after dessert and didn't feel rushed. Will come back soon.
