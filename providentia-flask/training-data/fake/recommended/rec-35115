I ordered pancakes and what I got was Bisquick mix pancakes, fake maple syrup and no butter. My friend ordered the bacon egg and cheese croissant that you could get for 3.50 at a corner bodega. We really wanted to like it because of all the great reviews but we left hungry and disappointed. The quality and quantity didn't match the price. For 2 bucks less we could have gotten a really nice brunch at coca cola Â cafe down the road.
