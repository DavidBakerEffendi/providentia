De-friggin-liscious food!  The rib appetizer is a must-have and it's the only thing my girlfriend ordered for dinner.  I had the paella and it was super yummy, choc full of mussels, shrimp, calamari, sausage, etc.  There are so many mouth-watering menu items, you wish you could try it all.   Seating was a little cramped, but I survived.  The sangria is great. We had the red, but I tried the white and it was good too.  It's the kind with apple and orange chunks and grapes too.  I love to eat the spiked fruit.  =)  A must-check-out restaurant!  I plan to go again and again.  Thanks for reading.
