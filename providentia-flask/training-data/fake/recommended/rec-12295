Alright, the food here was fairly enjoyable...the fries weren't THAT special. Fresh and tasty, yes...but you can also get those at McD's. (If comparing these fries to McD's alone insults you, I don't give a flying fuck). What makes this place special comes down to what sauces you order. We ordered three. The Sambal-Olek, Irish curry, and Mango Chutney. Sambal Olek....sounds pretty exotic, right? Sounds like something you definitely have to try while here at Pommes, right? It turned out to be the biggest upset in our foodie tour that we all experienced. It's a $1.50 for 3 ounes of Sriracha. Wow...living in Rowland Heights and the Greater LA area all these years..and paying a buck and a half for something we have gallons of at home seems like a rip. What the hell. The Irish Curry...you can actually go to Nijiya market, buy a box of curry cubes for 2 bucks and make this sauce. There's more Irish in this sauce than there is BMW at the Mercedes factory. Alright, the mango chutney which our friend Barry chose was the best. It was the only enjoyable sauce out of three. It was actually quite tasty. If we ever come here again, we'll know what to avoid, and I'll be back here with a better review. The Belgian decor was a nice touch, though.
