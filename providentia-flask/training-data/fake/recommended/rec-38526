No frills atmosphere, but clean. Somewhat busy, but staff managed it well on a Sunday afternoon. Food came out in under 10 minutes. I had the Chicken Cheesesteak with vegan cheese/mayo on a seeded white roll. The bread was fantastic: chewy bite, fresh tasting. I really enjoyed the faux chicken as well, diced with all sides seared. The vegan cheese lacked flavor and the vegan mayo wasn't too tasty either. I think the sauce could be improved: I found myself dreaming of a salty, cheezy nooch-based sauce that a huge ladle full would do wonders for this sandwich. Overall a decent place in Philly that I'd likely visit again.
