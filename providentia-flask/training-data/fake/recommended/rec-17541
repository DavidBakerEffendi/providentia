The kind of place you hope makes it... Attentive and friendly, if not slow, service... A wonderful spot stuck on an unsuspecting block with food that exceeds expectations.  The empanadas are tasty though not the familiar South American empanadas you might be expecting.  All the entrees are great.  Perfectly sized portions... Worth venturing off Bloomfield Avenue if you're heading to Montclair...
