Been a guest of Shore Cycle Club several times on their rides and a member for a few years until that four letter word called WORK intervened with monthly 12 hour rotating shifts and days. Boy, is that FUN !     Speaking of outdoor pursuits that are highly worthwhile in South Jersey, check out the Shore Cycle Clubs website shorecycleclub.org and consider joining this organization. Rides leave Tuckahoe Bike Shop on Sundays . Also rides out of Port Republic and other locales. Sponsored rides with SAG support are the Pinelands Century in May and the Belleplain century in the fall with maps, sag and FOOD. Not that I need more.       Seminars were very popular with nutrition, Hydration, fitness level,   and other topics discussed. I am sure they have also had bike clinics to maintain your bike and simple fixes to get your machine on the road.          Major events are the July member picnic and December Christmas party. As soon as I retire on March 1 st. 2015, I am joining - let's see 14 months of rotating days and nights... we should have joined the union... oh, we are in the union, oops, there's goes my seniority....
