My favorite diner in the area. Food is solid- wait staff is generally attentive and friendly. The food is always fresh and the place is always clean. A classic NJ standard but an absolute standout among the other below average diners lining Rt 10. Â My personal recommendation: The GYRO platter and pumpkin coffee !
