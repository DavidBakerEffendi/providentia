Super cute, laissez faire cozy restaurant with food service and EXCELLENT food. Standouts include: Combination platter (a sampling of apps, all delicious) Baked Meatballs (sooo good) Almond Crusted Sea Scallops (soooo good) Grilled Octupus I could also see this place being great for brunch. Â Will have to try soon.
