This is definitely one of those things you need to try at least twice in your life--once sober and once not. I've only ever ordered the chicken and rice, because I don't like the taste of lamb, but I've heard good things about the lamb and rice along with the combo (chicken + lamb). I honestly don't think it's really as mind blowing as everyone else claims it to be, but it's definitely a cheap and tasty meal. I especially love the pita that goes on top of all the lettuce/rice/chicken/white sauce. At lunch it's only $5 and they'll throw in a free drink if you work around the area. I guess if you're a tourist, throw on some fancier clothes and they might mistake you for an office worker too. At dinner time and beyond, they up the price to a whopping $6. The guys who run the cart are efficient and surprisingly accommodating. I have very low spicy tolerance, so I always request no red sauce (the first time I had it, I almost died) and extra white sauce (amazing stuff but probably very unhealthy). They are perfectly nice about it (they even tease me for being weak haha) even though there are a ton of people waiting in line. Also, make sure you go to the real Halal guys. There have been a number of fake ones popping up here and there who claim to be the same ones. Nothing compares to the original.
