Pancakes are homemade, more crepe than pancake. Omelets are good sized and there's a lot of food choices as well. Small seating area, for Sunday the room filled up fast and due to the cold patrons who were waiting for a seat were a few feet away and staring at those who had just finished their meals...so if there is a crowd there's little chance for just taking a few minutes to relax...unless you don't mind being stared down to leave :)
