I came here with friends from out of town who had heard about the place way back home. We walked around a bit and saw all the delicious food the market had to offer (especially the fresh pasta!). We ate at Manzo and I had the pappardelle with braised pork which was absolutely delicious, and just the right size. Anymore and I wouldn't have been able to finish the plate! We also tried the focaccia which was so great I could have gotten a piece of that for dinner and nothing else. On another visit my friend and I tried the panini section, and the bread is unbelievably fresh and the prosciutto is also great. Unfortunately it's the same counter for wine tasting which sometimes holds up the line. The only downside are the crowds - there are just so many people crammed into both the shopping and dining areas.
