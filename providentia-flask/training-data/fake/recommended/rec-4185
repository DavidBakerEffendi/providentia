2 vodka and 7ups Hamachi shots (3 teaspoons) with the tempura flakes- a bit spicy Beef tataki-meat was sliced so thinly..perfect-with arugula Bartender Cory was awesome and friendly We had beers and drinks too with dessert:s: smores....it was like heaven! Atmosphere was trendy and hip. If you jsut want something casual, head to the back to the Grafitti bar. It literally is a casual bar with the games going...yes with graffiti on the walls...outdoors...enter from the restaurant or from outdoors...you will have to walk down in a alley though. Thanks to Andrew for serving us drinks at the Graffiti bar too. We had fun!
