Very fast delivery got my order just 10-15 mins right after placing it, originally ordered a apple crumb pie but the owner was very quick to call me letting me know it wasn't available and offered substitutions. Very friendly and great customer service. On top of it all my large buffalo chicken sandwich with blu cheese and chocolate cake was soo delish! Will continue ordering in the future.
