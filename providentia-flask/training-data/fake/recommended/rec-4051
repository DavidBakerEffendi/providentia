i've now been three times -- twice for dinner, once for brunch -- and every visit was pretty good.  the food is quite tasty -- i especially like the flatbread with goat cheese, that's a favorite -- and the cocktails are also good.  i like dinner more than brunch, though -- i had the smoked salmon salad sandwich (try saying that five times fast) and it was good, but didn't blow me away.  however, the prices at brunch are a pretty good bargain: $15 for an entree (a few of the entrees have an additional $5 fee but most are covered), coffee or tea, and a breakfast cocktail.  the prices at dinner are also very reasonable, cocktails are $10 and the food is not only affordable but also easily shareable, so you can split a few plates and keep the cost down even more. overall, it's not an amazing dining experience but it's enjoyable, won't break the bank, and around the corner from where i live, so i'm sure i will be back again.  oh, and service can be spotty -- it was good at brunch today but the second time i was there for dinner, our waitress was difficult to flag down -- so i recommend being prepared to be patient, just in case.  admittedly, the service wasn't so bad that it's keeping me away, but i might try sitting at the bar next time -- that's what i did on my first visit and had great service from the bartender, so that's probably where i'll take my chances next time.
