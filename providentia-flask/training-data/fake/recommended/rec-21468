This place just opened 4 days ago!  It is a welcome restaurant to the Fishtown neighborhood.  The food is Mediterranean and it is all fresh and homemade.  I had the chicken kabob platter that had a salad and cous cous.  It was well seasoned, fresh and tasty.  The quantity is decent and the menu has variety and is reasonably priced.  They also have baklava, which I bought to take home.  They offer eat in, take out and delivery.   Bernie
