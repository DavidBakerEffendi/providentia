The ramen was good, but I found the broth to be only average. The ambiance inside the restaurant was very nice, but I don't think the one hour wait was worth what we got. Also the price of the ramen is pretty expensive, ramen is supposed to be a common everyday food, not gourmet. We also tried the avacado and tuna tartare, which was beautifully displayed but did not have an original taste. If there wasn't a wait I would consider going back, but probably not because the price is so high for only average quality when there are other ramen joints around.
