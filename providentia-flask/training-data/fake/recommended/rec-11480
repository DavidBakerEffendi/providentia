food is way to expensive for this place. decor in main dining is grandmaish. its not the quality isnt good, i just dont think that they have found their niche for their type of restaurant. they mix too many flavors for meals that could be good; so it makes you not really want to pick anything. I would stick w/ simple appetizers or get the steak (the house steak sauce amazing). also drinks and customer service excellent.
