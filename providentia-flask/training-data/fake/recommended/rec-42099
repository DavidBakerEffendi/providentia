Puerto Viejo! Everything is tasty, so delicious and flavorful! We had a group of about 35 people and everything went smooth! From appetizers to dessert. The Customer Service is impeccable! The staff is very friendly, makes you laugh and will bring out extra homemade plantain chips if your order is a few mins. behind.  The smiles and warmth made up for them not having Tres Leche for my dessert that night;  that's something that more restaurants should adapt. Everyone left full and happy.  From my vegan guests, gluten/dairy free guests and all my carnivores! We will definitely return so we can try everything.  The tilapia was great! The Steak was awesome! I can't wait to go try something new and have delicious glass of Sangria to wash it all down. Great Family owned restaurant, Great food, Great Energy! = Great Time!
