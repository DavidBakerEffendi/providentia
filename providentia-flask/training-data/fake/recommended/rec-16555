Costumer service is king. It truly makes or breaks an experience. Even if Caracas has amazing Arepas, they tasted like poop after the treatment we received there last night. My friends and I are hard core Caracas fans. We've been visiting both establishments in Williamsburg and Manhattan now for a while. Last night may have been just the last one for me. We went with a big group (25 people or so) to celebrate a friend's birthday. The manager, Florencia, was absolutely rude. From approaching us as soon as we got there to warn us to not cause a raucous (our butts had barely touched the seats at this point) to screaming at us from across the bar in front of other patrons to stop making noise. The so called noise she screamed about lasted about 1 minute while the birthday girl stopped at our table to say hello. The music was so loud that I have a hard time believing that anyone could even hear us but her (we were sat exactly besides the bar away from other costumers.) Bottom line: Florencia failed management 101. Ruined what should have been a good time and lost the business of a loyal following.
