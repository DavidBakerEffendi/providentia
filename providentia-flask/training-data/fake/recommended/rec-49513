My word this place is great! I went with some friends, a vegetarian and a self proclaimed vegan skeptic, and they both loved it including myself of course! I had the Crunch N' Munch and Sweet Tree. They got La Fiesta and Spicy Mang. They were all great I personally liked the Sweet tree and Spicy Mang best. All the sushi was very flavorful and the nori didn't over power the vegetables like most veggie sushi does. Also the sauces that each piece were topped with were almost creamy though no creme was involved. Lastly I had the Vanilla Chia Seed Pudding, oh my glob it is wonderful. Not too sweet and very light just right in my opinion especially since I'm trying to avoid processed sugar. The slight draw back to the place is that the location we went to, on 14th st, is very small so there isn't a huge staff. Although we did go at a good time when the place wasn't crowded, I'm sure during lunch or dinner that it might take some time to order and get your food, so one should take that into account when visiting. We were also met by the stores proprietor who asked us how we enjoyed the food and the rest of the staff there were very polite as well. Beyond Sushi is Beyond Awesome!
