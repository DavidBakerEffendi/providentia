I really liked the atmosphere in this place. I went with my sister and shared the pate and she had the moules frites, while I enjoyed the steak and frites. I am not a big fan of mussels, but I have to say that this were probably one of the best I've ever had and kept trying to steal some from my sisters plate. Definitely coming back when I'm in New York again.
