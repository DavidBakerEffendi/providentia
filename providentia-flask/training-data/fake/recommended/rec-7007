Update on 11/15 (Original review on 11/14) After my original yelp review the owner reached out to me directly.  He was committed to understanding what happened and to finding a resolution to my concerns.  You can't ask for more from an owner or manager.  He cares about his customers!   After looking at reviews on yelp and seeing the five star rating, I decided to venture out to check out Bee Hive for dinner.   What did I order: 1.  Deviled Eggs - 2 2.  The Sandra 3.  Red Velvet Cake Verdict 1.  Deviled Eggs - Very good!  Perfect balance of ingredients. Recommend ordering these. 2.  The Sandra - Also very good.  Great flavor.  The biscuit was wonderful and I am speaking from growing up in the South.  The combination of the biscuit, gravy, and egg made for a delicious and comforting meal. 3.   Red Velvet Cake - When I ordered I asked how fresh the cake was and was told they are made at the restaurant. Not quite an answer to my question but I felt it would be worth the risk so I ordered a slice to go.  HUGE mistake - The cake was so dry.    I called the restaurant and mentioned the cake was very dry and the lady who answered the phone said "I don't think we have a return policy on cake".  That was it.  No offer to refund.  No offer to provide a new slice.  Nada. All in all the food was great!.  If you are in the mood for a biscuit or biscuit sandwich I would go to Bee Hive!  The service left a lot to be desired, but I am positive the owner will work with his staff on how to handle issues when they are brought up by customers.
