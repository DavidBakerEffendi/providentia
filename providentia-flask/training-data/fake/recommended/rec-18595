What a terrible meal. I got the khao soi, it was extremely oily and greasy. The chicken was floating in the soup with bones. The noodles were soft and soggy. I rarely leave food behind but I couldn't eat this. To boot the service sucked. Had to flag someone down after 5 minutes to get noticed. Would not recommend this place
