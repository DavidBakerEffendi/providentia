So let me start by saying, this wasn't my first pick of places to dine. I am not a fan of plantains and I thought I hated yucca. BUT the restaurant we were headed to was closed on Monday and we ended up here. I couldn't have been more impressed. So we were told it was BYOB, and I didn't quite get it because it said that they served sangria. But then it was explained that they serve punch mixes that you can bring wine to add to and make Sangria! SUCH A GREAT IDEA! Tip: There is a wine store two doors down from the restaurant in case you forget to bring one. We had the Goat Cheese appetizer and the Empanadas and both were delish. Both of our dinner portions were HUGE and we have a crazy amount of leftovers. I was also very impressed with the food preparation. I have had yucca several times before and have never liked it. Last night, I have no idea what they did to prepare it(i believe it was simply roasted) but it was to die for! This restaurant is very large, you have to walk through a jungle lined pathway to get in and we saw four large rooms and a spacious outdoor forum and all were full of people. The only reason this place doesn't get five star is that it is the LOUDEST place I have ever been to. They were pumping in music overhead and we couldn't hear anything we were saying. We were also sat by several groups that had birthdays and drums were brought in, I believe there was a cowbell and I had to plug my ears!
