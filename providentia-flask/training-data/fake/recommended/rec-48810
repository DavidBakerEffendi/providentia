I've been to this restaurant a few times, both the Chelsea location and this one, in in Hell's Kitchen.  This location is more impressive, but the same amazing menu.  Even with all the amazing Thai places, this place stands out in just about every respect: amazing atmosphere, great food, and great prices.  Staff is very friendly.  The food was so reasonable, that my g/f didn't realize that the tip was included in our table for six.  I called the next day to explain that we tipped twice.  They very graciously offered to refund our money in cash, which we gladly took as a gift certificate, since we know we're going back there. The best things on the menu: for apps: honey ribs; for entrees: pork chop, bangkok pumpkin curry chicken, and tamarind red snapper.  The lychee (red) sangria was also great.  Can't wait to go back.
