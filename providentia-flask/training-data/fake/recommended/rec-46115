It was on our last trip to Connecticut, Mill on the River was highly rated by my daughter and so we gave it a spin. It was great, everyone seemed to like what they ordered, my drink was well-made and the atmosphere was sublime. They actually have an attended coat check room and strongly encourage customers to use same. Â I never realized how much classier a restaurant can look when there aren't coats hanging off the back of every other chair. Seemed like a lot of people were celebrating a special occasion of one kind or another, and I would certainly use the Mill to celebrate in the future. But the food was superb and the salds very interesting and delicious.
