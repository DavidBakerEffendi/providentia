Two words: TRUFFLE BURGER. Seriously. I will never get anything else whenever I come here. I've been once before, and had the regular burger, which was good, but ZOMG the truffle burger is just a melting mass of amazing truffleness and deliciousness. FOOD: if it wasn't clear from the opening of this review, the truffle burger is to die for. The other burgers are good too, and they grind all of their meat in house, so whatever you order will definitely be fresh. The truffle burger comes out covered in cheese and truffle oil, and my god, this was simply a divine experience. My friends and I also ordered a side of the sweet potato fries, which were good, but I was just having too much fun on my side of the table with my truffle burger. DRINKS: they offer a pretty impressive selection of craft beers, if they actually have them in stock. I've been twice, and the second time I went they seemed to be out of at least three selections on the menu. Hopefully they can improve this. PRICES: for three of us (ordering three burgers, one order of fries, and three beers), the total came out to $80(ish). If this were an "ordinary" burger place, that would be pretty crazy, but for the quality that you experience at Umami Burger *cough* truffle burger *cough*, it's alright. I wouldn't make this place a habit because of the prices, but I'd come every once in a while for an indulgence. SERVICE: good for how packed they were the second time I came in. There's an upstairs and a downstairs, and the servers have a lot of real estate to deal with here. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, and was able to make suggestions. We came around 8:00pm on a Friday night, and thankfully the wait wasn't too long. The first time I came it was round 4:30 or 5:00, and there was zero wait, so plan accordingly.
