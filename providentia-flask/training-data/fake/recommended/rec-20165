Decent place but it is a little over-rated.  Some of the chicken I had was not even seasoned with salt so it had very little flavor on the inside. The buckwheat waffles are too heavy so I would avoid ordering those.  Crowded on the weekend so expect to wait and service is quite slow. Wish they had better coffee and cappuccino. We had the banana cream pie, it was ok.
