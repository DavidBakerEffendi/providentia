It was my first time there with my family, and we ordered a pepperoni pizza, and a veggie pizza that had olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and some other stuff. Let me say, the margarita pizza looked delicious, yet we didn't order it. The pepperoni & sausage was first. It was a yummy, authentic brick-oven pizza.The thick layer of mozzarella was scrumptious. On the other hand, the veggie pizza was blehh. it had an acquired weird taste, never again shall I order that.
