What a fabulous little place! Name well suited! Selected this place for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and was totally impressed. The food was amazing and the service really personable. Other reviewers pin the size of this place as a problem, but it's just right. Call ahead for reservations and anticipate an intimate dining experience. The waitress was very sweet and we could smell our food cooking as we waited. No frills - great good. Definetly going back again and again. So glad we found little fish, it's one of our new favorite spots. Well done!
