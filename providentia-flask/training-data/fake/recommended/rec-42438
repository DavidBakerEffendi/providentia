A friend of mine and I discovered La Fourno one day when walking down South Street, trying to kill time while waiting for a table at another restaurant.  I was being picky about where to have our pre-dinner drink and after several blocks, I got annoyed with myself and decided we were going into the next place that had a bar.  Seconds later we stumbled upon La Fourno and their sign announcing "Bar Open". We stopped to read their sidewalk sign (mostly because their window sign was so helpful) and were greeted by their owner.  He informed us that whenever hesitant people stood outside to read his menu or specials board, he likes to make a point to invite them in.  Sounds like a solid business practice.  We got a table and decided we had had enough with waiting.  Our first choice in dining still hadn't called us with a table (how dare they??) and adorable little La Fourna already had a carafe of wine in front of us.  If only finding a man was this easy... We have since gone back several times, and always try to order something different each time (sharing everything along the way, of course).  The pizzas are always delicious. Pick whatever toppings you and your table want most, but it really doesn't matter because the crust is spot on every time. We've enjoyed their caprese salad, fried calamari and mussels as an appetizer on different occasions.  For entrees, we've had the baked penne, the veal and sage raviolis, chicken marsala and penne alla vodka.  My favorite is probably the veal and sage raviolis-they were very earthy and hearty.  But seriously, everything is great.  Simple, homey and well-prepared. La Fourno is one of those places that remind you a lower price point and a casual atmosphere can still supply you with delicious food and an experience worth talking about.
