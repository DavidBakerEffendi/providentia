Right by Philly's Amtrak/bus station so if you are looking to waste some time and get a good drink, stop by Slainte.   Food portion size is huge.  I ordered a burger and fries and I couldn't finish the whole thing.  Burger was cooked perfectly.  No complaints whatsoever.  And the place was relatively cheap.  We had food and drinks for 2 of us and the bill was around 40 dollars. Everybody was cool from the bartender to the locals.  Will stop by again.
