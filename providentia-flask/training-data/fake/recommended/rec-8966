OMG, the food here is sublime.  A friend and I had our second (yes SECOND) dinner here last night after having sushi at Blue Ribbon Sushi up the street.  We really came for oysters but then I saw bone marrow accompanied by oxtail marmalade on le menu (so we ordered both things of course).  Everything was amazingly scrumptious.   We met really nice patrons, and Benjamin, the barman, rocks.  PLUS they have Bruichladdich on the wall.  This may end up being my new fave place when I'm away from home.  ;)
