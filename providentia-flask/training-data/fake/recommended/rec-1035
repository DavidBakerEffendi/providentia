I would probably give this four-and-a-half stars, and would have given five had I loved the dessert. The wine list is extensive (as it should be considering it's name), with varietals from all over the world.  The specials that evening, which we tried all of, were perfect.  Lamb meatballs are easily one of my favorites, and their iteration was excellent. Dinner was nice, well portioned, and definitely made me want to visit again.  Our server was excellent as well.  She was attentive and kept the wine flowing!  The space itself is larger than you'd expect, but had an intimate feel thanks to dim lighting and quaint seating spaces. My only gripe was the chocolate cake we had for dessert.  I felt that it was dry and just didn't live up to the rest of the meal.  Regardless, we'll be back and I'll just try a different dessert.
