The food here is great.  I've had the soy sauce chicken, duck, roast pork and roast pig (They are not the same. You should try both).  The vegetable (typical green leaf vegetable) in oyster sauce goes well with the roasted meats as does a large portion of wonton noodle soup.  Everything here is delicious and very inexpensive. Can't wait to try more.
