Another interesting and unique Thai Experience for this weekend While Pure Thai was very minimalist and authentic, this place had a different unique quality I have yet to see at Â Thai restaurant. The Decor almost felt 1800's Victorian style, which is different from the DJ booth filled Thai places all over. The Duck salad was probably the best one I have had to date. Big pieces of duck, and season really well. The Beef Pad Thai was also perfectly seasoned and was a good amount of sweet, and the beef was not rubbery and cooked well. Side note: The lunch special came with vegetable dumplings, which I was not crazy about The Thai iced tea came in a huge cup and the mojitos were on the larger side as well. The Masaman curry was also one of the better ones I have had Overall, great experience, great service and great food
