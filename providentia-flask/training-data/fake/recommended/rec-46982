I love! No!!! Extremely adore this place. It is an awesome joint without alcohol but drinkers have the choice to byob. I love their salmon salad, stuffed french toast, awesome burgers with those excellent sweet potato french fries and their iced tea. Service is impressive to say the least and extremely attentive. The only down side is brunch on the weekend. The lines are seriously long. Otherwise it is a keeper!!!
