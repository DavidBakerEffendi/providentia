This is a gem in Times Square. Really. It's not touristy at all! Â  Foods: [1] tofu agedashi [2] octopus balls -- seriously tasty! [3] Mini Udon -- WAY better than that overrated / overpriced Ippudo. However, to note: [1] yes, pieces are smaller, but quality over quantity. [2] service: awesome [3] Japanese High Ball: I was pleasantly surprised that they had this, since it was my favorite drink in Tokyo =), but disappointingly, it did not have that "kick" even at 3am. =/ Still, I would recommend and return!
