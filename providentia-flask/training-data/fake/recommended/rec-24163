What can you say about the King of Steaks? He deserves the title, that's what. I love it here, just don't forget to get some of the hot sauce on the side and to try it with provi.I much rather come here than to that other gaudy one across the street, ugh. If you're a girl, just watch out. The guys working the window are not very good at hiding the fact that they are checking you out....can be a little uncomfortable.
