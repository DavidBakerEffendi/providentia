This place is overall pretty great. It's a great atmosphere and they're very quick in bringing the food. I try to go here with my friends at least once a month. There's no question that they've got great food, but you REALLY have to communicate to the waiters to tone down the spice - sometimes, it's so ridiculously hot that it's impossible to eat (I'm Indian, and I can tolerate alot more than the average person). My suggestions: try the cumin lamb, the steamed dumplings, and the chong qing chicken.
