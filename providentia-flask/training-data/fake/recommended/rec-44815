This is one of my favorite takeout joints in the city. The fries are pretty good themselves, but everyone comes in for the sauces. I've sampled all of their available sauces and they are all really good. My personal favorites are the sweet mango chutney (the most popular), the peanut satay, the honey mustard, the Parmesan peppercorn, pomegranate teriyaki mayo and the wild mushroom. I remember when I first came to this place too that they had a special on fries that were fried in truffle oil, they were some of the greatest fries I had ever tasted, I hope they come back with that special sometime soon.
