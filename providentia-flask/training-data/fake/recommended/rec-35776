Tiny little place with yummy Japanese dishes.  We packed into our little table ordered beer and sake and started the parade of Japanese tapas.  The grilled yakatori, fried chick gizzards, crispy squid, fried rice ball -- all went deliciously with a col bottle of sake. Grilled eggplant with miso was great - one half of a whole aubergine topped with miso and baked until the inside was super tender.  Scoop out the inside yumminess.
