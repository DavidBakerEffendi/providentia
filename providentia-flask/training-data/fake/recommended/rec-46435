So I'm kinda obsessed with Marc Forgione. You see, he was a umass alum.. and I'm a umass alum.. and well, we're perfect for each other! He just doesn't know it. His restaurant is freaking fantastic. It's absolutely stunning, by far the prettiest restaurant I've ever been to. It's exactly how I would design a restaurant. Romantic, casual, modern, cozy - it was all just too perfect. I loved everything about this place. My drinks were delicious, the service was spot on, and the food was fantastic. My only compliant was that the portions on the duck were itty bitty. But I guess that's what you get with nice places... (although, that always grinds my gears a bit... if I'm paying 40 dollars for a plate I want to leave full!!) You better believe I'm coming back. It's pricey, but worth it.
