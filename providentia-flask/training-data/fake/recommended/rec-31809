Trust your nutrition to the helpful staff. I enjoyed the house made chili and chocolate cheesecake with a wonton salad between. The barkeep's suggested beer pairings were Founders' Pale Ale to start and a sweetish Scotch ale winding down. 6:30 was quiet and by 8 PM tables indoors and out front were filling.  Clients know the staff. We had couples, one with a baby, mixed groups of younger local-ish adults and a really great vibe. Feels at home and the tastes are a treat.  Check out the on-line menu. Savor the chalkboard of daily specials. Worth you attention even if only for a beer and the ambiance. No wonder I have friends who live in downtown Philly and rave about the sense of community!
