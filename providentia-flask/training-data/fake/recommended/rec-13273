Gem of a restaurant amongst all the other crap in midtown. No sushi here but come for all the Japanese street food. Loved the okonomiyaki, onigiri, and panko oysters. The yakitori was also pretty good but I've yet to find anything like the amazing stuff I used to get in Japan. Looks like they have great drink specials so this would be a super fun place to come on a weekend night with friends for snacks and beer/sake. Will definitely be back!
