First off, the Chickie's and Pete's I went to is not on Packer, it's "the original" on Robbins ave. Second off, it's a good sports bar with friendly service and delicious crab. A very down-to-earth type place. The crab is their claim to fame - snow crab and king crab are both winners. They have original "crab fries" - french fries with seasoning and some sort of cheese dip on the side. Also, in a move that must be unique to Philly, they put fries on top of their salad. Nice. Good tomato pie as well. Chickie's and Pete's is a place I always stop by when in Philadelphia, a tradition I intend to continue.
