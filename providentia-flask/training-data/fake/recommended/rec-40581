Having been to other Pei-Wei locations in Cherry Hill and Florida, I was very excited to find out that a more local Pei Wei had opened up about a half hour drive from home. We finally went for dinner last week. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, mongolian shrimp with brown rice, teriyaki chicken with white rice and lo-mein. We had enough food to take home for another dinner, so the portions of the food were okay. However everything was brought out piecemeal- one of our entrees came as we started the lettuce wraps, and the lo-mein did not come out until we were half way done with our other dishes. Really like the soda machine and the fortune cookies, which you could take extra with you for leftovers. The only thing I noticed they didn't have, was the orange and lemon segments, lemon for soda and oranges for dessert. I was at a Pei Wei in Palm Beach FL area and they had orange segments. We will definately come back though.
