I was being treated to a special diner. Since I wanted Italian I had 2 choices, I choose L'amante based on a Yelp review which described the duck. I love duck so it made the choice easy to make. However when the duck came out I knew I was going to be disappointed. The leg was overcooked, the skin was not edible and the meat under was well done. I do not ever send any thing back and did not want to make a first on a special meal but it was close. The green veggies were a mystery, all stems and tough. The squash blossoms were great but not enough for me to ever go back. Go early the acoustics are terrible and it is very noisy. This was our 3rd time here but now on I will go to the Trattoria delia.
