I love Bianca's! This was my second time here. Bianca's is great, because it is delicious Italian food AND the prices are so reasonably perfect. (Cash only) You cannot make a reservation here, but you can get a drink at the bar right next door while you wait. (We have never waited over 30 minutes) No worries if you haven't finished your drink once your wait is up, just bring the glass over to Bianca's. Not to mention the charming host, hostess, waiters, and waitresses I have come by during my dinners here, but the restaurant is so charming as well. My boyfriend and I got 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, dessert, and a bottle of wine (Chianti!) for $86!!!!!! You simply cannot beat prices like that in NYC. We brought his parents back this weekend, and we will be sure to come back again and again! You can't go wrong at Bianca's!
