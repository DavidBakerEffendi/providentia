I do NOT understand why this place is popular.. The burger was pretty lousy.   I went here on a Friday night at 8pm before the crowds showed up with a group of friends.  We sat at the bar and had some beers.  I ordered the bistro burger (bacon and cheese) and fries.  First of all, the food took forever to come out.  Second, their burgers are TASTELESS.  The meat was totally unseasoned. No salt, no pepper.. absolutely nothing.  Third, it tasted like a burger you would get in a hospital cafeteria!  And I swear I have had BETTER food in the cafeteria at Hackensack Hospital.    There is absolutely nothing special about this burger or this place.  The fries were unoriginal too. Go to almost any pub around NYC and order a cheeseburger.  I am pretty sure that 9 out of 10 pubs would have a burger that was tastier. I guess if you just want cheap beer and food, you could go here, but there are plenty of other places without a long wait that would be a better option. I think this is one of those cases where maybe a few years ago the burgers were good. But now they have become complacent because they get such a crowd and it doesn't matter to them to put out good food. Skip this Corner and go anywhere else...  I wont go back here. just my two cents.
