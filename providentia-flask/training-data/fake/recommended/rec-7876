Not busy at all for a Saturday night, easily got a table. Started off with the Maine Stout beer, which was good but really didn't hold a candle to other Maine craft breweries. Calamari was safe, crispy, tasty, but the an unexpectedly small portion. For the entr√©e, I had the farmhouse burger which contained a dollop of goat cheese and a side of aioli. The sauce was very acidic and too thin. The burger, while cooked appropriately, had grill marks that were burnt and emitted a excessively charred flavor. Service was fine, but I probably won't come back here again. Note that on Saturday there is a bottomless mimosa/bloody mary promotion from 10-3 at 25 bucks / person. Maybe something to check out?
