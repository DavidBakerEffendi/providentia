After walking up and down the streets of Little Italy, we settled for this sweet little spot. We were seated next to the window and enjoyed a very nice lunch. The waiter was very friendly and helpful with his recommendations. My husband had the penne with vodka sauce which was very tasty. I ordered the lunch special linguine with eggplant and it was delicious! Almost every restaurant in Little Italy offers a lunch special menu which makes eating in Little Italy a bit more reasonable than the normally outrageous prices. I realize it's New York, but $66 for lunch for a family of four is ridiculous. And that was with a couple of lunch specials. That being said, the food was delicious, the bread was soft and warm! With a little effort, you can certainly find food that's just as good at more reasonable prices elsewhere in NY. Â I wouldn't eat here everyday, but if you're going to eat in Little Italy, this place is pretty good.
