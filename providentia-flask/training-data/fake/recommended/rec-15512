This place was so convenient but somehow overlooked by my husband and I. We made the mistake of going to another pizza place down the street and having an "eh" experience. We were still a little hungry so we decided to split a slice somewhere else. We yelped close by locations and this is what came up. Wow I wish we would have come here first! It is a TINY place with amazing pizza and rolls. We had one with onions, peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms. It was hot and fresh. My biggest recommendation though, would be to get one (or 10) of the garlic rolls! They are made with real minced garlic that you can see and taste...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Don't make our mistake and pass up this place just because it is small. Stop in, get a slice and a garlic roll and eat outside on their little bar. WORTH IT!
