I've eaten at most of the Mulberry Street Italian restaurants (I still have a few to knock off) and this is my favorite.  The portions are quite generous and tasty and the wine list is ample as it should be.  I really like the bread, and more specifically, the manner in which they do their olive oil and balsamic.   It should be pointed out that the service here is very good too, which is important to me.  Attentive when necessary, but not overbearing.  Certainly worth a look if you're in Little Italy.
