Maggie McFly's is a big place with a little parking lot. THATS the first thing to know! They offer valet parking on the weekends. This place reminds me of a nicer TGI Fridays. The menu is about 16 pages long, but there are few goodies tucked in here and there. Especially on the dessert page. Bar is a good size, but this place has the possibility of getting loud and obnoxious. There seems to be a steady stream of too-old frat boys who like to party and drink and be very boisterous. Which is fine for some, others hate to be around that sort of scene. The bartenders are always very nice, sometimes forgetful, but nice. The food usually hits the spot for me, as I am there at the end of kitchen hours and just trying to get some quick food after a long work shift.  I stick to the appetizers, and the nachos have seem to been the best so far. Artichoke and Spinach dip seemed to have more cheese in it than any of the other ingredients, and was  a bit disappointing. Like I mentioned earlier, take a piece of carrot cake home with you, and it might make the experience a little better.
