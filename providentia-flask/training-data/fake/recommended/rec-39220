Their pizza is a little pricey and greasy but delicious. I think the grease is because they use whole milk cheese, in fact I know from the empty cheese boxes lying around. Their sauce is wonderful, not overly sweet like those chain restaurants. That said, when they use it for their ziti and meatballs it could benefit from a bit more salt. The ziti pasta truly is enough for 2 people. It comes with what he called a "little salad" (it was enough for two) and lightly toasted bread. The meat is halal!
