I went yesterday for the first time and LOVED it. I took my mom for her 50th B-day along with my 2 aunties and they had a blast and we were all wasted LOL. The Lychee martinis are so good and the price is just right. Â I can't wait to go back with my friends. I will be there next weekend. Thanks Verlaine!!
