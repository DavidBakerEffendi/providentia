I recently went here while on vacation and visiting my family in Philadelphia.  My sister and her daughters told us about this place but also warned us that the wait would be long but the food was good.   The next morning, it was pouring rain and we ended up waiting about 30 min out on their patio trying to stay dry with umbrellas.  Once we were seated, our server took our drink order and soon our food order.   The place was packed and the food took about 15 min to come out.  It was wonderful!  The food is the best and the home made ketchup was great. But in all honesty, I want to give it 5 stars but can't due to the service.  Like many others posting here, the service was okay but the attitude of the staff was horrible.  It was like they were doing us a favor by taking our orders and bringing our food.  Nobody was smiling... honestly... if you don't want to serve people food, don't work in this business.  The staff need to totally get over themselves.  Granted the food they serve is great but you still have to have a great bed side manor.  I will not be going back nor will I be able to recommend this place due to the attitude of the staff.   Maybe the owners want this feeling... maybe they don't know how people are being treated.... Either way, this is not the way to keep customers no matter how good your food is.
