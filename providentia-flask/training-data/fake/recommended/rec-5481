It's pricey ramen, but worth trying at least once. I was out to try something different there, and bin bin ramen and fried shumai satisfied that craving. Bin bin ramen is soupless spicy noodles (I think it's marinated in spicy mayo) and it was flavorful and tasty. Fried shumai is new, I've never heard of it, and seriously tasted great with the sauce that comes with it; I think it's the same sauce as the one in bin bin ramen, but I'm not complaining! I can eat 3 orders of these! Service was quick and our waitress was conscientious. I like how all the seats had little cubbies at the bottom for personal belongings! There is also a Terakawa Ramen in NYC and I'm not sure if both are owned by the same people, but this one is Philadelphia takes the win.
