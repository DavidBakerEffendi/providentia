I visited Sabrina's for the first time a few days ago on a leisurely weekday with my honey.  There was no wait, if you don't count the time we spent trying to figure out how to get inside.  I ordered a burger with turkey bacon on top and some kind of heavenly siracha jam... yes!  It was delicious, especially with the fried egg I asked them to put on top and they happily obliged.  Honey got plain french toast with a side of bacon that he really enjoyed.  Not the best french toast ever but pretty good.  Overall a wonderful experience and yummy food.  I will return (on a weekday of course, I hear the wait on weekends is epic)
