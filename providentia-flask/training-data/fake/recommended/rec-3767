pasta! Â cheap wine! great pick before a show. When we were there they needed to switch our table towards the end of our meal for a big party that was coming in. To apologize for making us move they brought us a tray of every dessert being served in the restaurant that night! chocolate mousse, canolis, fresh fruit, cookies, chocolates, it was to die for. I would have been satisfied with even one of the desserts, but being able to try them all made it an awesome memorable experience! great place!
