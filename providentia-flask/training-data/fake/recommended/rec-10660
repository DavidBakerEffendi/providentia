This review is for PIZZA only!  The spot has a great plain slice.  Honestly my favorite slice in my area.  The place is kinda dirty and sketch looking so I stay away from anything made from behind the door leading to the kitchen.  Pizza is spun up right out front and I must say the man tosses a good pie.  Also prices are very fair.
