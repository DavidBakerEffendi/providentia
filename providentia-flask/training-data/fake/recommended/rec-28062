This place definitely deserves a solid 5 stars.  Crispy on the outside bread, soft on the inside, with fresh, good quality ingredients.  Service was stellar when I dined in, and was also stellar when I've called in to pick up.  I don't know if they still have this on their menu but they had this amazing green bean appetizer with truffle oil, some sort of vinaigrette, and shaved cheese.  They don't have soup for the summer, but for colder weather, I had their tomato bisque and it was delicious.  Highly recommend this place for an amazing sandwich, great service, and no fuss dining experience.
