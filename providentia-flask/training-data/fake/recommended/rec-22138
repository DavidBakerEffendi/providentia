Had no idea this place existed until the hubs and I randomly walked down Montrose and came across it.  After living on the west coast for many years, we have been hard pressed to find an good Vietnamese sandwich on par with our old favorites.  While not quite 100% there, Nam Nam is the closest thing we have found in our hood- nice crusty bread, delicious spicy mayo and pickled veggies..... the pork was quite tasty.   The iced coffee is also delicious.  Super nice people working there.  Went back the next day for more, but unfortunately they were closed due to plumbing issues, so hopefully they get that resolved soon!! The only real negative I could say is that they could definitely benefit from sprucing the place up a bit- apparently they've been around a while, but you'd think they just moved in by looking at their storage situation....  regardless, we'll be back.
