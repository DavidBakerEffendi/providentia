Okay, I've tried El Fuego three times.  I had no desire to go back after the first time, but it's a block away from work and people rave about it, so I figured I just hit an "off" day.  The first time I had a burrito, second time tacos and today a quesedilla.  I've had way better, even in Philly.   I think "meh" pretty much sums up the taste of the food.  Everyone points out that it's fresh, which I suppose is usually better than frozen, but if it's lacking in flavor and not prepared well, it doesn't do much good. The service was okay, I guess.  The girl who took my order today was completely confused when I asked for a cheese quesedilla.  Apparently you can only get it with meat or veggies (read: a couple of peppers and onions) and she put beans in it.   I'd never had a quesedilla with beans in it but I thought, "what the hell, I like beans."   I think my biggest problem with this place is the sogginess factor.  They don't use a slotted spoon to drain the beans so you get a bunch of water in your burrito/tacos/quesedilla.  It makes it very messy, and just plain unpleasant to eat.   And what's with the loud dance music?  It makes my head hurt and I sure wouldn't want to eat in because you can barely talk to your friends over the music.   Maybe I'm just missing something, but I'm just not getting the four and five star ratings.   The main reason for the second star is that they serve Jarritos sodas.  That would only be better if they served the Jamaica flavor. Would it kill them to offer nachos?  They have all the ingredients but don't serve them.  I have to say I love some good nachos, so if they put them on the menu they might be able to redeem themselves to me.
