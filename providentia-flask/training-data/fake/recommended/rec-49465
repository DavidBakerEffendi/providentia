A note on service-- I was shorted a Crunch 'N' Munch roll yesterday (which is my favorite roll, though the December roll of the month is pretty bangin'). The delivery boy said he'd be back in ten minutes with the missing roll, but never showed. Indignant, I called them around 8pm and left a message. This afternoon at one, I called again, still fuming (and so sad), though impressively polite when I spoke with the phone answerer. They delivered my missing roll today within half an hour of answering my phone call, with many apologies, and a free brownie to boot. Beyond Sushi knows the way to my heart.
