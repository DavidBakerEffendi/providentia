Had a fantastic experience! They sat a table of 7 with ease during brunch hours on a Saturday. I was immediately warmed by the wall of fun mustards and pickles, and then I glanced over to the baked goods and found many gluten free options that all looked fantastic.  I ended up ordering the blueberry coffee cake and it was outstanding!  It had the, "yes this is a naughty pastry' taste, and not "Im allergic to gluten so only want things that have no flavor and taste like someone secretly injected health food in here" taste.  Delicious.   The coffee was very good here, and everyone at the table devoured all their food.  I was again pleased to find I could order any of their sandwiches on GF bread - so I, of course, did.  I had the pesto grilled cheese.  While the GF sandwiches are substantially smaller than the standard ones that were served to other guests at my table - the bread is typical GF size (think Udi's).  The sandwich was SO fantastic, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. Great warm and unique atmosphere, great service - great experience.
