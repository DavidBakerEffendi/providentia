Went there for the first time on Monday with a young lady and we did well in choosing this night as it has a reputation for filling up early on the more popular nights of the week/weekend. Our server was Kim and she was alsolutely charming and very attentive. We had 3 appetizers (paani puri, mutton seekh kebabs and the tiger prawns) and for the main dish we shared a Drunken Munkey Chicken Biriyani. Absolutely scrumptious !! The drinks are also WOW !! I had the coctail named after Ernest Hemingway - and it was WOW ! Citrusy and powerful !! (I only needed one !)
