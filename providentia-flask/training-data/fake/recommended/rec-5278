Being a tourist, I had to get a Cheesesteak, cuz who visits Philly without getting one? Anyways, I had already tried Geno's, Steve's and Philip's. Out of the three, Philip's wins it. I will definitely want to try other places when I get the chance but for now, Philip's has to be the best for me. They make it fresh as you order it, instead of having the steaks pre-cooked. I ordered a Whiz Wit and the cheese was amazing. The onions had so much flavor in them as well. I loved the location of it because there is a parking lot, and if you're like me then that really takes a lot of stress off of you looking for a parking spot, especially being a tourist in a big city. No seats but there's a standing area to eat. My order came out quick within 5 minutes and they were very friendly and not as intimidating as other spots.
