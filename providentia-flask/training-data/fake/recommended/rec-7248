Not worth the hype, came here for their Wednesday promotion where all the items on the menu are $1, sangria $2, beers $3. Nothing was good, mostly just BREAD with tiny portions of either shrimp/meatballs/pulled pork/chicken/whichever other filling. Save your money and go somewhere else for happy hour.
