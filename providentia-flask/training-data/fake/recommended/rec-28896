I went there last night for Restaurant Week and was very disappointed. I had heard great things about it from friends and was expecting the same experience but didn't get it. There was nothing that was terrible wrong, just a mix a things. We got there early and sat at their bar (which is very small) for a round of drinks before getting seated. When we sat down at looked at their menu, we realized that their Restaurant Week menu really was not a bargain at all, and that better items were on the regular menu, so we went with the regular menu. First we ordered the Onions Rings with the Chocolate Ranch dipping sauce for an appetizer, which was good. At this time we ordered another round of drinks, which took about 12 minutes to get to the table. The chocolate martini I ordered was good however. For dinner I ordered the Chicken and Goat Cheese Salad on top of a Corn Waffle. The salad itself was good, but the waffle was a little soggy. The whole plate would have been way better if they cooked the waffles crispier. I only ate a few bites of the waffle before pushing it aside. My boyfriend got the Waffle Cubano sandwich, which he said was good, but in his words, "There wasn't much too it". Also, the seating there is very cramped and the music they played there was too slow, it didn't make for a good vibe. I was a little annoyed at this point, so we ended up not staying for desert. All the desert items looked great, so I would suggest to anyone to stick with that when they go back. To Conclude, the dinner items were just flat out not worth it, the Restaurant Week menu was horrible, long wait for drinks, crowded tables and horrible music!!
