I love the decor/atmosphere of Murphy's - very cozy. Ordered the: Harpoon IPA Sauteed Mussels (mussels were tasty, but the broth left a sharp after taste). Chili (delicious and definitely warmed me up after coming in from the cold weather outside). Lobster Roll (I expected it to be warm, but turns out it was designed to be a cold roll. Very generous helping of lobster and tasty. Really enjoyed the fries and the cole slaw that accompanied it). Service was good. Waiter was attentive and cheerful. Came in a little after the dinner rush so the atmosphere was really relaxed.
