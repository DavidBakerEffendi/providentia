I LOVE the food here. Il Bambino is consistently good and an Astoria staple. Unfortunately, I have a hubs with a high gluten intolerance, so their bread filled menu is not an optimal choice for date night.  However, when I do get to indulge, I enjoy every second of the savory food items presented to me.   Their paninis and crostinis are a treat for my taste buds, and the service has always been friendly and efficient.  I've yet to have a bad experience here. Their backyard patio is wonderful during the spring, summer, and fall months.  It's a very calm and intimate setting for a delightful lunch or dinner. Writing this review is making me crave Il Bambino's food - that's how good it is!
