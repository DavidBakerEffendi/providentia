Fat Salmon is, by far, one of the best sushi restaurants I have been to. It has a quiet, intimate ambiance and is especially a good atmosphere for couples. It is a little pricey, but the quality of the food is worth every penny. I have no problem spending money on top-quality food, and Fat Salmon is definitely Grade A. Everything I ate was delicious.
