I have been living in Newark for a little over two years now for college and this is a frequent for everyone that I know. As soon as you walk inside you know exactly what it is to be inside of a Jersey diner (and what it actually means to be open twenty-four hours a day). I have never had a bad dish here and the staff has always been amazing. If you are looking for breakfast in the middle of the night, a good bowl of soup or just a cup of coffee this is a great place to go.
