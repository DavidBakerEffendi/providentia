Food was good, service was fast but waitress not all that friendly. We were the only non-Koreans there. Â Seemed almost irritated when we asked questions. Last Korean restaurants I went to was in Korea. The food here was good but not exactly the same. Especially the BulGo Gi. Was not servied on the dome, no lettuce but still pretty good but not the best. The shortribs were excellent. There was a long line as we were leaving and that was mid-week on a rainy night so be prepared to wait or try and go early. I recommend it. Overall food very good and excellent prices. I did not understand why they had "Pending" on the sanitation rating on the door.
