I had food envy with every plate I saw!  This place is fantastic; I'm so thrilled to have a new fabulous restaurant on South.  Miles Table is similar to a fast- casual restaurant.  They have the guests order at the front of the restaurant, get their drinks at the front, but from there there is table service.   I went to Miles Table this morning with a girlfriend, and we both walked out very happy with our meal and overall experience.   I ordered the vegetable wrap.  It was delicious...  I told myself I was only going to eat half, but I nearly cleaned my plate.  The wrap has a generous amount of filling, great flavor, and was served with homemade chips.   My friend ordered the Sausage and Egg brioche sandwich.  It looks so darn good...  The egg was perfectly cooked with a nice warm soft yoke covering the sandwich.  The bread was perfectly toasted, and the portion was quite generous!   The ambiance was casual but thoughtful...  It was very relaxed and friendly.  Everything was modern and they used the small space very well, so many guests can be seated, but we didn't feel cramped.     The only critique we could come up with was the coffee, which was not fantastic... but not horrible. I will definitely be back for many more visits :) .
