For the hype and hassle of getting a reservation, not worth it........ the chicken under the brick is great, as were the oysters, but the service is slightly sub par, and the butterhead salad was a joke (looked like someone drop kicked it on the plate). The lady ashton choc cake could barely compete with a devil dog, and i'd give the devil dog the edge with a glass of milk.  Just underwhelming, not horrible, but I don't understand why people are so crazy for this place. there are better places to eat in the city.  glad i tried it, but wouldn't go back......................
