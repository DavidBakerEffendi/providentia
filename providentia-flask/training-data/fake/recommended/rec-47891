Ample parking and very clean, roomy restaurant. Ordered the 360 appetizer and pernil entree. My favorite was the sweet plantain on the 360 stuffed with beef and topped with mozzarella- yum! Unfortunately, they were out of blueberries for the smoothie I wanted and also the creamy cilantro dressing for the salad- bummer. Seating is abundant and food is hot and fresh! I will be back...
