My favorite restaurant in philly to date. I can order take out or dine in with friends and quality of the food does not change. I never pay more than $20 for my share of entrees, dessert, and drink. I would recommend the Roti canai appetizer (thinner version of Jamaican roti), mango chicken, beef rangdang (sp), and any fried rice is a perfect choice! To drink, try the lychee - refreshing and get the fried ice cream if you have room lol
