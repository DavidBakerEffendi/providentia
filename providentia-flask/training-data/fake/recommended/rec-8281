This is still one of my all-time favorite burger joints-great old bar, good crowd, plenty of atmosphere-a great place on a cold night.  Highly recommend as a good village night out.  The burgers are broiled and huge, quite tasty.  This is NOT a fancy dressed-up $29 trimmed short-rib and brisket "gourmet" burger-just a good honest burger.
