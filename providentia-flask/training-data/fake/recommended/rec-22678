really good hotdogs. great fries. AMAZING beer selection. They had Bourbon County Coffee.. ON DRAFT! insane! my only reason for not giving this 5 stars.. PLASTIC CUPS?!?! YOU DUN GOOFED! get rid of that garbage. I expect my BCBCS (an extremely hard to find, extremely high alcohol content beer) to be served in a proper snifter and not a 7oz plastic cup. that's NONSENSE. but, I WILL come back, because we had a great anniversary lunch.
