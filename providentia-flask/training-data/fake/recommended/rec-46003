very tasty, affordable sandwiches. i would say stay away from classic banh mi (although it is really tempting at only $5) because I think pretty much all of the other sandwiches on the menu are much better. the spring rolls are really tasty too. definitely worth checking out. a fantastic lunch spot if you're in the area looking for a some good, quick eats. cool atmosphere and nice wooden tables.
