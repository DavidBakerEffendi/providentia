I have been to this restaurant a few times and most of my experiences have been great. The one bartender was so helpful I can't remember her name but she was amazing. Octupus is a must and the agnolotti was delicious (recommendations by this bartender). HOWEVER, the last couple times I've been there I have been disappointed. One time I had the pleasure to be sitting next to the owner BUT all the attention of the staff at the bar were on him vs the other guests (meaning myself). That same night I unfortunately had the lobster dish with tarragon that I did not enjoy it just because there was way too much tarragon and I never knew that I wasn't fond of it. So I made it a point to the bartender that I really didn't like it and she just procedded to say ill wrap it for you. So obviously I was still hungry so I had to order something Â else besides the item I didn't enjoy. If that's not enough on this visit I just made I was 15 minutes early to opening and I had the hostess tell me they were still closed until 5pm, instead of offering to have me sit and wait at the bar I went and waited in my car approximately 2 mins before I realized there are a bunch of other restaurants that would want my business. Keep in mind I have been there early on other occasions and was allowed to sit and even have a glass of wine until "officially" open. Not going to lie food for the most part is awesome but the service these last couple of times doesn't was very disappointing.
