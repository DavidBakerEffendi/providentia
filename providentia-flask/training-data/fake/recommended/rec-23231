I really wanted to love this place, given the reviews I've heard of it, but I didn't. The space is quaint and I do like being able to watch the chefs plate the food, and the food is good but it's not worth the $38-40 a dish price tag. Perhaps it's better for a couple, but our party of 5 waited for 1.5 hours to get our meal. If you're going to seat 5 people you should be able to serve 5 people in a timely manner. The 2 tops all around us were being served and finishing even before we got our meal- despite them arriving after us. We waited a long time for apps and there was very little communication from the wait staff except when she brought the appetizer out- they did comp that but then we waited another 30-45 minutes for our main course. I absolutely regret the decision to spend that amount of money here. We could have created a much better meal at home with that amount and it would've been warm. I was so disappointed. On top of it all 2 of the 5 people had some major gastrointestinal distress throughout the night from it. Â Everyone has a bad night, but it hurts more when the price tag is Sooo high. I wouldn't mind so much if the dishes were $20 each- but I expect a lot more for $40 a plate.
