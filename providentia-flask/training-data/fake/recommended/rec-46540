Great new SoHo spot where Country Cafe used to be... They've redone the space and it's adorable. I can't totally determine whether you'd call Vin et Fleur a wine bar or a restaurant. They have an all-French wine list of interesting picks, as well as a short French menu. We had the endive salad, mussels, and chicken paillard. Everything was delicious! A couple of complaints... Our waitress didn't have any suggestions about the wine list, and either the A/C wasn't on or perhaps they don't have A/C... it's very warm in there! Regardless, I'll be back when it cools down outside for amazing Frenchified eats at a reasonable price. SO much better than Cafe Felix down the street.
