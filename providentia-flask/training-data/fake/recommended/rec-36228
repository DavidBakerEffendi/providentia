Another great breakfast suggestion from JW.  I needed something light because of a lunch reservation only a couple of hours away.  I sat at the bar and ordered a cafe au lait, a soft-boiled organic egg with "soldiers" and a homemade donut.  That tide me over without making me feel stuffed! And I got a matchbox AND postcards from Balthazar.
