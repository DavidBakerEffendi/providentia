First off, I agree with several others that it is refreshing to have a bruncherie that is open past 3pm on a Sunday.  The fact that you can get terrific mimosa is an added bonus.   I had the farmers platter, which consisted of an assortment of local cheeses, my favorite was fat cat, a brie like cheese with a subtle goat cheese flavor.  It was served with apple, house made meats, olives and nuts.  The combination was a good one.  I wished they would sub in toast and jam for the pate, since I am not really a fan - but you can't have it all. My husband had the ham and Gruyere omlette with house roasted potatoes - perfectly proportioned and cooked, not overly cheesy, and the potatoes melted in your mouth. To cleanse our sweet tooth's, we ended with a mint ice cream sandwich.  Perfectly creamy and naturally minty house made mint ice cream, nestled between two minty square chocolate cookies will have me coming back for their ice cream until I am too fat to fit through their door. I will definitely venture out for the dinner menu, their selection of old fashioned drinks was impressive.  Go right now.
