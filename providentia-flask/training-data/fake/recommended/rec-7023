My fiance and I had an impromptu date night in Williamsburg and happened upon this amazing spot. I'm not even sure where to begin. The decor is quaint and sweet. I later found out that John, one of the owners was responsible for the beautiful paintings. His wife, Treva(hope I'm not misspelling her name), the other owner and executive chef, was our server. She was great at recommending dishes for us and overall had such a pleasant disposition. The food was great and there are so many more things we plan to try the next time we go back. If you have a sweet tooth, the hummingbird cake and biscuit bread pudding are a MUST! John, Treva and their staff are a huge part of what make this place so great. You clearly see their passion and investment into cooking great food and creating a welcoming environment for all their patrons. Please check out this place if you want a filling-feel-good time!
