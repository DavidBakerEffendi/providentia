I used to think Applewood was the top brunch spot in Park Slope, but the last few times I went the servers seemed overwhelmed and angry. Our waitress slammed my drink down so hard I was afraid to look at her! It seems ironic, but as the number of customers has decreased and the wait time to get into Applewood for brunch has gone down, so has the quality of the service. I know it's hard to maintain a good restaurant experience over several years, but I miss the old place. Also, the last time I was there, the bacon was overcooked.
