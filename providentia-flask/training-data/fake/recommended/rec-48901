Traif was full so my friends and I were referred to Xixa a couple doors down. It was interesting because we were requested to order everything together at the beginning of the meal so the chef could determine the correct progression of the dishes. Each dish had a unique twist on the typical. We started with a complimentary amuse bouche -- "snap pea tacos" : a sugar snap pea chopped in 3 wedged with a mini cheese wafer. Of the dishes ordered, the most memorable were the thai curry esquites and steak tacos with bone marrow and steak tartar. Main drawback of the restaurant was the high price for the small dishes (aka not good for the hungry).
