I took my distance away from Blue Ribbon into account when I was looking for an apartment near the Slope.   The oysters are amazing (taste so fresh I think I wondered into Acme in NOLA). The skate wing with bacon and potatoes could go down as my desert island meal.  The beef filet with fresh herbs is also an outstanding dish, reminds me alot of the Vietnamese Bo Lu Lac without the teriyaki sauce.  Definitely look forward to sampling the rest of the menu, well if I can keep myself from ordering the skate wing again. Would definitely recommend coming early evening or late night on weekends to avoid the (c)rush.
