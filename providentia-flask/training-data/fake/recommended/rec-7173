Me and my friend went here after work. He passed by this place time and time again, finally he wanted to try this place out. Happy to say was well worth it. This place has a great atmosphere. The staff was very kind and to finally get to the good stuff the food was fantastic. Â Would definitely go back again. If you yelpers out there are reading this and are in the city definitely hit this place up, you won't be sorry.
