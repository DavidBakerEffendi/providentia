1.5 Stars. It's one of those places that you always want to go because your friends have raved about it and you're convinced by the 600+ yelp reviews with a solid 4-star rating that it must be amazing. So you go there with high expectations only to be sorely disappointed. Basically... -small portions -most dishes were overly salty -overpriced -unoriginal Nothing is really memorable except the shaved foie gras, which is okay but not worth coming back for considering how the rest of the menu is so lacking. Everything is just so-so. I remember feeling almost angry at the end of my meal because it was such a letdown, betrayed by yelpers and my friends. I would not return and object if my friends suggest eating here. I am that upset! If you want tapas, bring your money to Brooklyn and eat at Traif!
