Crazy Greek is the perfect spot for that all night party crash, an early morning stop in or just a casual bite. Open extra early, closing early too, they offer a classic dive menu with a little more and exceptionally fast service. They brought my food out before I even finished this review! I would highly suggest it if you happen to wake up early and find yourself hungry with no urge to cook or anyone leavin the club or lovers house extra late to stop in. Now I have to eat!!
