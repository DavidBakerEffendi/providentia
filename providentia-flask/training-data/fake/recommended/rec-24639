Definitely one of the best places in the Hill. Their food always tastes fresh & clean, and the space itself is very cute, although it tends to get very loud when it's full. I know everyone comes for brunch, but their dinner menu is really nice too. My favorite is the "When Veggie Met Sally" salad, which is a salad with goat cheese and a veggie burger on top (although I'd like to call it "When Harry Met Salad"... but that's another story). As far as brunch goes, everything is delicious, but here's a tip - if you live nearby, call & place an order, and take it home! Definitely beats waiting 2 hours for a table! :-)
