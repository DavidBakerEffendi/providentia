Wow, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The service was impeccable: our waiter was attentive, able to meet all of our dietary needs (One girl in our group couldn't have anything with dairy and I am super picky about my food). He didn't bat an eye and was able to substitute foods and ask for food to be specially prepared in order to make us happy. The food itself was delicious but the desserts were the highlight of our evening. My friend is friends with the pastry chef and so we got to sample the entire dessert menu. Imagine five girls at a table full of desserts making lots of moaning noises! I loved the mint ice cream the best but they switch up their menus frequently
