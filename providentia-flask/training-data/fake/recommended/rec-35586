We enjoy good Spanish food, especially tapas.  While visiting Philly we happened upon Tinto while browsing Yelp's suggestions and decided to give it a try tonight.  We (there were 3 of us) were glad we did.  We managed to order and sample a good number of items on the menu and were pleased with all our choices.  The moules basquaise,  pulpo, patatas asturianas and the wild mushrooms were our personal favorites.  The desserts were excellent as well.  The individual dishes were imaginatively presented.  The ambience of the dining room was congenial and not noisy, and no muzak.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  Prices were fair.   Tinto is definitely worth repeat visits.
