I like the staff here.  They use Amy's Bread for their sandwiches which have nice fresh ingredients.  La Panineria offers a small portion size that feels right for a light lunch but I always feel like they are a bit cheap on the meat and cheese.  Also paying the same $10 for ciabatta sandwich plus soda vs. just a panini without a soda is a little frustrating for those who don't want a drink.  I enjoy supporting independent spots like this but I would be feeling the love a lot more if they had a few more slices in those $10 sandwiches.
