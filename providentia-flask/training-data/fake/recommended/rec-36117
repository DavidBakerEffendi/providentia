Shit it's 11:30 Pm and you find yourself in the east village with your peeps and are sh--faced or on your way there :) Pommes Frites to the rescue. Hopefully you worked out before and dont have high cholesterol because this is not likely to help you especially when your hun over self orders the large fries and one of the 20 plus dips that are there. If this is what Belgium offers I must visit soon. A note to previous reviews- Hey order the fries and walk in the street wih you and your sauce...unless its Â  24 below outside. Just a thought Apparently they have poutine as well now which is another way to kill me. Does anyone know the nearest hospital to this place. Since I dont know any better I will be here on my next visit which will probably go like my last visit. AWESOME AND TASTY
