They are back after renovation. The food is great. For the starter, karage (fried chicken), super tender and juicy. If you like pork katsu, you will have to try their berkshire pork. Not like the regular pork, it is incredibly juicy. The oyakudon is authentic also. Only down side is the temperature control. Feel kinda hot after you have the donkatsu...
