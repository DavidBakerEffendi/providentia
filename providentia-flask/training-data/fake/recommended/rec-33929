I've been wanting to eat here for a while now and after dining at Do or Dine the other night, I truly hate myself for not doing and dining here months ago.   I sat at the bar and ordered the nippon nachos and the duck.  I thanked the bartender for recommending the duck and told him that my palette will never be the same.  I'm pretty sure this is a regular thing for first timers here.  Also, the bartender was awesome.   Also had a sphergerita shot which was definitely the weirdest shot I've ever had in a good way.  Drink this! This is now my favorite place to eat in Brooklyn.
