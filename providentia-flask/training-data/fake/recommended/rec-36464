As I see Balthazar has stellar reviews, I just wanted to throw my three cents in. We had a party of nine people, who were all in the mood to eat. We tried just about everything on the appetizer menu. I was really pleased with the bone marrow, and the nettles raviolis. The one exception was the risotto which was not creamy, the flavor was nice, but I don't care for crunchy risotto. The pork belly was amazing! The service was great! I'll be back!
