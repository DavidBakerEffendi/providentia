I went here with a friend for dinner last night. It is actually quite spacious inside so I can't imagine getting a table is ever very difficult. We shared the Matador platter which was a ton of delicious food including the Chicken Pio. We also ordered a large pitcher of Sangria. The large wasn't so large but it was delicious. The service was great, the food came out very quickly and was absolutely delicious. I look forward to coming here again.
