4.5 stars.  I went here all the time in college.  I happened to be in Philly recently and was staying at the Double Tree, conveniently located right next to one of my favorite old slice joints.  Sure, you need to bring a few paper towels to soak down the mountain of grease, but it is worth it as it is so very good (the pizza, not your grease-soaked paper towels).  Also, really good cheesesteaks in a city clogged to the gills with 'em.
