Excellent place, great place to share plates, although beware some plates are very small but their price may not reflect that. Spicy rice cakes is a good plate to share and the pork buns are amazing. Definately get one or two for your self. Menu changes often, so good place that you may not get bored with. Milk bar is next store and has great cookies.
