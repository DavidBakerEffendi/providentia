Been here twice and all I can say is inconsistent. First time I was here was on a packed Saturday night and even at 11 pm a table for 3 was about a 40 min wait. I really enjoyed most of what we ordered, the wings and the sweetheart deal. I tried the honey BBQ and wango tango wings which were both amazing. I loved the sauces however if you're a real fan of spicy I think wango tango is incorrectly labeled, it is definitely more mild than hot. We ordered the pulled pork sliders which I didn't love and have had better in other place in the city. The ribs were great, the meat was moist and fell off the bone. Also I thought the mac and cheese was one of the best I've had. The second time I came back was a different story. I had the wings again which were still good. Skip the Dino poutine because there was barely any cheese on those fries, one crumble to be exact and the gravy was not good. This time the ribs I ordered were dry and tough and I was extremely disappointed and the mac and cheese was just standard. I don't know if it was an off night for them but I no longer think it's worth making the trip into Brooklyn for it.
