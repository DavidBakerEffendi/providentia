My honey and I loooove us some baila latina.  We've been working our way around the NJ/NYC latin clubs/clubs that have latin nights for the last 6 months.  Since FINDING these damn spots is so difficult I decided to review a few because so few of the yelpnation are. grr. This place is in a SUPER sketch area of Newark. But there is a parking lot with an attendant more or less across the street and the poor freezing man will watch your car, which is nice. So....you may ask, why, Leah M, why would you go here to dance when it is mostly populated by people your mother's age? Well, I would answer, because people my mother's age know how to to DANCE! And dance without drama. Plus there are plenty of tables so you can drop your coat, sit and have a drink and chill between sets.  Drinks are not expensive, cover charge is reasonable, dance area is spacious enough, there is always room to dance. The music is sortof hilarious, but it works. They have singers and live percussion playing over recorded music, so you hear all the hits (mostly merengue, bachata, salsa and cumbia) but also they bring out a dj once in awhile for some reggaeton and pop.  So it's a mix of everything. And everyone clears the dance floor between songs which is weird, maybe this is a cultural thing I am not accustomed to? They serve food, lots of people seem to have bday parties here, and very few whiteys like meself come here. But it's fun, and since my honey and I have fun wherever we go, this place is a laid back, less expensive option when we wanna dance but cannot summon the energy to do a big fancy spot.
