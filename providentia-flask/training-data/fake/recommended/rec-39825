What has become of the Lower East Side? I am proud to say, some really great food. This is a small place in the LES with both indoor and outdoor seating, right across the street from Tompkins Square Park. And what a nice little place indeed. I ordered the carrasco, basic steak and potatoes, but both were great and very flavorful. I also had some of my BF's paella valenciana, wow!! That was yummy! Different seafood, including shrimp, mussels, and clams, served on a kettle-looking plate. I think I ate more of it than she did! Mojitos were excellent and strong. We also had a round of lemon shots, just as good. All in all, this place was awesome. Great food, comfy ambiance, and yummy drinks. Will go again!
