First: the bread basket. Comes with vanilla butter, orange marmalade & strawberry marmalade (which they make themselves, of course). Delicious cheddar & rosemary scone, marvelous warm pear muffin and, my favorite: the BRIOCHE. Boy they know how to make brioche there. And I am a big fan of brioche. T he only thing I wished was that they didn't toast it - it's even better when it's warm and tender. Baguette was ok (but I won't go there - I gave up on finding fresh and crispy baguette elsewhere than in France - I am snob this way). Then came the egg sandwich. A delish. The stars there were clearly the bun and the egg. Again, the bun (brioche - again, they make their own) was perfect: sweet but not so much as it would overpower the other ingredients. It might seem odd to list the egg as the star there - but believe me, it was. And for two reasons:   1. It tasted like an egg. What? You don't understand? Well, try to remember the taste of the last egg you ate. You don't remember? Well, I guess that's normal, because egg don't taste like anything these days. I hate to play the "it was so much better before" card, but it's true. And this egg TASTED like egg, and for this, Get Fresh, I am eternally grateful.   2. And - it was cooked to perfection: it was poached, the white was white (and not transparent) as it should be - and the yellow was runny - as it should be. More on oeufmayo.wordpress.com
