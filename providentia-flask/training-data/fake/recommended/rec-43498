I have passed by here several times and never went it. Stopped by today, it's a great place for a cheap lunch, the food is made to order so expect about a 5 min wait but the food is good. The place seats about 25 people so plenty of space to hang out. Owners are friendly and attentive. The owner told me "If the customers are happy, I am happy" and for that, I will come back here.
