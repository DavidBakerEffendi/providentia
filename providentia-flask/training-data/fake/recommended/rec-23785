Good barbecue is hard to come by in the Northeast, but luckily this void is filled by Percy Street Barbecue.  I stopped by for lunch today and instantly loved the vibe that the eating establishment gave off.  The number of delicious options on the menu was overwhelming, but with the help of our waiter, I ordered the honeycrisp apple salad and sliced brisket sandwich.  The salad was very unique but tasty.  Now to the sandwich: I have had some incredible barbecue meals in my lifetime (including at the world-famous Salt Lick in Texas) and Percy Street Barbecue's take on the brisket sandwich blew my bangs back.  The combination of the sweet barbecue sauce, melted cheddar, green tomatoes, and perfectly cooked brisket took my tastebuds on a very enjoyable ride to Tastyville.  If you are ever craving barbecue and in the City of Brotherly Love, do yourself a favor and head on over to Percy Street Barbecue.
