First of all, I'm big on brunch and breakfast! LOVED this place! The concept is just great, easy laid back environment. You order at the counter, grab your seats and dine away. I had the French toast with mix fruits and it was worth every calorie! Delicious! Oh and if you're a fan of raspberry tea, try it here...it's delicious (it comes unsweetened but just add some sugar), the drink cones with a ton of real raspberries mixed in! I'll def come back here!
