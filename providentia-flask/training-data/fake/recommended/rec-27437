I went with my boyfriend on  a Friday night at around... 8 is my guess, I can't remember. We waited for about 10 minutes which was perfect to look over their tough menu (what do I choose?! All looks amazing!). Our waiter was named Lightening (seriously) and we both agreed he was the best waiter we had had in months.   *Popcorn with bacon grease (or something bacon) instead of bread - awesome *Oxtail terrine - amazing I honestly can't remember what else we had. We were going to go a different route and our waiter took the time to describe what he thought were good pairings so we went with his advice (he actually advised to reduce our order by one meal) and his recommendations were perfect.   Can't remember what beers we had but they were all from NY state and not common beers to find in a restaurant (at least our picks weren't). It was fairly priced for how delicious it was, but it was a special occasion kind of meal.  One of the best I've had in NYC. So So delicious! The decor is nothing - pretty cheesy actually - but  who cares when you can have bacon flavored popcorn and a waiter named lightening.
