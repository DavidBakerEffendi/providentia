Perfect. Not just the food but the dining experience. Wanted to enjoy an evening of quality food and some nice drinks and Open Door exceeded all expectations. Cheese plate-amazing. Fish Tacos-Superb. Pumpkin tart- WOW. We ordered incrementally and the food was always quick and fresh. Nick and Gerard were fantastic and topped off the experience. Also try Tuesdays for Half off Bottles of wine on a very competent list.
