I'd like to think that maybe there are other better options to get there - so i'm giving this place a 1 star - with the anticipation that on my next visit, it will be better. Cons: - bacon definitely pre-cooked, and not crispy. It was like eating bacon jerky, that was not even warm. - The Swedes would probably be disappointed with this restaurants interpretation of Swedish pancakes. It was overcooked with burnt edges, and stacked on top of each other like a conventional pancake. They were not presented rolled, or quarter folded as one would have expected. Instead, the 'Swedish' pancakes were practically fall over off of the undersized plate. - Lingonberry - did not taste like lingonberry, instead it tasted like strawberry jam. Pro: - i'll save this for my next visit, hopefully there are some to share...
