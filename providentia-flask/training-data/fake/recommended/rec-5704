First, the best and most extensive (and varied by many brewers) local beer list in this area.   And a great bar with super friendly bar tenders and very attentive service.    We came here for a show, and not only was the band & venue great, everything else was excellent too including the food.   We had the cheeseburger and house special sautéed scallops.    Both were over the top delicious.  I'll be back soon.
