Delicious food. Great service. Festive New Orleans inspired decor. Was so happy to have found this little gem in Staten Island. Has the sweet potato fritters- incredible. Tried crawfish for the first time as both an appetizer and in my main (crawfish étouffée ) both were solid. My boyfriend got the ribs with corn bread and was thrilled. For dessert we had the chocolate banana bread pudding (solid, but not the best I've had) and the fried cheesecake (which was a revelation.) Definitely intend to pay another visit for their jazz nights for drinks and appetizers!
