This place is great! I've been here about 8 times. 8 out of 7 the services and staff was great! But for that once they deserves 3 star... there was not that many customers that day/time and all of the staff was busy talking to each other while I was trying to get their attention for a cup of water... and we asked for our bill and it took forever.. I mean forever... because they were busy talking... I mean I like the food and everything but seriously the staffs should pay more attention to the customers!
