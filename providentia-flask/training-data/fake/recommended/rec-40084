I could very well see myself here any and every night of the week.  In fact, when my friends tried to pull a relocation move after a few hours, I gave a slight protest.  Slight only due to the fact that I had, um, been enjoying their liquid selections so much.  My Antonia on draft, hellooooo.  The main bar also serves mixed drinks, bottled beers and wine. Between our large group, we ate through the whole menu.  I took bites of everything and had no qualms.  We were lucky to score two tables together, things really started getting packed.  My advice is to arrive early and pace yourself.  Setting your own stride is easy, especially since it's up to you to place your orders at one of three counters. If sitting on a bench, eating and drinking doesn't sound entertaining enough, Frankford Hall also provides a few decks of cards, generic Jenga and other distractions.  I was quite content sitting, sipping and soaking in the gorgeous fresh air.
