Live within walking distance & I've only been here twice. Shame on me.. Coffee was great one morning I stopped.. For dinner the second time I had the Sonoma sandwich, which was turkey, ham, roast beef with cole slaw and Russian dressing. It was so filling and delicious. Huge sandwich too. Also tried the beef empanada which they warmed up for me. It was flaky and good. Very friendly staff.. A few friends also recommend the Thanksgiving sandwich, which I will try next time.
