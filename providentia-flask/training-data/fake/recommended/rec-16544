I am slightly obsessed with this place! Came in for an impromptu dinner with my previously-referenced foodie sidekick/roommate/best friend to commemorate our big move over to the West Village from Alphabet City and our speedy recovery from the culture shock (if you think I'm exaggerating, you haven't spent much time east of Ave A). We started with a half dozen oysters and then had the peach salad special with honey bacon vinaigrette--it was so incredible that I'm still thinking about it today. The cheese plate was on point and Pimm's Cup and G&T were fantastic. I love the woodsy-yet-classy atmosphere in the bar area, which was pleasantly packed with beautiful people around 10:30pm. Since I now reside in the neighborhood, I will definitely be back very soon to enjoy the G&Ts and the notably cool crowd.
