I usually love Pei Wei but I don't understand this location. The food is a hit or miss. There is never a crowd here but right next door the line to chipotle is out the door. The locations in cherry hill and moorestown are great. I don't understand why this group is subpar :/ I usually end up here bc chipotle is too busy. The fried rice I had today was burned and had pieces of burnt stove debris. The extra veggies I asked for were hard and didn't appear to be cooked with the rice. The fortune cookie was good..... It's sad bc the restaurant is really nice inside Â and should be rumbling with business. I have had a nice meal here before. Maybe Sunday evenings are just slow? It doesn't really have the energy other locations have. I think with a little help from a DM, a few promotions it could be a better experience. I may still come here for light meals but not on the top of the list for food choices in this area.
