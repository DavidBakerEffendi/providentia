I am close to a 5 on this. Any restaurant where you have to practically roll me out the door means i enjoyed my meal. The ceviche scallop special, the smoked fish appetizer and the chocolate pot o' creaminess served my taste buds well. My friends had the rib sando and the pork belly sando - $8 each...can't' go wrong with that price. Also, my natural reaction to beets is to gag. I don't know why I felt compelled to see my reaction to the beet and goat cheese salad, but enough is said that i finished the last bite before the plate was cleared. gag-free. The South Side cucumber gin drink was tasty and refreshing, but did not seem that strong. It was the drinks that raised the bill, but the food was damn good.
