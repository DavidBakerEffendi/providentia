We recently went to the Inn at Weathersfield for my sister's 30th birthday. Thanks to the kind hospitality of the staff, we felt right at home from the start. Everything from our quaint rooms to the exquisite dinner were right on spot. Would definitely recommend for family get-togethers. Also a dog boarding service just down the road called Willow Farm that was really convenient for us.
