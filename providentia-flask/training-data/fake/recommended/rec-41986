Incredibly SALTY food. Each and every course. In a party of about 10, at least 4 of us at the table could not even finish our entrees - which were all different. Due to the zeal of our guest of honor, who unabashedly LOVES the place (and we did not want to hurt her feelings), we felt uncomfortable complaining and instead just quietly set down our forks. Worth a second try, because it really is a delightful place ... but NEXT time I will be sending the food back.
