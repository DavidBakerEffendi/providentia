I have now been there twice.  I like Sabrina's.  The food is good, some dishes are better then others.  I find that the pancakes are bland, but the special breakfast sandwiches are very good.  The wait is too long for what you get, but if you have never been I would suggest giving the wait a go.  The service was friendly on one trip and uptight the other visit.  Nice atmosphere for brunch.  Bottom line- I am sure I will be back and I would recommend that others go.
