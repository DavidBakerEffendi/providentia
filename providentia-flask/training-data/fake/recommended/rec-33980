The crust on this pizza is amazing.  Baked so hot that it blisters and blackens before it even has a chance to brown, it is chewy an crisp but still delicate and doughy.  We had the Artichoke and Pancetta pizza with garlic and olive oil.  No tomato sauce but we didn't miss it. Also, the staff was awesome, even though we might not have been the least annoying customers.
