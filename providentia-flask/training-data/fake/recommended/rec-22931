Went Saturday night, cool looking place, modern, different for Ironbound. food tasted good, excellent presentation. portions not too large, but prices not bad, so was worth it. wasn't too impressed with the sangria. was more like fruit punch, not wine. 2 people split a large pitcher, and neither felt even a buzz. overall, would recommend for a nice, quick meal in a comfy, modern environment.
