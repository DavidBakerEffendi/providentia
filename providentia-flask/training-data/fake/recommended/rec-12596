Amazing food! Didn't think hipsters could do comfort food right, but by Jove, they've figured it out. Our waitress was super sweet as well. I had the Superbowl so I could sample some sides and all were delish. Burnt ends baked beans and collards were the standout for me. Mac n cheese was delicious but it's creamy and I prefer baked. My fianc√©e's pulled pork was definitely a life changer, according to him. Will be back soon!
