I had heard from a friend that this place was overpriced and not too good so I'd stayed away, but I had a craving and it was close so I said, what the heck, I'll give it a try. I was very, very impressed. I know Japanese food and Sushi quite well. I have lots of experience with it and have eaten some of the best examples of it. This place, while not the best ever, was very serviceable. What it isn't is creative but that's ok with me. The dishes are quite traditional (Negimaki, Rock Shrimp Tempora, etc.) but very well made. I started with the Miso and it was served perfectly (piping hot like the tea was). Next up was the Negimaki which was served with a nice pickled side that added some nice flavor to the perfectly seared meat. I then tried the O-Toro (not the best, but quite good) and had some Nigiri and a few maki rolls. The rolls weren't very impressively prepared (knive/presentation wise) but tasted great. The Nigiri however was made of very high quality fish and I was pleasantly surprised since this wasn't a very traditional looking sushi place. Overall, I really liked this place. I will go again as long as it's consistent.
