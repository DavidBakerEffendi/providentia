The first time I went to Soco I was underwhelmed. I was totally disappointed with the food. I'm not even sure why I returned. But I'm glad I did!!! Soco redeemed themselves in every way! The food and drinks were fantastic. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese. The food came out piping hot and fresh. The first time around the chicken was bland. Not this time. The chicken was very tasty without being too salty. The waffles were fluffy and tasted better than ordinary Eggo waffles but not as sweet as a piece of red velvet cake. They were perfect this time around! The mac n cheese is a little pricey for a side ($9) but it was soooo worth it! And the portion is big enough to share. My cocktail of the night was the peach cobbler. I wanted another but I was afraid I wouldn't finish my food! It was really good. I'm so happy Soco stepped their game up. Can't wait to return!
