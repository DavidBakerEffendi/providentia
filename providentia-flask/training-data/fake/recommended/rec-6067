Had dinner here last night.  Went for the shepherd's pie... well, they didn't have it on the menu.  What da... So I chose to order pork chops instead as a consolation pick.  That was by far the best pork chops in the world!  Gave my friend a bite and she told me that was the best pork chop she has had at a restaurant.  Y'all simply must try it! Then it got better.  Yeah, it got better.  My friend and I had 3 drinks each.  They were all very good - not cheap but the taste and alcohol volume were worth it.  The most memorable drink was Kith & Kin, which was some sort of cucumber cocktail.  The first couple of sips sucked!  It was too fizzy and couldn't taste anything but soda water.  I decided to give it a stir and it did the trick.  Kith & Kin (after giving an extra stir... I am a genius!) should be the measuring stick for any cucumber cocktail drinks!   The decor was a little too dim for me but forget that... go for the food... go for the drinks.  Not cheap but worth the price.
