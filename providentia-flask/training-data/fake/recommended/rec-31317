We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and for the price, it was really tiny; order something else. We had a party of about 9 and we opted to stay and drink instead of heading to a bar. It was a great decision as the music was good but not blaring and we were already seated to drink the rest of the Â night away. Drink prices were reasonably priced and tasty.
