The wait staff and food were fantastic!  My mom and I stumbled upon Benito and had dinner here last night.  I can not say enough good things about it.  The food was delicious - I had homemade ravioli and my mom had a pizza with fresh mozzarella that had a great flavor.  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful they even allowed me to taste wine before I committed to a glass.  Make sure to look at the pictures and memorabilia hanging around the restaurant and if you are lucky enough the staff will tell you about their family in the pictures :)
