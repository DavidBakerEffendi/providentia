Solid place - good meat items with a decent amount of non bbq items. Highly recommend the chicken wings, sausage, and the sirloin.  Never eaten at the restaurant, just takeout only but the place looks decent.   I like the fact that they charge by weight so you can really control cost and amount of food. I recall it was like $9 per pound.
