Thank Goodness for the Groupon discount! Still spent additional $100 on top of the $70 for $120 deal. I'll tip my hat off to their freshness. The Hamachi melts in yo mouf! Although their sushi is fresh, Zento is quite too expensive for their serving sizes. $8 for a hand roll that you can devour in a single bite is ridiculous. Oh. Don't get the Ramen. I was just curious toward the end of my meal, and you really just need to order the sushi! The ramen noodles were too thin to be ramen, and the broth was more on the salty side for my palette. Also, appetizer Calamari was also too breaded! Not enjoyable.
