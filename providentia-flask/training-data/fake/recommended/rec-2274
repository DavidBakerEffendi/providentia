We love Geno's.  I've been taking my son before or after Phillies games for 10 years.  We always look for a reason to stop by.   Most folks think the chipped beef from a freezer make a steak sandwich.  The real slices of meat on this sandwich are what it is all about.   If you come to Philly, stop a Geno's.
