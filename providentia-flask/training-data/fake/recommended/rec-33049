Tasteless, greasy, dirty and disgusting. Starting with the Chicken Tikka Masala, it was almost totally devoid of any discernible flavor. It was greasy and tasted like the base was watered down Ragu vodka sauce. I don't know if the chef is guilty of negligence or may just be an untrained child cooking for the first time. So very disappointing that the most popular dish served on the planet could be made so terribly badly. The Chicken Karahi was greasy and had chunks of unidentifiable things suspended in the flavorless sauce.  After eating this, my stomach feels like i had very spicy Vindaloo or a bucket of Brick Lane's Phall. ( I wish I had one of those, at least i would know why my stomach is burning ) The cutlery looked like someone spit on it and wiped if off on their dirty apron. Streaks of filth down the knife blades, and this was on all 4 knives on the table.   The servers were in serious need of a bath and deodorant. Truly disgusting. The floor in the restaurant was full of filth.  I was sorry that is was a sunny day, because the shades were open, and the floor, cutlery and horrendous food were all enough to make anyone sick. Perhaps if i had spent 30 years at sea, in mostly stormy conditions, fishing stink fish from the bottom of sewer water, then, maybe i could stomach the food at this place. Then again, probably not. How could anyone could give this joint 3, 4 or 5 stars?  Were they completely and totally intoxicated, did they order extra spicy Vindaloo, do they smoke five packs of low grade cigarettes a day, or maybe they had their sense of taste destroyed by fast food or an accident at a chemical plant?   For anyone who likes food to be at least edible, stay away from this place and it's low grade dog food.
