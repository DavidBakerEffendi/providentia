I've been here twice so far, most recently for a birthday night out. I picked Eulogy because of their beer selection and mussels. On a Saturday night we were able to get a table for 4 in the bar section as soon as we walked in although this was just because of good timing. There were plenty of people standing around but another table cleared up a few minutes after we entered. This table was near the door and would get a draft anytime someone entered the bar. The reason to come here is for the beer selection. They carry just about anything you would want and have a very unique tap selection. Eulogy still carries major domestic brands as well but makes you pay quite a bit for them. My brother was appropriately made fun of by the waitress when he ordered Miller Lite, although all in good fun. They pride themselves on the beer selection and aren't afraid to tell you about your horrible taste in crappy beer. Some people think they are too stuck up though, be warned. Sometimes the beer can take a while to get to the table but on a busy night it was understandable even if it wasn't great. It didn't take longer then 5 minutes at any point but this was before eating so I didn't have anything else to drink or eat while waiting. You may want to order a new drink keeping that in mind. I shared a 2lb pot of beer mussels with a friend as well. They have quite a few ways of preparation but I've never ventured into the other styles. My brother ordered the Sausage Trio with what I believe included at least veal and venison. The sausage was amazingly delicious. Don't go in expecting something like Italian sausage though, it's nothing like that. Besides how crowded it can get on a Saturday night and the resulting time between beers there isn't anything wrong with Eulogy.
