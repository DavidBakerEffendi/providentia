Been coming here with family and friends for many years. Last place in the area for German Food. Check out the "Game Menu" when in season. All of the German Specialties are good and tastes best with a glass of German Reisling wine. The fresh hot rolls are addictive. The deserts are good and I recommend the Apple Strudel. Heintz and his son Michael do a great job keeping their customers satisfied. The Heintz burger is a good option if you want just a burger and a beer. Diane is the best server in the place. They also have a private room for parties up to 20 people.
