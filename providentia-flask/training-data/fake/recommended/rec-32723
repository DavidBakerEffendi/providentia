Rudy's is a place you have to have patience with. it's busy. students like it. their staff gets busy. busy places are busy for a reason. because they have consistently good food (chicken sandwich, mushroom flat bread), rotating beers, cheap well and a good selection of better than well spirits. I love the every other Saturday hip hop dj. it is what it is. but if you like it. you like it.
