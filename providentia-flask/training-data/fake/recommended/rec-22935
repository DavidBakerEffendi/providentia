Baker & Co is a cute new Italian joint in the West Village. We came here for brunch and had a good time. There's a good amount of inside seating (we sat right by the door/window overlooking Bleecker) but there's also a back patio if you want more of an al fresco dining experience. Food is good and huge portions. We had the Baker's Mac & Cheese (cacio e pepe style) which was delicious but a bit too heavy for my usual liking. The bottom part was SO creamy I could only really get through the top layer, but it was definitely tasty. We also had the fritata with goat cheese, which was quite good but also huge. Basically, just come hungry, because the food is large and heavy. Unofficial tip: turn left when you exit and get a freh Italian ice from the Italian bakery down the block. Perfect way to complete your way.
