Stopped here after a trip to the Gorge. A standard pizza joint: pizza, beer, video games. We didn't expect much, but the pizza was surprisingly tasty. It passed the taste test from our picky eater kids. We're from NY, we eat a lot of pizza, not every one of our kids agree on pizza. Â They all liked this pizza. Deeper-dish crust, saucy, cheesy. A crowd pleaser for our whole family (ages 2,5 and 7). Plenty of seating. Standard fare, don't expect much more than fresh standard ingredients. I was glad to see the craft beers on tap and in bottles/cans. A bonus: great video games running on a quarter each. They have Double Dragon!
