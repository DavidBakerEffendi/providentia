I popped into this place by chance today while I was waiting for my bus and ordered some steak after getting a recommendation from the staff. It is a smaller restaurant so it may get packed at busier times but they also deliver and offer takeout. The food was delicious and the portions were quite large. I will likely be back here or ordering delivery from here in the near future.
