I had great dinner at Cookshop last week.  My reservation through Open Table never properly confirmed and the restaurant was packed when we arrived.  We explained what happened and they very kindly made an effort to seat our table of four in a very reasonable amount of time. The food selection is very interesting, I loved the snack menu. The portions are considerably large and the food well prepared.  This was my 2nd time there in about a year and I wonder what took me so long to return.  It was a very enjoyable eating experience.
