Starting off, I wouldn't expect that many Pho places in Burlington, VT... That being said, this place was alright. The Pho didn't come with jalapenos or bean sprouts or mint or cilantro or lime... strange... The waiter forgot to bring napkins about 5 times, also, no water refills... Anyway, the flavor of the soup was good and they did have sriracha, hoison, fish and soy sauce. They also had a selection of stir-frys which my lunch-mate ordered... The spring rolls were fresh and tasty... Anyway, good for New England/Vermont Pho. Bad for California Pho... You can try it, just don't expect the best.
