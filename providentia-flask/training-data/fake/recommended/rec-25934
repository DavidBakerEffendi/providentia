The food, as pictured below sits in open trays.  Fine, if you like it this way, but not for me.  The server, who is behind the counter, moves out and into dining area to reach this food.  So, at the minimum, the layout of store is wrong. Furthermore, the food seems to have a shelf life of over two days. Expect your food NOT to be fresh, when from the trays below.   I ordered a Tabbouleh salad, and there was more Cos-coos than parsley greens.   Also, the tzatziki sauce on another sandwich seemed completely watered down.   Not really exciting food.  To make things worse, the pita bread was under cooked. Sorry, because I love Turkish food, and all the things on the menu seem to make this place authentic.  Maybe I hit this place on an OFF DAY.   I hope.  Anyway, right now,  this restaurant has lots of room for improvement.   (1) change the layout, to make the food covered, and only accessible by the server. (2) change from a fast food restaurant, to a  "wait 10 minutes" restaurant.   (3) expect customers to be more PICKY about the food matching the photos.
