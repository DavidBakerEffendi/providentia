I have been here several times since it opened because I am so anxious to try the variety of dishes.  Absolutely the best pork chop around.  And the bacon wrapped halibut was amazing.  The new artichoke salad appetizer is my favorite along with the fig salad.  Great suprises from a small neighborhood bistro but will definitely keep going back.  Very comfortable atmosphere with a friendly welcoming staff who is very helpful.  This is a great BYOB place for dinner or lunch.  And I can never pass up on the homemade desserts.
