Rutt's Hut...it's a New Jersey original and must stop after any Giants game or trip to the city. The hotdogs are always great and beer is beer and the atmosphere can't be beat. Go after a game and watch the flood of locals to get the real experience. The old man behind bar has been there for about a hundred years and is about as old school as possible. The place is not classy but Â it's not supposed to be. The atmosphere is that of a great local bar with great bar food. The deep fried rippers are the real draw but all of the dineresque food is great. Make sure to get a side of chili for the dogs and you are all set.
