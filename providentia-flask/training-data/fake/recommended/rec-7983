The crepes here are so delicious! I personally tried three: Savory crepe: Coq Au Vin, Swiss cheese, herb butter: Pretty good and hearty Sweet crepes: Nutella, Banana, and Hazelnut Ice Cream: My favorite! I mean how can you go wrong with Nutella. White Chocolate, Dulce de Leche, and Toasted Almonds: My friend's creation, and very sweet. But still yummy. I'll be back!
