Pretty decent spot.  We stopped by yesterday for Octoberfest.  They had closed off the streets and for a solid 2-3 blocks it was pretty packed from noon onward. Lots of vendors were set up and they are pretty decently priced ($6 a beer, $4 for a good sized hot dog).  They have some ping pong tables and jenga set up inside and have a gorgeous open air area with heating lamps and fire pits during the fall where you can sit and mingle on a brisk night with the warmth of the fire.   They have a nice hard cider which is pretty good as well as the fire pits are a highlight but you better get there early to snag these coveted seats. Unfortunately, when you go home at night you will smell like you have sat around a campfire and will probably need to wash your clothes or at least air them out to get the smell out. Keep in mind you can't order food at the bar, you need to order at a separate window.  Perfect for big groups because there are large wooden picnic tables, benches and umbrellas outside. This place would be terrible however if it was raining as the inside area is not large at all.
