Tiny, cute, homey, free wi-fi, and a friendly Â accommodating staff made this place a go-to spot on my trip in New York. I think this will be my shortest review ever, but it's really because it's that good and that inexpensive that there doesn't need to be a long drawn out reason to go there. Just go!
