i really enjoyed this place. i went there for brunch Â today, it's very reasonably priced they have a $6 special on weekdays which includes 4 pcs toast, 2 eggs, homefries, OJ & a cappucino. WHATT?? how can you not love it. it's a little cramped and you'll probably have to wait at least 5 min. the waitress was very rude and not very attentive, that's my only complaint. the food is so goodd, OJ is amazing, best i've ever had and soo fresh. highly recommended!
