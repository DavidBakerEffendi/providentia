We went here twice. The restaurant itself is kept neat, and the food is flavorful. It hits the spot. The second occasion was when things got awkward. I chose the buffet which was rather underwhelming. Punctuating the experience, an employee scooping food items onto my plate and telling me how to eat them. Of course I was too polite to tell him I didn't require his help or advice. When I seated myself with my (his) plate, three employees kept staring at us while we ate. It is like they were waiting to see if Â I was going to vomit, because since I am a caucasian man I should be eating ham on whitebread and mayo or something. At a certain point in my meal, I felt waves of angst internally because I realized I hadn't finished my Medu Vada and recalled the foreboding sign hung at the buffet "DO NOT WASTE FOOD!" I forced the remains of my plate down so I could go back up there, free of the sign's wrath. Anyway. This place had some good vegetarian food. This place was also loaded to the brim with moments of discomfort and stress. All in all, a weird experience that I don't want to relive. P.S. be wary of "The Sign."
