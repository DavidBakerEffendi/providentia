One of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. If you're in the area, you definitely have to give it a try. We've always come in starving so we opt for the tasting menu. You can request certain dishes to be included, and what kind of foods to avoid. Here is a brief rundown of what we got: (please note that the menu is always changing) 1) Amuse-bouche: chilled mint and pea soup - very refreshing 2) Braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - the sliders are pretty tasty, but weren't anything unique. The fries with the aioli were addicting. 3) Pork belly - I have a slightly unhealthy obsession with pork belly. But their version blew my mind. It's so greasy, fatty and heavenly. 4) Corn risotto with scallops - Delicious, fantastic dish. Scallops seared to perfection. 5) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs - Very tender, the meat slides right off. The strawberries make it a cute dish. 6) Spicy bigeye tuna tartare on eggplant tempura - Amazing. I just can't. 7) Miso-glazed hamachi collar - this is the juiciest hamachi I've ever had. Â  8) Soft shell crab with avocado, pineapple, papaya - Hot, crispy, and delicious. Lastly, the bacon glazed donuts with cappuccino ice cream. I'm a big fan of salty+sweet combination, so this dessert hits the spot. Definitely will be back!
