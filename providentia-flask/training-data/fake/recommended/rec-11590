Everything about this place was great from the service to the food and ambience. It was too hot to sit outside, but the inside was just as great. They have a huge wine list (or should I say book), and a nice seasonal menu. The hospitality was impressive, the hostess had a cab come to pick us up at the door since the restaurant is tucked away.
