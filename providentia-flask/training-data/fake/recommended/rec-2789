Too bad we never were able to at least try out the restaurant as a coworker had recommended.  I was treated very unprofessionally by Mo.  Was booking a party of 40 for a Saturday night.  Was told 3 days after calling to make the reservation that we would be charged a minimum of $25 a person.  That was unacceptable 3 days later.  Needed to be told up front.  Didn't appreciate the over talking and yelling on the phone by Mo.  Had to cancel and find a more accommodating restaurant (which I did-Candela Restaurant).
