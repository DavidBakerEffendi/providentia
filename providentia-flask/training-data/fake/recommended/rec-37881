Food delicious, waitress helpful and attentive but the noise is horrendous!  Sat along the north wall in the middle of the dining space, and the diners around us were all SCREAMING to be heard by their companions - left with ringing ears.  This restaurant needs to do something about this or face a class action suit for hearing loss.  Only recommend if outdoor table is an option.
