Out of all the mexi joints I've hit in NYC - the Heights (which has a decent amount of Mexican places), the random trucks in the Burg and a few other places in Lower Manhattan, this is by far the best I've been to. Though, I haven't hit the other hyped places up in north Bk (haven't tried, Burro, Yola's, La Superior, New Mexico Place, etc.) I'm a Cali native (yes, another ubiquitous "I'm from Cali so I know what Mexican food is all about" review; but, that's the truth, ain't no jive ;)) ..anyways...This place is solid and stacks up with the best in Cali, from SD, to Santa Ana OC, to LA, to Mission St SF; these guys do it right (and better than many places in Cali) - spit roasted al pastor, rotisserie chx, high quality grilled carne asada (tender fatty ribeye or skirt to boot.. and a perfect med rare. Not even general Cali does that), and crisp Carnitas. I can easily rank this in my top 5 all time mexican restaurants among my favorite in Cali. All of this served in a non pretentious manner - simple, to the point, in a no-fuss space (as opposed to the majority of pre 2010 NY mexican joints that look like a girls gone wild cantina/bar or some cheesy bs sit-down fancy restaurant), this place does it right and focuses on food (like in Cali ..yes, I said it). I'm happy to see more and more legit mexican eateries opening up in NYC; vs the aforesaid old NY pseudo mexican food joints found in the past. PS: - one of their hot sauce bottles is labeled "Hella Hot" Â ...so I am guessing the owners might be from the SF Bay Area.. which would make sense given their deliciously legit food.
