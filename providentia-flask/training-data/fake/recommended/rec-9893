This place was everything that I was expecting and more!! Love the decor! The ambiance and the crowd. We waited by the bar for a table for two on a Saturday night for Approximately a 30 minute wait. We didn't mind the wait. I tried a coquito passion drink which was very fruity and delicious! Just right! The bartender was a bit slow making the drink but it was delicious! We got a table towards the back in the downstairs section. Loved it! We order empanadas de pollo for starters, delish!!! For the Main course we decided to share "el matador"  oh and we were so glad we did. Enough food to feed like 3 people. Delicious chicken, delicious Tostones with an amazing garlic sauce, amazing salchipapas! Yum!!! Even the salad was to die for! We also decide to try the sangria, oh and it didn't let us down! For dessert we had the tres leches cake. Very sweet, moist, ooh and the crispy caramelized  banana slices were Yummi! Overall pio pio is an amazing place! Portions are big so be hungry!! By the way, We loved the "bday song"!! I would love to go for my bday!! :)
