So glorious-great during the day, even better as a post-bar snack. A medium is pretty huge, and I've never had a bad batch of fries. The main highlight=THE SAUCES. I love the pesto mayo and the mango chutney, but if you aren't feeling too adventurous, the Dutch mayo is also delicious and goes perfectly with the fries. The only problem is that there isn't really anywhere to sit, so you have to take them with you to your next destination. If your next destination requires drunken stumbling, this can be an issue. The fry/sauce combo is so good that I've seen my friends pick up the fries that they dropped on the filthy streets of Manhattan(!) and eat them. I'm not saying I condone their behavior, but I definitely understand it.
