All I can say is AWESOME! This the third year I visit NYC and this restaurant and each meal seems better every time. The sake menu was overwhelming but I simply asked the wait staff to help me pick and was thrilled with her suggestion. We had the pork  belly, the tuna tartar, the beef cooked on hot stone, the sashimi appetizer and finished off with the sesame crime brûlée. It was all amazing.
