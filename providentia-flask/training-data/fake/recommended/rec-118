Went in for the first time yesterday and ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was awful, dripping in grease. My husband only made it through one slice, I ate 2 slices, didn't want to waste so we asked for the rest to go, but ended out throwing it all away when we got home. So sad. As well, the ambience left a lot to be desired. Our waitress had what looked to be slippers on her feet, and looked like she had rolled out of bed and shown up. We were the first customers of the day, but still .... Bummed out, as we were hoping for a better experience and a new local pizza place to enjoy. But not this place, unfortunately.
