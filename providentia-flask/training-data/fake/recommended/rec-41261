came in here for brunch today.  there was one bartender, and (i guess) one cook.  there was a backyard area where we took our drinks after giving our food order to the bartender.  backyard was adorable, and quirky and i would definitely come back for some happy hour drinks (i saw some great deals for happy hour and not a bad selection).   however, we ordered the garden bagel (no cooking required) and a breakfast sandwich.  it took over 30 minutes to get the food. now, if i wasnt on a schedule it wouldnt have mattered as much. or if i was trying to throw back 3 or 4 drinks before eating. but i was starving when i walked in.  granted, with the bartender doubling up as waiter host and barkeep, i had a feeling it would take awhile.  when the food finally came .. wasnt bad. wasnt great. pretty much as i expected. so, while i think i would def come back to drink, i probably would look elsewhere for actual brunch time needs when im coming on an empty stomach.
