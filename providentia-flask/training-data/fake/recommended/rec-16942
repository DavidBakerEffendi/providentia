First off lets start off that this place is BYOB! For me this is always a plus. Now as far as the food goes where do I begin; the octopus appetizer is out of this world, its cooked in a light scampi sauce and it melts in your mouth. I love octopus but many times it can be chewy and not cooked well, you won't have that problem here. As far as the fish you really can't go wrong with any choice! They are all cooked to perfection and are all cooked in a light sauce as well so you can really taste the quality of fish. I have had the Chilean Sea bass multiple times and I just can't get enough! All in all if your a seafood lover then this is a place for you to try! Make sure to make a reservation, this place is always packed!
