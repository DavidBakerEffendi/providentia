Hadn't been to "the Shack" in a while but just stopped in for a to go order & once again it felt like home. Tried the new truffle mushroom salad & it was fantastic. Everyone from the servers, to the chef to the owner are just the perfect mix of professionalism with a little bit of fun. I won't wait so long to be back again. Thanks as always!
