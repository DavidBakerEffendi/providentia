First time here. Staff is polite. Place looks cleanã€‚ Got number 26 beef noodle soup for around $9. The noodle, soup and meat are pack neatly and separated which if a plus since the some beef are raw while some are cook. The beef broth soup was very tasty. Speed was a bit slow. Wait 5 minutes for the staff to answer a call and 15 minute more for the food. Will come back again
