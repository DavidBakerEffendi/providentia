This is one of my favorite spots in the city - delicious veggie-friendly and meat friendly brunch options.  VERY affordable prices. Plus, I had one of the best chai tea lattes here last winter.  Their indoor seating is a bit close, but that made me and my brunch-mates talk to the people sitting across and next to us.  You can tell that it's a local's place, since so many people sitting outside talked to people walking past.  I love it, and would highly recommend it.
