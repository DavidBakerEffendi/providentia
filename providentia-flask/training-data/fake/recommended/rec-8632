My wife and I have had six (maybe more) great meals at Pho 68.  The service is prompt and everything we have tried has been very good except the pho.  We prefer Pho 501 in East Hartford but they don't make anything but Pho there.  Pho 68 is a lot closer for us and offers a real menu.  Their pho wasn't bad (3 stars) but once you've had 501's, you have a pretty high standard to meet (at least we think so.) The ingredients have always been fresh and soups tasty at Pho 68.  They serve all the meals with a side plate of fresh lettuces, basil, mint and assorted greens so you can't help but feel you are having a healthy meal.  They do not serve alcohol but they're cool with BYB. We had a dinner party of six once and told the chef a day in advance.  He served three dishes that were not on the menu and they were all excellent.  He is very thoughtful and considerate; his wife is the chef. If they improved the pho, they would get a fifth star from us.  I hope more people go and eat here because it would be a shame if they closed for lack of business.The service is attentive and very reasonably priced. BTW, this restaurant is far superior (even the pho) to the other two I know of in West Hartford.  Do not get confused because the others are on the same or soundalikes street (Park and New Park streets).
