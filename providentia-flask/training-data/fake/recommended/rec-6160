Gluten-free pasta!  Thank you, Bistango.  The gluten-free bread they give you at the beginning of your meal is also very good.  The pasta options are pretty standard and there isn't anything particularly out of the box.  My pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach was good.  Husband's squid ink spaghetti was nice--the spaghetti was a bit thicker than usual and had a nice chewiness to it.  If you don't feel like cooking and rather eat out, this is a good spot for a nice, simple Italian meal.
