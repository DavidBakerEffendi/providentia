Up a narrow staircase and you'll be transported to a traditional Japanese teahouse. The walls are constructed like the thatched roofs and bamboo sidings of a Japanese lodging, complete with perfectly placed plants and hanging lanterns. Javier M. swoons about Cha An's magic appeal and I think the decor is responsible. A retreat from the madness of the east village, this tiny shop seats a cozy 20 people. While I visited patrons were speaking softly in Japanese, French, Russian, and English. The bar is lined with porcelain, glass, and metal teapots and teacups. Tools of the exotic and beautiful trade here. I ordered flower craft tea, a delicate flowering tea. Spiky green tea leaves are picked as young shoots in spring season and laced into tiny bundles with aromatic chrysanthemum blossoms. After immersion in steaming water, the blossoms gracefully unfold, providing a small ballet of brewing before your eyes. If you favor the rare osmanthus oolong from SW China or a blend of African Rooibis and Indian spicees, the tea menu provides detailed descriptions of each tea's origin, history, and flavor. I ordered the dessert sampler, which started with a mixed berry sorbet,. The acidic sugars held up fresh peaks of whipped cream. Although the sweetness marred the tea flavor, it was the best dessert. The black sesame brulee was flat, served cold and leaving a bitter aftertaste. The hot banana chocolate tart was all dough and no substance. A dribble of melted chocolate, two quarter sized banana slices, and a spoonful of whipped cream. The chocolate cookie, sliced like a refrigerator cookie, tasted of sprouts. Finally, the rice paste flour rolled in toasted rice flour was unusual but authentic. The winner was the macaroon, a glossy treat filled with red bean cream. Delicious and a sublime pairing with their sweet teas.
