I've heard so much about this place and it didn't disappoint.  On the whole, I'd say the place is a bit protein heavy, you won't really have veggies unless you make a point to. I have to say that I was more impressed by the appetizers.   Steam pork buns - absolutely amazing! there's enough said about that on the reviews Bar bun -  pretty good too, it is slightly bigger than the original buns Fiji apple kimchi - a very surprisingly good dish.. we read a lot of reviews about it but the idea of kimchi and apple just sounded weird and we were really expecting to be disappointed but it was really refreshing. def eat just the apple, then add some cream and then eat with bacon, it tastes amazing all three different ways The slightly bigger dishes we had were a bit overwhelming for me. Roasted duck - pretty delicious but the pate was a bit weird for me, tastes very much a thick condensed patty of meat, not sure how else to describe it. Veal sweetbread - so the actual dish is so far from what we expected.  it is very tender fried pieces of veal kind of like popcorn chicken with pickled cabbage.  it really reminded me of this Vietnamese dish of fried fat.  it wasn't my favorite and felt quite fatty, I don't think I'd order it again. Service - we were seated right away on a Tuesday night.  Our waitress was very nice, friendly and attentive. On the whole, most of the reviews say it is "expensive" but I actually think it is pretty good value considering in New York there are so many restaurants that easily charge $50 a person and deliver very mediocre food.  Our bill came out to about $100 total tip included, which is really pretty good in NY.
