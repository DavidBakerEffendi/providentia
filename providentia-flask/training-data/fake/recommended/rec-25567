Before moving to NJ and having pizza at the Trattoria, I didn't care much about pizza.  It was all the same to me. One visit to the Trattoria converted me to a pizza lover!  Their chicken parm pizza is amazing.  I love the spots of melty ricotta.  I have also thoroughly enjoyed a white pizza with chicken and spinach.  I wish they had that one more often. Their dine in service is also good.  I enjoyed a huge portion of cheese ravioli and my friend enjoyed her spinach ravioli as well. Their service is fast and friendly.  Overall, great.
