Finally, I have been really wanting to go to Kefi and was not disappointed! Went here on a Friday evening after work with no reservation and they had one table available for two! Perfect! Started with the 4 dips, a lemonada cocktail, and I had the heirloom tomato salad- delish and the grilled octopus- perfect! Service was great and the prices are so reasonable here! I will be back many times!
