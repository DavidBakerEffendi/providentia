I like Gennaro's and if we lived nearby might be back often. My wife is less of a fan.  She made the point "that was not a $82.00 lunch" value-wise. $68 plus the tip. Room is nice enough.  I posted a pix.  Our server was professional and attentive.  Background music is Sinatra and friends from 1960. Not bad but out-of-fashion.  Sad to say I am old enough to remember the music well.  I don't know what younger customers would think. Going back to the lunch menu, my wife and I shared the zucchini rollatini ($9.00) to start.  She had the veal al limone with risotto for her entree ($19.00).  Nice but a small portion.  The risotto was a fail. I had a taste and commented that I make better risotto at home.  I went with the eggplant rollatini ($16.00) which was nice.  Plenty for me at lunch.  Had the lemon gelato with limoncello sauce for dessert ($10.00) which was recommended in the Star-Ledger review - nice.  Why they add a chocolate covered strawberry on the plate escapes me. Ended with espresso and cappuccino.   My wife was comparing Gennaro's with Cafe Picasso in Somerville - which has prices around $8.00 to $12.00 for an entree at lunch.  Plus the portions at Picasso are awesome - you take half home.   Food is probably a bit better at Mezzaluna on  Witherspoon Street and at better prices - but Mezzaluna can be annoyingly loud - bad acoustics. So a nice place but a bit pricey.   Hard to spot from the street.  Look for the strip center just north of the light at Cherry Hill Road on Route 206.  It will be on your right if you are northbound. Parking lot is on the north side.
