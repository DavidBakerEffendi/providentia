Since moving to NYC after many years in Paris, my favorite regular in the West Village has become Barbuto's. Admittedly, I've only had a few casual, light lunches or a coffee biscotti in passing, over the last few months but find the simple, fresh and inexpensive, (considering its location and fairly high profile chef) Italian food the best deal in town since arriving. The summery octopus salad starter was delicious and about the same price I paid, in an establishment close by, for some awful, greasy, deep fried, frozen calamari. The wood fired pizza's are very good. The unpretentious, friendly staff are a breath of fresh air after some of the WV snobbery. Bit like the River Cafe, London in some ways. The old car service station space, is great all year round, particularly in summer when all the windows are open. Will be going back for a proper dinner just as soon as we've made the move to only a few blocks away. Can't wait.
