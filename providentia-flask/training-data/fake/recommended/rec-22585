An insider tip for you: if a restaurant has an outpost in Las Vegas, you can be sure the owners care more about crafting a money-making empire than an enjoyable dining experience.   Scott Conant's food is delicate but a bit bland, and is completely at odds with the in-your-face shouty club vibe.  Our waitress was a dead-eyed model-wannabe who knew nothing about the menu, and the cheeseball dance music was so loud (on a Wednesday night) my wife and I literally could not hear each other. Bottom line, if you care most about impressing your guests with how much money you can throw around (hey bro look at me, I'm eating thirty-dollar spaghetti!) before stumbling on out to the Meatpacking District then this is the place for you.  If you actually want a good meal, there are at least twenty other Italian restaurants that serve better food for less money in friendlier environs.
