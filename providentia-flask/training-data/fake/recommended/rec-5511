A great meal and Jenny the general manager / sommelier made this a 5 star night. You have to get over the fact that if you do the tasting and wine pairing, we're talking a $400 bill in a not so intimate / romantic setting so that brought it down a star. The various fish dishes with fun sauces, such as utilizing nettles was delicious, my favorite being the the grilled scallop, but the ribeye was a perfect medium rare as well. The deserts were very good, but they did not steal the show.
