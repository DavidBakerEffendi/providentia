We stumbled upon this restaurant during business lunch.  I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was comfortable, not too loud but lively.  The waiters were very efficient and extremely helpful.  We ordered the mozzarella burrata and the veal & wild boar meatballs and both were very good.  I had a bowl of pasta fagioli to start and the grilled sword fish special which both were very good as well.  The fish was a tad dry but I'm just being picky.  I would definitely recommend stopping in for lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed.
