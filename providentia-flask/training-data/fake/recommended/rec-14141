I went here a couple of months ago with a friend and oh my goodness. the fish just melts in your mouth. We sat at the sushi bar and did it Omakase style. the sushi chef asked if there was anything we couldn't eat or didn't like to eat and started working. i loved how we were able to try such a wide variety of fish and did not use soy sauce at all. that's how sushi should be consumed! i remembered the rock crab piece the most since that was my last piece and i definitely asked for a second one. it's definitely an experience and i recommend it to anyone that's never tried it and is adventurous with food.
