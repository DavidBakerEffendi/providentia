Let me preface this review by saying that if Parc was about 20% cheaper, I would have rated it 5 stars.  But, when menu prices increase, you expect more out of a restaurant.   I went to Parc with my girlfriend and we started off with the Onion soup.  I loved it, my girlfriend thought it was a little too salty.   For our Entrees, she had the Beef Bourgenion (sp?) and I had the Pasta Bolognese.  The pasta was ok (it's really my fault for expecting a good pasta dish from a 'french' restaurant) and my girlfried was happy with her entree.  For dessert, we had the bread pudding, which was, to be honest, kind of awful.   Service was average, which is perfectly adequate, especially for a busy restaurant.  The ambiance was also nice, albeit a bit loud.  the views of rittenhouse are really nice.   I would recommend going once, especially during the daytime, but I don't think this is a place you'll come back to.
