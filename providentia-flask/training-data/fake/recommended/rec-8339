CASH ONLY!!! GREAT FOOD!!! those are the only 2 things you really need to know. I think they have an ATM inside. I went there with a friend who had hyped it up quite a bit and it met every expectation. the menu consists of all comfort foods. its like a spa for your stomach (except no potential health benefits) I hope to do it again soon. and again.
