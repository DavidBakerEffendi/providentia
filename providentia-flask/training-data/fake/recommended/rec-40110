From the outside looking in this place looked great, but it just wasnt that great. The salad that I ordered was awesome, so I had pretty high hopes for dinner but throughout the night the only good thing we had was the salad. Service was okay, not great but not terrible and the place was pretty busy so I can understand that. The food was where the problem was.There was just nothing special about the food and the prices were pretty high for what we got. With so many good restaurants in Philly I was pretty bummed that we ate here. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody. It is very average food with high prices.
