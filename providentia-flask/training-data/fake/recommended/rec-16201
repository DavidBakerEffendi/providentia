Uva....I'm gong to miss living so close this little wine bar. If you go, you must try the cheese plate...and listen to your server....they know what they're talking about.  For the Upper East Side, this place is a nice little surprise....quiet and no frat boys...just wine and cheese.  What more can a girl want? (It's also great for a first date)
