My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Boqueria by chance after having been told to visit the DC location.  All of the wait staff was INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful and the head chef made the experience.  We sat at the kitchen bar and got to see all the fuss as well as get little treats from the kitchen.  It was a true VIP experience.  We ate the ham and mushroom croquettes, the mushrooms, and more. It was ALL amazing.  We regret not having the paella.  HIGHLY recommend for a date, a birthday or just a casual drink after work.  Upscale but not snobby.
