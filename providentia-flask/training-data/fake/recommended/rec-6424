Nevada's alright.  Really, that's all I can say.  If you're drinking in this area of Bloomfield, go there and order something standard and you'll be good to go, otherwise go somewhere else.  I recommend some sort of soup or the disco fries - with mozz cheese and brown gravy.  Oh, and the zucchini sticks and broccoli bites are pretty good too. Open 24-7.
