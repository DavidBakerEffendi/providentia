Daniella and Todd have distinguished themselves as a French Bistro, yet they were willing to put step outside their comfort zone with a Summer BBQ party held at their restaurant on the Sunday before Labor Day!  They created an extensive and authentic menu and created a warm and loving atmosphere for our friends and family to honor my husband on the occasion of his 60th birthday.  The food, the decor, and the warmth were incomparable! This review is way overdue: I intended to post this review months ago. My oversight became obvious because friends and family are still talking about the party we hosted at The Pickled Heron! Daniella and Todd deserve the success they're enjoying as a restaurant and as party planners.
