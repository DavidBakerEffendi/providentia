Had cocktails and dined with a friend on Tuesday night 1/14/14. It was lively at the bar and in the restaurant. 30 to 40 something crowd dressed well. Sports on the TV at both ends of the bar and light pop/rock music faintly in the background. Food was fantastic and service was very good. Had the Kansas City Strip cook medium which was excellent and flavorful.
