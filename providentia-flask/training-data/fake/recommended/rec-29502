RECOMMENDATION. Sell frozen unbaked Sfogliatelle pastry packages as an option to customers. Dolce is already awesome but I will upgrade my rating to five stars once you start selling the frozen pastry treats! :). BAGLIANI's MARKET in Hammonton sells them and they are great. Honestly, the best Sfogliatelle I ever had was in Sienna, Italy. The layers were paper thin and flaky as opposed to thick and chewy. I have been on a hunt in central and South NJ to find something equivalent and I've never had the same quality. The dough layers get un-crunchy, "chewy" and oily after sitting out for awhile. -Not Pleasant-. The only way they are best eaten in my opinion is straight out of the oven (or close to it). I was pleased that Bagliani's had frozen ones. They tasted better when cooked at home. I think if Dolce and Clemente tried to sell frozen unbaked Sfogliatelle packages you would have many new customers. Just a recommendation.
