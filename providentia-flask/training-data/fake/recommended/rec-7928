I have been to Doc's in West Chester many many times and had GREAT experiences. Tonight was the first time I've tried the new Doc's in University City (and my ratings are specifically based on the one on Sansom Street). I made a reservation and arrived about 40 minutes early (approx. 5:35 p.m.). We got seated right away. Our waiter (we did not get his name) was very nice, but service was HORRIBLE. First, we ordered drinks which came fairly quick enough (less than 5 minutes). Then our waiter left. He came back after about 10 minutes later and took our appetizer order of 6 oysters and 6 clams. It took literally 25 minutes before it came out. I did not mind the long wait too much until I looked over at the table next to us whom arrived very much later after us, receive their oysters and clams and other apps FIRST. We ordered our entrees as soon as our oysters hit the table. It took 40 minutes before our food came out. We ate all of our oysters and clams AND ordered additional soup and sides because we were STARVING! By the time our food arrived, we were already almost full. Our entrees did NOT come out until I asked our waiter, "Are our dishes on their way yet?" and he told me yes. It took another 10 minutes for another person to bring our food. Our bill came to $113.00 and I felt ripped off severely. Not because of the price, but because of the lack of attention our waiter paid to us. Me and my boyfriend cancelled our plans afterwards because we did not get out of there until 8:15 P.M. I will not return back to this Doc's in UCity, but will definitely take the long drive to the one in West Chester where service is better and much more comfortable. And I also notice that their menus are slightly different. I LOVE the Seafood Portofino ? (Seafood over Linguini with spicy red sauce YUMS!) but the one in UCity had Seafood Bouillabaisse instead, which I did not enjoy much.
