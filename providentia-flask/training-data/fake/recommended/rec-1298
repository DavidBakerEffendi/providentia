Not only do I feel virtuous and hip when I eat at Pure Fare, I legitimately feel healthier than before I walked in the door. Although some of their food was slightly exotic to me at first (I'm still not sure what spelt is) it's all fantastic, from the quinoa bread to kale salad. Their coffee beans are wonderful and well roasted, and some of the baristas are very well trained, and the ones that are still learning the ropes will doubtlessly be excellent soon. If you want to feel cool and healthy at lunch time, check this spot out.
