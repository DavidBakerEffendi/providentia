Great restaurant in the middle of queens blvd. There is a long wait - so we went to CVS next door to read trashy magazines to pass the time. Almost ordered the whole menu! Very good fusion tapas. Lobster & Citrus - Nieh, not enough lobster and too much the bitter vegetable thingy Korean BBQ wraps - Came in an order of 3, and it was amazing very flavorful Crispy Pork Trotter - Unique, with an almost raw egg on top. Tasted like a croquette Yellowtail tartare - by far one of the best tapas on the menu, loved the cassava chips Oxtail Terrine - read other yelp reviews, it was good Shaved Hudson Valley Foi Gras- very interesting, never had foie gras like this. it is like light fluffy foie flavored cotton candy For dessert, definitively try the jalapano and peace sorbet. AMAZING! Happy eating!
