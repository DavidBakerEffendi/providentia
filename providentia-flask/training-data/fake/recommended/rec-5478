Osteria is the dark underbelly of an overconfident celebrity-chef. The service was nothing extraordinary, and the pizzas were burnt, flavorless, unoriginal and overpriced.Honestly, I could never tell the difference between Osteria's pasta dish and a pot of Prego and Barilla. Why did I spare the restaurant of a 1 star score? The grilled octopus salad saved the meal.
