Love me some Minca! Quiet neighborhood ramen joint with some rocking noodles and broth.  Up there with Ippudo and Momofuku in my book, without all the hype and wait. The pork broth is the bomb.  Hearty and fills the soul.  Chicken and veggie broth also available, but honestly,  why bother?  Noodles are firm with a nice chewy texture.  And the roast pork after being saturated with brothy goodness is porcine heaven on earth. Definitely worth a walk off the beaten path, just don't overfill my joint and make me wait!
