Nice Space! Ping Pong, great beer(s) nice in/outdoorsy atmosphere. Looking forward to the fall to really get in the spirit of October Fest out of doors. Food is nothing to write home about. Kraut was overcooked and rather bland-, and the dogs, while tasty ,are boiled, not grilled. Next time I may go for a more exotic wurst. Valet in Fishtown? What gives?
