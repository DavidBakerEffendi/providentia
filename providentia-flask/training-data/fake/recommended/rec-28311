LOVE this place! I went there with a group of 8. We had reservations in advance, and were seated as soon as we arrived. The food is amazing, came out right away, with the price and portions are JUST right. I actually couldnt believe how inexpensive it was. The place had a steady flow and good crowd the entire time. The white chandelier in the the middle of the place is pretty cool, and the hostess's cool attire added to the ambiance. I will be frequenting this place often. If you there, try the Basil Chicken- its the best Ive had. FYI- for parties over 10, there is a $20 minimum per person.
