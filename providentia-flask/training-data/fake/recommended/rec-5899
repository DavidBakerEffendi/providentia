My boyfriend took me here for dinner for our 5 year anniversary(neither of us having been here before).  Always ready to try a martini bar; I'm a big fan of tapas and a vegetarian.  Seemed like a good pick.  We sat right down at 9 on a Saturday night.  Very cool ambiance, a little too dimly lit for me, but otherwise 5 stars for atmosphere.  Our waiter was friendly and hovered just the right amount.  The martini menu was small for a martini bar.  My boyfriend ordered the sweet manhatten and aviation maritini.  He liked neither.  I had an espresso martini(I can't remember the name).  It was ok.  I've had better, and much much worse.  The menu was small and the vegetarian tapas nothing to write home about.  We ordered the french onion soup dumplings to start.  He ordered the tai chicken lettuce wraps and polpette(meatballs in red sauce).  I ordered the spinach ravioli.  The french onion soup dumplings rocked!  Not soup, but onion dumpling balls topped with gruyere cheese.  And two thumbs up for the polpette.  The lettuce wraps and spinach ravioli were very bland.  And we wouldn't order either again.  Definetley would come back again for the french onion soup dumplings alone.  Honestly would have rated it a five if all I did was drank martini's and ate dumpling balls all night long.
