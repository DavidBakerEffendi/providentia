I came here for the rave about their corn. And it is by far the best corn I have ever eaten!!! My family and I went at night, but the wait was 2 hours. So we went in the morning around 10am. There was no waiting line... and the menu was the same. Extremely happy. If I were to visit NY in the future, I would stop by this place for their Corn. Super delicious.
