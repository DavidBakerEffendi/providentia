Ordered the a cheesesteak for $14.50.  A little confusing when you walk in as the cook is doing double duty.  Cooking and at the same time taking orders and finishing up with those that previously ordered.   You first pick the steak of your pleasure which comes with a standard slap of mayo and a layer of white American cheese. Once your steak is ready, you can add what ever toppings you desire, from sweet peppers to cheese whiz. We completed our steak with half cheese whiz and half provolone. We ate at John's Roast Pork a couple days prior, and I have to say Max's steaks were more pleasurable.  Not for the faint of heart, but if you are looking for a great steak and not worried about the possibility of getting car jacked, Max's is the place for you. Next time in Philly I would probably try another joint, but will always remember the steak at Max's
