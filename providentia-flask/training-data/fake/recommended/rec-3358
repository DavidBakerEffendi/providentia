Stowe's is a great find! We were visiting the area as our friends in the area and we were looking for a place for fresh seafood. We stumbled across Stowe's on yelp and saw the reviews. We went there for a late lunch. I had the new england clam chowder and the fried oysters and fries and my boyfriend had the lobster roll and shrimp basket. The lobster roll is saut√©ed lobster and is placed in a roll. It literally melts in your mouth! I would highly recommend it. The owner is a very nice man and has been there for a long time. I like the fact that it is a local family business and they didn't sell out to the real estate developers. It is at a prime corner location across from the beach. Parking is limited in a small private lot and the seating is very limited. It is a good place to get take out or if you are going to eat there, you need to go on the off hours. They are not open late either. I would definitely recommend visiting this place!
