Octopus Salad. YUM. Mussels a la Maison - Sauce was a bit on the salty side, but otherwise absolutely delicious. Steak with Senegalese Sauce - Sauce was also bit on the salty side, but otherwise quite tasty. Portions are reasonable to large. 2/3 dishes were a bit salty, but I would definitely be willing to believe maybe the chef was off on the sale that night as it was otherwise quite yummy. Would give them another go.
