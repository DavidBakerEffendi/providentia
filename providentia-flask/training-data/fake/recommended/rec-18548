That night I went to Ocean Grill (very fancy schmancy) and came back to the hotel STUFFED! Sister went shopping and brought back this for me.  Can I repeat I was stuffed? "WTF, are you serious? Why did you get this?! I can't eat anymore" "This place is famous for being delicious" "It's going to get wasted..." ....35 min later.....FINISHED.  not a scrap of chicken, lamb, or rice was left.  This place summoned my inner fatass...yearning to come out for a worthy cause.
