I came here for breakfast 3 days in a row since I moved into the neighborhood. The owner, Din, is awesome. The chicken biscuit is just like down south, the veggie muffalata is good when I look at my stomach in the morning and decide the chicken biscuit is just not necessary, the short rib is good, but eat it at the store cause it gets soggy to go. I love the chips he drives up from New Orleans. One of my favorite sandwich shops.
