I am reading the novel MUSEUM OF INNOCENCE by Orhan Pamuk, a Turkish writer who won the  Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006.  The main character eats out a lot and whetted my appetite.  Reviews of The Bosphorus on Yelp brought me here to whet it, and I was not disappointed.   The food at The Bosphorus is prepared and served with the care  of a museum curator  trying to provide only the very best.   With all my choices  The Bosphorus met that high standard: The appetizer:  Baba Ganoush, smoked eggplant pureed with black olives topped with grape leaves The main entree: A whole grilled fish, Levrek-Branzino, flown fresh from Turkey,  served with a succulent salad The dessert: I cannot remember the name of the dessert, so I will use that as an excuse for returning soon to find out.  It was a sweet and chewy pastry laced with feta served in an oblong dish.   It is not one of the desserts shown on the restaurant's website, thebosphorus.us/default.… but all of those look gorgeous too.  I need a bib just to accommodate my meditation on them.   The libation:  The Bosphorus is BYOB.  I brought my own fine vodka, but it was the only "lesser" part of the experience. The main character of the MUSEUM OF INNOCENCE drinks a lot of Raki, Turkey's signature drink, a very sweet liqueur flavored with anise.  I called five of the largest liquor stores in northern New Jersey and haven't found Raki yet.  I will, and that will be yet another reason to return to The Bosphorus.
