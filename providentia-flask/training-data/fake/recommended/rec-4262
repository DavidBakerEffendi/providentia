I had been researching Spanish places for when coming into Philly. Jamonera got ranked the best, we made a reservation and were happy to go! We got in 5 minutes late for our reservation because we were coming from the airport, wasn't an issue. Our reso was for 9:30, and we knew Happy hour starts at 10, hmmmm how to stall for 25 minutes. Turns out it was hard, so we ordered the papas frittas, I wouldn't say they were much like anything we had in Spain, I mean, they were fried potatoes, but not a bravas. They were kinda a miss for me, $7 for legit a potato, cut into pieces, fried with some mayo. Meh! Next up we got the eggplant fries, this was a 5 star dish, plus they had a version of romesco, which is quite hard to make perfect. THE fries were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, perfect! I ordered the pig egg($7), I'm not a fan of deviled eggs, but these were great, nice thick slice of pork belly and a creamy deviled egg! We also got the vegetarian tapas platter, fried artichokes, roasted beets, some type of squash, roasted fennel with goat cheese spread, Â and shaved turips they were all amazing and this seemed worth the $16 price. So the happy hour starts, and I see the pig egg, now only $2 per order, damn... I know it was partly our fault for coming so close to happy hour, but I feel a bit cheated that I spent an extra $5 for 1 extra piece of pork belly. Their sangria was great, tastes like some of the best in Spain. We ended up spending a bit more than we wanted, but the food and services was great. If you're not a cheap-o like me and want to drop $200 on tapas this is a great place.
