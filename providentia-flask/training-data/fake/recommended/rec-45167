My girlfriend and I had a terrible experience on a Saturday night.    They were busy but that does not excuse an hour plus wait for our meals (the table next to us waited 1.5 hours for burgers).   The disappointment continued when the food finally arrived.  My girlfriend's crispy chicken sandwich was nothing more than two chicken fingers with a piece of cheese over them and soggy fries.   I got the cornflake chicken which was tasty but an overall disappointing experience.    Will not go back again.
