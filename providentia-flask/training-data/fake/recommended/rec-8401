Just tried this place for the first time after reading great reviews. This place is Delicious from start to finish. The husband and wife that work here make you feel like family. They serve your stomach from their hearts. I grew up in this area and was surprised their was such great authentic Indian food. Â Yummy Yummy. Had the Dhan Sak and the hubby had some shrimp in a creamy curry sauce. The mango lassi was dreamy and the vegetable pakora was divine. I will be back. Sorry Taj Mahal you lost me to Ghandi
