Came here with my co-workers on a Thursday, it was moderately busy (Not packed but from the outside, it definitely looked like it a was popular restaurant).   A couple members of our party were a little late so I headed to the bar with who already arrived and grabbed a couple drinks.  The service was great and the hostess would occasionally check on us to see if the rest of our party arrived. (Not in a nagging sort of fashion, was very nice and told us that she would hold the table till they arrived).   Once the rest of our party arrived we were escorted quickly and the waitress was very attentive, and informative when it came to drink and food selection.  I highly recommend the cobia, chili lobster and pork porterhouse.  There were 4 of us and sharing the chili lobster was a great choice as a sharing platter. The veal was alright, needed more truffle (said it had black truffle oil but could barely taste the truffle).   For dessert, go with the cheesecake or chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies come with a mason jar with milk.  Very "homey" touch to it. If you are picking any dessert wines I would go with the Takaji, Oremus 2008.  Very sweet and goes well with the cheesecake.   Overall a good vibe to the restaurant and would definitely go again.
