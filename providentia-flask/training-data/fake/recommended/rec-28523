I have had the pleasure of dining at Piora and have always enjoyed an exceptional dining experience from start to finish.  Cozy atmosphere and a wonderful ambience.  Attentive, knowledgeable staff.  Variety of dishes to try and a plentiful wine list.  Great place for dinner if you want an intimate, relaxed gathering with a date or a few good friends.
