Went here for a weekend lunch and got Chicken Vindaloo and Malai Kafta - both were very good representations of british-style curries.  We asked for both dishes very spicy and they delivered, really fantastic flavors as well as spiciness.  Service was really good, not over the top but nice and responsive.  Price was also very reasonable, and they're BYOB!  We will definitely come back here with some good beer and friends.
