I love you, simply put. I love how you very un-kosherly marry 2 different animals, in addition to savory melted cheese, to create what can only be described as a late night flavor-gasmic high. I love that your crowd is the kind who you can chat about favorite cereals, and the origin of their names with while drunk at 4:15 am. xoxo P
