Good Dominican food, I love it. The Sangria was awesome and my parents and I got nice off one pitcher, lol. It took a while for the entrees to come, but we had some nice starters and a good time drinking. Everyone there was extra friendly and cool. Had a great time and everything we ate was delicious.
