This place is absolutely amazing. I went to Joe's Shanghai with two friends on a Monday night. There was a wait in line to get seats. It was worth the wait! We had to share the table with two people but it was also worth it! We met an amazing couple with interesting stories and they also recommended food that was good. You must get the steam pork buns here. About 8 for $4.95. The soup bowls are also decent. I like the fried flat noodles with came with pork and vegetables. The scallion pancakes here are also amazing. The food here is very traditional and authentic. The service here isn't great at times.
