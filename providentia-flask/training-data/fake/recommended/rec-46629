Had a great experience here last month!  I had great luck in making a reservation for 6 for a Friday night - when I called in that morning.  The owner took my call and was very helpful & told me that he could get us in as long as he could have the table by 9:00 for another reservation. We were seated almost immediately when we arrived, and despite the limited space they managed to find room to stow my husband's suitcase as he had come directly from the airport. The meal was excellent.  We all loved our food.  The appetizers were light and fresh and well-seasoned.  I tried the gnocchi for my entree, and they were incredibly light! We did have a 10-month-old and a three-year-old with us, and it worked out fine as we were seated in the corner on the upper side of the restaurant, but I could see how it would be more difficult to deal with kids in the somewhat cramped space.  It was also fairly loud - good for covering up noise if your kid is whining, but could also be a little overwhelming.... all in all, I'd love to go back and enjoy a kid-free meal sometime! As we left, Giorgio was handing out bruschetta to people waiting in line.  He knows how to keep his customers happy!
