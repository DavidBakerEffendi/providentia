Great Ramen, amazing pork buns. I was at a crossroads when I had a pork bun and chicken bun, and was trying to figure out which was better.....then the soup came. At this point everything was so good I gave up and now I figure they deserve 5 stars for keeping me in a state of complete satisfaction. Thank you. Love the booths and design of restaurant too, even the trip to the bathroom included a peek into the kitchen for an inside scoop on how they make the buns.
