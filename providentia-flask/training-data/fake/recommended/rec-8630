A great place for a filling, fresh Italian meal. The place is always packed with locals - the food is hot, fresh, and plenty of it. really love the house dressing, the salads are huge, as are the entrees. Had the lasagna most recently, but the eggplant parm is also a favorite. And picking up a bowl of fresh soup and a hunk of bread to go is a great lunch treat! The staff is always friendly - one time when we were raving about the house dressing the owner came out and gave us the recipe! Just pick your spots - because on weekends and busy nights there can be a wait! Prices seem to be sneaking up a little, but you can't argue with success. I live near the much touted Paradise City restaurant in New Britain - was surprised to learn that the folks who own Yanni's used to own / run Paradise City.
