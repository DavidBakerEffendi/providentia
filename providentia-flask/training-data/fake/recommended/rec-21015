Went here for a quick meal during the day on Sunday. We got two "small plates": Merguez and Meatballs. Both were very very good! Portions were also pretty decent. merguez came with hummus, pita bread and salad. Prices for small plates were $12-$18, which is somewhat reasonable for this area. I heard they have a real good brunch, so i will probably go to that. They have wine and beer, I was about to order beer but they had regular bottle beer for $8-$10. I thought that's pushing it for regular small restaurant. The only thing I didn't like is I thought our waitress was a little weird, I think she was disappointing we didn't order entrees and drinks.
