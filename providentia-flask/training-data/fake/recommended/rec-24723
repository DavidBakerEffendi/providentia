Stopped in for lunch. My husband had a cup of Chili with cheese- he said it was good. I had a cup of Broccoli Cheese Soup- pretty good. For our lunches my husband had the Shepherd's Pie-good! I had a Rachel and fries- very good. Of course, we enjoyed some good craft beer. Our favorite was the Tulach Leis- so good. Our service was excellent. And it's a good value, too. We'll be back.
