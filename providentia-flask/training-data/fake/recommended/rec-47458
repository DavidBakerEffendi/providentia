I'm there for the $2.50 McSorley's (Dark) on tap. The bartender was kind enough to treat my friends and I to a couple of free rounds which was really cool. It's a very chill laid back place that gets a little crowded as people line up to grab tables in the back. Typical moody lighted dark wooden pub with a few TVs up playing sports. The burger isn't as amazing as I thought it'd be - I ordered one after several beers and it was just a bit too greasy. I'm usually all for the fattiness, but this didn't mix well with the beer and made my stomach a little unpleasant. I'll have to try it without the booze in me. The chicken sandwich isn't a bad alternative, but yeah, I'll probably stick to the fries which are all sorts of tasty. Go for the cheap beer, good crowd, and order some fries.
