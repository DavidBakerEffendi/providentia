The name I find is a little bit of a turnoff. I think of buttermilk, and I think of my hips... But on to the brunch....it was great. I had eggs with sausage, waffles, coffee, and a mimosa. It made my day. The eggs were perfectly cooked. The sausage...superb. The coffe was rich, just like I like it. And the mimosa, well, you can't go wrong with that. The service was excellent. Can't wait to come back.
