So to start we had to ask for light.  Not just old fogey's like my wife and myself, but my 14, 19 and 23 year old kids had their phones out trying to read menus.....stupid. They hand us menus, ask if we want something to drink, but since the beer menu is half the menu it takes a minute (especially with no light).  So my son and I ask for 2 beers off the menu, neither is available, we ask for 2 more.....guess what not available....OH...that menu is out of date...no kidding  If you going to have a beer menu that changes often, don't make it fancy on the back side of the food menu.  Even the new plain white paper beer only menu they finally handed me was out of date.  UGH. Food is basic, and over priced. The burger (Blue bird) was flavorful and almost moist, the dry huge roll sucked all the juices out of the burger. One son had the bypass he liked it except the english muffin was too small for the burger, at least it wasn't dry. Onion rings were good.  Disco fries good. What's with the wrong beer glasses for the beers?   IPA should be server in pint glasses, not snifters....only reason to do that is to charge too much.
