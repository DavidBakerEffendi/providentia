This is a great family place. Their pancakes are the best I've ever eaten. They have a delicious Belgian waffle as well. If you want lunch, I recommend their French Onion soup as well as their tuna melt. I've tried plenty in their menu and have never been disappointed. The staff is very nice and welcoming. My family and I go there often and highly recommend them.
