How does one screw up Spaghetti & Meatballs? The Original Benito One will show you how. My meatball was so old, hard and tasteless that carbon dating would have been appropriate. The scarpariello was not good. The calamari was over done. Â This should never happen on Mulberry Street. The bread was good. Edit: They took the cost of the meal off my bill; i didn't ask. That was probably the right thing to do. The waiters were good so I will give them an additional 2 stairs.
