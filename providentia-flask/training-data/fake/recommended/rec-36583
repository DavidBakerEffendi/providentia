We had the Lobster risotto, west and east coast oysters(special) and the escargots. Bottle of wine. Bar steak, duck confit and a pork dish. We also each had a diff dessert. Everything but the duck was superb. The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing. Loved the place itself but we had a semi-private table with plenty of room. We were visiting from Chicago and it's one of my bros favorite places to dine. Got to see William H Macy (which was sooo cool). Â  Small in a cozy way. Make reservations for dinner, we went on a Tues. and def needed them. It did not feel pretentious at all.
