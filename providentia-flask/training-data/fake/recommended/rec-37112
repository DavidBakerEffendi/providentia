I went on a Friday nite.. food was ok. there were 3 girls playing the music, probably filling in for somebody. the music was soso, with a couple hiphop/rnb tracks throughout the nite. heard no soca, maybe 2 dancehall. the dancefloor was just a little extra floorspace beyond the bar that dominates the room. not my choice for a nite of dancing..
