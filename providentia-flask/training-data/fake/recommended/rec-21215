My first yelp review! Save for the best meal I had in the longest time. Trying to make a last minute RSVP on a Monday rainy night, RSVP for 7pm but end up half hour late, not only they are willing to accommodate us but the hostess came out of the restaurant to get us - afraid we might miss the restaurant in the rain! Love the decor and the ambience. Ordered the uni croquette, caviar rice bowl, foie gras soba, mac & Cheese, wagyu beef sashimi, and the branzino. ALL amazing, except the mac & chees, it is a bit too cheesy for me (not a big fan of blue cheese). My fav of the night will be the foie gras soba, at first I worried that it might be on the heavy side but it turned out to be light and very flavorful. Â  Unable to try dessert because we are late to our rsvp but I will def. be back to try it very soon.
