Great Little place in Soho. Small men√∫ good cocktails, good wine selection. We had a lot of the food most of the appetizers. They were all great small portions god for two but for 4 u need 2 of each. Loved the cauliflower and the angeloty with artichoke. Service was okay not great. Anyways I ll be back soon.
