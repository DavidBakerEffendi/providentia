Enjoyed a wonderful dinner here back in September when they had their soft opening. The ambiance is amazing, definitely not your traditional Indian restaurant. It seemed like it would even been a great spot to meet friends at the bar and have a drink. Since it's been a while, I can't remember my top fav dishes, although I don't remember not liking anything. I even tried (and liked!) the octopus. The general manager and owner were both extremely nice and accommodating. Can't wait to go back.
