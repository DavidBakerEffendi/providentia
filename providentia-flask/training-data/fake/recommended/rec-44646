Came here for brunch. They used to have an unlimited drink deal, but it has been discontinued. The food is sub par and the prices are quite steep - my friend ordered a $10 farmers plate which was literally a scrambled egg, piece of bread, and a few slices of cheese and tomato. Disappointed and will not come back.
