Casual atmosphere, big portions and delicious margaritas. What more can you ask for? There hasn't been a thing on the menu that I've tried and haven't liked. For appetizers their ceviche and the nachos with everything on them are delicious - they are huge portions so make sure you go with an appetite. For entrees, I am a fan of the shrimp enchiladas. It's stuffed with shrimp and the red cabbage really adds to the deliciousness. If you want a burrito, you can't go wrong with Rafael's especial. Partner it with "The Perfect Margarita" and trust me you'll be back!
