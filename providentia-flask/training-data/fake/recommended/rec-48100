My wife and I had been looking forward to trying Pizza Barrio for several months so we figured restaurant week would be a perfect time. Â We were disappointed, but would still love for this place to do well. So first the good: Yes, this place is adorable and yes it smelled delicious. The pizza was generously sized. The stuffed sweet peppers were tiny but delicious. Foccacia bread was good. Now on to the not so great. Roasted garlic was served cold without a garlic fork. Pizza was somewhat flavorless. Service was slow. Menu was misleading. Dessert (the supposedly award winning ice cream "bite") was artificial tasting. (Granted neither my wife or I are not big coconut fans and that was the theme of this dessert). This would have been all ok if it wasn't for the misleading prix fix resteraunt week menu. We were there shortly after opening (the third party to be seated) and at dessert they told us they had already run out of the tart they had advertised. This too, would have been ok if the waitress had been more gracious about the change. Oh Pizza Barrio--you can do better (even on a busy day)!
