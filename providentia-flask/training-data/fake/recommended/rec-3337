As I sit in my lunchroom eating leftovers that taste like a delicious campfire I figured I would write my review. Bbq platter is gigantic and very delicious. Obsessed with the chopped pulled pork. Mac and cheese so good, as were the mashed potatoes. Decadent heavy and good for the soul but definitely not for anything else. Service was pretty bad so 4 stars!
