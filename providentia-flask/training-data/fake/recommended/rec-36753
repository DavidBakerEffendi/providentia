So much fabulous food, so little room in my stomach :(  Came here for lunch on a weekday and this place still managed to have quite the wait...but no worries, hand me a mimosa and I'll be just fine.  Once seated, I skimmed the menu and realized this was not going to be easy.  Why, oh why, must restaurants have so many enticing dishes?!  What's a 100 pound girl to do when she wants to try half the menu??!  Ugh!  Decisions, decisions...thank goodness I'd have some help!  Seated across from me was my trusty meal finisher; aka, the bf.  We started off with the mixed field greens, the goat cheese and onion tart and the spinach and ricotta ravioli.  All were amazing!  Next came the macaroni au gratin.  And finally, the ham and gruyere sandwich.  YUM!!!  Prices were a little steep but hey, it is NYC after all.  I leave the restaurant spouting off my usual line, "Uhhhh, I ate too much..."  It's all good, walk it off, walk it off.  And so we did...I love Balthazar!
