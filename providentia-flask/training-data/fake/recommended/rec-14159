Beau Monde is so charming.   I took a day trip with a friend from college and we couldn't have ended up at a more perfect place to catch up.  We were seated by the window at a table with a mini topiary.  When our coffee came out, we had a cow shaped creamer...I named him Mooky because he was just too cute.  It's the little unexpected little touches that I adore in life.   We had the special of the day:  a savory scallop, roasted brussel sprouts, and mushroom crepe.  My first bite, I almost melted onto the floor.  It was one of those, I must close my eyes for this moment bite.  The creamy sauce was crazily explosive in contrast to the crispy and tender crepe...and then you're hit with the scallop and mushrooms and the crunchiness of the brussel sprouts.  HEAVEN.   I will be back for dessert crepes next time around and to visit Mooky again.  Kiss him for me when you visit and tell him that Mama says, "I love you."
