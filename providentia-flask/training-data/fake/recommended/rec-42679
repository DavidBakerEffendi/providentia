Good place for happy hour and group dinners. I went there 3 times. Once for happy hour. Unique cocktails with great deals. Another time for dinner and then for lunch. Korean entrees are great. The bibimbap in the hot stone bowl is really hot so you can get the crunchy rice at the bottom. The sushi roll is not recommended. The fried tiger roll wasn't crunchy, more soggy. Other than that the dishes are fine.
