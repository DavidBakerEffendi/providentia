best sandwiches ever!!!! YUM, ITALIANO and the ROAST BEEF! sooooo damn good, good sized portion too, and came with salad, yay!!!  Dont get the crostini, it was soft bread smeared with a ton of goat cheese and lathered with tomato jam....kinda inedible!!  Very generous with their portions!  The oysters are amazing, my fav is the St Simon!!  Very friendly staff, would def come here again and get the brick chicken!
