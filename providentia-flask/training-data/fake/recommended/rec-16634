Best meal I've had in NY in a while. I'll admit I have always wanted to try Perilla bc of Harold's Top Chef fame, so I was prepared for it to be a bit overhyped. The food totally exceeded my expectations, every single dish was delicious, well executed and perfectly balanced. Apps: - Crispy Wild Boar Belly - delicious, can't go wrong with pork belly, and it had a meatier flavor to it than the pork belly at Blue Hill, maybe bc it was "wild boar"? - Spicy Duck Meatballs - amazing! super juicy with a spicy mint kick Entrees: - Grilled Branzino w/Cumin lamb - I was in the mood for something different, this was a modified 'surf and turf' and the result was great! i liked the cumin lamb paired with grilled fish - Tea Smoked Duck Breast - I think this was my favorite entree, the duck was juicy and cooked to perfection, it was a healthy sized portion - Tasting of Local Rabbit - tender and delicious Dessert: - Sticky Toffee Pudding - not what i expected, but AMAZING, like a bread pudding with toffee, cinnamon ice cream was great complement, I was stuffed by this point but kept eating bc it was so good Everything we had was good, and that's not something you can say for every meal in NYC, I would go back!
