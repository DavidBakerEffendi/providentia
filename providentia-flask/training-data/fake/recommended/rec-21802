We wanted to show my mother-in-law a nice evening out. She was all wrapped up in her home clothes, but we wanted her to try Kiwiana. She was *so* happy to have made the effort to get semi-dressed and come out to enjoy Kiwiana. Momma was so pleased... she said "damn! that man can cook!" Kiwiana now has a liquor license with a full bar (and happy hour until 7:30 pm) and the two cocktails they have right now are dead on- DELICIOUS! The Farmer's Daughter (gin, cucumber, elderflower, lime, sugar, mint) and the Kiwi (rum, ginger, lemongrass) just really lovely combinations. We tarted with oysters (wow! salivacious!), the beets/lavendar infused goat cheese with pecans, and the salmon ceviche (pure genious! the textures are amazing and it's extremely flavorful). for the mains: I couldn't resist the fried chicken again- and I swear it tasted better than I remember (I wish we could get a WHOLE corn on the cobb! I don't know how he makes corn taste so flavorful!) Momma and hubby had the lamb burger. Now, hubby and I took a New Zealand roadtrip and the best lamb burger (we thought) we had in life was in this tiny town there... but this lamb burger beats THAT lamb burger. Momma was so happy, and that- is priceless. For dessert- couldn't resist the passion fruit flan again (damn that's the perfect way to end any night!) and this time we were early enough to try the Raspberry lamington (they ran out last time we came) and it was so yummy! Light/airy/flavorful... WOW!!!
