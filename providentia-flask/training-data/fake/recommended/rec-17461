If you have ever been to a rock concert, a sold out club in New York, or a Tokyo subway during rush hour, that about sums up the experience of waiting for your table. The hostess was nasty to my mother, the Lobby is where all 8000 people wait shoulder to shoulder WITH WAITERS BRINGING FOOD THROUGH... Never again.... BTW, I haven't say down to eat yet. I'm still waiting after 1 hour. Food: EXCELLENT The Tapas cannot be ignored. Love the food
