I really enjoyed this place.  We came on a Sunday to watch football and being that it was my first time here, I didn't know exactly what to expect.  The place consists of a decent sized bar, lots of high top tables, an outdoor patio, and a separate dining area with booths and tables for people wanting a more quiet meal.  We had a large group and the waitress was very accomodating with putting together several hightops right in front of the tv for us. The specials included $1 sliders, 50 cent wings, bloody mary bar, and $10 towers of bud light.  We ordered a lot of wings, sliders, and beer.  Something on the menu that caught my eye, was the large variety of tator tots they had to offer.  We decided to order three different kinds all of which were pretty big portions for $4!  The buffalo and blue cheese tots were great as well as the Vermont cheddar, bacon, ranch, and chili and cheese tots.  Next time I would like to try the white truffle and parmesan tots.  Also, you can order all the varieties in tot, french fries, or sweet potato form. The menu also included an interesting variety of burgers and sandwiches all reasonably priced.   The décor was fresh, clean, and new.  This place is great for families or sports fans or even for a date.  During the games, it wasn't so rowdy where someone would be intimidated to come in.  There was a very chill and friendly vibe.  The waitress was great despite us having a large group of 10 people.  My glass was never empty.  I wish I lived a little closer as I would be glad to make it my go to bar!
