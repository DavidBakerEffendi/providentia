Whiz whit! Quick, awesome service. Cheesesteaks and cheese fries here are really tasty without the political baggage of Geno's. Also I tried the compared the cheese steaks here to Geno's a couple times and prefer the ones sold at this place each time. Bread is tasty also. Since this is Philadelphia, and this is the east coast, definitely make up your mind before you come up to order. The line goes by pretty quickly but people get pretty impatient when you take your time to order. There is definitely plenty of seating, the only tough thing about this place is that there is only neighborhood parking, however that is the same case with Geno's as well across the street. Anyways definitely check out this place if you haven't already for an experience!
