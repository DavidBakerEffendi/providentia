Its true whats been already said by so many fans. The Blueberry Pancakes w/ warm maple butter were just slammin jammin GOOD GOOD GOOD!!!. Of course I also had side of sugar cured bacon which was also very good. Went here this past Monday morning, got up very early to take train into city from Long Island arriving about 9am - no wait, Yay! Already making plans to come back again (will pick weekday morning again) and perhaps try dinner as well.
