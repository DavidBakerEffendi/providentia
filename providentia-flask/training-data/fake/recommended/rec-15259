As a food lover, you spend your days waiting for that one gem to come along.  You dream of it, calculate your next order, have long talks about it with your friends and family, whisper to it from 200 miles away sweet nothings, and count down the days until you meet again.  Nan Zhou, I love you.   I really, really liked this place.  When your 2-year old slurps up noodles of the hand drawn type, he may not fully grasp the importance of this key life event.  I will remind him of that day, the day the earth stood still. I look forward to our next visit Nan Zhou.
