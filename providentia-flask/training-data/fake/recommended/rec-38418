I have mixed reviews about this restaurant. This was the first time my family and I ate New Haven style pizza. We ordered the white clam and margarita pie. The white calm had a nice flavor; which was full of garlic. The margarita had a nice flavor as well; which was full of fresh basil. The sauce was very simple, but it got the job done. The only issue I had with the pies was the crust. The bottom of the crust in certain areas was burnt, and I mean burnt (like toast). I guess this is normal, because the other customers crust looked identical to mine. Overall, it was a good experience. I probably won't be returning anytime soon due to the distance, but I would recommend others to try this restaurant.
