One of the best meals I have ever experienced and great for an intimidate date. We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bartender make some pretty cool drinks, all 14 bucks each. The restaurant is designed really well with some beautiful artwork. Food was great. Avoided the tasting menu per advice of others and was very pleased with this choice. It is definitely worth the visit if you can snag a reservation..
