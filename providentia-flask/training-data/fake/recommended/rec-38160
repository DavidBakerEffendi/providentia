Food was extremely tasty here and our margaritas were great! Hugo was our waiter, very friendly!!!! He didn't know the specials by heart and had to read them from a paper...he was very funny about it but not too silly enough to not take him seriously...you couldn't help but smile with him! I would ask him as a waiter again!!!! Our table ordered the guacamole, freshly made and it was great! The chips tasted very fresh as well. I enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup and had the portabello burrito. Both were fantastic. All of our family members raved about their meals as well. Looking for a nice place to gather in Downtown New Haven, and in the mood for freshly made Southwest food....and if you're a tequila fan??? Well...you need to check this place out asap!
