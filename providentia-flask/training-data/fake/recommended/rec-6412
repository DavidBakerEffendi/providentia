I've only tried the P.H.O. real sandwich here, but honestly I love this sandwich so much there's no reason to try anything else.  The sandwich is HUGE and full of meat and fresh vegetables.  It's like you're eating the better half of the food pyramid. You can get it both hot or cold, but personally I like it better hot. They also have FAST free delivery (including today on Christmas Eve).
