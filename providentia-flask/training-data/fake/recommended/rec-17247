Even if you go to Cuban Pete's on a weeknight your still gonna wait at least a half hour and that's only if you don't keep bothering the hostess to seat you.  The poor girl looked like she was gonna lose her mind.  The food is ok. There's are a ton of Cuban restaurants with better food and less of a crowded rush. Don't order the braised rib.  It was soooo fatty.  We brought our own wine and they brought us sangria without the wine in it. What?  Ok I'm done.
