Prior to going, I called in to check what the wait was and was told there was no wait. 15 min later I arrived and there was a long line ahead of us. Winded up waiting more than 30 min. Arggghhh Did it seriously get packed that quick or did the host just lie to me? Despite that debacle, I'd rate it 3.5 stars. For the price you pay, you can't get a better quality burger BUT definitely not the best tasting burger in the city. The beef was good but could have used more seasoning. The bun was very small and beef patty was very thick making it very messy and hard to eat. Was disappointed the fries came out a little soggy and cold - equivalent to ones you would get at a mcdonalds. The bar/restaurant itself was too divey and loud for my liking. I didn't like that you had to wait in line for your spot. Why not use a reservation system?? While it was a very cheap meal for a good burger, not sure if I'd like waiting more than 30 min.
