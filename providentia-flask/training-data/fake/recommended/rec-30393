I was a fan until a few weeks ago. Food is great but customer service from a few weeks SUCKED. WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING US MAKE RESERVATIONS IF YOU ARE GOING TO SEAT US LATE? Come on now, we live in NY a place where people are busy and have places to go. It is just unacceptable to seat people late especially if they made reservations.  ON TOP OF THAT to make matters worse, the host sat people who walked in later BEFORE us. What's going on here? No they were not waiting outside before our party and yes they literally walked in and were taken to their seat right away. Please explain this system.   Food is great but you need to learn how to be prompt.
