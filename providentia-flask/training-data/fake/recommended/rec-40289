I had a great time here. We came for the Bulls game and got a bad seat at first. One of my coworkers was kind of a dick about it to the waiter, but the waiter was cool, and moved us to better seat. He even put the game on a larger screen. He was professional about it and never put the brakes on the quality of service. Chickie's is everything I would expect a sport bar to be. Plenty of flat screens and a great seating set up. You can see the t.v.'s from just about anywhere. They had great food and a huge bar. I ordered the muscles which were okay, but the fries and philly cheese steak nachos were awesome. Their cheese steaks and burgers looked great too. The service was quick and our glasses were kept full. At least on a weeknight, this it the place to be. Highly recommended.
