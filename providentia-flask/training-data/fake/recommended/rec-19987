Went here for brunch with my girlfriend and we both loved it.  The food was amazing, the brunch prices were great, and the service was fabulous. They've just changed their brunch menu so we asked the waitress what she would recommend and then ordered some more.   The baked eggs were amazing.  Probably the best "single" thing we had, but the brisket plate was top notch taken as a whole.  We also got the ricotta toast, which was really good but nothing that surprising going on with the flavors (it came with a honey drizzle and blueberries, and a heaping side of fresh baby mustard greens which was a nice touch).  We also had a side of fresh fruit, which was good, but not worth evaluating. The cinnamon bun is also amazing, and plenty for two people to share.   The space was really good, but I wish they left the air duct exposed or adorned the drywall covering a little - it detracts from the ambiance I think. Overall this is the best brunch I've had in nyc.  Would recommend it to anyone
