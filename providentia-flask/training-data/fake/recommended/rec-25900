I would give 3.5 stars, but have to err on the side of 3.  After reading and hearing so many great things about this joint, I was incredible excited to go.  The crowd, the wait - none of it bothered me because I was anticipating the best burger in town.   The burger and fries were good, but everything was under-seasoned.   Even though we were starving, the first bite was a disappointment of flavors and juiciness.  I do have to say that the burger got better with bites and the bacon was fantastic.  I also liked that they served the burger with fixin's. I will def go back, but more due to proximity rather than the best burger label.
