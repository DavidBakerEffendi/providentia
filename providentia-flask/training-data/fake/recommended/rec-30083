Used to love this place but won't be back. The service is so terrible and the food is so overpriced. I haven't been in a year because of the service. Just went back and it was the worst ever. We went early on purpose because the staff can't handle the crowds. Got there at 11:40. There was one table there. We got our menus and drinks and no one came back. More tables filled in and we flagged someone down for our order. We both ordered wraps but I asked for mine as a salad. No problem. The sandwiches come with two sides. Our waitress asked what we wanted so we picked one. She said they come with two sides but we probably don't want the other. Why wouldn't we?? We're paying an arm and a leg for a sandwich of course we want what comes with it. Our food came out last. 10 min before we had to leave to get back to work. Mine was in sandwich form not salad as requested. I didn't have time to fix it. It was supposed to have corn chips in it- I had one chip at the bottom of my wrap. Whatever. No one came back to see how lunch was. When we asked for boxes and the check the waitress gave us a dirty look. I paid cash my friend asked for half the bill on her card. The waitress came back and put the whole thing on her card. My friend was furious with the whole situation so went and asked to speak to a manager. No manager onsite but she spoke to an older woman about our experience. Another waitress was sitting in the back and looked up and rolled her eyes at my friend. Totally uncalled for and unprofessional. We want to love this place but I'm done. There are SO many other options in Glastonbury that are happy to have the patronage and can provide the level of service equivalent to the price you pay. Also, when you visit the Bean in the winter you have to wear your coat and scarf. Just not worth the time and money.
