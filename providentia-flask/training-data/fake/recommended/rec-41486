cozy little place, the tom yum noodle soup is delicious, definitely coming back for an other one! I also tried the vegetable soup with mushroom dumplings, the broth was a broth nothing exciting form my taste-buts.. the dumplings were ok. The starters looked very good as I was spying to the left and right... yummyumm!
