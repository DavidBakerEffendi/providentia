This place is intimate and has several different sections in itself. We had the fortune of dining by ourselves in one of the rooms because the other was full. Decor/Ambiance- 4/5 I like the homely feel and the different sea-related items decorating the wall. Service- 5/5 Since we were alone in one of the rooms, Â we were basically doted on. This I can get used to. Food- 3/5 We had the fried oysters and the Cioppino that everyone raves about. The oysters had a nice texture at first- until we encountered the sand in each one. That sort of killed it for us. The Cioppino was pretty good. If we were lobstermongerers and experts in breaking one up, we would have probably liked it more. First world problems. The sauce went well with the fish. But good is not the same as mindblowing awesome. Maybe next time (with no sandy oysters please)? Bottom line- Maybe your experience will be different. But ours was just ok.
