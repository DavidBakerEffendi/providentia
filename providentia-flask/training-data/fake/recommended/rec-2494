When comparison to Geno's, I think Pat's would get my vote.  The bread was nice and soft, steak was juicy and tender, and the cheese wiz just icing on the cake.  Although the line was long, it was worth it to try a "traditional" philly chessesteak. I think the menu ordering was the funniest thing, especially the last part where it says "If you make a mistake don't worry, just go back to the end of the line and try again." hahahaha
