Super cozy restaurant in Nolita.  The burger is as good as everyone says.  I don't think it's the best burger in NYC (Diner still holds that special place in my heart), but it definitely is an awesome burger using ciabatta bread and sweet chili sauce.  I'd definitely like to come back again and try the pastas.  Great neighborhood spot.
