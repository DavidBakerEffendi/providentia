I just went yesterday and the new patio is awesome.  Although it's on a fairly busy street it didn't feel that way at all.  I could have been in my own back yard, but my blueberry mojitos aren't as good.  The pulpo (sp?) was absolutely delicious and so tender.  We also ordered the stuffed scallops which were also quite tasty. You'll have to give the staff a bit of a break, as the patio is currently a work in progress.  The food and some of the beverages have to be run from inside, and the only access is the front door.  They are planning on some changes (like that much needed side door) and it will only get better from here.  I can't wait to go back!
