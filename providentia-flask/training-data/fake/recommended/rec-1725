It's interesting how this place managed to claim notoriety for The Chicken and Rice spot in all of NY. I will attest that the food here is pretty good, especially for street vendors. However, eating here sober is quite different than eating it drunk at 3am. The quality is certainly consistent, and the ground beef/chicken over a giant bed of rice and onions accompanied by a smattering of sauces is something that many travelers are willing to wait in line for. That, of course, is the reason why this place only gets 4 stars. For the quality of the food, waiting in line for 30 minutes in the cold is just not something that a fast paced, inpatient guy like myself is willing to wait for. That being said, you should see the look of everyone who got their hands on the plate of food, it's like they've never had anything so delicious, lol. Overall...I guess if you haven't had it, you should try it out. But, in my opinion, the King of Felafel have better food. Food: 4 stars Service: 3 stars Price: 5 stars
