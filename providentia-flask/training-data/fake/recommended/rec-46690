Welp, the nachos are pretty much worth sacrificing your left pinky toe for. But that's not necessary b/c they're like 5 bucks. De-lect-able. This place used to be Azure and they also had amazing nachos so clearly the nacho karma is great in that building. Food is great. Bartenders are cute. If you have a car, swing on by. If not, grab some mace, a protective shield and a money belt and hop on the el. You won't regret it.* *If you do, I can not be held liable. The bartender was reeeally cute.
