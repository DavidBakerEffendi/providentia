I've probably been to this restaurant at least two dozen times over the last 5 years and I have always had a good experience. Highly recommend all sushi rolls (especially the special rolls). Last time I went, I got the fantastic roll, jungle roll, and volcano roll and enjoyed them all very much. Staff was very friendly and hibachi is available - so if you're looking for something fun to do with a group of people it's worth trying.
