i love the renovations!  the restaurant is now more spacious and seats more people.  lots of hits and misses here.   love:  homemade sausage (well seasoned and great to share with a group); duck curry (this is the largest portion of duck that i have ever been served for a duck curry.  the meat is meaty and not overcooked), deep fried catfish (hit or miss, when done right it is crispy but not dried, when done wrong, it just tastes bad); the sticky rice that comes with your entree (served in a small bamboo container that keeps your rice warm and fresh). meh:  paneang curry (i love peanut butter, but not peanut butter curry); cornish hen (looked and tasted like chicken than cornish hen). the service is always spot on.  i love the family business feel and they are always accomodating to large parties. overall, a good place to go with the family.
