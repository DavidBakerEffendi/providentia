This place gets PACKED! This is my 2nd visit. First visit, we had to wait for about 40 minutes to be seated at this BIG table shared with a few other parties. I have to say, it was brutal to see other people at your table with their food while you wait for yours. My 2nd time there, no wait (lucky us!!). It was on a Tuesday night, but the place was still filled! The workers know people go there for the dumplings, so before we even sat our butts down, the waiter already asked how many orders of dumplings. Personally I thought it was kinda rude but if I guess I wouldn't mind if I was SUPER hungry and ready to chow! The two of us got an order of the dumplings, Shanghai noodle and a shrimp noodle soup. Everything was delicious. The trick to eat the dumpling is to eat the top first, suck the juice inside, then eat the whole thing. Both times, I had very good experience with the service and the food. I'd go there again :)
