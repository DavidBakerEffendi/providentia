We were told this was a great place to eat, read the reviews, and chose to visit for our family Christmas Eve. Dinner.  What a disaster! It took 40 minutes to get our first drink, an additional 30 minutes to get our appetizers, (which came cold btw) and my entree was so salty that it was uneatable. The only reason I've awarded 1 star is because I felt so bad for the wait staff.  After complains to the manager, they did remove several items from our bill, but the manager never made an attempt to visit our table.  That explained a lot! I would never recommend this place to anyone.
