If you are interested in throwing a seamless, effortless, group event for any occasion definitely go to Bar Room (more than suitable for corporate events). Laura, the events coordinator is extremely accommodating and responsive (no details were ignored) and most importantly all staff had a great time. Would definitely do, again or add to the list of approved spots in Midtown. AD
