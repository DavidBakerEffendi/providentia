Limited lunch menu on Sundays! There is a combination of brunch and regular lunch on Sundays. After my first visit, I went back on a Sunday hoping to have some calamari again but sadly it wasn't available. Their calamari is very very good. Different from the usual calamari you may see in other Italian restaurants. its comes sauteed with roasted tomatoes and served soaked in the tomato sauce! We also had Mercato which was great. They seem to use very fresh ingredients. My main dish was Pollo parmigiano. Also very tasty.
