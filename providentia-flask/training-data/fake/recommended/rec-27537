The place looks like a tacky Asian grocery store. And you feel a little bit on display seated in their- their windows big- their lights florescent. All that is forgotten when you take a bite of the warm comforting pho noodle in broth. This place has the most unique and homestyle pho I know of. Their noodles are the wider kind and their slices of eye of round beef are thick cut (most pho places use the thin noodles and deli thin sliced beef). Surprisingly, though, the meat was as tender and fresh as can be- and the thick cut really satisfying to my carnivorous tendencies. The soup broth was veryyy full flavored- nice hardy beef sweetness without the msg. Their spring rolls were wrapped with the egg wrappers (which tends to make it crispier than the regular rice paper wrappers the other places use) and had minced taro and vermicelli in it- which made it ohhhh so good and just like the way my parents (who are of Cambodian origin) make it. Needless to say- this place is not to be missed by anyone who claims to be a Vietnamese fan. I haven't gotten a chance to try to banh mi bc I was craving pho. Next time maybe but I've been obsessed with the $3.50 bbq pork sandwiches at Gude Gude in the lower east side where I live.
