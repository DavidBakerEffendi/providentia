I was very hopeful walking in.  The decor was nice, details, lighting, etc.  Menu was interesting but simple.  Then it all went down hill.  Servers had no clue, disorganized, unfamiliar with what a customer needs, let alone wants.  Caesar salad dressing was salty beyond belief.  My gnocchi was tough and flavorless.  The shape and texture let me know it was straight from a vacu-pack.  Pancetta was cut too thick and imparted zero flavor.  My wife ordered a peasant stew, specifically asking that the mussels be withheld ... well you know that was just wishful thinking.  The waitress said "the kitchen never reads the instructions".  The stew was server with a fork ... hmm.  When we asked for a spoon I was afraid we would have to describe it to them.  After asking no fewer than three staff, a teaspoon was delivered.  My wife asked again for a soup spoon, and what arrived would have been perfect for a buffet line or Gulliver's Travels. Again, this place has the look and ambiance to be great.  The problem is their food and service have a long way to go to catch up.
