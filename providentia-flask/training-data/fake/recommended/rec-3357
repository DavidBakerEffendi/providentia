Great quality and service. Large selection of fresh veggies, meat, and seafood. I would definitely recommend making reservations. Half hour wait around 6pm on a Saturday without one. By 8pm there was a line out the door. Service is quick and friendly! Take advantage of the deals on yelp as well. Melona bar was a much needed palette cleanser after a huge meal.
