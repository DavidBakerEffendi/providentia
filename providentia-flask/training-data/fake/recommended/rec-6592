This place proves that size isn't everything. The cafe is smaller than a NYC apartment (ohh yeah) and fits about 20 on a good day. The kitchen is just big enough for one person to move around in..and from the limited amount of space and tools that the cook has to work with, you would be surprised at the quality food they churn out. I have found my new #1 burger place in the country. Having lived on the West Coast, I constantly lust for In-n-Out. Last night, I began my affair with the Bronte burger. Sweet chili sauce, fresh greens and tomatoes, and cheese over a thick succulent juicy medium-rare burger patty, paired with a tasty side salad. I was full from the soup and pumpkin salad (also very good) before I got to my burger, but I still managed to scarf the whole thing down even though I was bursting. I just didn't want the taste to end. Greed can be a painful thing. p/s: CASH ONLY
