Much, much, much better than New World but still quick and a great bargin.  The burritos are HUGE, like a small baby wrapped in foil.  The menu offers a ton of choices so they can accomodate even the pickiest of eaters. Not super impressed with the people skills of the counter help, but since the food is good and comes out quickly, it doesn't keep me from stopping by when I need a burrito fix.
