On my way to a conference in the area, I passed the Stage House Tavern with my coworker and thought, "that place looks charming.  i'd like to come back here".  We returned two days later, and had a great time!  Our strategy was to eat dinner early an avoid rush hour traffic on the highway.  We got a soup or salad as well as an main course for $11.95!  Compared to Philly prices, that was terrific.  My salad was large and fresh.  My friend's soup was flavorful and generous.  We both chose from the array of HOUSE MADE RAVIOLI and sauces.  I got the seafood ravioli with vodka sauce.  My friend got the pork sausage ravioli with the 4 cheese sauce.  Delicious.  Our service was wonderful.  There was live music playing at a reasonable volume.  The drinks packed a punch.  There was a diverse array of diners, plenty of flat screen tvs, and lots of space.  I live about an hour and a half from this location, but I would gladly return there on my way through town in the future...
