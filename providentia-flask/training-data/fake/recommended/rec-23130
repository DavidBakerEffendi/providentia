I was very excited to try this restaurant for the first time. The atmosphere is very nice. The staff was friendly. I love how the menu was set up and what they had to offer. I really like that they only serve food that's in season and they have some organic things on the menu. My party and I enjoyed everything that we got even down to the drinks. I would say it's a definitely try the ginger soda. It was amazing! I will definitely be back again.
