Hot Diggity does not disappoint - and really takes care to make sure the meat and dairy-freers can experience their specials. I recently had this month's special dog, the Pilgrim Harvest, which can be vegan without butter on the roll and with a veg dog. It had wonderful brussels sprouts slaw and a sweet - but not too sweet sauce. Alongside I had the cauliflower soup, which was creamy and delicious without any dairy (just ask for it without sour cream or whatever cream situation goes on top). The dogs are filling, the staff is all super nice, and everyone understands what a vegan can and can't eat. We filled up (my partner with 2 doggies, me with one and a soup) for $20. Great deal and great food!
