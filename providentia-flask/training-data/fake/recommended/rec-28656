Yet another target that was on my food quest day. A place with small noms and lots of flavor! First off they're kinda like pmmes frites where you get a chicken finger and there's a lot of sauces but they also toss them in sauce. To tell you the truth go with the regular fingers and dip your sauce because it think it's a bit cheaper and I'm a fan of variety. DON'T GET LOST IN THE SAUCE! I got a few regular fingers, the chocolate bbq sauce, the tomato mayo sauce and funny enough the girl accidently made a general tso finger for me. The regular finger is very well fried, the skin didn't adhere to the chicken solidly which is actually good thing because that means they freshly bread their chicken in house and isn't frozen. The chocolate bbq sauce really stood out because I expected bbq sauce with the bitterness of dark chocolate (sorta like a chocolate stout) but this actually had a chocolatiness! The tomato mayo was solid but the general tso was actually quite amazing. It;s wasn't take out gen tso flavor but made you think about it. The spiciness was the right amount, it wasn't corn starch filled and fresh crunchiness of the finger skin complimented the sauce. This place is pretty good. I would probably come back to try some of the other flavors. I wouldn't make a meal out of it because it takes a lot of chicken fingers to get me full and this place averages about 2-3 bucks a finger. O yeah since I said finger so many times I have to say this as a shout out to my foody lady "Salad fingers!"
