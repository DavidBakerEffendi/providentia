3 stars seems a bit generous, but our waitress was polite. Upon walking in, this looks just like any other Mac Grill. However, that's where it ends. Service is excruciating slow for some reason. It wasn't even a full house! Dinner for 3 on a Saturday night, we didn't expect a speedy staff. However, it took close to 40 minutes before food reached our table!! The food was average at best. Chicken was a bit dry. When we asked for extra bread, that didn't come until we were almost done with our meal. It wasn't the server's fault. She came over to apologize about the bread. She told us they are almost ready. I don't think I'll go back to this location.
