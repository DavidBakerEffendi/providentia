Just left my first experience of fitler dr and I would grade them as an F+, I was the last table set at 953 pm and they took me without any thought or problem. The service was excellent even when I was the last person in the place. I had the Croquettes and Potato salad which was interested and delicious. Next I had the lamb ragu and since I've been practicing a salt free diet for awhile the entree seemed very salty to me. The sever took my meal to the chef and well after the place was closed a new meal was prepared. Still a little salty, but I think it might have just then been my Pallet or the meat itself, but it too was well prepared and delicious. Next I was offered dessert however not really took my eye. At no point was I ever rushed or "please sweet baby Jesus make him leave " from the staff. The F+ is for fast service, friendly staff and a fantastic dinning experience.
