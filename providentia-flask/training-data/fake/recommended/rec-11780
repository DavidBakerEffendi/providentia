I've finally had a chance to check it out here this past weekend.  Wait time of 10 mins wasn't that bad considering we (two of us) were there during prime time. We had the baked eggs with kale salad and biscuit and gravy.  Both dishes were considerably good.  Downside - wished the brunch menu offered more food selection.
