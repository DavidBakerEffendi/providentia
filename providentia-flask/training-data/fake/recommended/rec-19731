Not the best place if you want an intimate setting, but if you're in the mood for comfort food/communal dining, this is the place to go. The food is very heavy and good, so prepare yourself. You may want to skip the appetizers and just go straight for the entree. Their devilled eggs, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese are deliciously spicy. The bbq fried rice was also good. I didn't enjoy my burger as much, but food-wise, this place is a great justification for a food coma. Service was attentive and speedy. We got a table almost right away and I love their texting system for getting tables (just like Max Brenner's, except NOT an hour long wait, thank you.) My main complaint is the seating. If you're a big group, you'll easily get a good table and some "privacy." If you're a couple, however, you'll be seated at a table with other couples or groups. A very obnoxious and loud family sat next to us, not because they were dining there, but because they were waiting for a table...I guess they missed the Â seats outside specifically made for waiting ;) Other than that, I can't complain. This place is a good choice if you're in the area and ready for some food and drinks.
