First of all - let me start by saying that the concept of stuffed patties will always grab my attention. With that being said... The place is a bit small, but set up well. The service is phenomenal. We had a party of 6 and sat in the high booth table. We definitely overstayed our welcome, but we did not feel rushed out by the lady behind the counter. I got the original burger and bacon jam fries. The bacon jam fries were tasty. The original burger was okay. It took a while for me to find the cheese, but once I got to the cheesy goodness - I was a happy customer. Two qualms I did have with the burgers: 1. The patty was cooked a little more than what I am used to, but that is probably how they get the cheese to melt inside so that's understandable. 2. The bread was too flakey and a bit too dry. I think I got the brioche bun. I'm going to try the potato bread next time because... How can you ever go wrong with potato bread?
