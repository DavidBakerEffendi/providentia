Disappointed that Momofuku noodle bar had just closed for the night, I walked on over to the ssam bar. I wanted to experience the glory of David Chang. Since I was on expense account and eating alone, I saddled up to the bar. Â I started off with the the steamed buns with pork belly, hoisin, cucumber, and scallions. This was really good, the pork just melted. For my entree I ordered the marinated hangar steak ssam... I guess when it comes to ssam, I am your typical Korean who likes it the traditional way. I was definitely a little disappointed. So as I was eating at the bar by myself. David Chang is drinking a glass of wine right near me. And he asks how I like the food. I tell him the meat is good and the kimchi is not good. And he is like what?!?! Not good, why... I tell him it doesn't taste right, I wasn't a fan of the kimchi puree. Still have to get to the noodle bar.
