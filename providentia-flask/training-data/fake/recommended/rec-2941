It's about time I stopped in on Yelp to give Pizza Brain the FIVE stars it deserves. It's almost humorous to me that people actually bother writing reviews to complain about things like the lack of pepper flakes, high prices, or strange toppings. This place doesn't exist to fit the normal pizza shop mold! It's a completely unique pizza experience. From the moment you walk in until you're around the corner on your way home, the employees of Pizza Brain work to deliver the highest possible level of satisfaction not only due to their out of this world pies, but through their impeccable customer service. The dining area unparalleled, and the outdoor mural and seating is icing on the cake. Without a question, Pizza Brain is the ultimate destination, and will always be my number one recommendation to those looking for a good eat in Philadelphia.
