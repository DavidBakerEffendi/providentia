I really like Parc and I come here every year with the family before thanksgiving. The service is always fantastic, and the food is always amazing. We've tried the fish, burger, salads (soooo good!), chicken, it has all been amazing. The decor inside is nice and comfortable and really makes you feel like you're not in Philly. I recommend the shrimp salad, the trout, the burger, and the french onion soup. My family loved the green salad, they were all raving about it. I have become a strict vegetarian since my last visit in 2010, so my options were limited. However, I ordered the sauteed spinach and the beet salad, and both were fantastic and good sized. They may sound like simple dishes, but they still packed so much flavor. I hope that they change the menu up or add more vegetarian options so that I will be able to mix it up next year, but if not, I will still be pleased with what I ordered. No one has ever had a complaint here. I highly recommend this place (and if you are a large group I encourage you to make reservations). Also, when we came here one year on my birthday they brought out some cake with sparkler candles, it was really impressive and delicious!
