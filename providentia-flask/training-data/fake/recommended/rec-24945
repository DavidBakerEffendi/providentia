My boyfriend surprised me to a romantic dinner at Blue. He did good and so did they!! I was a very happy girl! We sat outside the ambiance was so beautiful for Â the next hour I didn't feel like I was in Staten Island! Steps away from the water lined with tiki lights. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. We had a bottle of Malbec which was delicious! We tried the Octopus App which had great flavor, the salad off the price fixed menu was surprisingly flavorful. The Veal entree was really on point. I was really pleased with my experience and service. I would have been fine just looking out at the water with my hunny and wine but the food and service definitely put it over the top! We will definitely be back!
