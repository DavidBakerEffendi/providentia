Had a nice meal here with some really good wine... good people watching as we sat on the sidewalk...they were pouring a great barolo by the glass that night.. food was good...not great but solid....a little pricey...had the truffle risotto, which was OK and the short ribs which were very sumptuous. Had a great antipasto before the meal would definitely go back...
