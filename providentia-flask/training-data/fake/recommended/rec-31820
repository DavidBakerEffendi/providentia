I'm not really sure where to start except... MEAT. And a whole big wall of wine. I recommend coming with a nicely stretched out stomach and a big appetite. For those who aren't familiar with the Brazilian churrasco way of eating, you get a red/green tag to tell the meat men to come bring you meat. They cut you off a slice and keep stopping at your table as long as your thing is turned green. It's hard to say whether this really deserves five stars. But for meat's sake, you at least need to save up the scratch to check this place out. It's well worth it. As long as you aren't vegetarian.
