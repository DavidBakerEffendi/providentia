I am so happy a new place opened in Fairmount. My friend and I ordered 1. Glasses of Wine $5.50 each 2. Roasted Cauliflower Salad- Seriously so delicious-Highly recommend 3. My friend ordered the Goat Cheese Leek Salad- very yummy as well 4. we both ordered the lamb for dinner- the lamb was very good as well as the eggplant mash. The broccolini that came with it was a little overpowering...but the dish was still enjoyable My friend and I think the next time we go we will order a bunch of small plates and salads. Â  Overall a very enjoyable meal.
