Wonderful every step of the way. The staff were incredibly gracious and gregarious. They catered to every request with a smile and made it quite clear our enjoyment of their food was their top priority. This kind of service is even more heart-warming when motivated by hospitality and pride, not an inflated price tag. The asparagus were enormous, caked in parmesan, and infused with butter on a cellular level. This is not subtle, dainty eating. This was big Italian shots to the face at every step, and it had me making faces I typically reserve for the bedroom. Pumpkin ravioli in butter, sage, rosemary and parmesan sauce: a bit heavy on the rosemary, but not so much it wasn't still very rewarding. Lamb ragout with porcinni mushrooms over pappardelle : the lamb had just a little more bite than the pasta and released rich tomato comfort. I easily cleaned every plate. The bread was good although the garlic toasts were a bit overwhelming. Overall earnest not exotic or exacting, but warm and rewarding. Despite valuing satiety over subtlety, they still made an artfully exemplary macchiato.
