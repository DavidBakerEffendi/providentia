Oh my word. I had resisted Il Bambino for a couple of weeks because I was sick of pork..and it had a big picture of a pig on it. I'm not sure why I had this logic and I'm shooting myself in the foot for doing so. I'm an idiot who thought it would be fun to be Kosher for 2 weeks just because I was tired of pig and somehow this translated into avoiding to this place. What they heck, Rachel? Thankfully, my friend took me here for lunch last Thursday. We had a great light lunch and a wonderful time. We ordered the anti-pasta first. The vegetables and cheeses were all laid out so beautifully. There were beets with goat-cheese (my favorite cheese), white beans with Parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, artichoke with a chopped olives, and I think tomatoes and a fresh mozzarella. So good - especially the artichokes. Everything seemed fresh and in season, especially the peppers. Then, my friend and I split two crostinis: one was a special - cured meat with garlic butter and piquillo peppers. It was great. A bit too much fire for my friend and I though, so we did a bit of scraping, which made it work out fine. Then we both had a goat cheese and honey crostini last. It was like a dessert crostini, so sweet and fresh. I am curious to know where they get their honey though. Prices were more than reasonable for lunch, and we both enjoyed sitting out in the back where they have made a really nice outdoor Â patio. Their dedication to fine meats and cheese was well-observed in their presentation and how the food tasted. This was definitely one of my most favorite places that I've been to in Astoria yet.
