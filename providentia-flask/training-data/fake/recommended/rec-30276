We went for weekday lunch on a long weekend and there was a 30 min wait before being seated. Weekend brunches tend to be worse. The service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere is homey but the music they were playing did not jibe with the rest of the place and was way too loud. The music would be more suited to a night time bar experience. I had the curried chicken salad which was quite good. My friend's grilled cheese and tomato soup was quite yummy as well. So the food made up for the wait. But would I wait the 1.5 hrs during weekend brunch? Nope.
