This place was so disappointing. My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and we were looking forward to trying this place considering it seemed highly rated on yelp. However, when we got there and started eating we realized we wished we didn't end up wasting out time with this place. First, the decor was a bit odd but we figured it was just their way of trying to be different, but what was disturbing was that there was a layer of dust and dirt on the blinds... Now the only reason why I bring this up is because I was sitting right next to it and couldn't help but thinking if their blinds are this dirty, what does the kitchen look like =/ Â  Yes, we could've sat somewhere else, but the point it is clean the restaurant so patrons aren't breathing that in and/or that's not going in the food. Then, we ordered drinks which were lack luster and way over priced for the size of the glass the drink was served in. We ordered the hummus plate (which was the only good thing about this place, but not enough for us to go back or to recommend this place to anyone), the mac and cheese, pita melt & the meatloaf.... Sad to say that all of the dishes had no flavor and were lack luster. The pita melt had barley any pesto, the mac and cheese looked like it was sitting under a heat lamp or microwaved to the point that the pasta was hard, and worse of all my boyfriends meatloaf sandwich was so dry and taste less that looking at it reminded me of cat food from a can... Needless to say I'm completely perplexed as to how this place has such high reviews, but I know that we will not be back and we don't recommend this place to anyone who wants to check out the seaport. There are better restaurants in the area with much nicer food.
