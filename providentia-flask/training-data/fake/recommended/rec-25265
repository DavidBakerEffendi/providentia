I went to Almond for brunch with our Nike team--12 loud hungry girls. Service was friendly and efficient. The biscuits that come with each table tasted like I had died and gone back to South Carolina. Authentic. Every one of us loved our choice. The huevos rancheros dish was the best I've had in the city. It comes in a little cast iron pan to keep the cheese melted and each bite warm. It's a fun, festive place, but not too loud where you can't hear your own friends. The side of bacon can feed four people, fyi...Sides are huge there.
