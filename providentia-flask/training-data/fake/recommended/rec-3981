Its just a diner, except with Tiffany glass on the walls, a few unusual menu items, and a ridiculously long line on the weekends. Â To answer an earlier review, asking where you can get an egg cream these days? LITERALLY ANY OTHER DINER. Bottom line: decent food and prices, not worth the weekend wait.
