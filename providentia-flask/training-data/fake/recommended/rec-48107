I've only been once but ordered Thali and filched across the table as well so I sampled a wide variety of dishes. Everything was excellent. I'm not in a position to refute other reviews but my experience was delicious food, delicately seasoned, delivered in five minutes, enough for a big eater, at a refreshingly low price, in a clean bright space. Everyone agrees the waitstaff is personable and professional, so I'll merely second that. I'm fussy about presentation and accoutrements but was impressed there as well. I will say that we were there for late lunch, which could be a different experience from dinner after dark. It's worth echoing that they close between meals. Arriving while they're closed is unfortunate, but so is arriving close to when they close and having to finish eating while others are turned away and the staff is patiently waiting for you to go, too. The check was ready when I asked for it, though, don't you know! I'll also say that India is a huge and disparate melange, of which Nepal is not a part. Ditto China. Anyone thinking south asian cuisine is defined by what's common in this country, or that nepalese is imitation indian, or syncretic indian/chinese, is likely to be confused and disappointed.
