I came in on a monday during a snow storm so it was pretty slow and laid back. Unfortunately,  I came here for the all you can eat steamed crab and they didn't have it. Boo.  I wish they would update their website. I got the red, white and blue special of six oysters and beer and the steamed mussels with garlic bread.  Everything was well seasoned and the oysters were nice and fresh. Unfortunately, two or three were a little mangled, but for eight dollars? Fantastic.
