Outrageously awesome every. single. time. And definitely better than all the places I've tried so far in the city. My favorite items on the menu: Lobster Mac and Cheese - they use shells instead of macaroni. The cheese is more stringy and thick creamy than milky. They use big chunks of lobster vs. cutting it up. Seriously, every bit is fantastic. Connecticut style Roll - simple and buttery with a mild old bay or some such spice-y sprinkle on type. A warm and toasty, and also buttery, roll. Fantastic. Cannot go wrong. Tuscan style Roll - Light basil vinaigrette and mesclun salad. Pleasantly different. I'm glad they added a new one and changed it up a bit. I've made the walking/subway trek here once, but have been lucky enough to procure a car the other times. The location is literally near nothing, and the quality at this location is somehow better than the truck - although, the truck is a very nice substitute, so the trek is worth it on a lovely day.
