Great place to grab a cheap lunch!   I would totally get their duck noodle soup since the duck is soft and flavorful.  The beef noodle soup was somewhat standard.  You can order with hand cut noodles, which are like thick, slivers of thicker, chewy dough, or your standard round noodles. Their dumplings were delicious, fried, I got an order to go!  Their noodles in peanut sauce is really good too!  I will get that again.
