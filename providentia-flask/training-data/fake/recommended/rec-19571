I so badly wanted this to be a 5 star destination!  The decor reminded me of New Orleans (my hometown) and I had been looking forward to going to Beau Monde ever since my co-worker mentioned it.  So, we went on a nice night and my husband and I sat outside.  It felt so perfect especially after our glass of wine.  I ordered a Ratatouille crepe (thought I'd be different) and he got one with prosciutto.  Both were good.  We opted to share dessert........the Nutella crepe (it is supposed to be with bananas but we got them on the side). FYI...my husband is a Nutella freak.  We haven't been buying it lately because he has  been cutting back and he's known to eat right out of the container until it is gone.  Anyway, so we were really anticipating this dessert crepe. He takes one bite and immediately knows that it is not really Nutella but some other chocolate hazelnut product.  I offered him the rest of my wine to keep him from freaking out on the server (it worked) but I heard about it the whole walk home.  Ok, the fact that it wasn't authentic Nutella I can actually forgive my problem was that it was stingily smeared on the inside and that I cannot forgive.  Bottom line is that for the price Beau Monde can afford to be a little more generous.
