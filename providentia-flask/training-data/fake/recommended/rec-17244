Jose Tejas is the only place I'm happy to wait 3 hours for a table. Why? BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT. My favorite things to order are: Tostada Grande with chicken or beans with ranch dressing. The ranch dressing is so good at Jose Tejas that I usually ask for some with the chips and salsa. It has dill in it! Fajitas- You just can't go wrong that! There have been times where I want to tell them to skip the protein and just give me the onions. Swordfish Tacos- Everything about this is amazing. I love the side salad and avocado that come with it! The avocado has a spicy mango salsa on and it I could eat that every day! Loud, fun, entertaining and great food.
