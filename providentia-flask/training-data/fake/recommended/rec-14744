I really like the atmosphere, but really bad food. I went to Vivo to watch the Euro Cup and first of all the food was horrible. The food was so bland, had no taste and only thing that was good to eat was bread, which is sad. The drinks were reasonable, but I was upset because I liked the place, but bad food.
