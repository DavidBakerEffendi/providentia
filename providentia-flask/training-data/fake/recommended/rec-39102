I feel like my 3 star review must be undeserved after reading all of the fabulous reviews for Kefi, but I just wasn't amazed. The food was good, and the prices were good, but that's all it did for me. It didn't blow me away. If you want a cheaper dinner in the city, give Kefi a try. The food is creative and the atmosphere inviting. Other than that, I just wasn't as impressed as I expected to be. Our server was a bit slow to come to our table. I believe we waited at least 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. I understand that it was busy, but it was a weeknight and we could have at least been served water while we waited. I ordered the fingerling potatoes which had a funny spicy taste but the yummy feta on top made up for it. For my entree I ordered the ravioli. Honestly, the price could not have been beat, but I feel like the flavor was slightly lacking. I'd come here again if someone suggested it, but it won't be on my must-go list.
