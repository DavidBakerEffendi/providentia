can't stress more on what a lovely brunch spot! they've got your staples, but with a nice greek/mediterranean twist at such reasonable prices! perfectly poached egg bennies that include home fries, cappuccino, and oj for $12. awesome! brunch specials like steak n eggs, pumpkin pancakes, some fried dough that's so good (sweet n salty, chewy n crunchy, like a big fat pancake with all the tastes and textures) with eggs on top...all ranging from $9-11. great service (cute waiters), definitely try to sit outside as inside is very dim. Â go around 11am you'd be fine, anytime after...be prepared to wait, but definitely worth it!
