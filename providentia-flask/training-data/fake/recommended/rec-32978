Went here on Saturday night with a few friends that live in the area.  Food was GREAT!! 1.  Chicken wings, healthy and crispy, baked in the oven with rosemary, you could eat a lot of them and not feel like your cheating on your diet!! 2.  Prosciutto  and Mozz.....enough said, I'm a sucker for prosciutto! 3. PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA!  We got a sampling with extras to spare to take home, ---white   pizza with truffle and mushroom THIS is a must, AMAZING!  ----margarita (I like the sauce) -----pesto with fresh tomatoes.  Pizza was crispy and a good ratio of sauce/cheese.  You can ask for well done for extra crispy too!! Lots of drink choices, I had a cucumber martini, very good.  And good wine list! Everyone was very nice and welcoming when I first arrived.  Being from New York and loving Grimaldis pizza I was excited to try the new restaurant.  I was surprised at how big the restaurant was, and liked that there was a separate bar area, will be good if you needed to bring kids and didn't want to be near others drinking!   In the main dining room I loved the mural of New York, it really made me reminisce about the area and where the original Grimaldis is! I will certainly be back!!!
