A great, though loud, place to have a few drinks and grab a bite. It's a bit tough to find a spot, especially if you want to eat, but people there seem to take the communal seating policy to heart. My wife and I went on a Friday night and cozied up with another group until a table opened up. If you're going with more than a person or two, it might take you a bit longer. Once you're seated, it's a solid draft list, and the bartenders seem pretty knowledgable and willing to let you sample before you order. The food is also very good - we had the wings, pulled pork, and the wild mushroom and sage pot pie (in deconstructed form so there's no soggy pastry). All of them were worth ordering again. My only criticism is that it's cash only, which is a bit of an inconvenience when you're ordering dinner in addition to drinks. So in short: good beer, good food, nice setting, and right next to the 15 St-Prospect Park subway. We'll be returning soon.
