If you're going to check out this lively gig, you must sit at the counter. No point in sitting at the table here! The atmosphere is VERY lively and very engaging! I love the spirit and energy you get. As expected, portions are pretty small, spent about $50/person not including drinks. The meats aren't their forte, rather check out their variety of grilled veggies w/ salt and the fish. Quite delicious food. Order the Kamameshi dish (for two) to fill you up on rice. Believe me when I say that holding that paddle is not easy. They let us try holding the paddle with a dish, and it really is quite heavy to hold from the end of the paddle. I only managed to hold one dish at a time, 2 just wasn't feasible! Bottom line, a bit pricey, yet worth the entertainment. And probably not the best to go in a large group otherwise you'll be waiting forever for seats at the counter.
