I've had the dessert crepes plenty of times from this great truck on Temples campus, but this week I actually tried one of their meal crepes. Â I ordered the gyro crepe and it was incredible. For $6 I got a huge portion of lamb and veggies in a fresh made crepe and a bottle of soda. The flavors were great and well balanced. The ratio of meat to ratios allowed you to taste everything. In the past when I've had desserts, I would get the s'more (marshmallow and chocolate) which is always a gooey but delicious mess. Their LevelUp reader was down (boo) but when I first mentioned that I didn't have cash and to cancel the order, the woman offered to "catch me the next time" before my friend lent me the money. In the past year I've been to the Creperie maybe three times since it's not the easiest location from work and I'm not a Temple student. The fact that the woman was so quick to be helpful in a bad personal situation because her reader was down just makes me like the business even more.
