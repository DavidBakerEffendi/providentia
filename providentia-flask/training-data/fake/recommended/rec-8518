I'm a huge Benna's fan, and I love b2 almost as much -- it just depends on the atmosphere I'm looking for/purpose of my visit. I head to b2 when I need VEGAN SOFT SERVE with rainbow sprinkles (!!!), smoothies, or when I'm with others and we want to sit around and eat yummy sandwiches and need a little more space to spread out (b2 is bigger than Benna's). All of the staff I've encountered at b2 are sweet, outgoing, and attentive. The outdoor seating is lovely in nice weather. There are also large windows that make the place open and bright inside. I've seen b2 get crowded, but I've never had a problem finding a seat. Also, the P.O.P.E. is right across the street, in case you need a drink after your bagel? Just saying.
