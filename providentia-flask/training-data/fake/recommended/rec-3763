I was lured into coming to this restaurant because I was told they serve adventurous and modern dinner options.  When our group arrived, we were promptly seated.  The restaurant was busy and the noise level was lively without being obnoxious.  Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.  We ordered the kangaroo appetizer to share because we did, after all, come to be adventurous.  I ordered the venison loin and my friends got the lamb sirloin and roasted duck breast.  We also got an order of smoked Brussels sprouts to share.  Our waiter, per the knowledgeable comment earlier, paired our dinners with wine perfectly.   Overall, the food was pretty tasty.  Not going to say it is the best thing I have ever had but very good and unique.  The flavors all worked well together but I thought it was a little on the bland side.  Could have just turned the flavor volume up a little more.   Personally, my favorite part was the bathroom.  They were clean but what made them special were the mini motel-sized bars of soap with the Public logo sticker on them that lined the walls (I took one as a souvenir).   Was the food good?  Yes.  Would I go back?  Probably not.
