Recently in Philadelphia for a day to visit family and friends, I was invited here for pre-dinner cocktails.  Owned by Woody (the prior owner of the dimished namesake gay bar Woody's), this bar-slash-restaurant pleasantly kicks it up a notch with an appealing (if constantly crowded) interior, an oblong rich wooden bar reminiscent of Cheers, and a dining area extending through to the back of the space.   What's memorable about this invention is that it 1) picks up the neighborhood by making good use of a space which has housed many failed restaurants; and 2) blends in with the revitilization of the 12th and 13th Street corridors that compose Philadelphia's LGBT neighborhood.  The bartenders shine, and they are more than pleasant, accomodating and deserving of their tips (albeit very busy during happy hour).  The drinks (as previously mentioned in another review) pack a whallop.  I had four rum and cokes (purchased by various friends during my time there) and consumption induced a comatose-like sleep later that night. There is a fly in the ointment, however: the food.  For such a fine interior, the food (pork shank, lobster and pasta in a cream sauce) were memorable only in that the dishes were horridly bland.  I would sooner seek flavor by running my tongue along a carpet in an inner-city needle exchange clinic.  The upside: the waiter was pleasant. Final thoughts: Great for drinks, company, and atmosphere.  Leave it at that and everyone will have a wonderful time.  Three stars for the business, an additional star for the pleasant staff.
