We made reservations for a group of 12 for lunch, and when we showed up, the table was not ready.  We only had to wait around for a couple minutes though as they prepped.   For appetizer we shared the Da Mikele pizza: truffle oil, mushrooms, prosciutto and mozzarella cheese.  It surprised me how delicious and flavorful it was, considering it had no sauce.  People all wanted seconds.  I had the squid ink pasta as my entree.  Excellent - not fishy at all, and the pasta absorbed the tomato/pesto sauce very nicely.  They did not skimp on the seafood either; it was the perfect portion. The place is very cute and cozy.  I can totally see this being a great date night location.  Would love to come back again.
