Impeccable service, food presentation and a great combination of flavors. We were seated at the more quiet, under the escalators dining room. Service was prompt, un-intrusive, and friendly - a rare combination. Presentation was pleasing and the flavors were well put together. Noise level was good so we could carry on a conversation without straining or having to compete with the conversation at the table next to us. Valet parking was a good addition though there are plenty of parking garages arround
