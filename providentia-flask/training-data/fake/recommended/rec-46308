Foody heaven.. this place.. oh, this place. First: the ambiance is beautiful, I really fell in love with it. Our server was fantastic, made great recommendations and was very entertaining but really knew the right balance between being helpful and pushy. The drinks were all fantastic, really unique and delicious. I got the apple cider mimosa and could have had ten more. The food: YES. We split the squash ravioli-amaaaaaazing and the lobster chili-suuuuper aaaamaaaaazing. What made them both was really the sauce, especially with the lobster chili (ask for extra bread to dip it in). So rich, so spicy, really incredible flavors. They also brought out bread with seasoned butter (delicious-I hope you're seeing a pattern), and these little.. cream cheese bite things. We literally talked about those things for days. I would eat a bucket of those, in public, shamelessly. Savor them! For dessert we got the pumpkin creme brulee and the s'mores.. the brulee was very good, light and not overwhelming, but the presentation on it was beautiful. The s'mores was so, so good but very rich and chocolatey.. graham cracker ice cream and a perfectly burned marshmallow sealed the deal. Now, this type of restaurant I generally refer to as a "burger king restaurant" (aka it's delicious but you're so hungry when you leave you have to stop at burger king) I was surprised to find that I was totally satisfied when I left, even though the portions were not very large. Seriously, go here. Go here now.
