Great little NoHo gem. I went to this place for the first time about 6 months ago, and I keep coming back. Fantastic Italian dishes. The delicious fresh pasta is most of the reason I keep coming back. One of those places that doesn't need to take reservations because they have the steady crowd Thursday-Sunday. There is not a lot of space, so the friendly host will typically have you wait anywhere in the range of 20-35 minutes at the bar next door (Von Bar, which also has a great downstairs area for private parties!). Onto the food. Typically I start off with the gnocco frito, which are these puff fried dough squares that they serve with a choice of italian cold cuts or cheese. I have only gotten the cold cuts which comes with prosciutto, sorpressata, and capicola (I think). My Favorite Pastas: 1. Gramigna con Salciccia e Pepperone -- Fresh pasta with sausage and peppers in a light sauce. Fantastic. 2. Tagliolini ai Frutti di Mare - a thick lingine with mussels, clams, calimare and shrimp. Great shellfish and pasta. I typically don't dive into the entrees, because the pasta and an appetizer is enough, but the thin slice filet mignon with rosemary is very good and the adriatic fish and shellfish stew is apparently good as well. Perfectly priced for the city. Went in the other day with two buddies, got sparkling water, a bottle of lambrusco, appetizer, our entrees, and capuccinos, $114. You can't do better than that! Great place, enjoy.
