We rarely eat here because my husband does not like it, but he decided to give it another try.  Never.  Again. The food was ok but not great, but the thing we can not overlook was the extremely rude service.  The minute she seated us, the waitress asked if she could get us anything from the bar.  When we both ordered soft drinks, she rolled her eyes and made a face.   When my husband's iced tea glass was empty, she never once offered to refill it, and then she took it away entirely while he was still eating.   We felt rushed and completely disregarded.  I have never had such terrible service anywhere.  We will most certainly not be back.
