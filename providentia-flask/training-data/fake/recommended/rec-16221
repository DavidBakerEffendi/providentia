A teeny, tiny little space.  I came on Sun. afternoon so the 4 little tables were empty.  I could see this is more of a take-out place.  But it was the best tofu I may have ever eaten.  Like really: EVER.    I ordered the Jeera House Salad which came with tofu and peanut dressing. The peanut dressing was a little too thick but tasty.  Prefer a thinner salad dressing.   The tofu in the salad was so amazingly creamy tasting. For my main meal I got the Vegetable Tofu with Green Curry.  Again, I've never had tofu so light and tender and creamy.  Like what kind of tofu is this?  Melts in your mouth.  Wow.  Just being nit picky about the curry dish: I prefer my curry dishes on a flat plate instead of in a bowl like soup so I can mix it with my rice.   Great taste though & I liked the red rice too. I've been to Thai Taste and Bangkok Garden and ordered tofu dishes: Thai Taste food was pretty good the tofu was a bit chewy.  Good Red Curry though.   Bangkok Gardens had bloody awful tofu!  It was watery/oily inside and so over cooked it was just terrible.  I wouldn't go back to Bangkok Garden again. When I want a tofu vegetable dish I'm getting take out from Jeera Thai.  Exceptional.
