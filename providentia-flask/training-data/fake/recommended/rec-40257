I was an oyster virgin when i arrived at Oyster House. I was nervous, excited, i wasn't sure if it would hurt.... it didn't. We had a great set of bartenders during the time of day when only the raw bar was available so it was kinda like.. sh*t or get off the pot!!! The bartenders offered up some great reccomendations, and i'll never look back. I now know i adore oysters, with anything on em... or nekked. The shirmp cocktail was also banging, and the cocktail sauce was spicy and sweet and buttery. really great. I can't wait to go back! However, i bascially came in hungry, and left hungry for $100... but it was fun to do!
