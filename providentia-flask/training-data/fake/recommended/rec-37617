I always pass by this spot on my way to the office. I felt pizza on my mind and wanted yo try it. Well the outcome was quiet amazing. Decor:- Really old rustic Italian spot. Like cappuccino machine by the bar. The fans on the ceiling is an artwork. Service :- i have to admit hands down that service was amazing. The gentle man checked on us time to time in a polite manner that would hardly interrupt a conversation. Attentive staff. I am impressed. Food:- Amazing pizza work. Its thin slices of pizza are simple amazing light & flavorful. We ordered mushroom porcini caramelized Â onions. Heaven !!!! Tried there appetizers simple buffala, basil & tomatoes. Loved it. Also tried veal lasagna. Super tender smooth silky. Final verdict:- amazing Italian spot with classic rustic decor & an artwork with some humor to it. Service was tip top. Food was amazing but the menu lacked some varieties. It was good tasty food and i would go again in a heart beat if my cravings were for particular dish but menu being limited makes it a bit less or short.
