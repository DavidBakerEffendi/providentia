I have eaten here a few times. I have a couple of friends who really seem to like the place, and they usually suggest it as a place to meet up. I notice that the beer prices are a little high, but whatever, judging by the looks of this place they cater more towards the restaurant side of the business and probably don't pull in vast sums of profit from the bar. The first thing that really starts to annoy me however is the music. It was so loud. Here it is, a week day, the place has a decent amount of people in it, mostly eating, and the music is just blaring. So much so that i couldn't hear a word form the person across from me. It seemed over the top. We order food, and it's O.K. I might even say good, but I have eaten at way to many awesome little Mexican joints in South Philly to say that this place had great food. Not that I expected better, I mean, a place on 15th street is Center City, you can't expect the best damn Mexican food ever. But I heard all this hype about their food, so I guess my expectations were a little higher then normal. Overall, the place is fine to drop in for a quick bite, especially if you have been getting hammered at one of the bars nearby and have a serious craving for a burrito. But that is it.
