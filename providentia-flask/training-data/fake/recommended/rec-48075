This is one of the last places to both eat well and chill. Their brunches are ideal for those who take advantage of no time requirements, because the service may not be "en garde," but they are considerate. The brunches are really delicious, and there are great vegetarian options. It can be very cozy in the cold months. During the warmer months, they have a great back garden--a treasure spot.
