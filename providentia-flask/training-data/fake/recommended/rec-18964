Very accommodating!  On a Friday, I called them at 4pm to make a reservation for 8 at 9pm, not only did they arrange this for me, but they were very kind and hospitable the whole while.  They left us be, didn't hover.  The wine was delicious and the food was just what you'd expect in an upscale French wine bar: small, flavourful, and served rustically. Music was a bit loud but that meant I could rage all night, sitting on the couch, without anyone truly noticing. I loved it.
