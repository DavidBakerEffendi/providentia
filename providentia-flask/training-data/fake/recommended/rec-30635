Really, really disappointing. I've lived in the neighborhood for years and have always wanted to come here. I brought the husband and my friend from out of town. I ordered a chicken dish, yawn. Had little to no seasoning, not delicious at all. My husband ordered a steak and the cut of meat was complete garbage. Knowing that they butcher their own meats and own a butcher shop themselves, he thought this would be a great bet, not so. Tough, gristly, really disappointing. My girlfriend's pasta dish was drowned in rosemary, I could tell she hated it. I think the thing that was so awful was that in this economy, we go out to eat so rarely these days. To spend $100 on this meal was really heartbreaking.
