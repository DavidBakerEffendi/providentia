Being in New York and wanted to venture for something different than usual Korean Restaurant Menu Food, we saw this place on yelp and wanted to try it.  It's pretty much like a Cafeteria with Korean and Japanese food and drink.  They have the cold and hot food section where you fill it up and pay however it weight was.  They also have lunch pack food ($4-8) and Korean side dishes ($3 each).  We tried variety of different hot and cold dishes.  I like the Kim Chi, egg cake and clear noodle.  Overall, the food was average.  We paid $ 24 bux for 2 boxes of food, 1 miso ($1) and 1 black rice ($1).  In general, this is a good place to grab for quick meal or if you don't want to cook then it's good to grab whatever you need and head home.  But to eat like dinning in Korean Restaurant with many given side dishes, then you may have to pay more here for that, since each side dishes are $3 each in a container.  They also sell Sake, variety of beer and can drinks.  The place is crowed and the line to pay for food is a bit long even though we were there 8 PM.
