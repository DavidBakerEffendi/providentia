Pretty solid Chinese take out place. Nothing amazing, but the prices are good and you can order either a full or half portion, plus its easy to park right in front, unlike some of the places downtown. When you order on the phone they ask if you want white or brown rice, which initially excited my girlfriend and I because we try to eat healthy, but when they say brown they actually mean fried, so thats not really beneficial health-wise.
