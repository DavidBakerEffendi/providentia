I've only heard good things about this place, so we decided to try it. Perhaps it's best for sushi. We had Chinese dishes only, which were decent tasting (not great), but came with nothing other than white rice (no combination meals like most Chinese restaurants). Â The prices were on the expensive side for the amount of food we got. We'll probably try this place again for take-out only as the take-out menu is far less expensive than dining in.
