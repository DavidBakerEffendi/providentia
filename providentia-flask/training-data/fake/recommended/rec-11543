Food experience is three stars, but that is offset by everything else about this restaurant, which was excellent. Great service from the get go. While we waited for the entire party to get in, the server handed us water and gave us seating at the bar. Everyone behind the bar seemed very professional and polite, so good vibes already. The restaurant itself was beautiful. Very homey and rustic, which is my type of place. Buvette also has an outdoor area, which was full by the time we got there, but it would've added an additional touch to the experience I think if we sat outside. Food is pricey and the portions are small. I don't know if this is because of the level of the restaurant or if this is a French style, but I was definitely far from full after finishing my meal. The food was very tasty though. Presentation was good as well. Not sure if I'd come back again, but highly recommended for anyone who hasn't gone yet.
