Little secret tucked away in the Upper East Side. Yes it makes grand coffee and yes it serves great panini. The kicker is that it's like a tiny piece of Rome picked up from Italy and dropped into the heart of NYC only moments from the park. If you are italian and are feeling homesick, this will give you a dose of home. Try some of the cakes and there are some good vegetarian options also. Enjoy! Bonus tip: check out their wine collection!
