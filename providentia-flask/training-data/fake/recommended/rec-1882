This place is definitely pricey so just be sure you're up to it before hand. Dinner for two- easily 150 bucks after tax/tip without drinks. The food is really good and gets 5 stars in my book. On the other hand, I don't know why they rave about their brussel sprouts- in the end they are still just brussel sprouts. I wish I had ordered a different appetizer. Portions are also small. The kebabs are definitely delicious. They aren't your average run of the mill kebabs. There is certainly some additional effort being put into the flavoring, spices, and cooking. Are they worth 30 bucks? I'm not sure, but I probably won't be coming back. They aren't that much better that it justifies costing 3x as much. Then again, the food ins't the only reason people are coming here. Half of your money is going towards the nice decor and elaborate setup plus being able to tell other people that you ate here, so before we forget, let me tell you that I ate here before you. My guess is that 99% of the time the seating is great. The time I went there I got seated next to the kitchen door... a very busy kitchen door at that. The lighting is a bit too dim in certain areas. I have normal eyesight and I don't wear glasses, but it was difficult to even see the details of the food I was eating. A coke costs more than 3 dollars and since it's so dim the waitress can't even tell when you've finished it so she doesn't bring you another one. Our waters also didn't get refilled, probably for that same reason. They take reservations through open table and I liked that they pay attention to additional requests that you make online, eg booth seating or embarrassing someone for a birthday. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The service is also really fast. From start to finish we were there probably less than an hour. Overall, this place is great, I just don't think it's worth the money. Cut the price in half and it might be nice for a romantic evening or celebration of some sort.
