Been a patron here since I first met my future wife 6 years ago and yes it was her that had brought me here. Over the 6 years the food quality never diminished even a little. We always order the Wood Smoked Salmon Salad which is big enough to share as an appetizer. And my girl will always get favorite Mushroom Ravioli which she swears is the best she's ever had anywhere. If they ever took those off the menu, I think our motivation for coming here would be completely wiped out. I usually get a chicken breast plate. Having the Indonesian Chicken today and the chicken is done perfectly. Never too dry. Sometimes I would order the Lemon Chicken and it is quite good but may be a bit too sour for some (like my girl).
