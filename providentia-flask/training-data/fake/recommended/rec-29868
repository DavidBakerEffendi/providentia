This place is legit!  The most authentic, traditional beef brisket noodles east of the Mississippi!  Vegetable stir fried noodles are also excellent.  I got takeout, and you can tell they care a lot about their food, because they asked whether I would be consuming the noodles within the half hour.  I said no, so she said she would pack the noodles separate from the soup!  When We had the food about 45 minutes later, food was still hot and delicious!!  They care about their food!  I'll definitely come back to eat in and do more takeout.
