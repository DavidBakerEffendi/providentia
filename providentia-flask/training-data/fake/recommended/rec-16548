Ardesia, I was wrong about you. So, so, wrong. I decided to give this place another go as a friend and I were leaving the Armory Show at Pier 92/94. Ardesia was the closest around to grab a bite and drink from. Â We ordered the artichoke crab dip and the duck bahn mi. I happily devoured both, while washing it down with a Magner. I would also have to say that the service here is always great and inviting. I don't know his name, but every time I've been here I've been helped by the gentleman with the glasses. He's always been very helpful when anyone I was with needed recommendations or had questions about the menu. He also happily rewarded me with my free glass of Rose for my third Foursquare check-in, while usually I feel kind of cheap and lame for trying to scheme for free drinks with my e-coupon. Speaking of third time visits. My third time was for a friends birthday. A friend of mine wanted to have a surprise party for his girlfriend, and I recommended Ardesia. We were a party of about 20, and they were very accommodating. They allowed us all to open our own tabs to avoid confusion, and were very good remembering the owner of each tab (See! All Asians don't look alike!). I would also have to say that this place is great for a big group on a Saturday night. I think it's too far from the train that it just doesn't get packed. Ardesia you have become a regular stop for me. When I'm all the way by the Westside Highway that is.
