Went back the other night. The waiter remembered I liked Rose, and offered me a new one to try (sensational). As my date wasn't in a garlic mood, the mussels weren't an option (quelle horreur!) - which gave me the opportunity to try the steak tartare... Which is also absolute heaven. The addition of harissa to the traditional spices was a shock at first; it wasn't until the introduction of the arugula-based salad that my palate exploded with a full compliment of flavors that now make this, for me, the steak tartare standard for excellence -- -- and make me add a fifth star to my prior review. I'm going to take this menu slow, and trust that every small plate on offer will impress me - and fellow yelpers -- just as much.
