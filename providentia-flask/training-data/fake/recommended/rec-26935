Took my fiance to Bouley for her birthday and she described the night as magical. Maybe it was the apples in the entryway. I dunno, I'm a cynic and I liked the food but perhaps the servers were a little too attentive and fussy. We received a number of complimentary dishes from the kitchen and take-home lemony bread after dinner. We had actually left the restaurant already but a nice young lady chased after us to hand us a little bag of lemon-bread. The space is comfortable and the noise level during dinner is acceptable. I thought it was odd that Bouley's men's bathroom was leaking but maybe it's fixed now.
