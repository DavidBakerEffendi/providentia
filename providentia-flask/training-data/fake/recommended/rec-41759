I have been here a few times with big groups of friends and our immediate go to is the bo ssam pork shoulder! Serving up to 10 ppl, the shoulder is always perfectly cooked, satisfying and a true culinary delight! I have never left hungry when visiting Momofuko's! The venue itself is perfect for small or large groups and the staff is accommodating and knowledgeable. I'm dying to try their duck rotisserie in the near future! This is a definite must if you're looking for a great food deal for a large group - not to mention the food is delicious!
