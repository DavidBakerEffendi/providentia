I come to Joya every now and again when I'm visiting friends in the neighborhood. Overall, I've found the service is good, food is good, atmosphere is good. I've never been WOW-ed but never really disappointed, either. My go-to thai dish is vegetable red curry (boring, I know) and that's usually what I order here -- they do that damn-fine. Can't speak to much else, but I say give it a go.
