Screw the paninis - get the crostinis! (At least, I prefer high content-to-bread ratios). We ordered a bunch of crostinis to share, and unfortunately I will not go into an intelligent critique of any of them, since they were all delicious - just go and enjoy. Drinks - I'm not a big beer person, but I fell in love with Crabbies Ginger Beer. It's unfortunate that Crabbies isn't more commonly available. Service - friendly, chill, cute. The place itself is laid back (but it's busy, so make your reservations and get there on time.) Price - well worth what I paid. Nice to have a break from city prices. I generally don't like going to the same restaurant twice, but I'm definitely making the trek back here for ginger beer and crostinis.
