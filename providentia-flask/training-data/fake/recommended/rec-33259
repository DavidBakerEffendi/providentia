I've had both brunch and dinner here. I'm always very happy. It is pretty hard to go wrong with warm chocolate croissants fried goat cheese with honey. If you are there for dinner the friend brussels sprouts are delicious. One caveat, the service at dinner is terribly slow. You go here for the food, not the service.
