Went to Clinton St. Baking Company for the second time last night. The food is good and very comforting. I was surprised we got a table right away. My crowd and eye were using Google offers and ordered some other things on the menu too. The girl refilling our water, however, spoiled the meal for the most part. Before we ordered, my friend asked if she preferred the Po' Boy or the Chicken & Waffles. She responded with "Ugh, our chicken and waffles are not good, get the Po' Boy" (When we were already ordering the chicken & waffles for the table). She then proceeded to say "Our chicken & waffles aren't good..have you been to...." Then she caught herself, before promoting other restaurants inside of her place of work! I was shocked! I am a marketing/branding girl at heart and could think of 1,000 different ways she could have talked up the Po Boy without ruining the idea of the chicken & waffles. By the way - I still love the chicken and waffles.. Anyway, turns out she gave me a nasty look as we left (she's the unattractive Asian girl with a puss on her face so you know to avoid her). If I was in charge, I'd let her go immediately. There are too many people who can do her job well than do the kind of job she did. If the owner reads this and would like to discuss my experience further, I am more than happy to continue convo.
