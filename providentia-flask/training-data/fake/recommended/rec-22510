Expensive for Hotpot.  I think all hotpot are about the same.  Raw food into hot water.  The presentation of the food is nice.  They put flowers on the dishes.  I end up leaving the place paying 35 with a groupon coupon.  I can get an all you can eat hotpot for less than 25 bucks. I think it is over rated.
