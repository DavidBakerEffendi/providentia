I recently moved here, so Beyond Sushi was the place that I decided to stop by to get my first taste of New York sushi. Beyond Sushi has a very unconventional approach to sushi; made entirely with all vegan, guilt-free ingredients, adding creatively zesty flavoring (such as kiwi -- something I've never heard of in sushi before) that will make the flavors almost dance in your mouth. I ordered Combo #2, which includes 2 8-piece rolls and 2 individual rolls. My choices where the Spicy Mang and the roll of the month that included sun-dried tomatoes -- I forget the name. My individual rolls were the seaweed roll and the mango roll. Because the roll of the month special is slightly more expensive than the normal rolls, there was about a $1.50 dollar extra charge, but it was for sure worth it. The prices were reasonable; the sushi, filling and visually appealing; the ingredients, fresh and healthy; and the combinations, highly original. We got the table closest to the register, so we were able to enjoy watching our sushi get made as well. The only caveat I would give is that seating is pretty limited, so either come between meals or order to-go to eat somewhere else at Union Square. It definitely did not disappoint - I'll be back.
