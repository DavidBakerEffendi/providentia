Very delicious food & very friendly service! They serve coffee, breakfast & lunch.  The sandwiches are great across the board! One is yummier than the other so it's a win win regardless of what you order, the pulled pork and grilled cheese are two of my favorites.  The pastries are delicious as well, from the muffins to the cookies, brownies and biscotti!  Breakfast options and salads are great too!  Definitely a regular now! :)
