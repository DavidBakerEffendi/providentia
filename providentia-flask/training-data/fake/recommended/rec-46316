This was my third visit to an Iron Chef restaurant (Morimoto and Flay). A party of five went to celebrate my best friend's 30th birthday and divulged in Marc Forgione's $99 tasting menu. Unlike my previous visits to Iron Chef restaurants I felt like the price of admission was worth every dollar. Enough reviews across the web cover the food (notably the Chili Lobster with Texas Toast) so I'll skip the details. I did want to note that: 1. The tasting menu offers a wide variety of food and palette cleansers. It's easy to see that Mr. Forgione put alot of time and thought into developing his outstanding tasting menu. I was especially impressed by the various palette cleansers (herbs, shot of 6 Point beer, sorbet). A small detail yes..but one that shows the effort and care that was put into designing the tasting menu 2. The service was outstanding. It took a few minutes before we received menus and water (possibly because we arrived 30 minutes before our reservation?) but after we placed our order the 7 courses were rolling out one after another. In comparrison to my previous experience with Morimoto's tasting menu there was significantly less down time in between courses. Our satisfaction with Marc Forgione's food was palpable and we left wanting to come back for more. It's safe to say that Marc Forgione's is one of the 3 best restaurants that I've ever dined at and I have no reservations in recommending it to any food enthusiast.
