We had an excellent meal about 2 weeks ago. I live the West Village as we have a few favorites in the area and we can add this to the list. We ordered three tapas and split and entree. It is cozy (tight) inside but the decor and overall vibe inside makes it easy to relax. Our server was very attentive and very knowledgable not only about the dishes but also the wine choices. Maybe I am biased because I live the area so much but this place won me over. Please my attached photos for the tapas we enjoyed!
