A cute spot where one can get yummy things like pumpkin spiced pancakes with cinnamon yogurt with a plate of bacon and coffee and it's all decently priced. A cute spot where you can see old friends from years ago, and realize that even though time passed, the friendship is still there. A cute spot to have your picture taken. A cute spot for brunch, coffee, or whatever. I miss this place, a lot.
