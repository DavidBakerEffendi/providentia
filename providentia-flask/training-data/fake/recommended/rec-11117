Maybe we got lucky with the server, but the litany of complaints about the service didn't reflect a recent Friday night experience. Endless chips and salsa, plus side o' guacamole, came out fast and were joined by a couple of fine craft brews (small but good selection). The guac, pico de gallo and salsa verde were all good, and they rub a bit of spice on the chips for extra kick, which was a nice touch. Is there a better app for $4 within a 3-mile radius? Probably not, but you tell me. As others have noted, the burritos aren't what many of us are used to. This isn't a Mission-style torpedo weighing in at 5 pounds, exploding out of the foil with a delectable mess of beans, rice, guac, sour cream plus the meat of your choice. No, it's not that at all. But that's okay. I didn't have any trouble embracing, then devouring, the two svelte carnitas-filled and un-grilled tortillas. I dressed 'em up in the guac and salsa and had no complaints. And I didn't even miss the overstuffed feeling that comes as the secret side with burritos gordos. My vegan buddy had the veggie wings that everyone raves about, and the BBQ seitan. I tried them both, and liked them, but taking my advice on vegetarian/vegan food is really a waste of all of our time, Mr. Spicoli. So take it from Vegan Mike: he loves them. Â  Excellent service throughout: attentive but not rushed. I don't know how some people got duped or upsold on the $5 rice and beans side. I know these are usually in the burrito, but the menu lists them separately with the price and indicates that they aren't ingredients in the burrito, so it was clear to me. Ambiance was nice and vibrant, and even though the place was busy, we got a booth right away. I'm trying to think of cons, but there really weren't any, so I'll be visiting again. And I'm looking at you, tequila selection.
