It smells sooo good outside the store. Really crowded but most people were waiting for their food. I ordered a mushroom cheesesteak with grilled onions. The bread is soft and delicious. They also give you plenty of meat, but the texture is sort of crumbly? Haha is it supposed to be like that? But I love how it's covered in cheese! I'm not sure what kind of cheese it is but it's white (provolone?). Great flavor! Also, I added green peppers, banana peppers, and red peppers on top! I also got a soda, so total was around $10. Overall a really satisfying meal! Oh and the servers were really nice!
