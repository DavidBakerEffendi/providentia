Tried Cookshop for brunch today- an outstanding experience.  The restaurant is bright and airy, and the menu I would describe as sophisticated New American comfort food.  Our group ordered the fried chicken, fritatta, chicken breast salad, and brisket.  Everything was delicious, bellinis were strong, and the staff was incredibly friendly.  On the way out 3 people thanked us for coming.  I will definitely return!
