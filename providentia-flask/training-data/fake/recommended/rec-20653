JOJU I've been wanting to try for a while now and finally got the chance to! I think it's one of the best Banh Mi places in NY. I got the lemon grass chicken and it was off the hook delicious and bursting with colorful flavors! My friend got a regular with a runny egg - messy but delicious! If you check in you get a free egg with your sandwich and I definitely recommend it! We also tried the kimchi fries (real yummy!) and also the fried wings (would not recommend). There's a few different types of Banh Mi on the menu and I know i'll be back for more. I can guarantee you this is a place that people love to come back to and that's definitely why I'm giving it 5 stars. It's a small but brightly lit Â place - I wouldn't recommend going with a large group - but the service is great and the food is absolutely delectable. A lot of other Banh Mi stores don't include as much meat and flavor as Joju does and as a result your tastebuds are overwhelmed by the taste of bread. BUT NOT here!! You taste all the fantastic flavors in the sandwich and the bread is just the outer layer that holds it all together (btw toasted wonderfully). long story short - JOJU IS AMAZEBALLS. YOU MUST TRY!
