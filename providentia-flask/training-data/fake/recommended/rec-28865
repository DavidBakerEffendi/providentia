As I have mentioned before, Midtown is one of favorite sections of Philly. El Vez contributes to that reason. Each time I visit here I always get the Zapata drink. I am a sucker for guacamole and the Bazooka Limon is a must. Is this place pricey? Yes, of course. You are paying for a Stephen Starr experience! The ambiance is so cool. Don't forget to get your friends together and take pics in the booth!
