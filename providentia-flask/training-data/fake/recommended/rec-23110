Well, we are more than an hour away from Joe's Shanghai in Manhattan, and Shanghai Bun is more than good enough to save the gas and toll money and not have to deal with the hassle of NYC. FAR better soup dumplings than anything else locally. If everyone else makes a 2-3 and Joe's Shanghai makes a 9 (Din Tai Fong is a 10) then I'd give this a 7!
