I booked a dinner reservation a month out for Valentine's day. After reading all the magazines that give Osteria such high praise, I figured it would be a nice place to take the little lady.  We were seated and offered water and bread. Our waiter seemed nice, but throughout the whole experience it seemed like we had 5 waiters. I can see them trying to not let us sit there and wait, but who the heck am I tipping at the end of the night?  The guy who took my order?  The guy who served our app? What about the guy who gave us our entrees?  Either way, we were served rather quickly with the water, bread, and first cocktail.  After that.  We waited...and waited. Maybe it was Valentine's day that caused this, but isn't it the most popular eatery in the city?  Meaning it's always crowded?  So either way, I wanted another delicious cocktail and was never asked.  Our food came and by that time I lost interest in the drink. My girlfriend got the chicken something.  Pretty much the grilled chicken that my dad makes every summer with greens and fresh mushrooms.  Not worth it.  I had the Lombara pizza since it got rave reviews.  I liked the concept of wood fired pizza with sausage and an egg.  It was floppy and the sausage tasted weird. I kept trying to think, "ok this is delicious homemade sausage" but I kept going back to how weird it tasted.  I like the egg part. Our app was the best. It was Plin (tiny raviolli with sauce and coliflower topped with a type of breading).  Once we finished we wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.  Makes me sad to say, because I wanted to like this place, but It was not worth the pricey bill.
