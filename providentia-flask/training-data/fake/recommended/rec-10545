Jimmy's Diner is the new place that opened up recently in the old Union Picnic location. The menu is upscale diner and the decor is old-school coffee shop (without beeing at all cheesy). And so clean! Now, let me start with the caveat the I am currently in (about to end, thank god) Stage 1 of the South Beach Diet. This makes it not such a good time to review any restaurant, but especially a diner. However, I was heading to trivia at Pete's Candy Store last night and since the sandwiches there were out of the question, I decided to check out Jimmy's and see what my options were. I got the chopped salad with grilled chicken, which was quite tasty (and only contained one ingredient on my can't eat list: beets). I thought it was a little over-priced at $13, but that's to be expected in this neighborhood, I suppose. Anyway, I am looking forward to more unrestricted eating and being able to try other items on the menu. While it's disappointing to see Union Picnic go, Jimmy's seems like a fair replacement and I have no doubt they will be getting a decent amount of business from me in the future.
