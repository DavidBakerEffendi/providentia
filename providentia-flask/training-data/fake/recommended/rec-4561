(Summer 2013) Burger Sandwich: 4/5 - Plain, simple, and unique with the burger on toast rather than a bun, which makes for a good ratio of bread to meat. The meat itself was very flavorful with bits of chopped onion, yum! Potato Salad: Must-try if you like eggs in your potato salad - It's one of the best I've had, just delicious! Â  Service: Very busy most of the time! Even though when we went it wasn't as crowded there wasn't any real organization to how they take your order... Ambiance: Small space with limited tables!
