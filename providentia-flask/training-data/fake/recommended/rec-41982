Had an amazing meal last night - we got the tasting menu and everything tasted amazing.  Apps - chicken livers, bruschetta, mussels and grilled veggies - excellent - the hollow pasta with the spicy sauce - delicious - veal sweetbreads were great!!!  Desserts were just sweet enough - and the service was great too - definitely visiting again!
