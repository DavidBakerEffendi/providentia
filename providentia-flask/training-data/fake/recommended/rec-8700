I have to say that I love the idea of this place and the concept though not completely foreign is a nice change from the plethera of sushi restaurants me and the bf frequent. The service is sufficient and quick and their recommendations were just fine. With that said I am going to first complain about how packed the seating arrangement at the bar/grill is, they could have easily done away with one less seat and everybody would have been much more comfortable. By no means am I obese even though I love to eat *wink wink* but my elbow was literally on my neighbor's lap. Then there was those chairs, they were arguably the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat in, so bad that my bf complained of a back ache the next two hours after we left and I couldn't even get myself to stay for desert which is a first for me since I love desert! What we got duck breast app- very delicious but a little chewy 2 seared uni- i love uni and this was the first time i could not finish anything uni because of the beyond salty garnish that they packed on top (the first of the many many salty dishes that could have been great if only they had laid low on the salt, and don't get me wrong I love salt) grilled prawn- my fav since I love shrimp heads grilled squid- just as grilled squid should be grilled enoki mushroom- good rice bowl with salmon and roe- the roe melts perfectly into the rice as you chew and it really grows on you, but the salmon was a little over cooked by the time you went for your second bowl hamachi in soy- so salty that i could not even have a second piece grilled scottish salmon- holy salt, the fish was perfectly cooked but almost left completely untouched since i would have needed to eat several bowls of rice to finish it Our bill with several beers was only $150 which was definitely not bad but I would not come again unless i wanted to go home and drink a gallon of water and stay up all night to pee, because that was exactly what happened and this was last night so I am paying for the consequence right now and not too happy!
