Such a cool little spot for an Italian dinner.  They make most of the pasta in house.  I can never say no to a place that does that! Aside from the random guy punching..actually wailing on a public telephone on the corner, dinner was mostly pleasant.  The tight seating area and lit candles actually give the place a charming feel to it.   Food was great, really fresh and very reasonably priced.  Most entrees were under $20 and were pretty filling.  Definitely one of the best bang for your buck Italian restaurants in the West Village.
