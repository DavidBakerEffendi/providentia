Elizabeth institution, for as long as I can remember.  Been here a gabillion times, as I grew up, on Adams Ave,  Their take out is still, mostly good.  Restaurant has steadily declined.  Last visit on Tuesday, 9/16, was the final straw.... Let's start with the service. There is none.  Barmaid, who barely spoke/understood English took our order.  ****ed it up, royally.  Saw her once.  No drink refills, no, 'How are you doing, do you need anything'? Ok, garlic shrimp and stuffed mushrooms....shrimp were tiny pieces of rubber.  Smelled off...Two, mind you, TWO mushrooms I cut into had long pieces of HAIR!!!! Ugh...Not going well.... Ordered the Seafood Parrillaldo, sp?) and Seafood Fiesta...everything dry, overcooked, even with the sauce they drown it in....Mussels left grit in my mouth.  So, so, soooooo sad.....Got McDonalds, when we left.  Seriously. Becqause this has been my 'go to' place, without going into Newark, for as long as I can remember, I have never tried Valenca's.  Friends have always raved, I was, no thanks, like Algarves.  Not anymore. Also, screaming little kids running around bar, area!!!????!!!! Love kids!!!! Just not the place. Do yourself a favor.  Pass.  Go to Newark, or try Valenca's...or Spiritos....or a diner.   P.S.  Wasn't busy.  Saw 5 other tables...4 waitstaff....wtf?
