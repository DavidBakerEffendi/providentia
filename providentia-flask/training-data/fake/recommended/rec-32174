I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand the interior is nice and the menu is large. On the other hand, we have a lot of issues with the service. We work in the town so we end up going here about once a week. So, we know it's not just one bad day. What's disappointing about the service: 1) They will interrupt you a lot. One time we had six different requests to get us drinks and not all by different people in the first two minutes we sat down. You'll think I'm kidding, but I'm not. Which brings me to the second problem... 2) The wait staff is completely disorganized. And it's likely you won't get one waitress but a different person every time you look up. 3) They will rush you out. The very moment you put your chopsticks down someone will come and take your plate (often while you're still chewing) and come right back with the check. And when you sign the check it will disappear like magic. Also, as someone else mentioned the clientele is a little...odd. You'll hear lots of whoops from the hibachi side that can start to feel a bit over the top. And you're likely to hear some strange stuff. For us, on our last visit, it was two women asking the waitress why they couldn't find the french fries on the menu. But, really in spite of all that the sushi is very good. And we do keep going back. Let's just say it's the very best Japanese restaurant you'll find in Wethersfield.
