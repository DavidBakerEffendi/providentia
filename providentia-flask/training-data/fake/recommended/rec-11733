Came here for brunch and had a great experience! The location for Riverpark is sort of obscure. Once you reach 29th and 1st, you will have to walk into a cobblestone driveway and walk about another 20-30 feet before reaching the final destination. The building is beautiful and is set right next to the river. Once we entered, a hostess greeted us and we were immediately seated. The place was relatively empty, save for a few tables. The interior is really nice and reminded me of a hotel lobby. The whole left side of the restaurant had glass windows, to optimize the view of the river. Since we were a large group (7 people), we weren't able to be seated near the windows and instead had to settle for a table in the center of the restaurant; so if you want a view, come with 4 or less people (and probably call in advance). The waiters were extremely cordial and very attentive. The food was also very good. I had the Chicken with Waffles and also a side of Roasted Bananas. The Chicken with Waffles was prepared well, but after I saw my friend's Pulled Pork Chilaquiles, I got kind of jealous and wish I had ordered that instead! The roasted bananas were fantastic and would totally recommend it too anyone who has a sweet tooth! There's only one thing I have to complain about...it was their French Press Coffee...it was probably because the beans weren't prepared well--the French press coffee tasted weak and I wish I had gotten regular coffee instead. Overall, it was a great restaurant with friendly staff.
