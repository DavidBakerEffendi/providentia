The food here is cheap, plentiful, and delicious, so no complaints from me and my boyfriend. We had marrow bones, squid stuffed with housemade chorizo, tripe chili with fritos, bacon jalape√±o cornbread, and a dessert that involved fresh berries, sweet cream, and deep-fried corn bread batter. YUM. I would recommend everything we had without hesitation -- and I'm excited to go back and try more! The bar tender pours with a heavy hand, which is always appreciated and the wait staff is awesome. Highly recommended.
