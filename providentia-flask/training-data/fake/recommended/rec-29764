Caught up with a friend over a late dinner last night. The wooden interior is really pretty and cozy and they have decent food at reasonable prices. Rosemary wings are the bomb--crispy blackened skin with tender, juicy meat. Got the Rucola--argula on pizza is a little messy to eat and the tomatoes made it soggy. Crust was too thin to support the avalanche of greens. My friend's butternut squash ravioli was yumm - savory sauce with a hint of sweet in the squash filling. Â  We left as the band was setting up--would like to come back for drinks and music next time!
