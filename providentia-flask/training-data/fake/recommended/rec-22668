I'm giving Beyond Sushi a 5 star rating based on the food alone, which was exceptional, both for taste, quality and presentation. I ordered soup and a roll, which was a big lunch and pricey (around $20), but worth every penny. Seating is sparse, but if you don't mind sharing a table you can eat there. I'll be back here for more veggie goodness.
