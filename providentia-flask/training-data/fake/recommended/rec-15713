A month ago this place was great - I've been a regular twice a week for the past 4 months (the two times they park in FiDi). But since management within the truck (what appears to be Chef Samir) changed ~6 weeks ago, the food has gone downhill, the service is slower and it's a pain even to give your order. Single handedly I've brought 20+ people from my office to the truck - it became a Monday/Thursday destination. But after back 2 back bad experiences (a group of 4 coworkers last week RAW kofta, and just myself the week prior), we've had to say goodbye to this former awesome place. Note to the Chef - focus on the recipes! let others make and serve the food.
