A great place to grab a bite to eat and a cool one.  Nestled in the Hell's Kitchen area of New York, this small inviting corner bar has great service, great drinks, great price, and great food.  We stayed in New York for a full week, and it was by far one of our favorite places to eat.  Known for their variations on tater tots, this place delivers on all counts.  Thanks particularly to the owner Gus for taking time to chat and make connections with our group!
