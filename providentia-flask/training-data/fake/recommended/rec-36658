I am upgrading Balthazar to 5 stars based on a wonderful experience last week. I was in the city for a bit of shopping with a friend and we got thirsty, as often happens. We just meant to have a drink at the bar, but it turned into some shrimp and oysters - then we were offered a table and ended up having dinner, drinks, cheese, etc.! $300 later, we were very happy campers. The dinner menu was amazing and their octopus was TO DIE FOR. I'd recommend Balthazar to anyone! It's worth dealing with the crowds and the wait!
