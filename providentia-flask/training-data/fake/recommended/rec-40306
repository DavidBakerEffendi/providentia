Tucked away on Drury Street, in an alley way in Center City, Philadelphia, McGillin's Olde Ale House could be one of, if not the best pub I've ever been to. Everything from the atmosphere, to the food, to the waitresses and bartenders is upbeat, happy, and serviceable. I've been to McGillin's dozens of times, and I'm not sure I've ever left with a complaint, and nothing short of a full stomach. McGillin's has incredible beer specials. $5 pitchers are definitely a famed favorite among the regulars. The wings are incredible, and they're cheap. The menu doesn't have an item that I'd recommend you stay away from. I don't know what else to say. Eat at McGillin's. You won't regret it, and neither will your wallet.
