Really enjoyed dinner. I picked this place for Mom's bday dinner and the folks were very pleased with my pick. Started off with perfectly cooked calamari and salad. Mom had sea bass, Dad the pork chop, bf had steak, I had a pasta dish. Everyone was into their food, silence at the table. I would come back here for date night. The service was very friendly but unobtrusive. The tables are a bit close but the lighting is dim enough that you aren't really looking at your neighbors.
