My husband, my family, friends have been eating at BS for years - since they came to Plainsboro.   Clean, friendly, and perfect.  I had a chicken salad sandwich with walnuts and raisins yesterday and truly it was to die for - They are generous with their food and we have had many of their special wraps and sandwiches.   They should get 10 stars for providing this wonderful hamlet a meeting place.  It's always packed but it's friendly, convenient and again, CLEAN!
