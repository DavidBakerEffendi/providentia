This place looked really promising when I walked in for brunch: good location, good vibe.  I ordered Krispy french toast.  The "krispy" should've tipped me off that this wasn't normal french toast.  It was battered and covered in corn flakes (cool!) and.. deep fried (not cool).  Don't get me wrong, I love fried food, but not when french toast tastes almost like something from KFC expect instead of delicious chicken inside, it's just mush.   3 stars for nice prices and because other people's food looked good.  I'll go back and try a burger.
