My husband and I went here for breakfast last Saturday around 8:15 am. It was nice and early so parking and seating weren't an issue. You're overwhelmed with yummy scents as soon as you walk in. There are so many cakes, cookies, and pastries to look at! We got a table right away and there weren't many other patrons there. I had pancakes and my husband had the popover omelet. I warned him that I'd seen a few reviews on Yelp that said the omelet was disappointing or bland. He loved it and said it was really very good. The pancakes were the best I've ever had, except for my mom's of course! Certainly the best I've ever had in a restaurant. We really enjoyed our breakfast. The server was very nice, and prompt. All in all no complaints! We left somewhere between 9am-9:15am and it definitely starting getting busier at that point. As long as we can be in and out by 9ish I think this will be a regular spot for us.
