I'm going to start out with the one negative: the space is small (albeit very cute), and when it's crowded the bar area can be a bit claustrophobic. Otherwise: 1. The manager himself seated us, carried over the wine glasses for the girls, and took our coats. The waiters were likewise all super-friendly and attentive. 2. The cocktails were amazing, original and strong, and the bartender made us a special drink-- "the Rattlesnake." Aside, My boyfriend got the "Desert Rose," which is pink and comes garnished with a rose petal...hilarious. 3. We had guacamole, picada, chicharron de calamar, tacos de pescado, arepas, and for entrees, salmon and ribeye. Everything was outstanding, but especially the guacamole, the fish tacos, and DEFINITELY the ribeye. It was savory, juicy, and the sauce was just amazing. 4. Complimentary churros, fondue, and champagne.
