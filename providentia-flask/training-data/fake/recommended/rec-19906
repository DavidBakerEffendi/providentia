This place is a tiny gem! Thanks to all the yelp reviews I found this place as an alternative to the spot I was taken to as a surprise. Now this spot offers nothing in terms of ambiance but sometimes all you need from a restaurant is a good meal, and boy does Â Nook deliver. I ordered the Tuscan chicken while my friend ordered a spicy version of the penne pasta. This chicken dish was SO well seasoned! Every bite was a party in my mouth! I would definitely go back here but probably in the fall and winter. It was blazing hip hop and R&B on this balmy summer Sunday evening when I went, and although the AC was on, it actually felt like a waste of electricity because I was sweating so profusely. All in all, I had a great experience.
