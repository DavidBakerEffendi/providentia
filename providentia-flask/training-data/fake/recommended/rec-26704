We stumbled on something unexpected here. We needed to find a place to eat before cathcing Born Yesterday at the Walnut Street Theater. So I did a little googleing and found Coco's was pretty much the closest thing to the theater. At first we almost decided to move on because we are on a budget and the specials seemed a bit pricy. Then we figured what the hell..we just wanna get a beer and split something anyway. We walked in...weren't sure if we should seat ourselves or not..then realized that would be the best idea since noone recognized that two customers had just walked in. We sat down and were only aknowledged after I got up and walked to the back to read the specials on the chalkboard. A waitress handed me the written version of the specials and a made my way back to the table. After that...after they figured out that we were new customers..only then did the service really pick up. We were waited on by two waitresses at that point and felt we were finally being taken care of. The best part about the experience though, was the food!  We were just so happy with the food! All we ordered was the Bruchetta and the Lamb lollipops. They came pretty soon after our beers hit the table and boy were they good! The Bruchetta was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned and we were glad there wasn't more than a plateful..because we could have eaten them till we exploded!   The lamb lollipops were even better than the Bruchetta! Perfectly cooked. Crispy to the bit on the outside and the meat just fell off the bone. The accompanying dipping sauce was great! It was like a sweet and spicy thai sauce. It reminded me of some food I had in Thailand a few months back...which is a good thing! All in all? We'd definatley go back to Coco's...We are looking foward to trying other items on the menu....if you go though, just make sure they know you're there when you arrive.  ;)
