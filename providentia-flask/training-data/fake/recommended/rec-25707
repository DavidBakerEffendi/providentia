What a delight! I was so excited to be at this beautiful refurbished restaurant. I enjoyed a drink (delicious classic cocktail list) with 5 other friends before being seated. Shared a couple of wonderful bottles of wine with our main courses, which most of which were steaks. They were perfectly cooked and some of my friends said it was the best steak they have ever tasted. We had an engagement we had to attend after that... so we had to get out of there before desert or an after dinner drink unfortunately. Will defiantly be back, as I need to try a few more things on that menu.
