Really, really disappointed after the excellent Zagat rating and Yelp reviews. There was no line when I showed up around 5 for an early dinner. The decor, service, and food were all sub-par. We only saw our waiter twice, and we had to ask for him both times. He explained they were 'out' of about half of the toppings, but somehow the next table got their pizza with pepperoni 15 minutes after I was told I couldn't. On my way to the bathroom I saw them chipping away at a bin of sausage, so it seems like the frozen toppings just weren't defrosted yet. That's right, frozen toppings. The restaurant is very cheaply decorated, the light fixtures look like they came from bed bath and beyond. I don't understand the hype and strongly recommend waiting on line for Grimaldi's. Despite the rave reviews they display outside, Juliana's just isn't nearly as good. edit: I've learned from a direct message that the toppings aren't frozen, but do get covered in ice from cold storage - which I still find unappetizing.
