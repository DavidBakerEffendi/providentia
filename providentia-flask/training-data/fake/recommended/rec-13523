Battersby has been supersized. Dover took over the place that was formally the "Magic Fountain". Not really relevant to the review, but I just wanted to include the words "Magic" and "Fountain" together somewhere in my note. Huge space compared to Battersby, but also kind of a strange "L" shape to it. A bit odd. Reservations are via email only, which I suppose is fine. Service was nice and friendly, but maybe a bit too much. This could be a first week/new staff issue, but I feel like we had to say, "everything is great" way too often. Food was excellent, but as my lovely wife stated after we left, "It's no Battersby". At our table we had an entree portion of the cod (a tad small), some sort of beef/steak thing (a bit large), the duck with crispy kale (tasty and good size) and the lamb ribs. All the dishes were good but maybe lacked that, "I'm going to lick this plate clean" quality that I've always found at Battersby. Nice selection of wine and cocktails. It's a pricey dinner. I'm not opposed to spending money and have regularly spent obscene amounts in order to eat things. That said, my internal 'value' spidey-sense kind of went off when we got our check. That said, this is a new location. It's only been open for a week and we will totally try it again.
