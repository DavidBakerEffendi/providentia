I finally got to come here on a Saturday night... although the place was filled, there was nearly no wait for 2 people - the hostess cleared a table and voila - ready! Our waiter was a little slow to come to our table initially, but was great in all other aspects, never showing signs of urgency or rudeness. The bar is bustling and low key with fantastic food. Perfect for a late-night get-together with a couple friends for drinks and gourmet munchies. We ordered the tater tots which was fresh out of the fryer with a delicious mayo-based dipping sauce, the infamous fried chicken, and the Redhead burger. The chicken was really good - crispy but not greasy on the outside and moist on the inside. The salad paired with it (spinach, pear, and sliced almonds) was amazing as well, but the cornbread was just cornbread. The burger was noted to be "a little dry", though I never tried it myself. The fresh homemade cookies delivered with the check is a definite plus too! I bought a bag of bacon peanut brittle to go, which was different from what I expected. As everyone else says, more bacon, less peanut please! It's almost got a spicy teriyaki/soy based glaze over it - good, not great. Overall, I give it 3 stars because I'd go back. It's a fun, social atmosphere with delicious, high-end bar food.
