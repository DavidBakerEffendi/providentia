Believe the hype! I've been here twice and there is a reason why this establishment has almost 2k reviews LOL. The fries are fresh, thick cut, and wonderful. Get the mayo chutney dipping sauce. This place is like comfort food and for it's value, it's also at a great price. The staff is friendly and helpful and they give you generous free samples if you just ask. :)
