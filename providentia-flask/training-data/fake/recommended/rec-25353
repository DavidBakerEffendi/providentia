I have never ever experienced anything like Pomme Frites before. I love Idea. It's open late, it's greasy, you can have it your way and picking sauces can be a fun drunken game between you and your friends. My favorite is the roasted garlic sauce, sundried tomato and the Especial sauce. I stood in line in 18 degree weather with some friends and when we were lucky to get a seat and munch down the greasy asymmetrically-cut fries- it was totally worth it. I wish they charged less for sauces, or gave you more than 2 table spoons worth of it, but it's New York. It's kind of useless to complain about price...or seating for that matter. It's such a cute place!
