Went here on a Monday night without a reservation and it was really busy! We were lucky to get a table for two straight away. The food was nice, fresh and healthy! The waiter was busy but not very attentive, bringing one of the entrees 20 minutes after the other. I would definitely come back here again! Good food and good atmosphere.
