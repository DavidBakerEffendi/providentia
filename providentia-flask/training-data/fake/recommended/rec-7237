P&K offered a casual, laid back atmosphere with delicious food and an attentive and friendly staff. The Grilled Pork Jowl with brussel sprouts, Cod in banana leaf, BBQ Baby back ribs, Sizzling Sissig, and both rices (coconut & Jasmine) were definitely our favorites.  I was with a group and we ordered and shared almost the entire menu.   The portions were on the smaller side, but so were the prices. We did have to wait about fifteen minutes after our reserved time, but that is expected of a place in high demand.  The staff was quick to recognize the inconvenience and offer a free round of drinks. I really enjoyed the experience and look to revisit Pig and Khao in the near future.
