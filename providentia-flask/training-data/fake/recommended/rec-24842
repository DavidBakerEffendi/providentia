I do like this place.  The restaurant is cool and the bar area in the back is fun.  However, last night we had a, shall we say, inconsistent experience.  When we first got there, a group of six, we went to the back bar.  It took a very long time to get a drink.  When my drink was served, it was wrong, it appeared that the bartenders were just learning.  Not too friendly either.  We then sat down to eat, the first few things we got were very tasty...really good (which has always been my past experience here).  Drinks took a bit, but no problem there.  Then the "chicken special Szechwan style" came out.  The guys dug in and we all said it tasted odd...we then cut a piece (of deep fried chicken) open to find out it wasn't cooked through...not happy, and kind of lost our mojo to keep eating. The manager then came by and was quite apologetic.  He took the dish and came back with a small bowl of brussels sprouts "compliments of the chef"....really dude?  brussels sprouts after raw chicken? He offered dessert, we traded it for drinks and closed out the meal.  I like the place, but to quote a friend of mine" slow down in the kitchen"...they need to keep an eye on what is moving through....
