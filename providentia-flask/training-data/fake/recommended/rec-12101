A close friend's birthday brought us here. Unlike other visits, this time I filled my plate from the salad bar more than from the meat-slinging gauchos and I'm glad I did. I'm a carnivore at heart but when I'm dining out I like my meal prepared to my order, not mass produced. The various meats were tasty but over seasoned in most cases. The only side I had was the caramelized banana which was a nice treat. I'm more a fan of small plates than all-you-can-eat, and a glance around the dining room reminded me that buffets, no matter the price point, bring out the gluttons.
