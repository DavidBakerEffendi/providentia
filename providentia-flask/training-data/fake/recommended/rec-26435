My friend brought me here today for a quick brunch before we started our shopping trip through SoHo. I missed it since it was such a small place. Immediately as we walked in, the waiter seated us near the entrance. It was a nice sunny, breezy day so it was pleasant. My friend ordered the Bondi (grilled chicken burger) and the waiter recommended I try their well known Bronte (ground beef burger). Food arrived about 15 minutes and my first bite into my burger and I was immediately surprised. The sweet chili sauce with the beef was so delicious! I don't usually order burgers but this is not an American style burger. Long story short, I was pleasantly surprised and I will come back again to try more of their other burgers.
