OK, tried the truffle fries (awesome!), the onion rings (great) and the tater tots (good, but don't need to have them again). The aioli sauce is a must try. I had the truffle burger, which I would probably eat another of right now if the wait wasn't so long! Slight opening day service issues, but they were handled well and I will definitely go back.
