This "restaurant" is misleading, with thumping base & sleazy staff one would think they're in a downtown Jersey club. The dance music can be heard from busy havemeyer street, while the shady manager overlooks from the bar clapping outrageously to the club beat. It's clear mr Zizi places more importance on creating a Â club atmosphere than giving a damn about his paying patrons. The food is acceptable, unlike the service. Wait staff could do with some training and a lesson or two in conversational manners. With so many restaurants booming within the Williamsburg neighborhood, this party joint won't fly. Hot tip: nearby cafe mogador boasts excellent food and service within a pleasant dining atmosphere. Music is played at a suitable level, it too is a restaurant after all.
