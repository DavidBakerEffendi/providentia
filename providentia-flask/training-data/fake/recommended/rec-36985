As close to Paris as you can get! Cozy joint, crowded (of course), tables close as they should be, sort of like a French mess. Food is great (but somewhat slow), atmosphere likewise (but not slow).  You will probably have to wait in the bar but that's OK cause it is full of nice beautiful people who just love to talk to you. Service is friendly and has a younguish touch to it which is perfect for an old guy like me. If you want to find a place for your next date this is a good candidate.  Go for the sensual oysters.  So enjoy, and if you need company for dinner gimme a call!
