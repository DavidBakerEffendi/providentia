First they made us wait to be seated because they don't have available tables to be seated later into empty room with empty 8 tables. After that we waited 15 minutes for waiter. Then another 15 minutes for for coffee and food followed shortly after. Food was great, especially Chicken Fajita omelet. But before I was able to taste it had to wait for silverware. Â To finish assault, they overcharged me. Avoid this place. Doubt will visit this location again. Ever.
