The truffle burger is the BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. Probably one of the best meals of my life also. Also love the thin fries (they're not crazily thin) with the three different sauces. Love the umami ketchup even though I'm usually quite a Heinz loyalist. The wait time has been around 15 minutes (5pm on a Sunday, 10:30pm on a Saturday). They text you and there's a phone app that tells you where you are on the list which is nice. Also, I live half a block away, so it's fine. Service is a little slow. They haven't worked out the kinks yet. They ran out of forks and took forever to get them to us... DO NOT GET THE CHEESY TOTS. They were $5 and there were (we counted) only seven tots. That is $0.70 per totally standard sized tater tot. Highway robbery! Especially since the fries are way better value at $3.50. There's a pretty awesome beer and cocktail selection also. I'm going to come back all the time.
