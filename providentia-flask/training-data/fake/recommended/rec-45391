After walking past this spot dozens of times since it opened, I finally rallied some troops and tried it out. Rucola is always packed, so calling about an hour ahead of our arrival and making a non-reservation reservation was key to minimizing the wait time. The decor is great here, with the whole reclaimed wood / old-timey light fixture thing in full effect, but I already knew that after my extensive surveillance. I would say it's cozy bordering on cramped. The waiters have sort of a tough time navigating between tightly spaced tables. The noise level is high. Not too big a deal, unless you're like me and your voice cracks like a 12-year old boy when you have to raise your voice. Â We had some interesting cocktails, good wine, and pretty great food. I had the LI Duck and it was stellar. The price point here is maybe slightly high, but if they can keep a packed house every night then it's clearly not too high. After our meal here, I'll be only slightly less envious in future when walking past and seeing all the happy people inside. The experience is not perfect, but it's a strong addition to the neighborhood and I'll be returning. I'd go 4.5 stars on this one.
