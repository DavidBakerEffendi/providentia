Went here for Brunch, got here around11am and place is packed! We took the last table available at the time we walked in. So expect to be waiting here. Ordered a cappuccino, OJ and coffee for Mike and they were...meh. Nothing to brag about. Pancakes were amazing! M not really a pancake fan because I have been traumatize with all the other brunch places we've tried in Brooklyn and has not met my expecations. But Cafe Luluc you have turned me around and m once again a pancake lover. Theyre so just-right fluffy in the middle and crispy on the sides that I finished two and a half of my 3 pancakes! I usually am full after eating one and a half but your pancakes just kept me eating it and eating it. If I didnt have one of his eggs benedict, i wouldve finished that plate! Im definitely gonna be back everytime I get my craving of pancakes =)
