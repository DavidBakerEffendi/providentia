My love for Thai food is unexplainable. Pad Thai has been one of my favorite dishes since I could remember and Joya was able to make my night with their Pad Thai. I came here with one of my girlfriends. We had wine to start. We had the shrimp spring rolls as appetizers and also the squid salad which was delicious. She ordered the skirt steak with vegetables which was cooked amazing! I obviously got the Pad Thai which was also very good. Not the best but very good!  The service was great, the food came out quick and if we needed anything the waitress was there to give it to us. Kind of felt a little rushed but I can understand because the place is small and  they need to turn tables over. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because they don't accept credit cards and that was a very big inconvenient for me.
