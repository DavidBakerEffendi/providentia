Wow, get your sh*t together, Palo Santo. There were four of us that night (mid-week).  It wasn't too crowded, but...... we waited 30 min for the appetizers, another 40 min for the main course, and another 15 min for the dessert.  No apologies or explanations from the server, just a blank stare every now and then when she passed our table. The food was a major disappointment.  My duck soup was inedible... with a thick layer of grease on top that just killed the taste.  My seabass was decent, but everyone else's meal was just disgusting.  The grass-fed, locally farmed rib eye sounded great on the menu but was far too tough and chewy to enjoy. Bottom line -- go elsewhere.
