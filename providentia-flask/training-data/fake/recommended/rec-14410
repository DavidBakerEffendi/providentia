Perfect! The best pizza I've ever had. No exaggeration--this might be the best pizza in the world. It does take a while (only 1 group in front of us hadn't ordered and it was 45 minutes till we had our pizza), but during that time you get to watch a master at work. He obviously values quality, checking the crust of each pie before pulling it out bubbling hot. Then he adds more freshly grated cheese and uses scissors to trim basil from a bunch. The crust is thin and crunchy. The cheese is high quality. The sauce is delicious. The proportions of each are perfect. Also, they were quiet, all business, but nice. They even let a girl come to their side of the counter to take a picture with Dom DeMarco and her pizza.
