My friends were craving some good Italian food, so I suggested coming here for a large dinner party after reading all the good Yelp reviews. Overall, we all enjoyed our visit. Despite being a rather small place, they were able to accommodate our table of 8 easily. Although, at one point they did have to move our table over a few inches in order to fit in another table of two, no one seemed to mind. The atmosphere was very quaint and cute. The service was good too. As for the food, everyone loved the appetizers, especially the buffalo mozzarella and the eggplant parmesan. Most of my friends also raved about their entrees as well. However, I was not a fan of mine. I ordered the fettuccine with salmon in a creamy pink sauce and it was a disappointment. The entire dish was very bland and lacked basically any flavor. Since everyone else enjoyed their meal, I would be willing to give Caffe Linda another chance. So to summarize... 4 stars for ambiance 5 stars for appetizers 3 stars for the entrees but may have been better if I ordered a different dish.
