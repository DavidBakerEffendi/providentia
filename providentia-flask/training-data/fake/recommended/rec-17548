This place opened a couple days ago, and I was very excited to have French pastries in Montclair. Church St is an awesome place to have a restaurant, and we needed more French cuisine anyway. After dinner, my friend and I decided to go into the shop to see what they had. Ah, yes. True French pastries - macaroons. I'm not so picky with my French pastries, but my friend has gone to Paris and has had La Dur√©e macaroons, so she knows what she's talking about. We got two to go, each. I got Lemon and Pistachio, and she got Raspberry and Rose. I have to say the lemon was delicious, but when I tasted the pistachio, I knew it was the best macaroon I've ever had. My friend said it had the exact consistency macaroons were supposed to have. We could tell the owners were French, so they know what they're talking about. I definitely recommend this little shop to anyone. If there is WiFi, I'm going there to work.
