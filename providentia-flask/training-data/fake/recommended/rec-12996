Great option for a light, satisfying and more or less nutritious meal- you get your fill of veggies. My go-to is the Falafel Sandwich, which comes out at $6.75 (a little pricey, but it's convenient, so...).  Plus they really stuff that pita. Everything is very fresh, and the falafel are the perfect crunchiness.  You also have a choice of falafel: original "green", "red" roasted pepper, or "harissa" spicy.   There's counter seating for those who want to sit in and munch.  The corner location makes it a relaxing people-watching spot on a nice day.  Watch out for the giant step up into the store.
