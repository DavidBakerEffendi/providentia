In the mean streets of Northwest Philly, delivery options are scarce.  Naturally, I turned to Yelp in search of delivery places that 1) deliver wings and 2) do not care about the lives/safety/general welfare of their delivery drivers.  Luigi's fits this bill.  So, I placed an order for wings and the driver risked his life to deliver them to me.  I ate them.  They were okay, I guess.
