You can buy cheap bottles of soju from the fridge and drink to your hearts desire / cause a ruckus without paying for all the chichifroufrou shit like fruit platters and tip. Then, once you're drunk and have ravaging drunk munchies, you can grab food from the fridge and heat it up and create a mess of spilt soju, fried rice, and whathaveyou. Â Without even leaving the premises! Then, once your kimbap and kimchi fried rice and mackerel (so good!) have soaked up all the alcohol, you can grab more bottles of soju from the fridge and keep drinking. You'll spend a fraction of the price you would have if you got bottle service at 3rd floor and then went to kunjip to eat. Plus, you don't have to deal with all the skeazy drunk guys trying to grab you. Life. is. good. (No, I have never eaten here sober)
