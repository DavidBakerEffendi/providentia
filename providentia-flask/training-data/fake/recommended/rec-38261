It is a fun place to have a margarita after work with coworkers. I think that having the possibility of seating inside our outside is fun. The inside looks a little cozy (a better word for campy). The restrooms are downstairs, I am thinking space restriction. The bar looks fine. I had a cucumber/strawberry margarita. It was alright, nothing extraordinary if we figure out the steep price they charge: $9 a medium glass. We also had guacamole on the table side although the guy who made it didn't move from his spot. He was nearby, he just brought us the guacamole when he had finished. The guacamole was very good. The chips however were good but cold. When I asked them to warm them up I got a "negatory big Ben". I ordered a pork relleno, it was OK. I wasn't too crazy about the black beans it came with. Honestly, we had a good time. The place gets pretty busy after 7:00 PM. One might need a reservation and wait for payday because it is not inexpensive. Friendly waitress, nice environment, nice decor, OK food and drinks, steep prices.
