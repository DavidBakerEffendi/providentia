Damn good pizza. This place is usually packed out, so its a wait to get a table (a long line outside) and you may be seated closely next to people you've never met if you're not in a party of 4- however, that worked to our benefit, as our "neighbors' swapped some of their slices with ours so we got to try different pizzas. Highly recommend.
