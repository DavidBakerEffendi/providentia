I can't sing any more praises about this place that haven't already been sung.  My other half and I have been comparing as many cheesesteaks as we can that Philly has to offer, and we just keep boomeranging back to Delessandro's!   The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because their chicken cheesesteaks leave something to be desired.  I found the chicken fatty and a little dry, and I've ordered it twice just to give it another chance.  No dice! Along with our friends who visit from New York and DC, we've been to Jim's, Pat's, Ishkabibble's, and Gino's.  Delessandro's trumps them all (but if you're not from here like me, I will note that if you're in the city and you simply can't make it to this neck of the woods, Iskabibble's is probably your next best bet). This is what I was looking for in a steak when I moved here a year ago!  I highly recommend Delessandro's to anyone who ask!
