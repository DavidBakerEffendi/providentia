Yep, believe the hype!  (Minus a few sour-puss reviews) We don't get pizza like this in LA and the closest imitators are a 30 minute drive.   There's really nothing better than walking in from the cold, sitting down at 3pm with a medium pizza and a fizzy coca cola.  The sauce is perfectly seasoned, crust not too thin, but not a big ball of dough and I just love the greasy, crispy pepperoni.
