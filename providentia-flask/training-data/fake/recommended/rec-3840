A hidden treasure for sure, I have loved this place since I moved to the neighborhood 10 years ago. While it could be easy to miss because of the size (it's a hole in the wall), the aroma will surely grab your attention! I'm not sure if the two women who chef up in here are related or not but they do not play around when it comes to their menu. From the fish to the beans and rice (which I think they cook with coconut milk) is all crazy! Everything is made fresh, so they will sell out at times and you may have to wait a little bit when ordering your take out. I know there is seating upstairs (I've never been) but trust when I say it's a mouth pleaser whether you can stomach climbing their shaky stairs to eat in or if you bag it up and head home. This is truly one of the best Caribbean places I've had the pleasure of trying in New York (and there's some stiff competition out there!).
