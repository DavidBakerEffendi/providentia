Went on Mother's Day for lunch. We found out when we got there that it was a buffet. I'm on a restrictive diet and they wouldn't let me order anything not in the buffet line. So I'm trying to find something to eat...not very successful. There were only one or two tables with people sitting at them, yet the staff was no where to be found for most of the meal. The best thing I can say here is go to this place when there ISN'T a buffet. The price didn't match the food either. $9.99 would have been more appropriate.
