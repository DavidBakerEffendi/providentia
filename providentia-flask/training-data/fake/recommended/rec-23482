one of my favorite eateries in cobble hill, bocca lupa is caught in between the worlds of a quick bite to eat and a nice sit down meal. the panini and appetizers such as the tuna & fennel salad, veal meatballs and sweet, almost chocolatey tasting pate (and the large selection of wine) -- all great, albeit a tad overpriced in my opinion. the many combinations to be had from the small plate dining style is pretty good overall and able to fill hungriest of stomachs. one thing that i find irksome are the occasional stroller type families venturing in with their double wides and bratty kids, but that's almost to be expected from this area in brooklyn nowadays. the food is real good though and the ambiance is pretty cool and intimate past the local kids' regular bedtime. another perhaps more important thing is the inconsistency i've experienced with mixed drinks -- for example, one friday eve i get a few killer bloody marys generously served in wine glasses for $7 a glass and the very next friday evening i get a weaker version in some tall & skinny glasses filled with ice for $11 a glass. as a result of this and other more minor inconsistencies i've learned that wine is probably the best way to go. despite my small gripes, bocca lupo is a really good spot filled with a lot of excellent dining possibilities nestled in a really great and quiet neighborhood. check 'em out.
