I love this place! I probably eat at Coppelia at least once a week if not more. The drinks are fantastic and pack quite a punch. My personal favorite is the Gran Paloma that's made with fresh passionfruit juice and tequilllllla. They also have it in a huge (like HEAD-SIZED huge) size if you really feel like passing out under the table. The food is also fantastic. I've never ever had a bad meal at Copellia. I love the steak, burgers, and of course the Havana salad which is the ONLY salad I can actually accept as a meal. The service is amazing and the waiters are super attentive and sweet.
