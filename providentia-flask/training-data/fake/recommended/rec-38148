Got a Chicago style hotdog. Expecting a generic hotdog in a generic bun? Not here. Sliced in half dog filled to the brim with toppings! Great "everything" bun that was a big upgrade from a basic plain bun. Mochi filled with ice cream seems like a random combination, but the mochi is excellent and finishes off the meal very well!
