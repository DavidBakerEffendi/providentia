I think most rave reviews come from drunk memories. I cannot guarantee a superb fry here...anymore. I was a regular when Pommes opened. But a few years back, fry quality declined steeply when management seemed to change hands. The new employees aren't  crazy fun non-Americans like the guys who used to run it. This zaps the dining experience down a few notches, as well, which is too bad.  I haven't seen the guys featured in the photo (previous manager/owners?) for years. Have you? Isn't that false advertising? Still a good  2am dining experience, for the sauces (tandoori mayo my favorite), seats and cone holders.
