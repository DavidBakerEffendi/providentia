Hubby and I went to have lunch this afternoon at Il Triangolo. We drove over, and it was simple to find. There is a small parking area with signage for the restaurant on one side, and local parking is relatively easy if you don't mind walking a block or two away.  The building is lovely, and the dining room was bright and clean. As it was 1:30 on a Thursday, we were the only two customers there besides an older gentleman having a quick lunch while speaking on his cell phone.  The food was absolutely delicious.The waitress was very nice, although she forgot to mention the day's specials which were outlined by another waiter when a larger party came in towards the end of  our meal.   I had the house salad and the spaghetti and meatballs. My husband had the beef carpaccio and the frutta del mare. Seriously those were some delicious frickin meatballs and the  red sauce was spectacular. Overall, I am really pleased with the food I had and the ambiance.  We will definitely be back frequently!
