Solid go-to spot in LES, open late (2am). Purchases under $10 are CASH ONLY. Some of the best wraps I've had. And when I say wraps, I mean like the actual wrap part - made from scratch after you order, it don't get no fresher than dat. Also has unique combinations of food. My favorites are the Brothers Grimm (Chicken, pickled shitake, raisins, plaintain chips, etc.), Mowgli (Grilled Cauliflower, spicy pineapple, shallot, bbq chips, etc.), and Teen Wolf (Falafel and yeah you get the point - they are creative and tasty). All in all, ingredients are made fresh, wraps are warm and gooey, and... + 1 for Tator Tots. Also love the sweet potato fries. (the only think I don't like about this place is every time I ordered a beer here (which I don't do anymore) it has been lukewarm) Good sauce too - my guess is a mixture of ketchup, mayonnaise, and some some of chipotle.
