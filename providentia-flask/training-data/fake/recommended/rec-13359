After I arrived at Laguardia, I went to my friends place to drop off my stuff then we took the train to Koreatown (not really a town, just one street) had dinner at Mad for Chicken and many rounds of happy hour priced beers at Ichiumi. Around 1:30 AM we took off to go to the Halal Guys at 53rd & 6th. I ordered the combo plate with chicken and lamb with saffron rice and 3 pieces of pita bread. Â The char on the beef and lamb is so good with the rice and the crisp cabbage, to add to it the white sauce makes everything THAT much better. BE CAREFUL OF THE RED SAUCE, I over did it and for the next day i had "fire in the hole". Guys there are super friendly and make good food. Definetly will be back.
