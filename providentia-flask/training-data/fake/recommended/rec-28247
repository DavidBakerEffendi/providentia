Great little joint in an unsuspecting location.  These guys are young but already being visited by the Michelin for hopefully a star or two.  The menu is super interesting and perfectly executed each of the 4 times we've been.  The vibe is casual and service super laid back which I think is the way to be.   If it sounds like I'm gushing, I am.  Huge fan of this place.  We don't have deep pockets and because of the price point, we've been able to make it back more than once.   Try the fried chicken!!
