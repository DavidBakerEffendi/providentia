I really love eating brunch at lulu. The coffee is really good and the staff very friendly... Brunch is really good here. I really like their wild mushroom and spinach omelet with gruere cheese. The eggs were cooked perfectly and were not runny or tough.... just perfectly cooked. Very delicious. I also like their eggs benedict. I like their concept of keeping things simple, small and delicious. Definitely a place to try if you are looking for a cozy place to brunch.
