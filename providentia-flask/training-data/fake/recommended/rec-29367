The only thing bad I can say about this place is that when I lived in Philadelphia, it wasn't open on Sundays. THIS is what a Philly Cheesesteak is, people. You go in, make your order and enjoy it either at the counter or at your next destination. Dalessandro's Steaks are great for dinners and great for sporting events. If they start shipping to New York City, they will have a regular customer in me again. Needless to say, on my next trip to the Illadelph, my first stop will be in Roxborough--even if it's on a Sunday. Lucky Philadelphians...
