The steak and other food was delicious.  Just a couple of things...some of the pricing seams to be off.  We orderd a pitcher of Bud light (3 pitchers by the time we were done), we did not know the price.   When the waiter brought it, it was a very small pitcher.   Only 2 1/2 to 3 -16 oz cups.  About half the amount of pitchers everywhere else I have been.  When we received the bill,  we were charged $15 for each pitcher!!!  What a ripoff.  It should be no more than $10 just based on the size of the pitcher and amount of beer in it.  Also, the garlic bread is one of the best I have had. But, $4.95 for 3 slices of bread??  Maybe lower that price to $2.95.  Service did seem a little slow and our waiter was still pretty good despite the wait.   I will return because the Delmonico 24 oz. steak is better than any I have had.  I had it med-well and it was juicy as can be.  I didn't even use steak sauce like I normally would.  Next visit, I will ask about the beer prices before I order.  I plan to visit again soon.
