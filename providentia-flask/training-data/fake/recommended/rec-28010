Can i say holy grail. If you are looking for fancy decor this is no not the place to go. But if you're looking for the best Cuban food that you have every tasted! this is the spot! its extremely cheap. every dish is flavorful. The service is exceptional. Guy from diners drive ins and dives has come here so you already know that its packed with flavor. Only thing that is kind of difficult to find is parking but the 7 train is right there.
