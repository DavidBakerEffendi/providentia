WTF? When I heard everyone RAVE about this cart, I just thought to myself, "It's freakin cart food - how good could it possibly be?!" Boy was I blown away! So THIS is the good cart! The one near MoMA!!! I was visiting NYC in the dead of winter in January, and this Halal plate just warmed up my soul one night. The line that seems miles and miles long will explain how good this food is. Their hot sauce is oh so hot!!! Price is very good for all the delicious food you get. All of the curious people passing by asking "Is it really that good?" make it taste even MORE delicious!!! I know that this place doesn't need another review, but I just wanted to add my love for this cart. I can't wait to visit NYC again. Reading and hearing about how good this place is does no justice. You have to try it to really understand!!! That is how I came to appreciate it. Yummmm!!!!!
