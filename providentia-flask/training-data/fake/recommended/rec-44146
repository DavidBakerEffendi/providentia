It may look like a bit of a hole-in-the-wall, but appearances are deceiving. Rangoon offers the rare treat of Burmese cuisine, something you can't find in even many major cities in this country, and it does a fine job of it, too. Burmese does remind one of Indian and Chinese cuisines, with some Thai influences in their rather heavy use of coconut and ginger. The menu is extensive, assuring that even the vegetarian diner has a truly mind-boggling array of choices. The fried rice is truly the best I have ever had. Some of the dishes are a bit salty, but in the case of this restaurant I don't think it's a major detraction from the tastiness. As a vegetarian reviewer who's not fond of overly spicy food, I highly recommend the village pea soup and tomato tofu curry, especially if you mix the latter with a generous portion of their *amazing* and simple coconut rice. But try a little bit of everything, too! You should never have to eat the same thing twice at this restaurant. I should also note that the service has always been unobtrusive but friendly, and extremely fast. More people need to appreciate this hidden gem.
