My wife chose this lovely little hole in the wall because of very favorable Yelps and its location two blocks from our son's apartment.  A great choice!  Friendly, quick service and delicious food. Very nice to our 1-year old granddaughter, too. Great little empanadas, a buck each during happy hour with reduced price sangria. And they threw in an order of crisp plantain chips as a surprise treat. The shrimp and mofongo were both delicious, and I was very happy with my  steak and onions. But the winner was the pernil--a big, moist and flavorful plate of pork. Not a white tablecloth place. Just a simple  casual welcoming joint serving up great Dominican food.
