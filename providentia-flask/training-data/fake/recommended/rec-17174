I've been to Cuban Pete's a couple of times, once with a large party (18 or so) the other time there was just three of us, both times we had to wait an excruciatingly long time. While the food was good I would definitely say not worth the wait, especially not with so many other Cuban restaurants in the area. The ambience is nice, I enjoy the partial indoor/outdoor seating and the sangria is definitely a good selling point, however with so many people eating, the over flow of people standing around waiting and the music playing it is almost impossible to have a conversation with the people at your table. The biggest con is the fact that while the wait is always long there is no designated area to wait, kind of just wherever you can find space stand there. I'd recommend if attending someone's birthday or if you are invited, but if the restaurant choice is up to you, I'd say scroll right past Cuban Pete's.
