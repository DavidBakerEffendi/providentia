Sorella was a disappointment with so much potential. Went there while visiting family in town and despite the great atmosphere and location it looked like an improvement over Zulu; however, I was wrong. The service was horrible. The waitress was not able to translate most of the words on the menu that we had questions about and we had someone with us that is fluent in Italian and was unsure what some of the words were. Ordered two of the vegetable appetizers (the carrots and the eggplant) and the eggplant was cold while half of the carrots were warm and the other half were near frozen. Two of our pasta dishes came out (small servings) and not the pizza we ordered, a simple cheese pizza. It took another 15 minutes for the pizza to come out. Unacceptable. And the pizza was horrendous. We were never asked for grated cheese, the bread was burnt, and had no seasonings. It tasted horrendous. During our meal multiple members of the wait staff came over with dishes we didn't order, placed them down then we informed them the dishes weren't ours so they had to go back and determine whose table it was for and bring it over to them - not the healthiest system for hygiene purposes. As someone who grew up in the area, loves your Dish restaurants and wants only the best for downtown's revitalization, this endeavor was lacking and I am very hesitant to recommend this restaurant to anyone. I would choose Salute over Sorella any day unless changes are made.
