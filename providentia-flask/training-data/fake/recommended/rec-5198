We were in town for the weekend for a friends 40th birthday and used the opportunity to get together with our cousins who live in Philadelphia. They drove up and met us at  Cafe 72. It was perfect, we didn't even wait a minute on a Sunday morning. We have food allergies and they were very accommodating. Food and service were great. We  really weren't expecting the quality, we were just looking for a decent place to have breakfast. If we are ever in Ewing again we will definitely be back.
