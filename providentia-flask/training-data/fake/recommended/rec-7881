Now one of my favorite BYOBs...the food was delicious. We started with a cheese plate and all I can say is, you HAVE to try the truffle tremor...it was so good! My bf had the cioppino which was unbelievably delicious; I had the pyramid pasta which was great (a teeny bit too much dough for me, but otherwise fantastic). We finished with the tiramisu...the portions are very homey and big so you certainly will leave satisfied. I wish they weren't cash only, but their food is so yummy that's hardly a deterrent. Will definitely be back!
