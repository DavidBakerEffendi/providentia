I stopped by recently for a fast lunch based on good review on Yelp, and they did not lead me astray! I stuck to the hot bar and salad bar and basically got a sample of almost everything offered because it all looked SO GOOD. I was a little nervous when the (very nice) cashier weighed my salad box because I got so much food and I thought it would be really expensive. You can imagine my pleasant surprise when it all came out to less than $12 (and i got a LOT of food)!
