Came here for a farewell dinner for my BFF on a Tuesday night around 8.  There were 6 of us and we were seated as soon as the whole party showed up.  Most of the crew ordered the pancakes, some ordered the burger and Mischa ordered Mischa things. They brought us little biscuits while we waited for our food and while delicious, they reminded me of Biscuit.  The jam though! Holy crap!  And I don't even like jam! Ahem.  It was really tasty. I ordered the burger even though I was about 20 minutes too late for the Burger and Beer deal.  I got it without the onions and it was really delicious.  Huge, juicy, yummy fries.  Definitely a good meal.  I tried my BFF's pancakes and they were quite good.  But I think the bacon stood out on her plate as the most delicious.  It was seriously good bacon.  Then again, I do like bacon more than pancakes.  Meh.  Tasty, tasty and more tasty.   It was yummy and I'd like to go back for dessert one day when I have room.  If you like pancakes, apparently this place is a must.  And if you DON'T like jam but you love biscuits and bacon, go here, try all three and be pleasantly surprised.
