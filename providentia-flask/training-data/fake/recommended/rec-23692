I love this place. Reliable, friendly, and quick place to get a good sandwich at a good price. Breakfast is excellent. I just wish they'd stay open later, as once they close, the options in my neighborhood for a good simple sandwich dwindle. The only way they could improve for me would be to use higher quality meats, or at least offer them, along with higher quality breads. Despite that, I'd say Jean's is your best bet for a solid sandwich in its neighborhood.
