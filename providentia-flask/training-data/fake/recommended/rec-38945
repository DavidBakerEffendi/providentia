Great flatbread, interesting menu with innovative daily specials, and an outstanding beer menu.  It is worth the wait, and service tends to be speedy.  The only warning, if you eat outside in the alley during the warmer months, keep in mind that it is an alley.  I have seen many people use that alley as a bathroom late at night (after the bars have closed).
