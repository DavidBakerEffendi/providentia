Get ready to be converted.  After eating here, you will judge all tacos against the tacos you have here. Eating here was serendipity.  Wandering the Chelsea Market, I was trying to figure out what and where to eat.  I did not think a taco joint in this place could be such a standout.  Usually high traffic places have average food joints. I am a taco junkie.  And while I will eat an average taco when there aren't any excellent options for food, I do recognize a good or great taco when I have one. This is the most interesting taco place I have found yet.  Had the carne, chicken and pork (adobado).  Each one was excellent and well assembled.  When I started eating the adobado taco, lighting struck me, and I realized I found my new best taco joint. The carne was good meat quality, grilled well, and was very delicious.  Chicken was just as excellent.  It was juicy and flavorful - not the standard dry and cardboard like "chicken" that most places serve.  The adobado was astounding - SO much flavor.  This was a really beautiful taco and my favorite. The taco tortillas here are made fresh - you see them getting pressed and then grilled.  Flour tortillas are made with lard.  It was the best flour tortilla I've had and will be hard to top this in any other restaurant.  I also tried the corn tortilla and was very impressed with that as well.  I like both. Eating here is very casual and mostly standing at a counter.  Not really a date place, but perfect if you're in the area and need a satisfying meal. If you can tell what a good taco tastes like, then you need to get your butt to this place right now.  I can't wait to come back here.
