I hosted my birthday here about a month ago. I have to say the staff and decor can do much more to make patrons feel accommodated,However one you sit, and finagle the ins and outs of a cramped space and a heavy winter jacket, your server is there, ready to take your order. Good for all types of eaters! They have fish and veg burgers! The sweet potato fries are divine! A bit too much for a frequent visit, but definitely worth a visit.
