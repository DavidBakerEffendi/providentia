This use to be be my favorite cheesesteak spot in the world!  I ONLY say "use" because I am now vegan...  Max's is not exactly the place to go for a delightful tourist outing or to bask in the ambiance of  *insert witty word here*.  No, Max's will offer you the most authentic cheesesteak (or hoagie) ordering experience in North Philly and a chance to buy bootleg DVDs, oils, and socks from some potentially shady characters.  Sidenote:  I'm still salty about my horrible copy of Avatar, the young man ASSURED ME that it was a perfectly clear DVD rip.  Got it home, and there were people laughing, walking pass the screen, and all!  So yeah, I'm bitter. But I digress... If you're not from Philly, let me give you a tip:  On my cheesesteaks, I would request "fried onions, salt-peppa-ketchup (one word), mushrooms, light mayo, & provolone."  This combo also works for chicken cheese'steaks!'   Also, there is a lively bar attached to the back end of the restaurant.  Although, that is not a feature I'd suggest for the "common" tourist, lol.  Use the ATM, as they do not accept credit (or at least they didn't back in my day, 2012).   Let me know how you like it, so I can taste that meat vicariously through your mouth! :)
