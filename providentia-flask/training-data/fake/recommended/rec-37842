I travel a lot, and when I hit a city I always look for gourmet pizza.  This was not it.  It's fine pizza, but the campana I ordered lacked the "pop" that would have me walk 20 blocks (which I did) to eat here again.  5 stars for me is mozza or olio in LA or zavino or barbozzo in Philly, for reference point.
