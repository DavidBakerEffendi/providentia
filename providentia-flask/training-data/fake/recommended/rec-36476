Eggs Florentine...YUM YUM! very busy place. We had a 45 minute wait for a table, but the bar tender noticed us waiting and gave us a seat at the bar within 5 minutes. She was so sweet and I had a great experience at my first NY restaurant. Food came out fresh and delicious, I didn't mind paying the price that I did.
