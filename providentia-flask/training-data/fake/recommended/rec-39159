High Expectations for Perfection -- Life is unfair, and perhaps so is this rating for Bouley.  But three stars means "A-OK" and, given my expectations surrounding a world-class flagship establishment like Bouley (and the accompanying sticker shock), something inside me makes me hesitate to label my experience there as anything more than A-OK.  This much is undeniable: everything at Bouley was perfectly executed (hell, even damn good) and certainly nothing was worthy of complaint (perhaps except for the unavoidable stuffiness of dining at an A-list French restaurant).  But what was missing was that "something else" -- like the jaw-dropping theatre of a place like Daniel, or the joy of eating super-rare fishes from the Pacific at a place like Le Bernardin. The dining room is serene but not breathtaking, and the food delicious but not mind-blowingly creative.  So by all means, go and enjoy (which you surely will) but try to leave the high expectations at home.
