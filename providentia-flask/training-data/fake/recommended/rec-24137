Huge portions!!! The XL bowl is only $6.50-ish, so filling and hearty, and they are generous with the sliced meat. They also give lots of lime slices, basil, and bean sprouts. Broth is delicious as usual. I love that it's in the heart of chitown and I can walk right over for bubble tea afterwards (only if I get the large sized bowl will I have space for bbtea) Only cons: unfortunately, the meat was a little thicker cut than I like it to be and the spring rolls I had last time tasted like they had been sitting out for a while.
