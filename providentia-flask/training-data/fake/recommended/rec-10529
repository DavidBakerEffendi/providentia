I really do love this place - chill and low-key, and not at all pretentious. The mussels look (& smell) wonderful, although I'm being naughty by reviewing even though I haven't probably eaten there in a decade. I recall their burger was excellent, though. I did find it annoying that their bathroom leaves a lot to be desired. I'll leave it at that.
