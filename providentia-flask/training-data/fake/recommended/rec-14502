Ugh.... Â I should have walked a bit further because this place was just horrible. Soggy crust, dripping wet from the remains of the defrosted toppings... I can't believe this place has so many high star ratings because I couldn't even stomach it. Really just a bad experience. I can't even say the flavors were good because they weren't. I felt ill after. Oh and they have a B rating for sanitation which is sketchy unto itself. Do yourself a favor and travel down to Prince St Pizza. You won't regret it.
