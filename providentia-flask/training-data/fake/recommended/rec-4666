Definitely one of the more upscale bars on Crown Street (especially when you compare it to Gotham and Black Bear...). The pod booths are definitely cool, albeit a bit difficult to maneuver around. The drinks are unique and delicious. My complaint is definitely the food. While delicious, it is heinously overpriced! The "sliders" are about the size of a quarter - and cost about 40 of them each. Try the oysters and the dipping sauces that accompany, but make sure your wallet is ready. Not really "my kind of bar"...but it's fun to stop by every once in a while.
