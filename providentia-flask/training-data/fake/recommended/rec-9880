Like every other foodie around, I am trying my hardest to go to as many places as possible during these last few days of Restaurant Week.  I went with my cousin to Riverpark, having heard good things about it.  We reserved over OpenTable at the last minute and just managed to grab a late reservation at 9:15 PM. When we arrived, they promptly seated us at a stunning corner table, with these amazing views of the East River.  The ambiance in this place is warm and elegant; the lighting is just the right blend of soft yet bright so you aren't straining your eyes to read the menu; and the tables are well spaced apart and the acoustics are well designed so you don't need to shout across the table to have a conversation. The food itself is fantastic.  We ordered the following: Appetisers - Prawn Salad / East and West Oysters Mains - Cod / Arctic Char Desserts - Beignets / Chocolate Souffle with Blood Orange Sorbet 1 drink each - a mixed drink and a glass of white wine Every course was utterly delicious but the real standout for me was the Arctic Char and the Chocolate Souffle.  Blood orange is my new favourite flavour in food...and the combination with the Chocolate Souffle was amazing.  The Arctic Char was perfectly cooked; it was juicy, with the perfect crisp charred skin and flesh which melted in the mouth. This is definitely a place I would recommend to anybody - especially if you want to go out to a nice place and actually be able to talk and have good conversation.  Service is excellent and prompt.  I will definitely come back again, particularly in the summer when it's nice enough to sit outdoors by the river. Total cost was about $120 for 2 people including tax and tip, but we tipped very heavily because of the excellence of the whole experience.  Excluding tips, the bill only came to $90 which is a total bargain for the quality of the surroundings, service and the food.
