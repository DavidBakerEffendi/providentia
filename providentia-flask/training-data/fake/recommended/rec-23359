Ok, so we gave it a second chance.  Gotta say, really impressed with the changes.  It is probably more like 3 1/2, but getting better and really happy with all the upgrades to menu, so 4 it is.  Chicken pot pie was OUTSTANDING.  Beer specials were good.  Wings slightly above average.  Best of all the prices have come down across the board.  I like the way this place is trending.
