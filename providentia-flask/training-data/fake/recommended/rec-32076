Best Place to go especially on New Years or 4th of July!!!  Parking Lot right next to the dining house also Penn's Landing was only a meir 5 minute walk across the bridge.  I went here on New Years Eve and it was a perfect night, the Food is out of this world, pricing is very acceptable and very affordable, they also have a bar and living room area for just casual seating.  Great Wine!!!!! again reasonably priced, the service is also top notch! I tipped 25% if that tells you how well the service was...  With the water front so close that why i highly reccomend this place for both those dates to see the fireworks at the end of the night.  Also if you dont want to fight the city traffic at the end of the night I95 south/north on ramp is RIGHT NEXT to the resturaunt. It make for a great quick get away!  on a scale from 1-10 i would rate this place a 9.  The only reason for not at 10 is that 10 is perfect and no dining room is perfect.
