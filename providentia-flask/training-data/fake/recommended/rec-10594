I stumbled across this place by accident walking back from dinner - what grabbed my attention was a sign stating that they had "gluten free products" inside. I was disappointed when I got inside because the only gluten free products they have are cupcakes (not baked in house; they were from Mr. Cupcake) and a quiche.   When I asked what Mr. Cupcake was the woman behind the counter gave a response in a tone that read "how do you not know what Mr. Cupcake is??"  Needless to say, she was pretty rash and "friendly" would not be a word I would use to describe her presence. The cupcake took about 5 minutes to get to me (the place was not busy) and it had zero taste (which I'm not blaming them for that, the blame goes to Mr. Cupcake).   Another place I can put on my list of where not to go in Montclair.
