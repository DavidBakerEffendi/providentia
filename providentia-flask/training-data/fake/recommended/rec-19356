This was the first time I had good service. Our waiter Alex was polite and kept the refills coming. Every time I've been here before I had no clue who my server was or when I would get my next drink. Jose Pistolas has totally redeemed itself and also try the short rib on the nachos. Melt in your mouth good. However, R.I.P black bean burger.
