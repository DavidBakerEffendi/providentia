One of the best diners in NJ, I think. The protions are huge so the prices don't bother me that much. I used to go here all the time when I lived near by and the burgers are fantasitc. Thinking about this place, I think I might go tonight and get a cuban sandwich, so so so good! Oh and if you have room for dessert, they have made to order donuts with dipping sauces that are incredible.
