When strolling through the West Village on Saturday to find "the perfect" brunch spot,  I had three objectives in mind (in order of priority): 1) To find a cute/cozy/west villagey place 2) To eat amazing food 3) To daydrink- ie: Mimosas Well, I found all three at Little Owl: For starters, the place is absolutely adorable!  Very cozy, reminiscent of a country house.   The second we walked in, we started drooling over everyone's food.  Everything (I mean EVERYTHING) looked incredible.  We opted to split the bacon cheeseburger and french toast,  which were both equally delicious!  I gotta say, Supper french toast is better, but Little Owl's came pretty darn close. We also had 2 cocktails-  one prosecco with fresh squeezed grape juice, the other with fresh pomegranate juice.  YUM!   All of their juices are fresh squeezed here;  you can really taste the difference.   The food/drinks were a little pricey for brunch, but definitely worth it. One of the best parts of this spot is the location, arguably the nicest area in the West Village, if not Manhattan.
