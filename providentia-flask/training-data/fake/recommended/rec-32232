Usually a pretty crowed spot. Seating might take a bit. Although always busy the service is fast and that saves the experience each time. I order the traditional burger. I love how it always looks perfect, like a little crabby patty. Food is delicious perfect size not to small or big. The only thing that I have ever ordered and been disappointed with was a shake. Took that as pretty odd seeing as how shake is in the business name you'd think it was a main focus. I ordered a chocolate shake but when I tasted the shake it had a weird mint taste to it, not sure if it was supposed to be like that or if the employee failed to clean the mixer correctly because they do have a seasonal mint flavor. Either way, this place is good for a quick and easy experience with a good bite. I would continue to give them my business.
