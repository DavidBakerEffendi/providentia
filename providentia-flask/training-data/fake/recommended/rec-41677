Mr. Dino's has amazing service and food to match.  The atmosphere and kindly workers add to the sweet taste of the best pizza in town.  They recently acquired a new owner and now serve sandwiches, too.  The Italian Ice leaves a little to be desired, but that's not what you're going there for! The pizza is like taking a bite out of heaven, out of your deepest dream.  If you can't make it there, order in.  You don't want to miss the experience of a lifetime.
