We had the doh nut burger (which was amazing) and the taco bun burger (which was just ok). We sat outside and the ambiance was amazing the little square that the restaurant is inside it super cool. The service was quite lacking we felt like we were ignored most of the time. Check this place out if you want to try something daring and delicious.
