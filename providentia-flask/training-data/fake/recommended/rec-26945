Bottom line: wonderful French food with excellent ambience and service at an unbelievable-for-New York-price. After eating in France, I've become obsessed with French food, but haven't found too many places within my price range to sample in the city. I took the opportunity to try Bistro Les Amis on a date, and it was amazing in just about every way possible. We were seated immediately, and it seemed like the hosts were picking the perfect places for people. We were seated in a cozy little corner area with a view of the bar (which was beautifully arranged and had an impressive floral display as well) and most of the other tables, which made for easy people watching and conversation. Our waiters were attentive, but not overbearing, which was perfect. The food was out pretty quickly, and was incredible. Both of our plates were perfectly executed (coq au vin and crusted salmon). And the entire bill (without drinks and with a big tip) was about $50. Well worth it. The only possible things I could think to improve would be the wine and the bread. The bread was good, but the crust was a little chewy/weird. Not a big deal. And the wine only comes by the bottle-- the two of us would have probably had a glass a piece, but a bottle was too much for the evening. When we come back we might go for it though-- the wine list did look very well thought through. I whole-heartedly recommend this place. No French necessary.
