I am always very pleased with my dining experience here. It is a little pricy, and you want to make sure you have a reservation or you will probably be looking at quite a long wait due to the popularity, but it is worth it. The house margarita is always fantastic, and in my opinion, the best cocktail on the menu. The stuffed pepper with pork chops and cornbread has probably been my favorite. One thing to keep in mind is that appetizers are huge, but entrees are small.
