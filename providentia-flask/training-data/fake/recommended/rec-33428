Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it for brunch, love it for dinner. This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. Their Spanish Omelette is usually my brunch go-to, but the Greek Omelette and Brioche French Toast are equally divine. As for dinner...you can't go wrong--just make sure you get some fried halloumi to start with.
