The most horrendous peruvian food I have ever tried, It used yo be ok, but now, its quality decreased, its horrible, it greasy, i got a ceviche and the fish was still frozen on my plate, then I order a creamy rocoto tiradito and the cream was diluted with water, the pisco sour didn't have lemon and was all wattery...simply disgusting, horrible service, they make you wait for ever and they are dirty, the tamale my mom order was spoiled and rotten. The piononos are always old and the alfajores are not alfajores anymore, they filled it with some tipe of lousy unflavored chocola mouse, that's not an alfajor... sorry guys, thats not the way the peruvian food taste.
