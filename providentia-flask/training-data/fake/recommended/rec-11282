I've always walked by this place when I either go to work or leave my office to grab some coffee nearby. I never see it really busy but when you look through the clear glass window it looks very modern. Well, living in center city I've realized there is no such thing as "mediocre" food. Honestly, I think it's either a hit or a miss. This place hit the spot. Although the prices were not really a single dollar sign it was well worth it. I got the chicken platter which comes with 2 sides and I think a 1/4 lb of roasted chicken. I placed a take out order and when I got back to my office to distribute our lunch we all were like.. This is supposed to make us full? But surprisingly looks can be very deceiving. For the amounts we assume we're small portions actually amounted to be a lot. It also didn't leave me with that "oh I'm so full and I can't work for the rest of the evening" feeling. If ya know what I mean. This may not be my "regular go to" dining spot but I would definitely eat here again. They're mashed potatoes and Mac & cheese were delicious! Chicken was well cooked with some moisture to keep it very tender and juicy!
