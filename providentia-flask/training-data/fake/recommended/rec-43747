As far as tapas restaurants go in NYC, this is one of my favorites. The space is hip without over-doing it and there are two counters you can dine at (one is at the bar, the other is the cheese and meat station) should you feel so inclined. If it's a warm out, grab a pitcher of red or white sangria and start picking dishes off the well executed menu. The portions aren't big, but they pack a lot of flavor. Upon sitting down I always start with Pan Con Tamate (grilled bread rubbed with tomato and garlic) and go from there as they are always changing many of the dishes on the menu nightly. However, mainstays that are not to be missed include the tortilla espanola, the bacon wrapped dates, and of course the seared lamb. Please dont' leave without trying the lamb, you won't regret it. The bill tends to add up, but you should be able to sample a decent number of dishes and have a couple of glasses of wine for around $50 a person.
