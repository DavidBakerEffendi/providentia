One of my favorite places to dine. Their best dish has to be their bife con mandioca. I'm dying to find their recipe for their dipping sauce for the fried yuca. I have also tried, the salpicao salad, their shrimp salad, their stewed shrimp dish, everything is just delicious. Their carpirihnas are awesome! Can't wait to go again!
