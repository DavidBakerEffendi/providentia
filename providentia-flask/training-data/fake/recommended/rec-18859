I am no expert of Philly cheesesteaks, in fact this was my first. But, living in Chicago and liking popular food establishments, I am an expert at a few things: long lines, lack of parking and wind. No one likes these things. Continually driving around looking for parking makes me more hungry, and more irritable. Add in long lines and wind, and you don't actually want to be eating with me anymore. So when we drove by Pat's/Geno's on a recent cold, blustery day, and saw the very long lines at both, we opted for Abner's. Again, I don't know the difference: but dah-ym! It was delicious. Provolone and wiz (goodbye diet) and criss-cut fries. Unbelievably good. Don't brave the elements. Don't look for parking. Don't wait in line. Go to Abner's!
