Four stars for restaurant - one star for me. Tell you why. I had long ago assumed that this place of the Warhol era was done, done, done. I guess that's just me being an idiot. This place is teaming with food and life and beautiful young people and really is the essence of New York. My friends all had wonderful, aromatic steaks, salads and sides. We all took advantage of the wine list. I'm still mad at myself for getting a stupid omelet, which was good, but what could have I been thinking? I was lucky enough to get a taste everyone's dish, drown my sorrows and soak up the ambiance. So. Four stars for Odeon, one star for me. Next time I want MAN FOOD!
