In one word: wow! Guilt free sushi. I ran into the owner while there and was educated on the raw food natural aspect of it and how the flavors are engineered to be had without the need to add soy sauce. She was absolutely right because its the first time I didn't have to add soy sauce to enjoy the sushi. The raw food flavors exploded in my mouth. Highly recommended!
