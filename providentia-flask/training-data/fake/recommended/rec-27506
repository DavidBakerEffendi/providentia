dude. So good.  This was probably the best meal I've had that was made in less than 5 minutes.  Except maybe some of the stands in the night markets in Taiwan I've had.   Their chicken plate with rice and salad was to DIE for.  Came here the next day for dinner again and their chicken gyro was awesomely GOOD.  and for $5?? HELL YEAH. Definitely my meal of choice in NYC.  Grab $5, get a plate/sandwich to go, sit, and enjoy..........mmmmmmm............. droooool.  ask for the hot sauce. and white sauce. mix it together. drizzel over plate. experience orgasm that comes in your mouth afterwards.  lots of carts out there claiming to be the original gyro truck but this is the real deal.
