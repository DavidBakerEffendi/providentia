This is thus far my favorite hanco's location in brooklyn.  The shredded chicken sandwich I had today was simply delicious.  The perfectly toasted bread with quality chicken and lots of pickled veggies + spicy mayo was a feast in my mouth.  Their taro bubble tea wasn't bad either.  Definitely go there if you're craving a bahn mi.
