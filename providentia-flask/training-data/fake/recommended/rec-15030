Frankford Hall is a really cool place to go and hang out and drink. Their outdoor seated area is very nice, especially at night when the trees are lit up or during the day with the ping pong tables set up. From what I've seen they have a nice selection of German beers on draft that doesn't change up to often, but the basic style are covered. What is really interesting is that you can get your beer by the liter. The food seemed okay, but perhaps a little over priced. There are no servers really. Instead you order at a window and you can pick it up or have it brought to your table. I ordered a sausage and it tasted great, but I expected a little more for 7 bucks. All in all this place has a great atmosphere. It's very open and fun with people coming and going about, but with other great bars and restaurants around Frankford Hall is a place I would rather chill with friends than try to dine.
