I'm glad i made a good decision of going there for dinner, it was a farewell dinner for my close friends, who are moving to London. I must say electric ambience, such delicious food and great service. Their Spinach gannochi    , grilled calamari, rivoli in pink sauce, and cocunut pudding were definitely the highlights of the dinner. It's a must try for the yummylicious food and beautiful ambience!!
