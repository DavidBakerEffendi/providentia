Love this place! no hassle, no drama. For a chill night when you just want to listen to good music, dance and grab some good drinks/snacks...this is it! Its kind of one of those places that you'd see college kids (over 21) and happy hour/after work crowd that aren't stiff all hang in the same place. Â If you're looking for a fancy night... don't come here. But this is a bar where you can still dress up or dress down. Its a really good place for a birthday party since you don't have to put your card down to reserve or anything.
