Whether it is 3pm or 3am, The Meatball Shop serves up a great Hero (my favorite is pork, spicy meat sauce and provolone) and other fresh Italian food.  Skip the sliders -- hardly any sauce and too much bread.  Stick to the Heros or pastas.  The mashed potatoes are also pretty good. Cool vibe, good music, a nice staff.  Check it out.  And if it is crowded, see if the two standing room only tables are open beside the bar -- sometimes you can sneak in there to eat.
