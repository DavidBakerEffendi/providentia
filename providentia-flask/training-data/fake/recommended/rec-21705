Had sunday brunch here: granola yogurt and berries was delicious.  Bratwurst hotdog was a bit small.  Two eggs dish was aesthetically pleasing and delicious (delicious thick bacon!). Overall, I really loved the design, and the open space. It gets super packed on weekends. Service brought the review down to four stars instead of five .
