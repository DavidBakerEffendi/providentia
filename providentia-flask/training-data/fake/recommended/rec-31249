Visits - 3 times a week this summer! The market has a good assortment of quality food, but you would need some patience during busy lunch hours. I'd say they are a little lacking in the international cuisine realm, but everything American here is quite good. Here's a quick guide to some highlights: * Pizza* Roberta's -- your ultimate brick oven pizza way above average among italian restaurants. Let alone that this is in a food market, with a reasonable wait (5-10 minutes after your order. Line varies a lot.). A wonderful portion of crust and cheese and toppings; awesome sauce and cheese. * Grilled Cheese* Mrs Dorsey's Kitchen -- not a big fan of grilled cheese, but still really enjoyed MDK's, with gouda and jalapeno~ * Sandwich/pulled pork* Mayhem and Stout -- I like the salad, which provides some variety. Quite straight forward for a good sandwich really. * Something healthy...* Two Tablespoons -- featuring organic and farm to table. I recommend the rolls -- texture of the soft rice paper wrap with crispy refreshing veggies make you feel so healthy but also enjoying the flavorfulness. I find their salad to be a bit bland and often disproportionate in terms of the greens/beans and the noodles. * Desserts* Breads Bakery, Gelato Ti Amo -- Chocolate babka and cheese sticks highly recommended from Breads Bakery ( I would bring the chocolate babka home, warm it up a bit, and serve with vanilla icecream... Mmmm.... it's a chocolate upgrade of a delicious, warm cinnamon bun!) And/or get the gelato for something cooler.
