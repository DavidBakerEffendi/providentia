My partner and I went here to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary and it turned out to be a great pick for this occasion. We had very attentive service throughout our meal. One waiter helped us pick just the right bottle of wine for our palette and budget and other waitstaff came by regularly to check on us. We ordered the special family style meal. Everything was delicious - ripe & tasty tomatoes in our salad, a nice platter of charred fish, London broil, and spicy sausage with yummy veggies on the side, and delicious berries in our dessert. And, we were treated to some fantastic biscotti to take home as a parting gift. Only negatives - we were seated in the wine bar area and our table was a little small for a sit down dinner, but the waitstaff was good about clearing plates regularly. We also found the giant flatscreen TV in the bar area a bit distracting. I mean, who watches TV at a wine bar? Overall, great food, great drinks, great service. We'll be back!
