After working up an appetite, I yelped to see which stand was the best halal stand and found this one with over 1000 reviews. Most overrated restaurant ever! As much as I like white sauces, I wouldn't describe the sauce here as exciting. The other red sauce that approached with caution is just BBQ sauce. The hot red sauce is hidden in lil cups. The chicken was NOT flavorful. How can all these reviewers out there be so amazed at bland chicken with creamy /BBQ sauce?!
