OH MY GOD, My love for this coffee house goes a long way.  I am not a vegan/vegetarian what-so-ever and I still feel that this is the best place to get a bagel and a coffee/iced tea in the area.  It's clean, SUPER doggie friendly, and the back room always has a different art gallery every month.  They have a nice selection of literature, some comfy spots to sit in the back, free wifi, and an amazing staff.  Not to mention, the coffee is quite speedy and usually makes me come home and clean my house.  Go here and listen to grind metal while you caffeinate and read a book!!!
