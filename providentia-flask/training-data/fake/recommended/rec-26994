On our short trip to Burlington, while walking around looking for a bite to eat, stumbled onto this place. It has been highly rated and recommended by a few people already. Great locally sourced food. I am not sure I agree with the overpriced point, since local and seasonal food is going to be pricier than its counterpart. However, if that's not your thing, then it's understandable. We only had brunch and it was really good. I had the Hash & Eggs. It was a roast beef hash which had big chunks of pulled apart beef with potatoes cut like home fries and a perfectly poached egg sitting on top. My bf had the breakfast sandwich, which had a good balance of cheddar, bread and egg. Both of our dishes came with a side salad where you can taste the freshness. Yep, you can! Overall, highly recommended. Don't miss it if you are in Burlington, even for a short period of time.
