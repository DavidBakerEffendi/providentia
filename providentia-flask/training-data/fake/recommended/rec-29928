Stopped in for dessert - we had the chocolate cake and ice cream which was apparently a special that night.  It was some of the best cake I've ever had.  We really wanted some coffee and were surprised they didn't have any.  Noticing our dismay, the staff literally went out of their way to go next door to get us coffee.  Amazing!  And it really hit the spot with the cake.  Very cozy atmosphere and great service.  Would definitely return.
