Day trip to NYC and heard all of the "Don't go to Times Square" jargon before we went.  I'm a tourist therefore I'm going to Times Square.  Stopped at Juniors with two girls under 7 and had a great time.  Cheesecake was of course outstanding, brisket sandwich was just as good and our waiter was very helpful/courteous.  Prices seemed fair considering the location.
