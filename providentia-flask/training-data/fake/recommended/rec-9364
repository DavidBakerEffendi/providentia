This place was decent. Pretty fresh market to table but I guess just the food wasn't there. We ordered pizzas when we got there the cheese and the crust both tasted kind of weird. If you are a fan of italian pizza or even flatbread pizza like you get at most other places it really won't taste like that here. The crust tasted healthy almost but this may be appealing to some people. The quinoa Â plum salad is good so I recommend that. the sweet potatoes are also good but some came out undercooked I would have to say the servers are nice. They ignored our table for the first 20 min by accident so they gave us a free round of drinks on the house. They put all your drinks in those mason jars to be hipster including if you order wine. I actually really don't like this maybe I'm a bit of a wine snob but I think the glass really adds to the experience and the flavor. Overall not sure if I will be back and I will only recommend if you are into healthy tasting food with a slightly hipster atmosphere.
