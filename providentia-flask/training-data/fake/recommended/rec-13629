Overall was delightful, though below the high expectations, and not entirely consistent. Here's some highs and lows. The apple kim chi blew my mind. What is this explosion of pleasure in my mouth? Seriously! Duck was weird. Poached Chicken was not what I expected, but was delightful comfort food being swimming in mushrooms and creamy sauce. Lamb was perfection. One other drawback is things are a bit overly salted. Cut back, and let the flavors shine through. Ambiance is great, though a bit cramped and crowded. 1 hour wait, but hung out in the bar and got plenty of snacks including the famous buns. Nice soft and meaty buns. (I'd rank San Francisco's Chairman Bao to be superior.) Oh, and bartender is awesome. Got an Old Fashioned perfectly made, with a giant sculpted ice cube. Now that's class!
