I cannot believe the high rating of this place! The noodles have great texture, and clearly are hand drawn. But the dishes themselves were not flavorful. The vegetarian stir fry was one of the worst I have ever had. The duck soup that my friend got was also terrible. The service is fantastic and the people are pleasant and that is what gets the 2 stars. The dim sum place next door has better food (worse service).
