My friends and I made a reservation for 12 at Malatesta for NYE. I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. We started with a carafe of the house pinot grigio which was from a freshly popped bottle, it set my palate perfectly for the rest of my meal. Everyone at the table started with either grilled calamari or bruschetta, but don't be fooled by the "flat bread" that comes out as a quesadilla... I ordered the homemade gnocchi in the tomato sauce to be safe, and let's just say that if my NYE dress allowed I would've cleaned out my plate. It was superb and I intend on coming back to enjoy it again. Friends at the table also ordered the spinach gnocchi in the Alfredo sauce, which was delightful, but became too rich after a few bites. Overall, no complaints about our entrees. For dessert, I indulged in the Creme brûlée. Well done, it was the perfect end to my meal. I wished I hadn't stuffed myself with gnocchi so I could have tried the tiramisu as well. All the more reason to return. This place is perfect for groups or an intimate date spot.
