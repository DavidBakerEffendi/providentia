This place is special, my aunt first sent me to this hood for the best croissant in the city years ago, and it is still the place for 'becky' in SoHo.  It is the kind of place that beckons my sister in law out of her bed in Queens, where the waffles meet your expectations and the sea food platter is beyond description.  We sat and visited forever, never felt rushed and loved every minute.  Make reservations, we were thankful that we had (and it was mid week) .
