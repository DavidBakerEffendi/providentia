Went here with my best friend for dinner.  SO SO good.  She had the Roasted Chicken, and I had the Flounder.  She also had the gnocchi appetizer, which I tried but I think could have been better.  Both of our entrees were superb, great flavors and not too much food.  Who wants left overs while you're out in the city?  We also got a side of the French Fries which were great, but it's hard to find bad fries in a nice restaurant in New York.  For dessert, we had the ice cream sandwich, which was really delicious, great cookie with great ice cream, can't go wrong there.  Great place, definitely recommend it, and it wasn't hard to get a reservation, even 3 days out.
