This s place is awesome remind me of my trip in France. The ambiance is relli cute and cozy even the table/the seats is pretty small. Â I love the crossiant and the beer salad on top with creme it's relli fresh and Delish!!! Only one issue makes me feel abit annoyed is the host who give me n'my friend black face and pout her mouth when I ask abt seat ;( .... No service mind
