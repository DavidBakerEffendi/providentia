The sandwiches at Tommy DiNic's are delicious and the portions are generous. I split a beef brisket sandwich with a friend, and we were both satisfied despite sharing. The juicy beef brisket meat was tender and stuffed into a warm, soft loaf of bread while the additions of provolone cheese and roasted peppers gave the otherwise mellow meat a sharp kick. The other friends I was with also enjoyed their sandwiches, trying a variety of meats including the roast pork and roast beef. While the line is long, make sure you're ready to order right when they ask you because service is quick, maybe even a little intimidatingly so!
