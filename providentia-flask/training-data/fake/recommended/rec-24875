Went here for dinner over the weekend and had a great meal.  We had great service and the waitress never tried to push us along as we ordered one course at a time and definitely took our time.   The place has a great feel to it with a beautiful view of the square/park.  My only complaint was that the music was really loud.  By the end of dinner everyone was loosing their voices because we were yelling over the music. The cheese plate is to die for and the beet goat cheese salad is also worth it.
