Delicious beer.  Good atmosphere.  And the good probably ends there for me... My experience with the food and service left a lot to be desired.  Being that I'm a big believer in letting owners know when I've had a bad experience (How can they fix what they don't know about??), I called and left him a message.  He got back to me super fast which was awesome and he seemed like a pretty cool dude and totally proud of his amazing food -- and I totally have a soft spot for Foodies.   After honestly listening about my dissatisfaction with their ability to make items vegan or "to order," the shitty experience I had, and the way that the bartender talked to me about all of that, he apologized and told me that I'll need to be more prescriptive in my ordering in the future and sincerely asked me what I wanted him to do.  Don't hate me for saying this, but here's the typical man-woman argument.  I don't want to have to tell you HOW to make my burrito tasty or that you should buy me a drink to make up for it!  I want you to know!  So, I'm sorry, Sidecar.  We have to break up.  This just won't work right now because you just don't understand my needs. Maybe we'll both be in a different place in some distant time in the future and we can try this whole thing again.  Just try not to break my heart next time.  (Because the way to my heart is totally through burritos and beer!)
