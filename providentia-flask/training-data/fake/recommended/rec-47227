Went for restaurant week! This small restaurant in the West Village lives up to its reviews. I have allergies and they were very accommodating to me, able to change some dishes slightly in order for me to enjoy appetizer/entr√©e from the prefix menu. The baby romaine salad was perfectly balanced with sweet and salty. I had the hake prepared rye crusted branzino style. Both were amazingly delicious. For dessert, a variety of ice creams/sorbets. Service was great, attentive but not overbearing and never rushing us out the door. Would definitely return!
