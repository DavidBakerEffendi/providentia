I was here at an odd time, on an odd day right after new year's, so there was NO WAIT! The pizza came out in about 15 minutes, and it was PERFECT - very thin, but not dry, and absolutely delicious! The sauce was incredible, and the elusive cheese to sauce ratio was ideal! I am not a fan of pizza, especially the huge, thick and gooey deep dish stuff - I think that's just gross... but THIS pizza I actually LIKE A LOT! I think there is even a chance that I will go out of my way to get pizza here again!
