Came here with Emily K. and two other good friends. I was really excited to finally make it to the hyped-up "best brunch in the city", so I was anticipating great things. The space is gorgeous - Â the brunch area in this rustic, yet refined loft-like room with 25 foot ceilings. We drank their free coffee and wandered around Nolita while waiting 45 minutes for a table. After getting seated close to the opening to the street (it was sporadically pouring out!), our waitress took forever to get us menus, drinks, and food. Granted, she seemed like she was in charge of half the tables at Public, but I swear she purposely ignored tables in case you wanted to flag her down. The adventurousss girl in me ordered the "Fry Up" (two poached eggs on sourdough, tomatoes, mushrooms, and bacon). I asked for a side of the yuzu hollandaise to formulate a makeshift eggs benedict from my Fry Up. I really enjoyed my dish - everything was cooked to perfection. However, two of our party ordered the Tea-Smoked Salmon and it got less-than-stellar reviews ("tasteless", "soggy"). Overall, Public made for a pleasant summer Sunday but is definitely over-hyped. I've had better brunch (and service) at FoaF and Five Points.
