I really love the Lockyard. It's a great addition to Bay Ridge because it has a relaxed vibe and something for everyone. Recently, I brought some friends who loved the selections on tap. Â The staff is excellent - casual, friendly, fast and courteous - you couldn't ask for more. Oh and if you go - sit out back in their yard - it's fantastic! Finally, I know the bar is known for being "hipster" - yeah there are some hipsters, but mostly it's just regular people sitting around and chatting. I ran into someone I went to school with many years go and neither he or I are hipsters.
