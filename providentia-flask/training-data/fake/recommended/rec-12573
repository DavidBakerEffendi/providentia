Beautiful little shop on Madison. There was a short line when I stopped by but it went quickly. It is a little pricey, but trust me it's worth it. If it's not in your budget, at least buy a single macaroon to taste. They are amazing. The texture and flavors are so good. I bought a box of six to sample and each bite was an indulgence. If you try only one, make it the salted caramel. As soon as I finished, I wished I had bought a box of 12 salted caramel ones alone they were that good!
