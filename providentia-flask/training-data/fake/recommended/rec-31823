Sadly I did not read Monica S's review first, so I had one of their dozens of beers, rather than a spiked blackberry lemonade. Next time! The BBQ was tasty, though the ribs were falling off the bone a little too much and the surface was tough and pulling away from the main meatiness. The house sauce has something akin to curry in it, which was a bit odd. Still, the meat was overall very tasty. Sides were also good - the German potato salad and baked beans were tops, followed by the sauerkraut, then the apple coleslaw and lastly collard greens. The Mac and cheese appetizer was outstanding though, so get that for sure.
