Oh, I can't let that one jerkass waiter make me cut a star from this place. I'm realizing that Pho is definitely in the top five of my favorite foods.  This place has a lot to do with that.  I finally figured out my rockstar combo: Ph, chín, nm, sách - brisket, flank, and tripe.          Brisket: flavorful and tender, not too fatty.          Flank: a little fattier, but so tasty, and a different flavor        Tripe: never would have guessed I'd like it.  Chewy. Others, ranked in order of "ok" to "bleh:        Tendon: gelatinous, I like it thinner than theirs.  Ok if in the mood.            Steak: inoffensive, but it gets too well done and tough.        Fatty Flank: Well, just too fatty for me.  Meh.        Crunchy Flank: Not crunchy, but gristly and chewy.  Not feelin' it.        Meatballs: Hated them.  But they're my friend's favorite. Anyhow.  This place rocks socks.  Cheap, too.  The boyfriend said, last time, that he thought the broth didn't have as much star anise as usual, and I think he was right, but I've never left here the slightest bit dissatisfied (with the food).   Oh, how I love this soup.
