A review of the happy hour only: What great prices on good wines, good beers, good oysters... Nothing was superlative, but everything was good or very good. Where else in this neighborhood can you have two beers, six oysters, and tip and leave only $20 lighter? Great location. Oh, and service was topnotch...
