I've been here twice so far, once at this location and at the newest location in Bala. I don't trust my creativity creating custom salads/stir fries and I always feel slightly pressured when ordering from a screen so I went with the suggested menu (the food items I have attempted to combine in the past is terrifying). The Cobb salad was good, not great, I'm not sure what it was - I just wasn't impressed. The Spicy Garlic stir-fry on the other hand was delish. I can't wait to try more of the other stir-fries (stir-frys?) on the menu, oh and I love that this place uses locally sourced food, or so I read on some blog out there.
