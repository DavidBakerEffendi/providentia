I love iron chef house.  My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week.  We most always order the special rolls.  The roti, sakura, chicago  and hard rock are all delicious.  Weve tried the udon as well and that is very tasty and fulfilling.  I would say there have only been maybe 2 times out of 50 that ive been there and felt the sushi wasnt super fresh.  Its most certainly my favorite sushi place yet and I highly recommend it!
