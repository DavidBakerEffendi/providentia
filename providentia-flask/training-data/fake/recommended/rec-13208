I tried Rye during a work night out dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Ambiance is nice and the menu has a varied selection. Drinks were amazing and STRONG! The decor is quite dim and the mood relaxed. The decor is from the 1920s and looks great. The menu had some great options with plenty of choice for carnivores and vegetarians. Apparently the scotch egg was delicious and I loved my crab cake. Â The mac and cheese side was a big hit as were the lamb chops my companions had. I had the duck with cherry sauce and it was great albeit a bit on the huge side.
