I just visited this place today and I must say it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!! The decor is nice and it is dimly lit. The service was AMAZING! The sweetest guy ever :-) And now for the sushi! It was superb! I had the Godzilla roll and it was soooo good!!!! I am from California, so trust me! I know my sushi haha. But seriously, this was awesome. The entire experience! A gem to say the least! You must go and try it out! You will NOT be disappointed :)
