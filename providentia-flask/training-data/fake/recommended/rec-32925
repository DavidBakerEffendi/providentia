The worst sushi all you can eat place I ever been.. Taste so bad. The fish was in very big chunk barely can swallow it. How in the world they cut that salmon so big?? Such a waste of money! The tempura also greasy, the tempura sauce and as well as the soy sauce they all dilute with water no taste and quality at all. Im about to talk to the chef about how bad the food is. But I consider again as a good manner. Even my husband got stomachache right after eat there. We will never go back!! If u guys love sushi u will know what is good sushi. Not crap like this. Sorry but I have to tell the truth.
