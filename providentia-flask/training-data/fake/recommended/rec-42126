I would like to start off by saying that I love the conveyor belt concept of this restaurant, as well as the daily specials offered. I went on a Tuesday for lunch, where every plate is $2. The plate selection is interesting - a mix between standard rolls and unique rolls. I was a particular fan of their BLT roll for something light and refreshing. The reason for the three star rating is simply that the sushi chefs don't pay attention to what rolls are running low and/or out. I would notice two rolls completely gone yet the chefs kept piling on Â stacks of cucumber and spicy tuna rolls. The chefs are centralized in the middle of the conveyor belt, so there is no reason rolls should be nonexistent for an entire lunch. I plan on going back again to see if it improves, but again I would need a better selection available.
