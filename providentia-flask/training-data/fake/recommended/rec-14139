Go hungry and leave early.  This theater district Italian eatery gets busy.  The portions are very big so do not order everything you want or you will leave with more then you eat.  This place made the menu for Maggiano's so thats why it may seem familiar.  Good value for money and never lets you down.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because il mulino is in NYC too.
