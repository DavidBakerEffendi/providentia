I absolutely loved it. The food is great, the atmosphere is nice, the waiters are attentive. So warm and cozy, makes you feel relaxed and ready to do some serious thinking. My table had their Italian Grilled Cheese, sandwich and salad platter and a regular Grilled Cheese and everything was amazing! My only issue was that I wish someone had warned me about their green tea. One would assume that's as basic as it gets. Sure the description said: pineapple leaves added. First, I wish I had an option just to ask for green tea. I understand the need to have fancy herbal teas at a coffee bar, but what about the simple items as well, the staples? Point is, I was not a fan and neither was anyone else at my table.I even tried to add sugar but it was still gross. I might add that I am an avid herbal tea drinker so I know there are hits and there are misses. This was icky and the waitress told me it's to be expected of herbal tea. Hmm...not always
