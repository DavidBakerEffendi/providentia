Omg! Best sandwiches ever!!! The spicy pork banh mi was so good I literally came back for it 3 days in a row. The pork is so well seasoned and packed with flavor. I love the carrot slaw the put in the sandwiches as well as the fresh cilantro. Also the strawberry bubble tea is to die for! Love this place and have already brought about 8 other people here. Definitely gonna be one of their regulars!
