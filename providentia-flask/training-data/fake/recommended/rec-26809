Um. I love this place. Okay, Okay...I've only gone twice but I assure you that is ONLY because it's so. far. away. A girls gotta trek about 2 hours via public transportation to get to her love. It just ain't right. The service is great. The food. is. amazing. Yes, it's loud and has large tables with tons of people yapping but honey, I came here for the food. Also, yes they only take cash. But honey, I came here for the food. See where I'm going with this? I took two of my friends here who have never been and I was even more impressed by Nyona when both of them raved about the food. Like I know I loved you, but if my friends love you too...well, I'm ready for a committed relationship. Also, portion size. Let me explain this to you. We're adults here, we're not afraid to stuff our face. But we still had plenty of food left over. And the thing that you need to understand is that we were still debating what to do after our dinner (after a day of museum going, brunch eating, haunted house screaming). So yes, we were tired but we wanted to do that extra lap because we see each other like once a year. Let's just do all the shit we can in one day, right? But. But. our predicament was such that either we let our food go to waste or pack it to go (had no where to keep it if we were going to continue to traipse about the city). After much contemplation and deliberation (and the fact that we were tired and full), we came to the consensus that we were at that point to attached to the food. It was a pack-to-go-and-we're-taking-this-shit-home-asap kind of situation. So there you have it. I adore you Nyonya. I am committed to this long distance relationship. You're worth it.
