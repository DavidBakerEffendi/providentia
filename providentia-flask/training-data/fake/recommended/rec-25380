Badly needed Viet restaurant addition to the area which I stumbled upon recently. So far so good : tried various Pho which did not disappoint. Broth right on point; rich and deeply anise flavored. The vegetable pho with tofu  with the beef broth was particularly good. Will be back to try out everything else. My wife and kids have been to many Viet places   in New Jersey and my wife heartily approved. My daughter's the spring roll expert so will have to take her here for her opinion and update further. I have an office in Vietnam so  have some perspective. Cash only. So far it is superior to the restaurants in Linden and Florham Park
