We were there at 2pm, and it was 20-30 min wait.  I wanted to try the famous Ippudo's ramen, so we did wait.   The restaurant was new and large and "trendy" unlike traditional ramen shops.  Every staff was courteous, and the service was good.  Menu was rather limited - you basically cannot get what you expect to get in traditional ramen shops.  Originally from Tokyo, I was appalled that I had to pay $14 for a bowl of ramen!!  It was good but not $14 good when other places offer ramen at $8-10.  Ramen is not a luxuary food.  It is something that you eat quick and cheap, and yet you can satisfy.   Maybe we pay for the nice "trendy" interior.   白丸 元味is $6.8 in Japan, and I do not understand why it can double in price. You do not linger on after you eat in ramenya.  Why do they offer desserts?  That is why there is a long wait. Service was good.  It was interesting that even non-Japanese staff use some trigger Japanese phrases such as "２人入ります ". Kudos to them to learn those phrases! Although this is a hot place, there was no attitude.  However, I do not like to see the suggested tip amount on the bill, starting from 18%.   It was very welcoming, but with the wait, price, and  the lack of regular ramenya menu, I do not think I will go back.
