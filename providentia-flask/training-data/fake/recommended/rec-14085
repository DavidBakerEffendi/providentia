Mmmmmm... I miss you Halal Guys!  While walking to dinner from our hotel on a recent trip to NYC, we saw a line.  A long line.  We smelled something really good.  We took note of the corner we were at.  We went to dinner, then got back and googled the address.  That brought us to Yelp of course. The first time, we got in line at around 7:15.. There were about 15-20 people in front of us.  We waited until 8:15 before they started serving up.  We got extra hot sauce and the white sauce.  Yes, the white sauce is good, and the hot sauce is HOT, they are not messing around.  But it's the combo of seasoning on the lamb chicken, rice and lettuce.  Amazing!!!  It is fantastic without the white sauce! While in line during our 2nd trip to the Halal Cart, we started seeing yellow bags with a familiar logo on them, coming from across the street.  WTF?  We've been standing in this ridiculous line for a meal that we can find at their other cart right across the street????? Boy did we feel dumb!  Out of fear of losing our spot in line, we just waited.  (Again,dumb!!) Then finally on our last night, and final chance for Halal Cart love, we decided to try to cart across the street.  Well, guess what? The same guy who was serving up at the cart with the line, was working the other cart that day!  We smiled, ordered our food, headed back to our hotel, looking at the cart with the loooonnnngggg line, and saying, crap, that was us a few days ago!  We feel like morons!
