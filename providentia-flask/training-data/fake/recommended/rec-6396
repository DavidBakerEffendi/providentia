Im happy to see the hipster influence in Astoria now spreading westward towards my grandparents old broadway and 46th street stomping grounds. I had a late lunch here with the girlfriend on a rainy weekday and we were overall pretty pleased with the outcome of our decision. A grilled cheese place with some style. An eclectic menu that can satisfy the easiest of cravings with some original and innovating dishes from simple cores. Didnt get much of a thrill from the soups or salads but as side pieces they were fine. The atmosphere makes for a nice changes coming off of a very busy and dirty steinway. I'll definitely hit this place up again when im on the other side of steinway.
