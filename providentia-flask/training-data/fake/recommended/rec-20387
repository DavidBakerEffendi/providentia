Ok, um, delicious. Having dinner here humbles me- herbs and veggies straight from their own garden (and some from Rooftop Farms), fresh fresh pasta, perfect sauce, creamy cheese. Not terribly expensive, could be a great date spot, nice for hanging with friends or you could even take your parents here. It's just, nice. My first time here they served an eggplant parm as an appetizer, to try it out on the menu, and if people liked it they were going to make it a main. My friends and I were dying over how delicious it was. Literally. Luckily, we survived and have been able to come back to Anella and savor more of their truly amazing Italian food. I can't really say anything bad about this place, except (aaack!) I didn't really care for their brunch. But go for dinner. You won't regret it.
