Old school type restaurant and snack bar...  Ordered one "cremator" and two "rippers"...  Cremator tasted like crispy bacon, enhanced with the relish and mustard, and the two rippers were juicy and tasted like what a good hot dog should taste like.   Customer service was excellent and quick, and wanted to check this restaurant out since I watched a feature on the Travel Channel a few years back, but now I'm across the river in Jersey City, I'm glad I did!   I'll definitely be back!
