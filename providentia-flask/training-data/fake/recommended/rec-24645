Rye is awesome on so many levels. But really, I just want to applaud them for being so flex with the menu.  I am a vegetarian and after having an utterly terrible experience at Traif, I was so relieved to be able to find food (and delicious food at that) to eat at Rye. When I asked the server if I could order the brussels sprouts without bacon, she replied, "Of course.  We make everything fresh." Of course they do.   Delicious, but decadent, food awaits you at Rye.  Be prepared to wait on a weekend--but luckily there is a great bar next door that will let you wait it out.
