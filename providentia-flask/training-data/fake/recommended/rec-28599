Fresh and tasty food, very warm service and simple decor... We truly enjoyed our food and the experience of dinning here. I love the little wet wipes they give at the end of the meal, to wipe off your hands. They are open to suggestions and tips to improve their place- which is a great plus for a restaurant. ( we told them the smell of cleaning products is a little too overwhelming. It's great that it's clean but we would rather smell the food .) Which earned them the 5th star!
