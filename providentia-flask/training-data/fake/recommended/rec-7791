This is a friendly neighborhood place. It's ideal for a quick & tasty meal complimented by some great beer. The menu is small, but doesn't leave anything to be desired, really. I love their potato salad and cucumber salad. The sausage from the house is really good and hardy for a very filling brat. I hope this place stays around for a long time.
