Hard to believe it's been 5 years since I was last here! Blue Point Grill is still fantastic and now you can make reservations (YAY!) Came here with colleagues and a client and had a lovely dinner. We had a friendly and knowledgeable server. The restaurant is still BYOB and has no corkage fee. We brought in our own wines from the local wine shop. I had the mango gazpacho, which had a nice spice to it, without being overpowering. For my main, I had the mahimahi crusted with nuts (sorry, don't remember what kind) and did a side of garlic mash. You have your choice of sides (fries, garlic mash, baked potato or sweet potato). Get the garlic mash. Just do it. The menu is continually updated with seasonal items. I have been coming here since 2006, and if I only have time for one dinner in Princeton, this is where I would go. Thank you for keeping everything so great!
