Meh... I don't understand the hype. Maybe if you're not an avid fan of Latino foods then this might be the place for you. If you are, you've had better. I think it's gotten so many good reviews because of it's location, the rarity of a large sit down outside eating area, and it's eco-friendly. First off, there should be someone to explain how getting your food works or at the VERY least tells you to read the "fine print" on your receipt lol. A friend and I sat down to talk and then realized that we had to go OUTSIDE to get our food. A second after we got to the backyard, the man in the truck was calling out names. For something that was "just made", my beans were a little dry. The margarita/mojito mix was good, I just wished there was more for the price. It's an okay place, it's just I've had better. I'd rather order nachos or steak and rice from nearby Yummy Taco. ::Kanye shrug::
