You want an au-thentic Philly cheesesteak?  Everyone will tell ya Pats or their competitors across the street, Genos. Both places do sell cheesesteaks, and neither place is close to the best in the city. Why go to Pats or Genos?  They are worth a miss but the 9th street market is worth a long look if you are a foodie.   Fantes is a must for serious cooks, cooking equipment fetishists and a look back 30 years to when there were stores specializing in just one category rather then the current pluthera of big box stores with the finest products from China and India on sale 365 days a year.   Isgro's has some of the best pastry you will find anywhere in the USA. Anastasi's seafood is a good place if you want to buy good fish and seafood to bring home and carefully make - not much to look at though... Spice corner will sell ya just a pinch of this or that hard to find spice. There is a place called DiBruno's.  They have all kinds of meats and cheeses, olives, oils etc.  I am a big guy and one time the guy was getting my order and I was looking.  With fine urban salesmanship the guy who FWIW looked more Irish then Italian to m, said something else catch your eye, my friend?  I said look at me, pal - everything here catches my eye! If you want to explore the Italian market and say you have been to Pats then go.  If you are reading this, however, you likely know how to use Yelp and will be able to find a better cheesesteak...with no trouble.  Not bad but...
