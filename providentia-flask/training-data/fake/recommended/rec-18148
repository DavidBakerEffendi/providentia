Local 44 is a pretty wonderful location. It's great for a quick drink, happy hour is wonderful with 3$ local drafts and the rest of the draft list is bangin'. The food menu changes pretty much every season and always has options for everyone. I live pretty much around the corner and have been by on slow days, busy nights, and in the middle of a snow storm. No matter the time of day or night, everyone is really friendly and it's easy to get a drink.
