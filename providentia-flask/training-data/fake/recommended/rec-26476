This review is for the grilled corn, which is simply out of the world. Paired with a mojito, which was probably one of the best mojitos I've had, it's a great mid-day snack. The corn is succulent and packed with so many different flavors in each bite, while the mojitos have a great mint flavor and are not watered down at all. I'm only giving 4 stars because the waitress who served us had such a bitchy attitude and kept ignoring us and chatting with her friends.
