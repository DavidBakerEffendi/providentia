I have been here three times and each time was excellent.  The service is great and the food is exceptional.  The design of the interior is warm, elegant and cozy.  I found the staff to be warm as well, and you can tell that everyone is working hard to build something special. I especially love that dishes are diverse and interesting without trying to force anything.  There are unique combinations that work well, and are clearly created because they succeed rather that because they are just 'new and different'.   My only suggestion is that they work on the menu(s) presentation, because at the moment there are several small separate menus, and I think they are a little awkward.  This is a very minor suggestion for a very special place!
