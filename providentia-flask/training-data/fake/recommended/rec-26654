Wasn't sure what to expect entering this place, but after trying the first course I was already impressed. We ordered the trio of dips to start with and they were fantastic. Such good blends of herbs and flavors. Followed by that I had the rabbit leg. If you're a bit of a more adventurous eater, I highly suggested it! Also, I loved the fact that we weren't rushed and we were really allowed the time to enjoy the food. I definitely see myself coming back to this place.
