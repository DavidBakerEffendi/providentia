this place is very disappointing . I used to like the soup there but they either mess up the order or took a very long time to get the order ready ( lunch time and barely had any customers there). half of the time the soup tasted weird with some weird meat in it ( they said it's beef but nothing taste like that). Onetime i ordered the wonton soup and the meat in the wonton was sour and I threw up right away.
