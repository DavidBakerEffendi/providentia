Considering that I've been coming to this place several times a week for more than the past year now, I owe it a re-review.  To its credit, Parc fixed the dishwasher problem that had been plaguing it.  Out of my hundreds of visits since our first tentative return, I think we've had a soapy-residue glassware problem maybe once, which is well below the margin of error for any establishment.  So well done, Parc.   Management seems to be much more on the ball these days, and Parc is obviously thriving; the people-watching here is about as good as it gets in Philly.   I'm just a barfly here, so I can't really comment on the sit-down dining experience, but the bar is always on point.  Food, when I do have it, is good and consistent -- very accessible and not terribly overpriced.   I'm happy to say that Parc has once again become one of my neighborhood haunts of choice.  A solid bet in Rittenhouse Square.
