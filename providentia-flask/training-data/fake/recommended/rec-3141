This is a cute place down in the Financial District and apparently a historical landmark noted by the Dept of Interior. Crepes Du Nord is tiny but houses a homey feel and delicious food. We ordered the 'crepe complete' and one of the specials with goat cheese, asparagus, and pesto pesto chicken. I'd come back but less 1 star for the waitress who seem uninterested to be there.
