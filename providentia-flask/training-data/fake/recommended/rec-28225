Any place in new york that has an hour long wait for brunch is usually delicious and Penelope is no exception. The pumpkin waffles aren't overly heavy as waffles tend to be. They have a perfect balance of flavors. The apple cider mimosa wasn't as mind blowing as i had hoped it would be but its always fun to try something new. The salmon wrapped poached eggs are delish as well. The wait staff is fast and polite, always a plus! There are only 2 down sides to this place. 1) the wait time can be anywhere from 45 min to an hour and a half. 2) its really loud inside. towards the end of our meal i couldn't hear what the person across from me was saying.
