I have been coming to this place since they opened - seriously, we were there when it opened - and it has always been good. Went back just a few nights ago with five friends and my two brothers and had a great time. Wings: awesome. Nachos: the best. Burritos are HUGE and always tasty. The margaritas are good (blood orange is my favorite) and the beer list is always really strong, lots of local beers and always a wide variety. Also great options for vegetarians and vegans. Staff is chill and laid back but always on point - I've seriously eaten here more than twenty or thirty times and I've never once had an issue.
