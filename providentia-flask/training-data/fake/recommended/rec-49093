I live next door to this place. The first time I went there I recognized an employee I saw at Jeffrey's Grocery to realize that they have the same owner. I wanted a burger and he recommended the Brussels sprouts and switched the fries out for those. They were really some of the best Brussels sprouts I have ever had in my life. I like the atmosphere there and the staff was really nice. My burger was good too. I'll be back..
