Go for dinner and do the tasting. My wife and I went to Restaurant Marc Forgione back in early January and all I can say it was great from start to finish. The best thing about eating in a place like this is you get great food without the pretentiousness or uptightness ( i don't think that's a word) you get at other Michelin star restaurants. While we were looking at the wine list, the sommelier/manager came over and asked if he could help. We explained what we typically enjoy and he suggested a Cote du Rhone that was not listed on the menu and was quite of bit less than what we originally thought we would spend (always nice). The wine choice was spot on with the flavor profile we described. Our waitress was great - personable and knowledgeable and just a lot of fun. I should have written this sooner as I don't remember all the courses but it was 6 or 7 courses for around $100 per person. For the food and the price, we felt this was one of the best tastings we have ever done.  Its been over a month and I still think about that lobster chilli and the BBQ oyster.   There are so many great restaurants in NYC that we haven't tried yet, so its hard to say how often you would go back to a place like this. But I know, we will be back sooner than later.
