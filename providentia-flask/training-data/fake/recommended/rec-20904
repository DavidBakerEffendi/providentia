Went to Baja's tonight for Cinco De Mayo, there was a line but we only waited about 10 minutes as where other places had 1 and a 1/2 to a 2 hour wait!  We have been here before and know we liked the food so we decided to go here!  My husband and I did think the food was priced a lithe high, however you got a lot of food.  Still I have been to other Authentic Mexican restaurants before and the food was way cheeper for the same large portion.  We were a little disappointed that my son's soda was $2, I don't think $2 for a soda in a small glass with tons of ice is reasonable.  Also we ordered tacos and enchiladas and they didn't come with sour cream and I wanted guacamole so that was an extra $2 for a small ramekin full.  I don't mind $1 for the guac, but $1 for sour cream when it should come with tacos, that is a little ridiculous!  We spent $6 on just 2 drinks and a side of guac & SC, that is just to much in my eyes...We will go again, because we do really enjoy their food...just won't go as often as we would like!  You also get all you can eat chip and salsa bar with plenty of different salsa's to choose from, so I guess that help balance it out a bit!   The decor is nothing to call home about, however my feeling is, if the food is great and the service is great and its clean I could care less how they decorate!  Sometimes the best things come in the smallest, simplest packages. Management was wonderful, and so were the servers, everyone was so friendly, upbeat, and didn't leave you sitting to long before coming over and asking if you needed anything.  For one of their busiest holidays of the year, they did excellent and we didn't feel rushed.
