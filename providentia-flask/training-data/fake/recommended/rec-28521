Great food and idea, not so great on execution and management I love that a place like this exists, and the food is pretty great, if not cheap. The staff are rude and the place is super disorganized during the lunch rush -- lines everywhere and no one knows where to go. Additionally, no one is a managing the seating so you have people camped out for ages with laptops taking up tables. If they tightened up a few things and made some improvements to the staff it could be a five star place.
