I'd definitely recommend Beyoglu. It really is the best Mediteranean/Turkish/Greek restaurant on the UES. Its a star above the standard Ethos, its Greek to me, and all of the other small greek joints in Astoria. I'd even go as far and say its better than the Ali Baba's chains. The food is impeccable and the atmosphere is lively. We went here as a party of 4 on a Thursday night and it was happening. There is plenty of seating, but reservations are recommended. If you go in the summer time, they open the french doors and there is partial outdoor seating. The prices are the same as any casual greek/medi restaurants but the food (from calamari to salad, to hot dishes) is one notch above them all.
