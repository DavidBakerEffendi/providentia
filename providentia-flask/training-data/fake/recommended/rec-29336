I've lived in Roxborough for a while now but just recently tried a famous Dalessandro cheesesteak. It's been quite some time since I've been this disappointed in food. I ordered a CS with fried onions and whiz. I also ordered cheese fries but almost fell over when the lady told me that they don't serve fries or any fried foods. The sandwich was average at best and I can't get over the fact that a sandwich shop doesn't serve "fried food". The shop across the street has great steaks and fries. Will never go back or recommend this place to anyone.
