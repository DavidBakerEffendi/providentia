Love love love this place. There's an overwhelming amount of options to choose from and despite our best attempts we always end up ordering the a slightly different version of our usual "make it extra spicy please!" entrees. I've never left this place disappointed...especially since I always manage to come out of here with 2 pockets full of their addicting after dinner mints... Â It's also a perfect place to have a glass of vino at Sunday brunch without having to feel like your a raging alcoholic (even if you are...)
