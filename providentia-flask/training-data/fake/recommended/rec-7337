This is by far my favorite restaurant in Manhattan!  I am a Top Chef fan and a foodie and this restaurant is exciting NOT JUST because Chef Leah Cohen is visible giving commands from the open kitchen, but because it provides creative and delicious food at a great price.  And heck, $15 for unlimited PBR dont hurt either.  Have been there twice now, once at the chef's table and once in the garden out back.  Both were amazing experiences with phenomenal service.  We didnt have reservations either time and were seated within 20 minutes.  It stays pretty full the entire night without being "crammed" or huge waiting lists.
