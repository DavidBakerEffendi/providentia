Everything in this little unassuming place is very simple & unassuming, however, the food is really good.  All their dishes give you the important feeling that you are actually eating in a little place right in Mexico, not in some large chain. They have a great deal of little, authentic items, for those that do not wish to eat the same three items.  My only disappointment was the Guacamole, which was not thick & chunky the way we like it, but everything else was tasty. The people here are also very nice.  Just keep n mind that it is cash only, but great if you want to feel as if you are having a meal at you aunt's house.
