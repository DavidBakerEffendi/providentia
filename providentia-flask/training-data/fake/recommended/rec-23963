I really like this place..The mahi mahi tacos are incredible... And I love their margaritas..especially the cadallac. The waitresses are funky punky and sexy... quick to serve you, and very nice. free chips with 2 kinds of salsa. There is a bar on one side, and dining on the other. Ambiance is decent..very cantina like. A younger crowd mostly, not a romantic spot at all unless your girl is a strait freak..
