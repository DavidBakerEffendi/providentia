Found this place on Grub Hub, so they deliver! +1 First time I ordered, it took over 2 hours to get my food -1 Although cold, the chicken wrap was good, the fries were decent. Spinach and artichoke dip was good. Gave another chance a couple weeks later. Delivery was as promised. Tuna Melt Panini was awesome, Sriracha wings were awesome. 3rd try the delivery was fine. Ordered the Chicken Sliders which were amazing, and the honey orange chipotle wings or something like that. Awesome. I'm really happy I gave them another shot. It's a little bit more expensive than some places, but the quality of food is high. Definitely recommend this place.
