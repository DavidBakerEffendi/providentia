Definitely a nice place. Food is delicious and the half sangria and margarita is actually good. It is a little small and crowded and unfortunately you can not be seated without your party being there. You can't sit by the bar either and wait (at least that's what the hostess said) and then another hostess lady told me I could. A little confusion but aside that it was good. Try the tacos if you go!!! Definitely 2 thumbs up
