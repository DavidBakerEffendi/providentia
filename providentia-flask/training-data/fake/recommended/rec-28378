So glad I finally checked this place out! Went last night [on a Wednesday] and the place was pretty packed - not overcrowded, there was still room to sit. But for a Wed in Astoria, it was poppin. And now I know why! Spicy cherry margaritas? YES! The waitress delivered a disclaimer when I ordered this drink, warning it was pretty dang spicy -- habanero infused vodka is the base. I actually didn't think it was too spicy - just a nice kick to it! I'm a big fan of anything HOT, though, so keep that in mind. Also, the best fried pickles I've ever had -- a bit of a kick to these too, and very hot [temperature-wise] so let them cool a bit before biting into them. My only complaint - too few of them! Will probably order 2 baskets next time :] Prices were pretty reasonable -- $8 for the cocktails and $6 for a draught beer, which there is a great selection of. I think the apps were $4-$6. Next... gotta try this brunch everyone raves about!
