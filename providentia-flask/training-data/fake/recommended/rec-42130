Thai food is my favorite and having lived in Manhattan with hundreds of amazing Thai places have definitely spoiled me. I'm all for family run shops but here the service is awful, food is extremely bland and tastes old and stale. Gave it a few shots and have been disappointed every time. Not going back again for sure.
