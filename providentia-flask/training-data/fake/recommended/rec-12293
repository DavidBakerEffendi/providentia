BEST BRUNCH PLACE EVER. The wait on a Saturday at 11-12ish was of approx an hour, but we were sitted before that (in about 30 mintues). I loved everything about it! We were not happy to sit at the counter at first, but afterwards we realized what an amazing experience it was. We could see how everything was cooked, and it really felt like we were having brunch at a nice French bistro. Attention was great, food was great. Overall, loved it! Would totally recommend.
