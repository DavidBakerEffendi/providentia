Excellent food, sizable portions, reasonable prices! Rare find for Brooklyn, awesome dining experience. Great steak, burgers as well as some good seafood and oysters. OK wine/beer selection with a hint of Europe. Too bad they close early (midnight), otherwise I would visit frequently. Good place for an after-movie visit.
