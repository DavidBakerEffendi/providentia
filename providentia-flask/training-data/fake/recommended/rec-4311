The noodles were fine, it's just that there wasn't many of them. Pretty much every dish is a salty soup dish with a few handfuls of noodles, some veggies and your choice of meat. Interior is nothing fancy, and the service could be improved. Had a the roast duck version (~$6) and I wasn't expecting the loads of bone that I got. Other than that it is pretty cheap meal, but don't expect to leave full on it.
