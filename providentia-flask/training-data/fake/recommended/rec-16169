I was expecting to love this place, and Market Table exceeded those expectations. The food was excellent, the service was spot on, and the ambiance was perfect for a low-key, Tuesday night dinner.  Rock on, Market Table, you're getting my first fiver on yelp! I started with the crispy calamari over guacamole, and the sauce had a nice kick to it.  Obviously it is not the healthiest option but it still tasted light and fresh, which is not often the case with fried calamari.   I couldn't decide between the swordfish and the skate, and our server recommended the skate wing, so I went for it.   It was one of the best pieces of fish I have ever had in my life.  The outside was crispy while the inside was juicy, melt in your mouth deliciousness.  My friend, who remarked that she never orders chicken when at a restaurant, decided to go for it and was pleasantly surprised at how awesome it was! For dessert I had the polka dot cheesecake.  In the words of our waitress, who was warm, funny, and attentive without being overbearing,  it's "really really really really really really really solid."  Just order it, you'll see what she means.   Overall an incredible dining experience....can't wait to head back.
