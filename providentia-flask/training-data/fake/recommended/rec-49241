I created a Yelp account just for this purpose. If you're ever on the Silas Deane highway, please take my advice and drive by Max Bibos. You can go to Vito's (which serves pizza) or if you're REALLY dying for a sandwich that bad, there's a Subway down the road a bit, and the quality is better. Max Bibos is a horrible establishment. I went there just last weekend, and not only was it messy and dirty, but the employees were rude and treated customers badly, and the food wasn't good quality--the cutlet I ate had been sitting on a counter all morning (and for who knows how long before that). It's a lousy environment and overpriced for the bad quality they serve. It really ruined what I'd hoped would be a relaxing Sunday lunch.
