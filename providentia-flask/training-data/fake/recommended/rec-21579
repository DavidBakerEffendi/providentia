Frankford Hall is an adult Disneyland situated on the cusp of Northern Lib/Fishtown.  Like Disneyland, Frankford Hall has overpriced beer and snacks but is worth the price because of the delightfully laid back atmosphere.  The beer garden is a nice respite from the typical Philly pub scene.  The crowning glory in my eyes is the well maintained ping pong table!  Great place to chill with friends on a lazy weekend afternoon.
