We went to Brio for the first time, because we didn't want to wait 40 mins. For the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered the fried calamari, bisteca burger, and fresh squeezed lemonade, my wife ordered lobster bisque and the chipotle chicken sandwich, her cousin had the chopped salad and Italian wedding soup.  First I want to comment on the service, then the food. The lemonade I ordered which the waiter said was fresh squeezed, was too sweet and tasted like Minute Maid, the soups came first, in about 10 minutes, and I watched for another 30 mins, while I waited for my calamari appetizer which I had to remind our waiter about.  The calamari was cooked well, the red dipping sauce was good, but the aioli was too thick and nothing special. The soups were good, but not excellent, the chopped salad was overdressed and made with iceberg lettuce.  The chipotle chicken sandwich was good but way too spicy. This was the good news.  My burger which I asked to be cooked to medium, was well done and dry and tasteless. The patty was definitely frozen, which for $12.95, the meat should be fresh. It was pretty horrible. It is a really nice looking place, but for the $64 plus check, we definitely got ripped off. This is supposed to be a Tuscan grille but it is a disgrace for Tuscany.  Could have gotten a better meal at Olive Garden and for cheaper, and believe me this is not meant as a compliment to Olive Garden which is also pretty horrible.
