2nd time I chose Sweet Afton for brunch in one week. Last Sunday my boyfriend and I had brunch there but our waitress was strange and was super condescending and dismissive---Okay-everyone has a bad day. One week later my friends are in town and all four of us met for brunch and again I chose Sweet Afton- last week they had a great Pumpkin Ale on tap and I wanted another. Anyway, same waitress (Adrian) this time she was blatantly rude to my friends, dismissive and basically ignored our requests. Zero customer service. She actually talked over my friend who was trying to get information on their breakfast burger Adrain again made another rude comment. Very strange to treat customers so poorly. After our food came one of my friends asked for hot sauce (Adrian was over by the bar shooting the shit with another employee and ignored his request). He ended up at the bar to get some from the bartender(who was rude too). Guess it's their vibe but News Flash Sweet Afton--It's never cool to treat customers so rudely. Especially when you serve such mediocre food. Don't waste your money here. Not until Adrian gets some training in customer service. Totally disappointing twice from start to finish.
