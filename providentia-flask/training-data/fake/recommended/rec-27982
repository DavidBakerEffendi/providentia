I love the place. Bomb Bomb's serves Italian "comfort food", and great ribs.  My experiences with the staff have ranged from very good to excellent.   It is really is a traditional South Philly establishment and doesn't attempt to be anything other than that.  Thus, the limited beer selection.  I usually go there when it isn't jammed and order food  I know they prepare well.  The menu is not heart healthy. Taste is subjective. It works for me.  Most of my family and friends agree.
