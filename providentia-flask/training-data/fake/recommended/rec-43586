Great spot for late tapas and drinks! We stopped by on a saturday night around 11pm for something to eat and drink and we were promptly accommodated in a nice table facing the open kitchen. We were greeted right away and soon after asked for drinks and food order. The tapas are pretty delicious especially the fritters although it seemed as if they all tasted the same even though the ingredients and components were different ( chicken, serrano , etc). We especially enjoyed the baccala' fritters with the aioli . Drinks and wine were also good. Definitely will go back for another late night snack!
