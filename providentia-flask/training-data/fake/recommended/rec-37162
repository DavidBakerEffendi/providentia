Despite the name, the restaurant Riverpark is actually beside the river. The park component I'm assuming refers to the FDR, which you get to look over as you glance lovingly across at the beautiful sights of Long Island City. As far as views go, this is about as good as you're going to get for a restaurant in NYC. Actually being able to look out onto anything is a plus here, and the floor-to-ceiling windows makes it genuinely quite spectacular. The food and service were excellent. My main, the duck with chocolate, was amazing. I love duck, and I love chocolate. Putting the two together is an unusual combination, but it worked. Bravo, sir. I will marry the woman who can blend steak, bacon, cheese and chocolate together, preferably in an easy to consume beverage form. Until that day, I will settle the above combination. There was nothing I didn't like about this restaurant. Worth the extra spend.
