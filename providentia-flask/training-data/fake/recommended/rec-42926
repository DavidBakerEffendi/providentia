How come you always find the best places to eat when you aren't looking for them? That's how I came across monument lane. After an afternoon of wandering around the village we went to monument lane for lunch. As soon as we walked in I knew I'd be a fan, who doesn't like fresh local ingredients in their food? Cool, Rustic, farmy d√©cor made you feel warm and cozy even though it was the middle of the summer. I immediately gravitated towards the brisket, but was told it wasn't available so I went with the grilled cheese and pork. Farm fresh egg?? yes please. Working in a restaurant I tend to notice little things that maybe other people wouldn't. in addition to the local products that dominated the menu I also took notice of the cocktail menu and the graphic of the glass it was served in next to the drink, which I thought was a nice touch. My favorite thing was when the check came it was concealed in a mole skin notebook that other patrons wrote comments about the server in. very cool and I have never seen that at another restaurant. I will definitely be back for lunch, dinner, brunch or just a drink.
