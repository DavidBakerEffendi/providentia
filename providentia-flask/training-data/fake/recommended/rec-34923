I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and we've been to quite a few Thai restaurants (as well as other asian cuisines). I'm always skeptical about restaurants that aren't bustling on a weekend night but he said he liked it and it was local so we went. The Tom Yum soup was okay, about average.  He got the Pad Prig King (Chicken, string beans, peppers, served with rice) and I got the Pad See Ew (Noodles with egg and chinese broccoli). He requested that his be extra spicy (4) since there was a spice meter on the menu that made a joke about the spice intolerance of "most white americans" (from 1-5) and he can handle wayyy more spice than I can (yes he's white too).  It really wasn't all that spicy when it came out.  He ended up dousing it with more Shriracha. My noodles were disappointing.  They were way overcooked, chewy and soggy.  They were drenched in soy sauce and all you could taste was the soy sauce and a hint of sweetness.  I must've had like.. half an egg in the entire dish and they were soggy brown/black balls of sauce.  Broccoli was alright, cooked well. Not sure if it was just an off day, so I'll come back for lunch or something.  Definitely not my favorite Thai place though.. going to have to try more places.
