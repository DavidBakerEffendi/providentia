I was not as pleased with this place as I had hoped. The main problem is the long, long line. If you have a limited lunch hour, you'll spend all of it in line. And after all that waiting, my noodles were just so-so. I was hoping for something with more taste. On the plus side, they were piping hot! The staff were friendly, which was a plus. And it was clean. But eating in the restaurant, on an August afternoon, was not pleasant. Felt like there was no AC. Probably just the heat from the grills. But still, unpleasant. I would not go back here.
