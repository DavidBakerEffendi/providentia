First things first, if you can't wait in a line, then don't.  Or, simply, go when there is no line.  This happens almost everyday except for the weekends at Clinton Street Bakery.   I'm not going to write about the pancakes because they are amply covered here in the reviews - they are divine.  I'm simply here to write about one thing that has been overlook for some reason (by Zeus' beard)!  The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Milkshake.   Holy crap.   Run.  Do not walk.  If you are a choco/pb connoisseur like myself this is Nirvana.  They use salted peanuts in the shake as well - Eureka.  It strikes that perfect balance between sweet and savory that so many other milkshakes can not even approach.  At $8 a shake, the cost is appropriately prohibitive because if it were let's say, $4 I would be here every day.   See the picture attached for visual reference of the perfection.  Note the rippled whipped cream, sprinkles of chocolate on top, and the thickness.  Rejoice evermore.
