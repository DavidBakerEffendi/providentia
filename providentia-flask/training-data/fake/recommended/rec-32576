I feel very lucky to live so close to Alta and it is def a regular spot for me.  the ambiance, service and good are all fantastic.  If you're on a date, I'd request a table upstairs so it's a little quieter.  As for dishes, the mozzarella skewers, brussels sprouts and duck are all my favs.  That said, I've been here enough to try everything on the menu and the only disappointment is the empanadas.
