The food was great. The atmosphere might be considered quaint bohemian. This is a coffee shop with a few tables serving Ethiopian food along side bagels and other breakfast and coffee items. The injera was moist. The lentils and chickpeas on the vegetarian combo were spicy; enjoyed all items on the platter. Chicken stew was tasty. Friendly owner and attentive service.
