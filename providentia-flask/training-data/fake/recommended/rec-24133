Oh how I wish this place was close to me in Central NJ.  I came here for a Sunday brunch after a bachelorette party.  What a find!  We were not disappointed... We had to wait about 20 minutes to sit down at our table.  There is a cute outdoor seating area which is nice when it's not too hot.  We sat inside for the air conditioning but I will say it is very loud inside.  They should probably look into treating their acoustics. I was torn as all of the benedicts sounded so amazing...as did the different kinds of french toast and pancakes.  With the waiter's recommendation, I went with the shrimp benedict.  This consisted of 4 nicely cooked shrimp and 2 poached eggs all over a mound of cheesy grits.  Drooool.  It came with two pieces of toast which must have had some kind of seasoned butter on it because those alone were delicious.  You get a choice of potatoes: the house potatoes sauteed with peppers and onions or roasted rosemary potatoes.  I went with the rosemary and had no regrets.  The whole meal was superb.  The other bridesmaids were impressed with their meals as well (they ordered the kitchen sink and the chicken and waffles benedict).  The pork belly benedict was one of my top choices and I hope I get to try it sometime.   We also ordered a small stack of the red velvet pancakes to try.  They were SCRUMPTIOUS.  They had more of a cakey texture with chunks of chocolate inside.  They were topped with a sort of cream cheese frosting.  They were delicious and sweet but a few bites was enough for me.  I'm more of a savory food person. All in all, I definitely recommend this place for brunch.  I have high taste when it comes to food and this was a winner!
