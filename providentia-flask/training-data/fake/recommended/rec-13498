Um... no. This is never going to happen again. Seriously, folks. I mean I love food stuffs and I am not going to hate on a place just because there is a ridonkulous wait or I have to journey the whole island to get there. That being said, places with hella hype are subject to strict scrutiny -- I go in a little suspicious and the hype doesn't color my perspective (for the better in this case, I guess). Anyhow... like I said, no go on this spot. I had the "Spanish Scramble." I *guess* I should have known better - it did say Spanish, not Mexican, but no... chorizo does not translate to "sausage" in this brain. (Technically it is in the sausage family -- it's like Genus: Sausage, Species: Chorizo). Granted sausage is good, great even, but not when you are thinking you are going to get chorizo. Whatever, fine, sausage and eggs -- but then the eggs come and they are runny... runny egg whites at that. Who eats runny egg whites?! Gross. *sad face* I had the brilliant idea to substitute the biscuit for the toast thinking "ohhh yeah, at a bakery this is going to be soooo good." The biscuit was fine but why would I rather have a KFC biscuit than another Clinton Street Baking Company biscuit? The thing wasn't even warm when they brought it over. Oh geez. And then the potatoes.... kinda like mashed potatoes in a browned shell. No! I mean seriously, papas (potatoes) all like that? That isn't even right. I took a scone to go and had it later. Nothing that great and not awful, just fine. And the "customer service..." pffft. Hella rude. Just needlessly rude - as if I can't mess up my egg whites at home for 1/4 of the price. And they add a tip if you have a party of five. Calm down! I tried my friend's pancakes with bananas and the sugar cured bacon. The pancakes were good and the sugar cured bacon was alright - really sweet tho. In sum... no, it is not worth the trek to the LES. No, it is not worth the obscene wait. And no, it is not worth the money.
