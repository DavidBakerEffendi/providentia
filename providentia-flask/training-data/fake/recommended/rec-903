Native Detroiter here - husband and I visited for the Cheesesteak Challenge on our own and tried Pat's vs Geno's. All in all, both were good, but I'll take Pat's over Geno's for the sass at the window and NO "this is America, speak English" garbage that's all over Geno's. Guy at the counter at Pat's even dropped our change and said, "SHIT!" - hilarious. Good sandwich - flavorful meat, cheese and onion. Could've used a bit of salt. All in all I was pleased. Clearly I need to visit some other places for cheesesteaks in the future.
