This place has GREAT food.  The prices are ridiculously fantastic as well.  My only complaint is the atmosphere.  I don't like feeling like I'm in a club while I'm eating.  It's hard to come here and be able to chat with friends.  What I prefer to do when I'm in the neighborhood is take food to go.  That being said, the food quality is great.  I haven't had anything I didn't like.
