In this Economy... Came to Joya on a late Sunday afternoon. First impression, the decor of this place is trendy and very Brooklyn. Its got red brick walls on one end and old fashion fans on the ceiling juxtapose with the modern bar. The portion of the food is BIG! The quality of the food is so so....but I would say good for your wallet... They also have a nice back area. I would recommend this place for group outings!!
