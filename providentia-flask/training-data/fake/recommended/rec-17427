Had been wanting to try this place out for a while and so glad we did Pretty small place, but a very intimate and cozy atmosphere. If it's not crowded you can really feel like you're the only ones there Service was top notch, the owner (name?) was extremely friendly and attentive and very helpful with our questions and recommendations. The appetizer sampler is a great way to go if you want to try a bit of everything. The pork empanadas are WILD!  Fritters also delicious and the Haitian caviar was a perfect combo of smokiness and flavor. The gumbo left a bit to be desired, but still good. The chicken étouffée was unreal. We were warned that it's a spicy dish and I looove heat. It honestly could have been a bit hotter for my taste but it was a great balance of flavor. Overall, highly recommended!
