I really enjoyed the food.  I did however, have a little bit of a problem with the hipster vibe and the odd layout of the menu.  The improper use of Italian by some hipster girl who was being so radically boho when she created it on her Mac made it a little confusing.  I don't like needing to have to ask for or need a menu explained to me. That was the only issue I had. The fried artichokes and ricotta cheese were great before we had our pizza. Normally I am pizza purist and just prefer cheese.  However, in this joint I had to go with something a little different.  We had mushroom and zucchini and the crust was nice and crispy. Another bonus was the subway door artwork in the basement next to the restrooms.
