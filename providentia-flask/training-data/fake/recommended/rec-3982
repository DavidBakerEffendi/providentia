can't beat burger+beer+fries for under $10. This isn't the biggest burger, but it is thick, juicy, perfectly cooked to order. If you get the bistro burger, comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and BACON.  plenty of bacon. thick, juicy, crispy bacon. lots of it. i digress. it's a simple burger and beer pub, if you're looking for anything fancy, go elsewhere.  gets packed, looks packed, maybe i've just been lucky, but despite the crowd of people waiting, i've never had a incredibly long wait.  put it this way, if you get a beer while you wait, your table or seats at the bar will open up before it's done.
