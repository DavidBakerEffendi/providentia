A perfect tea and dessert place. The one must-try item on the menu is the black sesame creme brulee. It's very unique, and I've never had it anywhere but here.  They have a lot of different desserts here that you don't usually find in one place in Japan.  Another item that I love is the green tea truffles.  The flavor is very intense, and it goes well paired with a bitter tea. Being the dessert glutton that I am, I usually get the chef's 3 dessert sampler menu.  My tea of choice here is the honey phoenix oolong.  A  lot of thought is put into the presentation of both the tea and the desserts. The cups are different for each kind of tea you get, and the desserts have a lot of small details that add a little something special.
