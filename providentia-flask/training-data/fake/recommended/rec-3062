A single bite of the Napoletana took me back to roaming the streets of Rome as a kid. It was so simple and delicious... the Â way all foods should be! Meat, bread, and a drizzle of olive oil with huge emphasis on quality. This is hands down the most authentic Italian food I have had in the city. I will definitely be coming back.
