This place was amazing. The Buffalo Tots are such a novel idea, yet so simple and delicious. The serving size and price are proportionate. My group all got burgers and they were cooked perfectly and YUMMY! The staff was friendly and attentive. The decor was full of lots of cool, old posters, beer trays and signs. This is clearly a neighborhood establishment, but we didn't feel unwelcome as out of towners. If you're in Hell's Kitchen, you must come to American Retro.
