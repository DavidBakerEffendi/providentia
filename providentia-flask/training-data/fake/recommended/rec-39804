I left Saturday night dinner plans up to the boys, and upon receiving a text that said "46th & 11th Ave.", I was sure this was a huge huge mistake.  I was happily proven wrong. martini -- 7 out of 10.  I'd have another, but it wasn't the best ever. Irish soda bread -- given free with spread-able butter (i.e. not frozen). tasty and unique. rugby on TV -- made me want to punch some one and get messy.  I allegedly said, absentmindedly over aforementioned martini, "Those are some tight shorts." lamb shank -- I ordered it cause lamb is tasty and the word shank makes me giggle.  it. was. divine.  melted off the bone, with a salty (but not too salty) savory red pepper sauce.  I asked for a salad on the side instead of the red potatoes, so I got a huge plate with salad and the other side of peas/carrots, which tasted simply like butter.  amazing. my bf ordered the steak wrap and said it was excellent, and got "scotch eggs" for a starter (which basically were like chicken fried hard boiled eggs.  bizarre but he seemed to like them).  the other guy with us ordered the burger and was disappointed with it.  I guess the typical bar food here underwhelms and the atypical bar food is awesome. its a nice place, the people were friendly, and I'd come back if I were in the area.
