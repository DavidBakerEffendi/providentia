I finally had my first Halal Guys experience on my most recent visit to New York. The constant line moves so quickly, and before you know it you're receiving a heaping bowl of chicken and rice and pita bread that's ready for you douse in sauce. I love the white sauce that cuts the heavier taste of the food, but overall it amazes me how good just a simple bowl of chicken and rice can be. On top of that, the pita bread is grilled to the perfect level with a slight toast on the outside and a doughy interior. In terms of price, portion, and flavor, you really can't do any better than Halal Guys!
