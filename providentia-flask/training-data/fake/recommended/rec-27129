Probably one of the worst Latin food experiences I've ever had,  and being that I'm Cuban (Born in the US) and my girlfriend is  Columbian (from Columbia) we know a little something about Latin food. We were starving and looking for a place to eat and just happened to walk right by it and decided to go in and give it a try that was mistake number one. Mistake number two was ordering the steak with onions and the roast pork. I've hardly ever seen finish stake in my entire life and the taste, well, there wasn't really much of a taste. As far as the roast pork goes I think they ran out of real pieces of roast pork and gave me everything that was on the bottom of the pan. A word on cleanliness... So the owner of the place wrapping up knives and spoons and forks in tissue to place down on tables. She dropped a spoon on the floor, looked down pick it up and then proceeded to put it right back in the pile of clean utensils... Now I'm a New Yorker through and I know stuff like that I know happens all the time but this happened right in front of me and she didn't even bat an eye, it seemed like it was habit. Very not good we also ordered an avocado salad and some green bananas fried up otherwise known as tostones, they ranked high on the list of worst fried bananas I've ever had. The Flan wasn't so bad! I will forgive but I will never forget.
