After getting up a bit late this morning, I didn't make it over to the Brooklyn Flea until around 1pm. And, I didn't get my lobster roll until about 3pm. Wow - I can't believe that I actually waited for 2 hours! I don't think I have waited that long for anything before...not even Shake Shack...although that's come very close. The line I must say was partly in due to the very slow process - since the buttered lobster rolls are made to order the line does not move as fast as you would expect for a pretty simple dish... By the time we got our lobster rolls - I was ready to hate it. I was ready to say "yeah, it isn't worth the wait." But...actually it was totally worth the wait! Served both New England style (your traditional lobster in mayo and celery) and Connecticut style - basically just buttered lobster...you can't go wrong with your choice. After waiting 2 hours - I of course got both! While the New England one is definitely more refreshing on a hot afternoon - the buttered version is deliciously decadent. Grilled to order in butter and served with scallions on a smothered butter grilled roll - it was like I died and gone to lobster heaven! Huge chunks of lobster, very rich and pure... But you really can't go wrong with either! The New England style has just the right amount of mayo to give it that light creamy goodness without overpowering the lobster. Red Hook's lobster rolls are in my book definitely the best ones in the city. Maybe even in the state of Maine! They are that good. Next time I'm thinking I will go earlier on Sunday morning and then maybe I can cut down on my wait time...
