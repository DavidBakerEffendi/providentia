Ambiance is quant.  Service is top notch.  Food is creative and well presented.  Prices are appropriate for quality of food.  Most importantly, the food is delicious. I recommend the gnocchi, which I ordered without panceta.  The Walu was also amazing.  The chocolate pudding was surprisingly light. Big tip - BYOB!  This is a huge plus of you want to avoid corkage (I dont think they charge). Also I called and got in the next week.  I know they book out, so check their Twitter or call. Well worth it.  Very romantic.  Perfect for a date night or any other sort of gathering.
