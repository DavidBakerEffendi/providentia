I've ordered from this place numerous times. Today I am so turned off by the food. I ordered a yellow curry with chicken. What do I find in my food? Not one, but TWO dead flies. I think it's time for me to look for a different Thai restaurant to order takeout from. I ate some chicken rolls as well as some dumplings. Who knows if I ingested flies through those dishes??
