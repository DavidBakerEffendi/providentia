I think I would have given negative stars if possible. I am not complaining against the taste that was good but the other aspects which people may tend to overlook. My husband and I ordered a roll each. And it was not a to-go. But we both got the rolls in ONE single paper plate. Next both of us were so damn hungry we decided to order another roll each. That's when I saw this. There was this guy who said he does not need onions in his roll and what the patron did while preparing shocked me. He took the onions out of the egg beef roll which he was preparing and what is to be trashed went back to the container which is to be used in the next roll he prepares!! I expected it to be trashed and not to use the same onions in the next roll. Who knows what the next person is allergic to? Or may be he or she is a vegetarian. Ok I placed my next order which is again to eat there and not a take out and I specified no onions after seeing what was done. This time around I get my order not on a flimsy single plate but the tray with a wax paper and the masala all over the roll!!
