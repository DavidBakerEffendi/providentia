Went there Friday night for dinner.  Let me first say that I have had some very good food here, but Friday night was the exception.  I had the baked meatloaf & baked macaroni.  It was the most tasteless meatloaf I have ever eaten.  Needless to say I ate none of it.  The baked macaroni tasted like macaroni with warm Milk.  If there was any cheese in it I sure could not find it.  This was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  Like I said, most of the food I would recommend but not this dish.
