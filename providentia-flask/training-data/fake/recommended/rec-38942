Just finished up a very tasty lunch here... The crispy sesame chicken, pork fried rice & wonton soup were delicious (and a deal at $7.95). Dan ate every bite of his beef and broccoli. (He opted for the white rice and also enjoyed the wonton soup). I've had better spring rolls and fried pot stickers elsewhere, but they were certainly fine here. All of the food was beautifully presented, and I appreciated the adequate portion sizes. We left completely satisfied, but felt no need to gorge ourselves with the usual monster portions at many other Asian restaurants. I also really enjoyed a lovely pot of tea with my little redhead... Â (Other than drinking tea from her own little teacup, the 2 1/2 year old's highlight was most definitely the captivating koi fish pond when we first walked in.) This restaurant has a relaxing (Ha! "Zen-like") atmosphere, and welcoming decor. Everyone was extremely kind, hospitable & accommodating. We really enjoyed our lunch, and I'm sure we'll be back.
