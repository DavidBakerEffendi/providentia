I had to unfortunately grab take out because I had a limited time for lunch.   I had the chicken shish tawook sandwich and it was sooooooo delicious!  The chicken was tender and light - I was completely full from that sandwich.  I also grabbed the hummus to take home which was light and fresh, but not enough pita to go with the enormous amount of hummus.  The staff were pleasant and very personable, that I wish I stayed in to eat. Oh well, next time
