This place won us over first for not being overcrowded at 8pm on a Saturday night, and then for actually delivering tasty food at a non-paralyzing price point.  The tequila-rosemary cocktail was refreshing; the 'tasting of chicken' tasted fully and satisfyingly of chicken; the fish and chips, while not 'amazing', as described by our server, were ample and well cooked. A special panna cotta with blood orange and caramel was a terrific capper.  Attentive service, good ambiance.
