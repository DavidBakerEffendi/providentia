Whiskey and grits, the TRUE breakfast of champions. In my previous stops at Rex, I had only sampled one of their stellar cocktails.  Finally, I got a chance to sit for a meal and it was a very enjoyable one. We began with the fried oysters and the mac & cheese.  I'm always impressed when I can taste brine and sweetness in a fried oyster and that's exactly what I got.  They were perfect and those grits, holy hell.  The mac and cheese while not the best I've had was certainly impressive and I had many spoonfuls of it.  We also grabbed a special of the Nashville Dill Hot Wings which were definitely the highlight of the meal.  Our waiter warned us about the heat level but we pressed on anyway.  They were totally awesome.  The heat was a dry heat and I could still taste dill.  I love it when flavors are balanced in a dish. My main was the pork hash and I was impressed with both its flavor and presentation.  I didn't expect that hash could look elegant but the kitchen at Rex pulled it off.  The pork was put in alternating pieces on the plate along with the potatoes and roasted cippiolini.  The dish came together really well and I would certainly eat it again. This was a very enjoyable meal and when paired with stellar made cocktails (courtesy of Sweet Lou) just made the whole experience memorable.  Next up, brunch, and another wonderful reason to return.
