Good food. Lots of beer. Yayyy. Anchovie sandwiches. Â Stout braised short rib sandwiches. Gigantic beer battered onion rings. A multitude of beer options. Though this place doesn't look like much, the food is pretty nice quality and the beer selection is solid. Prices aren't bad but not cheap. This one is a gem. Cheers.
