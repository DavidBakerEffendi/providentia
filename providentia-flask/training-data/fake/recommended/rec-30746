It's entirely possible that I'm self-hating, but there's a reason these reviews (or on most other joints) are so split. Just look who's writing them. Would you really trust their taste? There's a reason why this place is where it is - on top of an Urban, and on the same street as SEA. I don't think anyone who has a clue about Brooklyn visits anything but the entrance to the L on this street. It's perched itself up high but all it is, is perpendicular to SEA. That should tell you enough. High concept, execution problems. Great ideas in the contrast of dish ingredients but execution was a problem all around. From the two, "It's my first day" servers to the arson-suggestive cocktail to the undercooked monkfish, the experience left me wishing I came on a better, more together evening. Poutine, peas, and schnitzel executed nicely, nice flavors to mesh. Poor with the not-quite-fermented enough celery broth, lacking barnyard complexity or proper viscosity to hold up to the crisp, gummy monkfish, porgy that yearned to be elevated. My mezcal-based apple cocktail tasted like what happens when a scorned farmer's wife finds out he's been screwing the organic lamb instead of her, and sets the entire orchard ablaze. Oh, and the banh mi poutine was introduced to the table as "a fusion of Korean and Canadian dishes" - to which I responded, "banh mi is Vietnamese". "Oh, shit. That's a big mistake, huh?" Yup.
