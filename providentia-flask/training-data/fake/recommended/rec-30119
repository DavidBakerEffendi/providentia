I love green tea, I have to that this cha an have the best green tea I ever had in a long time! And I loved ever details of this restaurant:) I walked in With my girl friend on a Monday night. We already had dinner and I had a little too much drink, lol. We were seated by the window and a mafia looking waiter came to our table ( is this place owned by 山口组 ） or what??? Lol, but he was kind. Me and my girlfriend ordered a lot of food, a little OD I have to say, but I loved every little plates that came out of the kitchen. The green tea I had was in a black pot and it was like- oh my god! The tea was not too strong or too dry. It is clean, smooth but had a very long lasting flavor:) Again I have to say, I love their green tea!
