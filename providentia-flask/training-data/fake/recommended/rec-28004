This place would be receiving four stars but unfortunately the last 10 minutes of our dining experience ruined it all. After a wonderful meal of Mac & cheese and burgers, my company and I said over and over how great the food was. The bill was almost 50 bucks and I remember leaving small tip because we couldn't get to an ATM that evening. Keep in mind I dine out a lot, and also a caterer.  I believe  firmly in giving waitresses a well deserved tip, but in all honesty we just couldn't get to an ATM. We wound up leaving $8.00.  It was around 1130 at night. Our server chased me and my company out of the restaurant and yelled to the man controlling the door we were not welcome back as well as many other racial slurs. Today I happen to be going through a old bank stated bank statement and it reminded me to write about this on yelp. I wish I could remember our servers name. Honestly when I spoke to the man at the door about her behavior, he didn't seem bothered by it anyway. Great food, but a lousy experience.
