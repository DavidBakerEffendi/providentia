This is about as solid and quintessential a Chinese takeout place as you can expect. Is it quality food? No. It is delicious? You betcha. Very friendly people and moderate prices. The General Tso's chicken was the heavily battered thigh meat that you expect. The fried rice wasn't greasy, but didn't stand out. My wife enjoyed the wonton soup and pork lo mein. They toss in a free two-liter bottle of soda with large orders too.
