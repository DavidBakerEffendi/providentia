Let's just say this is the place I want to go to when I feel like not only relaxing but also drinking myself into a humble mess. The food is amazing, the drinks on tap superb. Whodda thunk that the once place I'd rather be chilling at when it comes to only food and beer would only be that of fishtowns finest. The whole place is dimly lit, relaxing to those who want to just sink away into their seat and forget their nearby diners existence. It's so relaxed there you almost want to just light up a cigarette and start smoking sure that no one around you would even pay mind to the second hand smoke they're about to ingest. lol. The bands that play there are great, we enjoy just being able to go out and relax. The food, wow. I had the fishtown stew and I just talking about it now leaves me craving it. The shrimp came out Jumbo and plenty. Mussels perfectly cooked, stew flavorly filling. I think I might just have to make a trip down to fishtown now..... a must go.
