Yes...just yes. Just went for a date night with my husband and it was everything we hoped it would be and more. Everything was delicious. The service is great despite the fact they're so busy. Very convenient to go grab a drink at Whiskey Lounge while you wait for your table. And on top of all that - great martinis. Win!
