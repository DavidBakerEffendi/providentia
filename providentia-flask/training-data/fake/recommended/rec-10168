I've been here twice for business lunches, and enjoyed very good food and service both times. It's got a casual, yet classy vibe, suitable for most any occasion. The sandwiches, chicken pot pie, and beef and ale pie all got good reviews by diners I was with. Last time, I ordered the banger with bubble and squeak just for the pleasure of saying, "I'll have the banger with bubble and squeak." Not bad, and fun to say. I have seen the place packed after work for happy hour, but have never ventured in for that experience.
