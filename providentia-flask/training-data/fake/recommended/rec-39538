I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I used to eat here, about once a month...food is pretty decent and drinks are inexpensive. (Not the best--but hey you get what you pay for) EXCEPT.... Ate there 1 week ago, and there was a GIANT BEETLE in my drink, I kid you not. I wish i was lying. I was finishing the drink and as i opened my eye I see a red sangria soaked BEETLE washed up on the side of the glass. Nearly barfed. Literally ran for the bathroom!--FYI we are talking over 1 inch beetle legs and all, wish i took a picture because I would upload it. My boyfriend called over the waitress to tell her, and she said she would comp this 1 drink...are you kidding????????? I came back and looked at the bill before my BF paid, and I REFUSED to pay anything, THERE WAS A BEETLE IN MY FINISHED DRINK!!!! HUGE HEALTH VIOLATION (I did report this to the health department FYI)!! The manager was the BIGGEST JERK I have ever dealt with. (considering I was a manger of a restaurant, I know what great customer service is) He wouldn't comp anything but the drink because "there was nothing wrong with anything, and you sat here for about 2 hours taking up a spot that someone else could be enjoying". Screw you! I told him i would only pay for the 1 entree that we split, since he was the biggest jerk ever, and I just wanted to leave. Literally YUCA get new management and CLEAN your bar! That is unacceptable!!
