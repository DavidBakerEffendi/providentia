Great lobster rolls. Right about of mayo and other ingredients, and the lobster was perfectly cooked and tasty. Buns are toasted and buttery, but not chokingly so. Comes with Cape Cod chips. They were out of chowder, so I can't attest to that. You order on one side and, if you're eating there, there's a room next door with picnic tables. They have non-alcoholic bevs, but it's also BYOB, which we unfortunately did not know. This place has it going on.
