This place is really amazing. I just want to say before I write how good the food was that it does get loud in the place and if on a date, you may end up talking louder than expected. They do have an outside area but since it was winter time, not sure if it was open but would probably be less loud in the warmer months. For an appetizer, we had the pomodoro farcito which was amazing. I was a little skeptical at first because I have trouble eating raw tomotos because of their texture but with the cheese inside, it made this dish great. For dinner, I had the pollo alla partenopea. I grew up on homemade sauce and this sauce really had a fantastic taste to it and the chicken was tender enough that it was easy to cut. My date had the pappardelle al ragu do vitello which had a similar sauce to my dish and also a great taste. All in all, the food was excellenct so it was definitely worth coming here.
