The food was great and the beer was reasonably priced. We did the small dishes (medium sized) for sharing and felt full up after 3 dishes and a bowl of rice. It wasn't too busy when we went (7ish on sunday), but it was probably early for the east village crowd. Not cheap, but I think it's worth it.
