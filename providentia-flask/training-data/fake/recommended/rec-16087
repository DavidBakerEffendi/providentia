Well.... honestly, didn't really think their burger is good. Lively kind of typical village bar. I came here just to try the famous burger, but felt like I was in one of the regular ordinary miscellaneous bars in the village with the burger. Maybe it's me, since many of my friends still recommend me to come here for a good burger.
