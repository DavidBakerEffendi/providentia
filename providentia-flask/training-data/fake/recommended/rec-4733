We left the West Village for a walk to a different (not Lupa) Mario Batali restaurant for lunch on a nice and warm Saturday spring afternoon.  As we trekked through the area, several of the group became bothered by an attack of the spring-time allergies.  As luck would have it, Lupa just happened to be a Batali restaurant that was near to where we were at the time.  I took a look at the menu outside as we were walking in, trying to decipher the lingo.  We were seated right away in the back room. I confiscated most of the bread since I was really hungry at this point.  We ended up ordering the Escarole, Tuna and Cannelini, Linguini and Mussels, Skate with Clams and Rabe, Market Fish (Striped Bass) with Spring Onions and Favas and the Spaghetti con Pomodoro (I think?; it's the one with the red sauce and chunks of tomato). I'm not a cheese expert, but whatever cheese was shredded over the Escarole was delicious.  No complaints with the Tuna and Cannelini.  The spaghetti in the red sauce with tomato chunks was also very tasty and satisfying. My favorite of the dishes was the Linguini and Mussels.  It's the best that I can remember eating.  The striped bass was perfectly prepared (big thumbs up) unlike some other restaurants which soured me on ordering striped bass.  I also enjoyed the Skate, even after I found out they are part of the ray family (Skates do not have a stinger or tail barb). Just some incredibly good food.  Definitely one of my favorites.
