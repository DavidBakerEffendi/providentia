I've been here a few times.... very tasty... LOVE LOVE LOVE the different selection of empanadas.  I've also had their Shirt Steak Salad... BIG portion!! had it for lunch then the rest for dinner. i usually recommend to people who work in the area and are tired of the same ol same ol thang.   The place is rather small and sitting can be an issue but there's alwys take out and walk to the neighborhood park on a nice day. I am and will stay a frequent visitor...... unless they change the menu.  :p
