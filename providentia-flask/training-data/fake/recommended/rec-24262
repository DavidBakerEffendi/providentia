We still love Giorgio's. Unfortunately (although unsurprisingly), they recently increased the price on most of their menu. The food, service, and atmosphere are still wonderful, but the slight bump in cost was just enough to make Giorgio's good for a more occasional special-ish night out instead of a standby.
