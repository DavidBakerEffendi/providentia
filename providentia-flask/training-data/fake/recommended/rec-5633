I love this restuarant.  I'm usually a very picky eater and don't like small fancier menus but I love this place every time I go, especially the edemame!  The set up is very different, but very cool.  The service was great, they even offer different types of water, sparkling, bottled, or tap.  They also have a nice drink selection although that can run your bill up very quickly.  I'd recommend the Indian Summer!
