Trendy, but not pretentious. Good beers and a variety of mixed drinks with unique ingredients. The place has a chill vibe, which is rare in the financial district. The drinks and food are overpriced, but really creative and enjoyable. I went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night and it was very tight in there. Great for 2 people so you can squeeze into the bar area or find a nook.
