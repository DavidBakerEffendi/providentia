I love this place.  I've been going to Cafe Steinhof for over 10 years.  I used to live right down the block before all of the crazy soccer moms began invading Park Slope lol.  Cafe Steinhof's chocolate crepes are like soft, doughy crack pancakes w/melted heroin chocolate. They also have a great beer/wine selection.  I used to get their seafood ragout before I became a vegetarian.  It is very flavorful, filling, and not 'fishy' at all.  I usually HATE fish, but my friend ordered it and I tried a bit.  After that, I ordered it practically every week. It really hits the spot in the wintertime. The ham and brie sandwiches are great. I've been a vegetarian for a little while now and Steinhof's meat sandwiches are definitely missable ;( Everything tastes homemade. It reminds me of 'the old South Slope'.  Good vibes + good food + good service is so important when it's below 0 degrees and New York feels like a kick in the vageen.  It occasionally gets a little too crowded for my ADD, but it's still worth checking out.  I'm going back to NY in the next month or two. I can't wait to meet up with old friends and eat crepes and drink Austrian beer like old times. It's nice to know that some of the good things about New York are still around.
