Wouldn't say everything here is Cuban, what I would say is that everything is here is pretty darn good. Had the lomo saltado short ribs. That's some good tender meat right there. Also tried the lechon sandwich. Also some good stuff. Was going to pass on dessert, but our waitress, who was really nice, convinced me to try the torrejas de oliva. Its like a bread pudding with a brulee top. Excellent. What is also great about this place is that its pretty affordable and 24hr. I would totally come here instead of a diner or mott street.
