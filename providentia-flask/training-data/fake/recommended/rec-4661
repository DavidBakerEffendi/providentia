Love this place. It's small with a cosy, hip buzz. They have some wonderful folks in the kitchen judging by everything we've  tried, from empanadas, the salad with yucca and shrimp,  devil  crab appetizers and the pan con pescado, a hot sandwich of fish sauteed in a really tasty sauce on acuban roll. I didn't try any entrees yet but they look good on the plates I saw go by to other tables.  The best margaritas and mojitos around New Haven by far. Next time I'm trying the sangria.
