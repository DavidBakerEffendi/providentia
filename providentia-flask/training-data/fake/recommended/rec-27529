I loooooove this place. 1. The food is great. They use local, seasonal and often organic food, and so their menu constantly changes to reflect what is available. The combinations of ingredients are innovative and unexpected. 2. Nice wine list with a variety of prices. 3. Friendly, funny and helpful staff. They will honestly direct you to a good selection of dish or wine pairing(not just the most expensive option). 4. Atmosphere is super cozy and comfortable, outside or inside. You should go here. It is such a great restaurant.
