This place would be great if they just lost their attitude. Food is amazing. Service sucks. Every time I've been here the server always has some kind of issue. Spent almost $40 on lunch and needed to do some work during my lunch break. Asked what the wi-fi PW was because they had two networks. RHLP Office and RHLP. The server said they don't give out the PW because it was for office use only. Really? I just spent $40 on lunch and you can't offer me free wifi? Pretty fucking lame and inconsiderate. Hell, McDonald's has free wifi. Whatever, I won't be going back.
