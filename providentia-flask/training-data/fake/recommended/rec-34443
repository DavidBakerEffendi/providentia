The food was par on flavor, but portions are ridiculously small. Other than the salad, you will be left asking "is that all". Now we get to the price, the only thing higher than the cost of this experience was the noise level. While both were absence, when I left, all though the noise was gone so was all the money in my wallet. For just 2-3 more $, I could have had 4 times the food at any other pizzaria in town. Â How ever I do find it necessary to mention that the service I had was both friendly and professional.
