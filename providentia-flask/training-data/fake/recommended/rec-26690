It was so cramped and noisy here that I couldn't enjoy basic conversation with my wife.  They have patrons sitting practically elbow to elbow in order to fit in what amounts to a small corner store.  This place would benefit from removing some tables or adding an upstairs seating area.  Aside from the no-comfort aspect of the dining area the food was good but not impressive.   We started with an appetizer - jumbo lump crabmeat with citrus and pesto aioli.  This was nice and refreshing and perfect for sharing.  The entrees, though, were a bit downhill from there.  I had the veal cutlets which were done in a lemon butter sauce.  One of my pet peeves is when a dish advertises roasted peppers and they are clearly those slimy ones from a jar - not roasted fresh on the premises.  This was the case here.  My wife got the ravioli special which was good but she had maybe five dumplings on her plate - not very generous for the premium we paid. The service was ok but like at least another reviewer mentioned I felt a bit rushed.  This isn't a bad place but you can do better for this food genre and price point in Philly.
