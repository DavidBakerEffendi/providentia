Didn't realize it was vegan sushi until I walked in but since our original spot couldn't be found, we decided to stay and give this place a go. The sushi was very, very different from the types of rolls we get at regular restaurants. They use a different rice--black rice, brown rice, and other types of grains. Everything was vegetable--there wasn't actually any fish involved, but the sushi itself was still very delicious--tasted fresh and clean (for lack of a better way to describe it). Would definitely go back (already picked up a delivery menu for when I'm out there again).
