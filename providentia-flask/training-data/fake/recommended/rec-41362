i go to chuko at least once a week because i'm completely hooked on their kimchi ramen. it's off the chain amazing, and i typically find ramen overrated. tonight, i decided to branch out and try the pork bone ramen. it wasn't a love connection, totally fine, it happens. our waiter came over and asked if i wanted it to go, when i declined i explained that i wasn't a big fan. as a result, he insisted on bringing me a different one the house - so unbelievably unnecessary and nice. at first i declined because again, it was my fault i ordered it. but he was so insistent that i leave with a good meal in my belly so i thankfully accepted and went back to my standard kimchi. great job chuko - Â what a way to establish yourself in the neighborhood.
