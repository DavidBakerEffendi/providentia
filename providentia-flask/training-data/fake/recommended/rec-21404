I went there around 9:30 at night on a Saturday and enjoyed there outdoor seating with a group of friends and there Blackberry Lemonade was very good. After a drink or two we then proceeded to the dance area ( guys 10 dollar cover, girls 5). The music is very upbeat and dancing is fun and a good time was had by all. Â I would recommend this place for people who like to go out to Bars and Dance but don't enjoy the whole club scene. Though a word of caution it is very hot in the dance area so dress accordingly
