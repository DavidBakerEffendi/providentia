AMAZING. Govinda's is simply amazing!  We have been there several times after finally making the hour long trip to the city to try it.  It is now our favorite food establishment ever...period.  We're a veg family and it's so nice to go somewhere that we can order anything on the menu worry free!  Everything we've tried is so delicious.  The food is abundant and fresh, and the prices are just fine.  For the takeout section: my favorite food is without a doubt the Seafood salad wrap.  Oh WOW.  It's pure heaven in a huge soft overstuffed wrap.  How can it taste that awesome yet NOT be real seafood?!?! I I also tried the fish sandwich and that was nice.  My husband, like most reviewers loves the chicken cheesesteak.  We ate at the fine dining section once.  We chose the buffet for $15. That is a NICE price if you ask me!  The food was delicious!  There were about four entrees on the bar and several rice dishes and we received a nice salad with really unique and tasty dressing.  One of the entrees was a tofu in a golden sauce like the wrap in the to-go section.  I found that sauce to be about the best thing I ever ate and found myself putting it on EVERYTHING!!  We ate upstairs and found it to be very quaint and quite romantic!  Highly recommended.  I can't wait to go back.  I just can't wait!
