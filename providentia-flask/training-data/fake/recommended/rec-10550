They really listen to Â diet-challenged diners, like my sister in law who has wheat, vinegar, dairy, and who knows what else stomach issues. I just have the lactose thing, and they came through like champs with my XO Sauce-encrusted Kampachi fish over sauteed white asparagus and fiddle-head ferns. The salad was great too - market greens, thin sliced daikon radish, strawberries, and macadamia nuts. Now that's what I call service.
