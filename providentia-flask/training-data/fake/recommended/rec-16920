We waited 55 minutes to pay our check. Fifty-five minutes with money on the table, waiting to be picked up. Our waiter was nowhere to be found and every time we tried to flag someone else down to help us, they just told us to wait for our original server. Halfway through the ordeal, a busboy came by and took all of our water glasses so we didn't even have anything to drink while we waited. The restaurant wasn't even full, because I know how crazy Cuban Pete's can get on a busy night. I've never experienced worse service in my life. Also, I'm Cuban, and I'm sad to say that this food is far from authentic. I ordered a bunch of appetizers and none of the foods that are fried had the fresh level of crispiness that's found in traditional preparation- both the empanadas and croquetas (that are breaded and meant to be either fried or broiled) were soggy and cold. The word "disappointment" is a large understatement.
