Heard about this gem based on reviews online and decided if I was in Brooklyn, I must check it out! Busy restaurant, with lots of notable celebrity visits on the wall. The food is known for their thin crust pizza and hot-stone oven. We ordered the basic (mozzarella and tomato sauce with basil) and added extra basil, mushroom, and salami - so good!! It's simple, tasty and has amazingly fresh flavour. Prices we're affordable and there was no line-up to arrive. However, it was in the middle of a Friday around 3PM. Only downer was that they did not have a liquor license and a beer would have been divine!
