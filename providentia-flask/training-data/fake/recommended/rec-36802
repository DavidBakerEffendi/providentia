I really can't remember the last time that I had a dining experience that made me as happy as the dinner I had recently at Boqueria. I literally had a smile on my face the whole time I was here. The service was absolutely outstanding. Everyone we encountered was friendly and hospitable. The place was packed by the time we arrived a little before 7:00 on a Saturday so we ended up sitting along the bar overlooking the kitchen. This actually turned out to be really cool because it afforded us a view of everything they were cooking and we got to make friends not only with the staff, but also with the other diners seated near us. The food, although delicious, was really only one small part of the amazing experience I had here. Everything from the decor, to the service to the location and the overall vibe of the place was awesome. And, for the amount we ate and drank, the bill was really reasonable. If I ever get to New York, I will definitely be a regular here!
