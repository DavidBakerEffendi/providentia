I'm at Fare with my friends: Michael, Kelli and Jefferson.  Sangria is superior to many spanish venues.  We had a breakfast burrito, which was amazing; tuna tartar- mouthwatering; watermelon salad- life changing! Fish tacos were delicious, though, we didn't get a lot of the citrus slaw taste.  Pescatarian flatbread didn't disappoint. The big surprise winner was the zucchini chips... wahoo!  Also, another big hit was the gazpacho w crab meat and basil oil.  OMG. The service was impeccable!  Stacey was on top of everything!  John the  manager made sure we were 110% happy at all times.  Stay tuned because there are plans for a living wall of fresh herbs, fireplace outside and outdoor area.
