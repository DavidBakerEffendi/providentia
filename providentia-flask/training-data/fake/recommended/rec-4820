This review is solely based on the service. It was so bad we didn't even bother to eat here. According to various diff sites, Pat's is the go-to spot to try a philly cheese steak so that's exactly where my bf and I headed on our recent weekend trip to Philly. We walk up to the counter where nobody at all is paying attention to the customers. We see a guy cleaning up the register so we ask him if that is where we ordered, he said "yes, but you're gonna have to give me a minute". so we wait patiently, and 2 minutes later, the guy is done cleaning and he has his back completely turned to us, watching the hockey game and drinking his soda. we felt so disrespected and ignored, we just had to tell him off and walk away right across the street to Geno's which there was def. better service!
