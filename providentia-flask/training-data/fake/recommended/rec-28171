A carnivore's dream. The only thing you need to get from the salad bar is your empty plate. Don't waste any of you limited stomach space on anything up there. You'll only regret it. The best beef around is awaiting you. (however, the chicken and pork are not noteworthy). The sirloin, whole filet (not the bacon wrapped morsel), garlic steak are outrageous. Even the bananas are great. I wish that another restaurant served the little cheesy rolls, because I could eat them as a meal but here they cause me to stop an ponder more cheesy rolls or more meat. The staff is very friendly. I visit for a few weeks a year from NYC and the manager remembers me (that might be a result of eating there too often, but it's that damn good), where I'm from and why I'm in town. If you don't believe how good it is, just walk by it and breathe deeply. Meaty air is amazing.
