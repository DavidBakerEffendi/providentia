Ew, dude. No. Before we were even seated, the hostess (who looked like a crab mixed with Brian Dennehy) started saying rude comments about my Rasta-Man hat. If you have never seen this kind of hat, you should check it out on google cuz it is AWESOME. It makes it look like you are wearing a tam-style hat (which, I suppose, you are) and ALSO like you have long dreadlocks!!!!!! Personally, I don't have dreadlocks and I'm not about to start growing them now (HELLO!?), so this hat is a great, quick way for me to "dread up" when I wanna and still be able to swerve back to a clip-on ponytail later on if I feel like. Anyway, the hostess is all "blah blah that's kind of offensive, blah blah" and my friend Caoimhe is all "your face is kind of offensive" (again, Crabby Dennehy). By the time we were finally seated, all I wanted to do was listen to "Catch a Fire" and tear into some Pringles.
