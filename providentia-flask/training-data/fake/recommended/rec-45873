I'm going to echo a previous review: the food is not as healthy as suggested. I've been there twice and I'm now convicted that there's a bit of deception going on. I also noticed that the chef came in and out of the kitchen, did different things and never seemed to wash his hands in between--in the immortal words of Jerry Seinfeld "I think poppy is a little sloppy."
