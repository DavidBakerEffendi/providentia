It is a toss up between Grimaldi's and Juliano's a couple of shops down,personally my preference is Juliano's, especially with the entire story about Patsy Grimaldi taking a stand but both of them are pretty good. Grimaldi's seems to be the more iconic choice though hence the bigger lines outside it. Best is to get the pizza and go sit at the pier to have it.
