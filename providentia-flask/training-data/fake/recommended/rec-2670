Great neighborhood spot in the Breeze that we frequent often. Love the beer selection here, and the eclectic food menu is always changing. Where else can you find a spaghetti sandwich?! The salt and pepper fries are a perfect snack too. The bartenders and servers are always nice and willing to answer questions about the menu or offer a brew suggestion based on what you like.
