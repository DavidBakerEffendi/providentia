JOLIE used to be Â my Fav restaurant. I'm so happy that they have opened JOLIE CANTINA, wow, wow, wow. Same amazing food with a flair. Plus, they still have my amazing St. Germaine Martini.... LOVE. Only thing I miss is the great space on Altlantic ave that they left. Try anything with Lobster or Steak!
