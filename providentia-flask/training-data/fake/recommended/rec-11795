I went for dinner on Sunday with three friends. It was all in all a really nice experience.  We got there at 5:30 on the button because I had heard it gets crowded pretty fast. Think the combo of football and the bitter cold kept the rabid crowd away; we walked into a completely empty place. My gf and I were giggling about the fact that they told us to wait at the bar until our entire party was here. Ah well. By 630 the place had filled up nicely. We were seated and set about to order. The Sunday supper option is a great idea but that night's meat option wasn't doing it for me (root veg salad, pork meatballs on pasta and a pound cake). So I went with the reco by many on yelp for the kale salad. Very tasty. Nice crunch with toasted nuts. Also got the pork sticky rolls - which to my delight came out looking exactly like cinnamon buns complete with icing! Shredded pork was tucked into the coil of the bun itself.  I was kind of disappointed when I tasted the "icing" and it wasn't sweet. It's just me being crazy into the sweet/savory combo. The horseradish mayo that they used paired nicely with the pork anyway so it was good.  I also snuck a taste of the crispy gnocchi off a friend's plate.  Also very good.  The waitress had mentioned that the gnocchi would come in a small fist-sized portion. Wrong - it was a generous entree-sized dish.  Which takes me to the one part of the experience that was a wee bit off: the waitress. She appeared really dazed, loopy, sleepy, high or something. Kinda hoping for better, more articulate service. But whatevs. I'd go back again for sure. But not to drink. Nothing on their drinks menu jumped out at me and seemed overpriced to me for what was on it (although guess you can say that about plenty of other places in manhattan). Last thing: there were a few comments that the place was small. Technically it is, but not nearly enough to where you're super squished or bumping into people.  Thought it was super cute, actually.
