3.5 My boyfriend and I come here often for the great burgers, but every single time the service has been TERRIBLE. The same bartender is always there and he is a miserable nincompoop. If you can minimize your time interacting with him by making sure you just tell him exactly what you want and then getting the hell away you might be ok. The other night my boyfriend unfortunately made the mistake of changing his mind and, god forbid, asking for a drink - the guy's response was "I already asked you and you said no!". Not that it's his job or anything...
