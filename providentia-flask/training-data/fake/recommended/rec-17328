I go here with friends on special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries and sometimes when family visits, I take them here.  This place never disappoint. Excellent service, the staff knows every food on their menu.  The ambiance inside the restaurant although it is small is very cozy and intimate.  I try to go here on a Thursday night because this is when they have a violinist play for their customers which is really nice especially if you are on a romantic date,  gives elegance and sophistication to the whole atmosphere of the restaurant.  Their food are delicious! Great portions.  I always end up taking extra food to go.  Their complimentary bread is what I always look forward to.  They have this really flavorful oil & herbs dressing that perfectly goes with their fresh baked bread. Another must try food of theirs is their Margharita pizza.  Everything tastes fresh and flavorful. Really delicious! BYOB. Yes, it's byob.  What more can you ask for?  Superb food & great service.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.
