I ordered one pulled pork sandwich and one beef brisket sandwich, both with rabe and sharp provolone. The pulled pork was, my sweetie and I both decided, just "meh". But the brisket one was really delicious! Beef is a stronger-tasting meat and held up better against the sharp provolone and the broccoli rabe. I got lucky and only waited in line for around 20 minutes. (!) But who cares, it's time taking in the sights and sounds of the Reading Market! :)
