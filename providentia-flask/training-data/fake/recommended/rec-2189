You stand in line with smelly trash cans all around (nothing like the smell of rotting food to get you hungry) and you get up to the front and see signs "This is America Speak English" and nasty servers. When I travel to different countries, I am glad they are not as nasty. Can you imagine going to Italy and not eating because you don't speak fluent Italian? Shame on Genos!
