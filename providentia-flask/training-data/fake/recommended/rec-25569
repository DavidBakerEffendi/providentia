The owners are so nice and really down to earth. Very accommodating and I have Never had a bad service, vegetarian sushi options are all great, but don't get the sauce on top of the sweet potato rolls. It is made with fish and oyster sauce. I also love the fried avocado with sweet and hot sauce and the Asian mango dish in amazing! They are so friendly and the head chef will give out free samples of new menu items seasonally. We have eaten there six times so far and have received four or five free appetizers! Love them!
