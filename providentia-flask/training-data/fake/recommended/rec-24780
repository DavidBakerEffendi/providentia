Awesome place and it's well worth the price. Definitely a great place to go with a large group. You would never expect to enjoy a salad bar at a Brazilian steakhouse. However, the gourmet salad bar here was actually my favorite part of the meal... it's a never ending array of delicious food! All of the various cuts of Â meat were all well prepared and the caramelized bananas that came as a side dish were divine!
