I love, and I mean ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place. I always come here whenever I'm in the city; I just can't resist. The long does get a bit long at times, but you never wait for too long. And it's also open really late at night, so it makes for perfect drunk food! Their food is amazing for cart food. I usually get the chicken & rice platter; it's my go-to dish. I've had the lamb, it's pretty good, but you really can't beat the chicken. I'm a fan of the falafel one too. Can't argue with the price for the amount of food they give you (and the taste too). It's only $6 per platter and it fills you up pretty good. But the best thing about this cart is their white sauce and hot sauce. I don't know what they put in the white sauce, but goddamn that's some good stuff! Hot sauce is really hot, by the way, so have a little bit first before you start pouring it all over your platter. NOTE: They started selling bottles of their sauces! If you like them that much, you can ask for it. Not sure about the prices though.
