I really enjoy Nom Nom and have been a quiet fan since it opened. People can be mighty snobby when it comes to ramen, but while I too have had superior versions in Asia/NY, I still think Nom Nom's ramen is pretty good and welcome its presence in Philly wholeheartedly. I only get the Karai Miso (aka spicy miso) - not because the other options are bad, it's just that it was the first one I tried and I can't bring myself to venture away from it. It's spicy, but not overtly so - if you can generally handle a medium spice level, you'll be fine. The broth does sway more towards the greasy end of the scale, but the savory and distinct flavors of the contents make up for it. At $8 a bowl, I do wish they threw more in there to make it a better bang for your buck, but I also never leave hungry. The pork buns are ok. I'm not really the person to vouch for this, because I generally dislike fatty meat which, to my understanding, is what most people are looking for with these kind of things. Service is friendly but not fussy; you pay for everything at the counter and pick up your order when they call your name.
