Just stopped in for a fresh juice. I dont remember the name of what I got, but it has carrot, apple, ginger, garlic, and i added kale. It's the bomb. Prices are pretty good. It is 4:45pm on a Wednesday and there is absolutely no one here but me and the awesome girl behind the counter. She's super friendly! Has free wifi and some outlets
