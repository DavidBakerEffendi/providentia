This was a great little spot to get bibimbap. It was fast fresh and very friendly. No nonsense. you go in you order the people are very nice, you get your food and all is good. The food is very very fresh, there is just enough chili sauce, and it is a good amount of food. I would greatly recommend trying this place out for sure.
