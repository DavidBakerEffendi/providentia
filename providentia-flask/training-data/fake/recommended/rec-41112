The food is delicious, but given the cramped space and the lines it's often too much trouble to go. Only attempt it if it's 15 minutes before it opens for lunch or dinner; then you can walk right in. Still logistically difficult if you're in a group or have children with you. Plus so many hipster hats... So. Many.
