The concept behind the meatball shop is really simple and these guys where smart enough to make a success out of it! I regard this spot more as a bar or place for drinks with good snacks, great for small or large groups, than a restaurant itself, since the food menu is very limited in my regard. Having said that, it's one of the institutions in the Lower East Side, perfect to hang out, and, by the way, one of the very few that have outdoor seating nearby.
