Its a great concept using a chapati and rolling it in a curry. I tried their aloo masala kati roll and I got two of them. I really liked them and they were surprisingly pretty spicy. Although I got two, it just didnt fill me up. I would recommend these Kati rolls for snacks more so than a lunch or dinner. The ambiance of the place was very unique. It tried to show the streetsides of India with peeling of movie posters on a brick wall and they had pictures of Indian book designs on the wall as well. So, it was a design full of nostalgia and I really enjoyed it.
