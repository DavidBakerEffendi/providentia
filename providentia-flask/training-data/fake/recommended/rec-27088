UNREAL. Just came back from this place for the first time ever and I am blown away. The soup was amazing, and I had the most tender salmon I've ever had in my entire life. This place is so cute and amazingly clean!!! The service is outstanding, very friendly and cozy, nothing short of down to earth. They truly make you feel welcome and wanted there. Nothing but smiles!! They threw in so many things to try and extra pieces, it totally warmed my heart. I have to say, I love the place, I love the people, and I really just want to hug every person there. Plus, the positive reviews on yelp speaks for itself-its a big deal that they have 70+ reviews and 4 1/2 stars!!!! I am impressed.
