If you've ever been to one of the Village Group restaurants you will know their food is usually good. If you ever had the opportunity to have dinner at Mignon it was AMAZING. Never disappointed. Rumor had it Mignon was closed to open DelMonico. With this, I was quick to make a reservation at DelMonico's for my husbands birthday. What a disappointment!!! We ordered to start Oysters Rockefeller and Clams Casino...in having one of each I was greeted with a mouthful of sand...not uncommon but really not something you want to delve into when having dinner at a nice restaurant. For dinner, I ordered the Cajun Filet Mignon medium rare with a side if scalloped potatoes. When the dish was brought out I couldn't believe what was in front of me. Instead a nice cut of Filet Mignon I received 2 small cuts of filet that resembled pieces of loin. To make matters worse my food was cold...my Filet Mignon was cooked medium well, the shrimps were rubbery and my scalloped potatoes were cold. The center of the potatoes were really cold. It almost seemed like the sides were pre-prepared and kept refrigerated. This wouldn't bother me if they would have made a conscious effort to have their presentation make it seem like it was just prepared. Now onto dessert...one of our friends asked the waiter if the tiramisu was traditionally made with lady fingers or was it cake. He didn't know. Lol!!! I mean our waiter was pretty good for the most part but you should really know what the restaurant where you work has to offer. Dessert was okay. Nothing really decadent or worth talking about. So all in all...this place is no Mignon! Disappointing!
