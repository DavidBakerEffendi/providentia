Rosewater holds a special place in my heart. It's where my hubby to be and I had our first date. But besides the sentimental meaning, this place is wonderful. Service is professional, kind and helpful. The food is nothing short of phenomenal and unique. We were here recently for dinner to celebrate our one year anniversary. We started off with the fried goat cheese and the seasonal chopped salad. It was fresh, appetizing and absolutely mouth watering. I had the grilled sirloin steak as main course. Juicy, tasteful and simply delicious. Hubby to be got the salmon which I tried and really enjoyed as well. Overall, highly recommended for a romantic dinner, girls night out, or if you're in the mood for good food! Do note that the portions are generally small and the price of most items are pretty high but absolutely worth it.
