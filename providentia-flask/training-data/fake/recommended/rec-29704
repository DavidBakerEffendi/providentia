Almond is on my list of restaurants to visit on the night of a concert at the nearby Gramercy Theater. It's perfect on a rainy night when you just want a nice place to relax while waiting for the concert. It's a spacious place so you don't have strangers two feet away  yapping loudly. I can only write about two dishes on the menu: risotto and the dayboat scallops and smoked dust breast. Everything was fresh and nicely prepared and the waiter and the trainee were both very polite, cheerful and helpful. Sitting next to the window gives you a nice view of 22nd Street and you won't be rushed out of the restaurant. It's not cheap (about $20 to $35.00) for the main  courses and a nice bottle of wine adds some shekels to the bill.  There is also a variety of upstate New York beers and I'm always happy to help out local breweries. When your'e done, walk down one block and your'e at the Gramercy.
