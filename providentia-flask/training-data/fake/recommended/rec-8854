I've been here twice and I always love coming back because it has such a unique New York feel to it, and the food is always so refreshing and different (in a good way). This time I had the chilled tomato gazpacho soup (I loved it!!!!!) and ricotta cavatelli with carrot Bolognese, Thai basil and cashew pesto which was scrumptious.
