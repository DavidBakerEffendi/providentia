This place is great. I've spent a lot of time in SoCal and I'm always very disappointed with NYC taco joints, but Taqueria Diana has got it right. My wife and I have eaten our way through all the meats - they are all great but Al Pastor is my favorite. Everything here is great but the nachos are unreal! They make their own home made tortillas! Go now!
