Called ahead of time if check for a wait and was told there was none. We came as a family of 4 on a Friday night and it turned out the entire restaurant was reserved by other parties. Since we had been told the OPPOSITE on the phone, they managed to seat us immediately even though we didn't have a reservation. From then on the experience was amazing. The atmosphere was very cool and classy. We ordered the ribeye with potatoes au gratin, kale, and the asparagus salad to share. The rib eye was 50 0z!!! We all had room for dessert so for dessert we had the butterscotch cheesecake and the poached apples. Everything was FANTASTIC and served beautifully. I would highly recommend this establishment.
