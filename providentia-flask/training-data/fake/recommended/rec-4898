I like eating meat. I have been known to consume raw bacon and steak on occasion. It's a bit of a paradox, given my love of animals in live form, that I love to eat them so much. The great thing about this place is that they don't do a whole lot of seasoning with the meat (generally just a bit of salt) so you really get to taste the flavor of the different cuts of meat. Most all of the meat options are delicious, so there's no real reason going through those. The Picanha, filet mignon, and lamb options were particularly tasty.  The only meat options that I did not find worth my time were the Linguica (tasted like simple breakfast sausage and was a bit greasy) and the  chicken leg things (blah). As for everything else. The wine list was marked up a substantial amount, so be prepared for that. I wasn't as blown away with the "salad bar" as some others were given the fact that some of the cheeses had been sitting around for a while and developed some hardness. For desert we got the molten chocolate cake which had clearly been microwaved and the vanilla bean ice cream on top was a timid vanilla bean at best. All in all I'd say this is a great place to go if you want to experience some choice cuts of meat. However, it's the type of place that you only need to go to once. While the experience was sufficient, i doubt I will have reason to return any time in the near future.
