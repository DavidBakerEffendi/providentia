After a friendly greeting at the door by the restaurant's General Manager we were escorted to our table.  The restaurant was busy yet not loud and had a fantastic energy about it.  Our server greeted us promptly, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and helped us select a great bottle of CA cab.  After presenting our wine he took our order and happily accommodated my wife's request for a different side.  I had the butternut squash ravioli for an appetizer and my wife had the mushroom soup.  They were both delicious!  We followed that up with an outstanding cassoulet for dinner and what my wife described as the best burger she's ever had (The ONE 53 burger).  Grilled pound cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert (along with the last sip of my new favorite Cabernet) wrapped up a PERFECT night.   Friendly, well educated staff; mouth-watering food and a terrific wine list!  Easily our favorite restaurant, ONE53 gives you 153 reasons to come back!
