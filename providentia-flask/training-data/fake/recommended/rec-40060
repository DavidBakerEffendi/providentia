Fun music. Fun watching people you wouldn't expect to see dance, get it in on the dance floor for hours!! My hubby and I unfortunately finished our drinks and danced out the door to a more 'adult' establishment. So, if you just graduated college, this place is A+++!! If you graduated a few years ago, it's fun watching the newly graduated kids!!
