Great American food! Their roasted tomato soup, the most ordered item through seamless web, is the BEST. I never order tomato soup out because I make a fabulous tomato soup and no restaurant even comes close.... well that is until I tried roasted tomato soup from The Smith. It makes my soup suck! This thick, tasty, velvety soup comes with cheddar and bread atop. You can get it sans bread if you're gluten intolerant. No problem. This soup alone is reason enough for 5 stars and frequent ordering. The other items we have ordered have been the brussel sprouts and the gnocci. Both perfect. The sprouts were crisp and seasoned beautifully. The gnocci was simple and not overdone. Each bite was a great mix of cheese, potato and a hint of truffle. mmmm...... Have always ordered in from them but will soon make an in person appearance.
