After reading so many positive reviews on Yelp, I just had to check this place out. Upon walking in, I could tell that Mood Cafe was unique. The man behind the counter just about welcomed us with open arms, asking us if we'd been there before, if we knew what chaat was, etc. My friends and I looked at each other, then placed our orders of chaat and lassi. What is chaat? To this day, I still have no idea. It's a colorful mixture of spicy meat, vegetables, crispy pieces, yogurt, almonds, chickpeas, potatoes, dried fruit, and about six different sauces. Never in my life have I experienced so many flavors and textures in a single dish. Fortunately, the mixture is both delicious and satisfying. The spices deliver just the right kick to pair perfectly with a sweet, cool lassi. I'll be back to try the other chaats. In the end, what really sets Mood Cafe apart is the exceptional service. The man behind the counter is friendly and loves to share his crazy concoctions with people whether they are first-timers or longtime customers. Heck, some of Starr's restaurant staff could learn a thing or two. Mood Cafe is a neighborhood gem. So if you're craving something daring, give it a shot!
