Brunch is a little on the pricier side, but it was a great atmosphere for a group of girls treating ourselves on a late Saturday morning, and every dish was well prepared and very satisfying. Coffee was also good. The pastries basket, juice shot and mini parfaits were a nice touch and provided some variety. Can't wait to come back and try this place for dinner!
