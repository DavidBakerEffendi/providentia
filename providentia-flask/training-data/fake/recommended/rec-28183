Firstly let me start by saying my experience was a bit ruined by our overly confident slightly egotistical waiter who totally forgot to take my order then it took almost an hour to get our food, mind you I ordered a salad. But, on the upside, the food was damn good.   Started with a hurricane.  It was beyond amazing.  I will be having cravings for that in the future i'm sure.  If it wasn't so far from me since I live in Queens, I would go back and just drink hurricanes. Obviously not the best choice of eats for a vegetarian, but my one friend wanted oysters and she was in charge of picking something for everyone.  We went for a girls night. I had the salad and collared greens.  The greens were amazing and had a heavy honey dosage.  I thought it actually tasted like bacon and checked to make sure it wasn't.  Seems that the most popular dish was the biscuits and gravy so I guess BACON was on the mind.  The salad was also perfect.  I am a stinky cheese fan and this salad had a overdose of blue cheese so that was great.  Lightly dressed and delicious with candied pecans and dried cranberries.  Actually the salad was relatively simple, but I really enjoyed the flavors of MOLD & SWEET.   I would like to add that I was probably on a sugar high which may have affected my review: candied pecans, hurricane, honey in the collared greens
