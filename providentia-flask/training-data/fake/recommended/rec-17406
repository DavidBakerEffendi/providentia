Scarpetta was a great treat after walking the Highline from North to South.  We came down the 14th street access and walked a block when Yelp! alerted me to this gem.  My companions were out-of-towners so we decided to sit outside so that we could watch the world go by.  We did not have reservations but arrived before 6pm and were seated without a problem.  The menu is varied - several kinds of pastas and many types of proteins including steak, duck, and halibut.  The wine list is extensive but expensive - probably the only downfall of this evening as we couldn't find a bottle under $45 and the majority of bottles were in the hundreds of dollars.  We did settle on a $45 dollar bottle, and it was delicious, but it seemed a bit pricey for my out-of-towners, who were treating for the meal. The wine arrived and it was fantastic.  We were also served a bread basket with 4 different types of bread - the two that I remember the names of were ciabatta and stromboli.  We also received a divided tray of bread accompaniments - olive oil, eggplant/tomato relish, and marscapone butter. I had the Taleggio Mezzalunai ($26) - see pic.  They are little moon shaped stuffed pasta that taste like bites of sunsine and moonbeams with a smokiness and a tangy bite at the same time. Delicious sauce and potatoes with crispy shitakes as a garnish.  I used the bread to sop up the juices.  YUM.  I did have bites of my friend's Halibut.  DELICIOUS. I'm a big fan and would definitely go back.  This was the perfect restaurant for the end of our trek.  The service was fantastic and the bill was aproximately $150.
