My friends decided to come here for a friends b-day. At first when I looked at the menu online and the $$ , I was reluctant. Ambiance- Very chill, the restaurant isnt big, so it has a cozy/romantic feel to it. Service- AMAZING, the wait staff was so nice and really helpful. The waitress even said that our bill included gratuity, which was really honest of her. Food- I shared with a friend the Beef Tartare, Smoked trout and potato gratin. The beef tartare was delicious, a really gread app to share. The trout was DELICIOUS. It had an amazing smoky flavor to it and the portion was pretty big, extremely satisfying. My favorite was the cheesecake: A butterscotch and mascarpone cheesecake with sea salt and nut brittle, the first bite almost gave me a big O. The salty sweet combo was delicious, not a typical cheesecake though. It kind of had a creme brule consistency.... you must order this! Drinks- I ordered the ginger twist, it was really fresh and tasy, not too sweet. The scene- By the time we left there were tons of people at the bar, seemed like a good crowd and they played great music. Employees only + good friends = Good times!
