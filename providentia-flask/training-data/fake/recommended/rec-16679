To rhyme Kefi is not so easy, Should it match with eye, or free? Anyway, I was late, my friend early, I found him below, not too surly. The lack of windows though could've been cause enough, despite the shelves of pottery and dishware. Â Oh, Kefi! Did I pronounce it correctly? I ordered the striped bass, fried to crisp, juicy, with mass. Not overmuch, with scallions chopped, olives & taters which the fish topped. Overall a good dish, just not delish. The service was friendly, my friend thought nosy - questions at the end about his meal, his stomach turned. T'was goat cheese, too late he'd learned. I'd come back to Kefi: sides, the dessert I'd try. The uptown locale is not so easy, though it'd count as an odyssey.
