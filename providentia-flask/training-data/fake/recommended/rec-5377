I will be honest it has been a while since I have been down here.  I know for sure Rex is a more than A-OK place based on the food and service quality as I remember... I am not sure if I would say it is as good as it gets.. which could have been due to my entree choice.... burgers. They have very good burgers.  I added bacon to mine - which could have been the trick ;)  But no, their burgers are pretty good.  It is just as much as City Tap House's burgers, except so much better.  I am a bit disappointed in myself for just getting a 'burger' here since it's kind of a mediocre type of food.  Perhaps if I make a return and get something else that could change. They have awesome mac-and-cheese.  I highly highly highly recommend it.  It is smooth, cheesy, and the crispy panko crumbs... YUM!   I would not get cocktails for theirs are highly addictive.  I normally do not get cocktails.  If I do, I get one.  I ended up having three.  I wanted to try everything.  They all sound exotic/strange, but don't knock it til you try it.
