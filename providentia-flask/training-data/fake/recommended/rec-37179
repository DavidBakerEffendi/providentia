LOVE THIS PLACE! awesome cheap food is amazing! just get the combo chicken/lamb with rice and veggies for 6 bucks and own it with white sauce. if your brave enough get some hot sauce. Nonetheless the food taste great and even better late at night after drinking lol. So much flavor and add the heated pita on top every bite is just fun and good. Yes its fatty but worth a visit every now and then. Their lines get long at night so just be patient and enjoy the free smell of awesomeness as you wait for your own. if you haven't gone here yet just check it out, worth it.
