The fries come our crispy which I really liked. Even though the fries are thick it is not soggy but crispy! :) My sisters and I preferred ketchup over the popular mango chutney. I think the mango chutney mayo dip was too heavy. Sauces are extra charge (even for the first dip/sauce) They have ketchup and vinegar for free on the side Small inside with one table against the wall, and two other tables. The tables have several holes so you can place your fries there! Very creative! :)
