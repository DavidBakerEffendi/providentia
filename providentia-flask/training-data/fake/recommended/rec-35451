I tell ya, I'm a big breakfast connoisseur. I've travelled quite a bit and one of the best ways I've found to judge a place is by what the local breakfast spot is like. Thus far, my favorites have been this one country diner (the name of which escapes me) near Brushwood in Sherman, NY very much the country breakfast. Another one in Cape Cod that my buddy brings me to whenever I visit, and now this. It's one of those places that if you're visiting the area, family, friends, just coming to see NYC but don't want to stay there, make time for a trip here, you won't regret it. Their pancakes are amazing. Just like they should be, so many diners and other breakfast spots make pancakes that are either too heavy, light or spongy, here, they're perfection. The "flavored" pancakes are fantastic as well which is great b/c it's usually something I stay away from as normally they're over flavored or artificially so. Not here. The eggs are never overly greasy. The bacon and sausages are just as cooked as they need to be and delish as that. One of the best perks about the Rutherford Pancake House over all the others though? EVERYONE has something to eat here, be you carnivore or herbivore, you can be sure that your diet and tastes will be catered to. Aside from their breakfasts, the lunches here are equally delish, fantastic and creative burgers OH...YES, try the sweet potato fries, they're magical. Okay, I've written enough, but seriously, you must make a point to come by here. You won't regret it and if you do, you must have some form of illness that affects your sense of taste and smell...ya weirdo...
