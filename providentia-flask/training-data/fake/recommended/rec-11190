I've been wanting to try Nan Zhou for a while since it's right in my hood. When we first stepped in the place was empty, but by the time we left it was packed with C town locals (a good sign!) The menu is simple and cheap (no soup over $6). Basically it's noodles with various meat or seafood toppings (with veggie options too). I tried the ox tail while my husband opted for the beef brisket. The meat quality is good, not great, but the fresh noodles are the star here. The broth is also so hearty and tasty we didn't feel the need to add any condiments. Although the ambiance is what it is, we did catch a glimpse of noodles being made by hand. It's worth going to see if you've never seen it done before. First, our waiter took our order then he hopped behind the counter and started making noodles! (I like to imagine that he washed his hands while I wasn't looking, but I guess it adds to the authenticity if he didn't.) NZ might be my new noodle craving (sorry, Pho 75). I can't wait to go back and try the roast duck and $2 won ton!
