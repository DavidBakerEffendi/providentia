We've been here a few times now and I have to agree with the other reviewers that this is the best south indian restaurant in the area!! We finally went for the dosa buffet last night and yes, they actually have about 25 varieties of dosa! It does get very crowded and is pretty noisy on Wednesday night (not so much the other nights), but the dosas do come quickly. Make sure you only order a couple of dosa (per head) at a time, coz they bring the entire order together and the dosas tend to get cold. The ambiance isn't that great (2 stars) and the service is ok (maybe 3 stars), but the food is definitely 4 stars!
