First visit this weekend, for brunch. Had the nutella french toast, which was very good. Also appreciated that it was accompanied by some fresh fruit. Only complaint was that there was a long wait--so long, in fact, that our threesome decided to sit at the counter. Noise level is high, but it's an upbeat atmosphere with lots of young people.
