Sweet Afton, has a cool and relax vibe to it. we went on a Thursday night and it wasn't too crowded. the lighting was perfect, our waitress was very nice and on top of her game. we had the macaroni and cheese, which was good, and some fried pickles. Apparently they have a thing for pickles; they had a pickle margarita. Music could be off at times, some songs were more like noise really, but it wasnt terrible. The drinks were not bad, wished they added a little more alcohol, but that's just me. If im in the area again, I would probably stop by.
