I have been here a few times, and its a nice place to come when you just want to chill out with a friend instead of going out to a bar.  Its a comfy place.  The decor is a little much on some of the walls but its really a chill feel to it.  I wish there was a place like this in my town, but its close enough to me that it is not that bad.  This place can get super crowded and I think they sometimes don''t know how to handle it.  But the staff is friendly.   A few negatives that i don't like about this place is: -Their menu is way too big, there is just too much stuff on it, they need to cut it in half (if not more!)  It's like reading a mini autobiography just to go through the menu.   -They need to really clean off tables.  I know it gets busy but when I was there last a table was dirty, a customer sat down, and the table needed to clear off.  The girl just took the dirty dishes off and did not clean it with spray or anything which to me is gross. -Service is slow, and sort of all over the place.   -The parking lot gets crowded, and its hard to park there, and when its icy its bad! So be careful! Other then these small things, its not that bad, its a great chill place to go to to chat!
