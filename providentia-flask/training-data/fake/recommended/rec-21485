"Can I get a room with a view?" I am still enamoured by Room Service.  Not a week goes by that I don't crave my favourite bar seats.   I have made it a point recently to try new things on the menu.  Yep still in love.  The Seared Tuna Salad was great as well as the Spicy Beef and Apple Salad (new fav). Trust that this place gets packed during peak time, so either make a res or cross yer fingers.  Perfect place for pre- or post- theatre crowds.  If you have a little wait before your table I definitely suggest grabbing one of their specialty drinks at the bar.  Any of the mojitos are delicious, but personal fav (as you would know from my quick tips) is the Room Service.  P.S. this isn't your typical wait 25 minutes  for a Mojito type place.  The girls at the bar serve it up quick, as I witnessed last night when she made 9 mojitos in the flash of an eye. The staff is nothing less than spectacular.
