what a great place (and what a great corner w/POPE across the way).  Lovely big tables and nice natural light, counter for those who are chitchatting with the staff.  Everyone seems to be friends here, which makes me feel like someone's younger sister eavesdropping on the cool kids' conversation, but I'll take that over crowded places with no atmosphere or bad atmosphere. Good veggie sandwiches here-- apple, gorgonzola, walnuts, honey was delish.  I wish they had options other than baguette or bagel, like just plain old sliced bread, but that is a total nitpick.  They have soft-serve here in the summer too-- what coffee shop has soft serve??!  Now that was a good idea.
