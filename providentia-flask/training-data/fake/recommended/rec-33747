After starving for about 8 days for a photo shoot in Philly I decided that the only way to end my psycho diet of arugula and water was to do it right with a cheesesteak.  Boy was I wrong. First of all I've never had a cheesesteak so its not as if I had any expectations.  And I'm not ever supposed to eat bread, so this was a huge leap for me!  Tuesday, and I take the dog, check out of the hotel rather early to beat the luncheon crowd, and take a drive. We immediately find parking less than half a block away and decide on Pat's due to the yelp rating over Geno's.  (got to trust my yelpers!)  We cowardly stand back, and whisper the directions to order to each other. (CASH ONLY SUCKS)  Tuesday takes my arm and leans in to say 'you have to order, i dont wanna'.  We decide on WIT and American cheese lol.  Neither of us are fans of cheezwiz or whatever it is.   So I take a deep breath, walk up and say "1 WITH American".  Hand over my money, and before my change was ready my sandwich appeared!  Like magic... We sat down, split it half, and dug in.   WTH. This is IT?  The cheese isnt melted.  Its very cold.  The meat tastes like nothing, and if this place gets more love than Geno's how can Geno's be any better? Here's the best part-  I take a big chunk of what's left, and *attempt*, let me repeat A T T E M P T to give it to pups.  She sniffed, licked, then sat down.  Finally she looked at me like 'What are you trying to feed me?  NO WAY."   My dog wouldnt eat it. And that's all she wrote....
