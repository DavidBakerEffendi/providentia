Every day I have to talk myself out of going to Cafe Petisco for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is so delicious! The place is soooo cozy! The staff, they're just fabulous and genuinely care about service. I normally order the mozzarella panini. It is served on toasted bread with fresh mozzarella, pesto sauce and sun-dried tomatoes. On occasion, I like to have the mushroom burger. The foccacia with cucumber sour cream dip they serve as complimentary appetizer is so delicious that I've ordered it as a side for my telephone orders. I operate a business in this neighborhood and have a ready menu to show my clients because I am so fond of this cafe restaurant!!
