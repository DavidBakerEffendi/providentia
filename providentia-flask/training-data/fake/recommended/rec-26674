My go to place for food in Fairmount!!! I love their pizzas and the godfather is the best I've ever eaten!! Nothing compares!! Have introduced it to several ppl and they have never gone back to another kind of pizza. The godfather rocks!! Have tried a few others and have not been disappointed ever. Great service, friendly faces and a very pro kid atmosphere!!
