I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  They managed to seat us quickly and the service was very friendly and patient.  There were 4 of us but the 4th person did not show up until 1 hour after we sat down and we did not feel rushed at all despite not ordering our food until after our 4th arrived, whereas many other places are more concerned about turning their tables than anything else.  It's a BYOB so that kind of offsets the higher prices but not to say their prices are any higher than other Italian restaurants of the same caliber.  I had the pasta bolognese which was excellent.  Everyone else at our table enjoyed their dishes too, which were the gnocchi and the cheese ravioli.  We had a bratty kid from the table behind us climbing on the umbrella stands, therefore bumping into our table (we sat outside) and the waitress told him to stop since his dad wasn't doing anything about it.  Since we sat outside, it was a good spot to people watch as well.
