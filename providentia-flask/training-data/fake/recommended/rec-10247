Let me start off by saying this is the best Italian Restaurant on the LES. I went in on a Friday night and  it was  fairly busy so I sat at the bar,and proceeded to have some  of the best drinks and conversations I have had  in  years with the bartenders. I was  expecting just so so Italian food this place exceeded my expectations I wanted some thing lite to eat,  so one of the bartenders  recommended the Fennel, Baby Arugula Salad which was delicious.Even though I didn't  have any pasta or any other foods they had, I saw some of the dishes they were bringing out to people, and the reactions were nothing short of delighted.
