Hello AMAZING! This was something I COULD NOT FORFEIT on my trip to NY. I had this delicious treasure the last time I was there, and I just HAD TO HAVE IT AGAIN!!! There's something about holding that greasy aluminum bowl in your hand sitting wherever you can grab a seat and just inhaling your food covered in the white sauce and smidgen of the red (if you get a lot...you better buy all the drinks at the cart next door because you will be DYING). I want to eat this over and over and over again!! I guess it's the equivalent to LA's El Taurino! You get drunk somewhere then you go here to eat and somewhat sober up. LOL. I like it! Just my style! I will be back for you Halal Cart!!!!
