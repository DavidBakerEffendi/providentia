Pros: - Food is GREAT !! - Good wait staff makes up for the bartender's attitude - Strong drinks - Prices are reasonable Cons: - They seem to get busy fast, so there will be a wait - There's barely anywhere to stand, if you are waiting - One of the bartenders seems to consistently be of the a-hole variety - Tables are very close - Not a large venue - Crowd was not very diverse Although my cons list surpasses my pros list, I will give it more chances because of the food. Deserves more than 3 stars because the cons were bearable for the most part. If you do decide to go, don't go just for the drinks. You can find a more comfortable bar in the area. Only go here if you plan on sitting down to enjoy the delicious plates with your drinks.
