I don't claim to be an Italian dining connoisseur. But I've had some damn good gnocchi in several cities. This place was no exception. An authentic Italian experience in a great American city. Great bread to start out with; you have to mix the salt, pepper and olive oil to get the full effect. Several special plates for the Monday evening. I knew gnocchi would be a good choice. Homemade potato-ricotta dumplings in tomato-basil sauce with eggplant and fresh mozzarella melting throughout. The wait staff clearly had their stuff together. Very attentive right down to scraping the crumbs off the table before dessert. We stated what we were looking for in a wine and he catered to our needs. A few bottles later we were all thankful. They had a decent selection of local beers as well. Oh, dessert by the way. I didn't think it was possible to fit anything on top of what just ensued. But the Tartufo was a new experience for me. I would attribute it to a mochi but much better. Chocolate covered ice cream, syrup and fresh strawberries topped it all off. I don't claim to know much about New York dining either. If you are staying in Time Square or Hell's Kitchen area its worth stopping in. Traditional Italian served up with great libations to match.
