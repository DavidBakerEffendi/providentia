We were there tonight and ordered a bunch of items including a soup and appetizer. We had children with us and the waitress took their orders first and brought them fast. So definitely was impressed. But then started the issues... They brought all our food together including appetizers and when asked said we ordered all at the same time and hence brought it together... Very disappointing. Would have thought they would be better organized. She came back later and said since she made the mistake it was on the house. So was a bit satisfied. To give credit, the food was amazing and we loved the burnt chilly garlic friend rice ans scheduling potatoes. Then we ordered dessert. The waiter didn't even clear our table but brought the dessert. On being asked is when she cleared the table and that too partially. The three stars are for the food alone. Service needs to be better if I were to come again. The abiance was great and a good restaurant if they can get better servers who know what to do. That is basic expectation from a restaurant.
