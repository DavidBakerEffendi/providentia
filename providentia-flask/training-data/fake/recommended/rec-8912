One of my favorite spots in town.  It gets pretty busy most of the time, but on off hours it's alright.  I almost always sit at the bar and ususall never takes to long to get a seat for one or two.  The space is ancient and divey but exudes charachter.  The beer on tap is pretty cheap (but small) and they come in awesome heavy beer mugs.  The bartenders are all cool.  The older gentleman with the beard is a real cool cat.  I've always gotten a buy back on my 4th or 5th beer. The jukebox is one of the best in town - Dylan, Mingus, Coltrane... classic.  Now on to the food.  I love this place, and I love burgers, and I love the burgers at corner bistro because the sum of the experience is so much more than it's parts.  They are cooked under the broiler which isn't hot enough and the cooks press the juice out of them like madmen, but the burgers always come out tasting great, even the frozen fries do it for me, and some how despite that and all packs of tourists i still love corner bistro.
