Had a wonderful meal out on the deck with my aunt and cousin last week. We shared an eggplant/zucchini pie and another one with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and big slices of parmesan reggiano. Both were delicious, and the crust is thin and chewy with that classic brick oven blackening. Yum! The pies don't look huge, but we still had a slice or two left over between the three of us. The interior of the restaurant was really beautiful, but the deck was perfect for a weeknight meal (although a little dark). Lots of happy people out there - and finding Ommegang Rare Vos on the beer list is always a value add to the night.
