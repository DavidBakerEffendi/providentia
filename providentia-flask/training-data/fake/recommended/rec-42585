I've ordered Chinese food from several local businesses and this one is terrible. The worst Chinese food I have ever had in all of my travels. Both locally and beyond. First, I told the person on the phone which bell to ring as there are two other bells and I hate when my neighbors are disturbed at dinner hour. Lo and behold they never in formed the delivery person and guess what?? He rang both the other bells and never mine. How did I know he did this? The neighbors both have dogs. Five between them .What a treat. About the person on the phone.....he hardly understood what I was saying. And I him. Interesting that an another reviewer thinks they are patient when the caller (customer) isn't understood by the person taking their order. I ordered egg drop soup, wonton egg drop soup, fried dumplings, vegetable lo mein and chicken in black bean sauce. Both egg drop soups were watery. The wontons were just okay bordering on bland. Fried dumplings were dry. The vegetable lo mein was also bland. And finally, the entree, the chicken in brown sauce had a very, very unpleasant after taste, I will never order from this establisjment again. And if you're reading this review you are FOREWARNED!
