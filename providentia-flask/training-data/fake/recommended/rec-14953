After much convincing (read: nagging) from my fiancee I finally gave in and decided to try Shake Shack last weekend. From the beginning let me be honest with you all, I LOVE burgers, and even the word "love" might be an understatement, so keep that in mind while reading this review. With that being said, I found the burger at Shake Shack (ShackBurger) to be small for the price, a bit under seasoned, and having a bit too many vegetables compared to the meat. While it was very tasty, it was hardly anything to write home about, and it's definitely not worth a 90 minute line (as can happen during the lunch hour), or the price. I've seen a lot of people on Yelp hating on the fries, and while they are undoubtedly of the frozen bag variety, they are still good (with the cheese sauce they are delicious). Surprisingly the favorite part of my meal was the hot dog (don't judge my gluttony), which was cooked to perfection on the griddle. Split down the middle, cooked to the point where it wasn't too crisp nor too soft, and placed in a delicious soft bun, it truly is the best "dog" I've ever had in Philadelphia. My dining partner got two dogs with peppers and onions and despite being full actually ordered another one for the walk to the bar (please don't judge him either). Long story short, you have to try this place at least once. While it may not be like the Shack in Manhattan it is still pretty good (albeit pricey), and if they continue to improve I'm sure they'll become a fixture of the Philadelphia food scene.
