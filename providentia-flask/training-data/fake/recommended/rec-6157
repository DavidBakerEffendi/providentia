Cha-an is good, but overall, it is overrated. The desserts here are standard, good Japanese desserts. I ordered the matcha latte which was very good. However, I was disappointed to learn that it was made from powder. If you are charging over $5 for a latte, it should not be made just out of powder! I tried the black sesame creme brulee. The taste was subtly sweet, and really interesting. I would highly recommend that if you do drop by. The decor is not particularly impressive. I know some people might think this place has really nice decor, but I just saw some Asian looking screens here and there. This place takes only cash, which is annoying.
