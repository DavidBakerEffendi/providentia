I passed by Pommes Frites so many times and there is always a long line. Couple of weeks ago I had some extra time before work and decided to stop by. Since Pommes Frites only sells fries, I expected more. I like my fries a little bit thinner and crispier. They come in 3 different sizes, I got the regular one for $4.50 and it was enough. They have a lot of different sauces and they charge extra for them, except for the regular ones ( ketchup, mayo) which are free. Waiting time : 15 minutes Service: Good Fries: Average They have very limited seating and the whole place is really cramped. Will I come back? It depends. When I pass by, if there is no long line and I'm in a mood Â for fries.
