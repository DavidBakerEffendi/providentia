Sure, the drinks were good. sure the music was fun. BUT..... Food poisoning is no freaking joke.   cleanliness and fresh food should be number one...no??? My friend and I had 1-2 drinks each at Fat Buddah, along with a few dishes. I didn't ingest anything much after eating dinner there We were both fine the night of, however I almost couldn't make it to work the next day because I was feeling so nauseous and kept throwing up. My friend was also experiencing painful stomach symptoms the next day.  I've been in NYC for 5 years and I've never encountered any food poisoning situations with local restaurants. this was my first trip to Fat Buddah,  can safely say it will be my last.
