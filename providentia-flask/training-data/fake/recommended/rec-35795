Easily the best meal I've had from George Sabatino yet! Definitely on the modern side of the fence, which don't usually impress me much, but the flavors were so direct and uncomplicated that it ate like soulful comfort food. Just really good creative food. I can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to go back again!
