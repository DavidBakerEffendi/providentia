I'm sorry, Nevada, but this has to happen. *takes star* I was in here again the weekend before last with a friend and received the worst service from the most mumble-mouthed, lazy, zombie-like character poorly portraying a waiter. we initially had a jittery wide-eyed girl come over who admitted to being a bit scatter-brained and may have had too many red bulls or coffee that night, and i didn't mind that at all. i welcome a little nutty enthusiasm. but for some unknown reason there was a switch and this slacker-of-the-decade was put on our table. to everyone in the world: if you hate your job, don't punish your customers for it, especially if it's a job where you depend on tips. get a different job, or i think we all know what has to happen here... this dude barely lifted his feet when he walked, barely opened his eyes or mouth when he talked, never made eye contact, and would somehow be already walking away from the table before setting things down. and then just disappeared. it was really annoying. the only thing that saved him was 1. i wasn't paying and 2. the meatball parm i had was pretty good...though it was a panini, which i didn't ask for. i was kinda starting to rely on Nevada bc it's open 24hrs and close, but i'll gladly drive farther for better.
