I love this place and so did my kids and girlfriends. I ordered a flatbread pizza from the Skinny Menu and it was delicious. My son had a macaroni and cheese burger that he really liked. My daughter tried the mac and cheese and liked it. When I visited with friends all six of us were very pleased with our meals and the service. And yes the cheesecake is very good. Share it with one or two friends it is huge and rich. The only problem is that it gets so busy you might wait an hour. Go for lunch, right when they open and you'll get right in.
