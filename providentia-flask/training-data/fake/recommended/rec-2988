Great noodles, big bowls, cheap meal! I had hand-drawn seafood noodle soup.  The seafood wasn't impressive, but I feel like I shouldn't have expected much for 7.50.  It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order it again.  My companion got the hand-drawn vegetable noodle soup, which was excellent.  That's what I'd get in the future.  5.50.  Can't beat that. One bowl of hand drawn noodle soup is more than enough for a full meal.
