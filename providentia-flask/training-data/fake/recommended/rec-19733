Great late night drunk food. I love thick cut fries and they have a massive selection of sauces. I highly recommend the roasted eggplant mayo and the pomegranate teriyaki mayo. I was trying to remember what kind of sauce I got a previous time, and they let me sample a few to figure out which one it was. Downsides are what everyone else has already listed: there's always a line (which is never enjoyable when you're drunk and you just want your greasy food) and there's limited seating (also difficult for drunkenness).
