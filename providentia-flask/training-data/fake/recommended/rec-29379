I just moved to Philly from Cali - and was delighted to find this place in Northern Liberties.  I came in with 3 friends for a business lunch, and we all loved the atmosphere and feel of the place, it was a warm atmosphere, well decorated and had a latin inspired personality as it should.  The food was delicious, the 'burritos' are actually large soft tacos, but they were good and more akin to what I found in Napa Valley than a neighborhood in Philly.  good job Catina Dos Segundos, you earned a fan.
