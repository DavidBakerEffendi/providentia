Really cute place with good food, reasonable prices, and super friendly owners/staff. We came here at around 6pm on a Friday night and it was still quite easy to get a table. We each ordered a buckwheat crepe and a pot of french press to share. Coffee is from the area's Oslo store and was really great! The crepes were very tasty too, but my husband's had so much goat cheese that it was hard to appreciate the rest of the flavors. We will definitely be back here, and cannot wait to try out the sweet crepes for breakfast. Overall, a great restaurant in Williamsburg at reasonable prices (cash only).
