I have been going to Divina pretty much routinely for the past eight years. Every single dish Mario puts on the table is fresh, delicious, and overall incredible. The service is always outstanding..and being seated in waiter Mario's section is always a treat. The saut√©ed shrimp appetizer is the absolute best I've ever had, as well as my off-the-menu special he always prepares. My ultimate date-night favorite, I am constantly recommending Divina to everyone in the area!
