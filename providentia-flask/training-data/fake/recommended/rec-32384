If you like ultra thin crust pizza then look no further. My wife and I love pizza, especially thin crust pizza. If you are like us, you must stop in and try it. You can choose from a variety of types of pizza. Varieties include Traditional Cheese, Margherita, Pesto, BBQ Chicken, Eggplant Parm, Veggie, Chicken Parm and more. We mostly get the Traditional Cheese but all are excellent! If you don't feel like pizza, they have a full menu with a wide variety of salads, appetizers, pasta's, meats and seafood. You can either side in the dining room or at the bar. When you walk in, you will be greated by a friendly hostess waiting to seat you. All the bar tenders are and waiters are friendly as well. This kid friendly restaurant is family owned by Ryan and Aran McDermott of Montville. Visit their website at thecolumbiainn.com.
