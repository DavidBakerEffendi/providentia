The line outside Tartine excited my stomach lining, as did the fact that it was acceptable for me to roll in two bottles of vino strong. I love French food and consider myself somewhat in tune with fine French cuisine.  Tartine was a bit of a disappointment. All I can remember is getting something covered in peppercorns, so much so that's all I could detect - pepper. The starters were better, we tried three different salads/appetizers that were all much more palatable than my meal. I finished drinking my dinner disappointed and tipsy.  Needless to say, I stopped for one of NY's famous gyro carts near the Waldorf before I fell deep into a blissfully intoxicated sleep. I love visiting NY and know there is so much better food out there so I probably won't go back for more pepper. The BYOB thing was a huge selling point though . . .
