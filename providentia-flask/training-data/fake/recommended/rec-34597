Here for restaurant week $25 lunch..amazing start to finish. Starting with free valet parking in the building, seat by the window.. Starter: House cured Arctic Char was at par with fine sashimi..this alone would cost you $20 at a fine sushi restaurant. Entree: Merluza - beautiful, buttery cod like fish Desert - Meyer Lemon tart w/earl grey ice cream was spectacular. + Capuccino using La Columbe beans. Wine: Had a Chilean cabernet..very good. Watch out for the pricing on the wine..there is a half glass and full glass price. Easy to be confused. Service was impeccable. We will be back in the summer when the farm is open for sure. I can only imagine how they would incorporate produce grown right on their terrace into their summer menu.
