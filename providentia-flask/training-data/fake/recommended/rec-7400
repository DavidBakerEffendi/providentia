This place is getting 3 stars only because the food is good. For a self service place, it is extremely slow just to get your food.  On a Sunday we waited about 40 mins just to get to the front of the line to order the food when the line was not that bad.  Chipotle can handle the same line in under 10 mins They should observe the efficiency of Hill Country in the city.  Same type of cuisine and much more pleasant dining experience and customer service. This place really needs to relook at their efficiencies. Everything is self service. U pick up your food, utensils, and drinks and hope to find a seat for you and your friends after waiting on that long line.  On the upside the slow service allows people time to finish eating so u can have a seat. They had the audacity to point out no tip when my friend signed her credit card receipt. We had the brisket, pork belly collard greens and mac n cheese and chocolate pudding pie Everything was delicious
