i wanted to take my parents to an authentic itallian restaraunt that wasn't 30 dollars a plate and decided from reviews that le vitru was my best bet. it was! the food is divine and very authentic and the space is so comforting and rustic. Â my mom and i got the handkerchief pasta with duck and beef ragu and while it didn't seem like it had beef to me, i can't even complain because it was just so delicious. would be a perfect place for a date.
