The food was excellent! We had dinner here a week ago (had been here for brunch previously) and enjoyed all the dishes. I especially liked the rosemary mashed sweet potatoes. The cocktails were good as well. My only gripe is that the server wandered off at times so we waited a bit for our check which is annoying. The folks at the host stand/coat check were incredibly nice and accommodating. We look forward to going back.
