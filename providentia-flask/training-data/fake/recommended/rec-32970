Food was soo good. I had blackened catfish with mashed sweet potatoes and collard greens. The sauce with the fish was amazing. The collard greens with onions and tomatoes very well cooked and delicious. My only complaint is why add flour to cornbread so celiacs like me can't eat it. The service was also excellent. They also have live music after 8pm.
