Just got home.  Went with the kids, because we wanted to check it out, and didn't want to pay a babysitter on a Sunday night.  So we decided to make it an all pizza night.  We got four pizzas total.  I'll go from the worst to the best. 4.  Margarita -  your typical pie, it was ok 3.  it had red pepper flakes, and octopus, it was also ok 2.  This one had squash, raisins, and pine nuts I think.  It was tremendous.  One bite into this, and I was saying "This lives up to the hype."  I think it's on their website where they have a review that says "The world needs more pizza like this."  After the first two, I was thinking, "The world has plenty of pizza like this." 1.  Finally, probably the best pizza I ever had.  All I know, is that it had pig's head on it.  The flavor was so unbelievable.  I had about 5 slices of this. I see a lot of people complaining about the price, and it's a little high, but you're not at Maple Glen Pizza, you're at a Mark Vetri restaurant.  And to tell you the truth, if the parents hadn't had a couple drinks each, I wouldn't have looked twice at the bill.  You're in the city.  Drinks are expensive.  All in all, great spot.  Oh, and Carrie couldn't stop talking about how nice the decor was.  "Yeah, it looks like our house" was my response.  Really, if we were rich and Carrie could decorate however she wanted, it would look like the inside of Osteria.
