A trip to NYC isn't complete without a trip here. Especially if you have just imbibed a few or a lot of alcoholic beverages. Always a line at this time of night. Probably the best $6 you'll spend for food at this time. I usually get the chicken and lamb combo. Unless you either have a death wish or you have a high tolerance for spicy foods, avoid the hot sauce or you'll pay for it. If not at the time, definitely later. Some white sauce and some BBQ sauce, you're plate is complete and ready to eat. I think the key part of it all is the pita bread. I always got to make sure to protect them from nearby poaching friends who have finished theirs. If the line is long at this one, go to the one across the street. I swear to you, they are the same cart.
