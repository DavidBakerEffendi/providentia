Clinton Street Baking Company is one of those places that just let's their food do the talking. When we got there at 10am on a Wednesday we we're told it would be a 30-45 min wait. When we returned 30 minutes later the host told there were still four tables ahead of us and that we needed to wait outside (mind you it was 20 degrees and snowing). Pissed off we decided to head to the next spot. While we were walking to bobwhite counter we got a text saying our table was ready. Begrudgingly we returned. I ordered the Chocolate Chunk Pancakes. They were good as advertised. I'm giving this place three stars for making me wait out in the cold but as far as food goes this place is as good as it gets.
