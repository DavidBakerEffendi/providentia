There are unexpected moments in life when a sweet little gem like Petite Crevette are everything you hoped for and more! That's exactly what we experienced on Tuesday, February 11th to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. From the moment we walked thru the door and were greeted so pleasantly by our lovely Austrian Host & Server, "I've been expecting you!" she proclaimed, we knew we had decided on the right place to celebrate. She immediately took the bottle of champagne we had brought to be chilled (byob a huge perk!) and seated us at a precious intimate table in the charming dining room. We shared that it was our anniversary and she shared she had just been married last week! Personable service without taking it too far, extremely knowledgable of the menu, helpful, attentive... and  just the right amount. I started our meal with the fried oysters and my husband the seafood chowder. Both were delicious! Generous portions with great flavor and complexity without too much of anything.  For my entree, I ordered the Shrimp Provençal and my husband the Mustard Crusted Salmon. Again, simply scrumptious! The portions were plentiful but not overwhelming. Both entrees were the perfect tenderness for seafood. Incredible flavor complemented well by the simple mashed potatoes and sautéed vegetables. To top off the night, our server brought over, compliments of the house... A small slice of their chocolate flour-less cake and mixed berry tart. YUM! Again... Delicious and such a lovely gesture. If you haven't already figured out how I feel about this little gem... Let me finish by saying... We will definitely be going back very soon! Enjoy!
