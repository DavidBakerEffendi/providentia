Came here with my boyfriend's family (who are French might I add) and some friends. The food was delicious and even impressed the French natives ; ) I had the French onion soon which was exceptional, the branzino special was excellent, and the desserts didn't disappoint either. I loved the interior and atmosphere: warm lighting, mirrors, and friendly staff. Even though I am from Manhattan, I will def. be heading back to sample the rest of the dishes on the menu. Highly recommend.
