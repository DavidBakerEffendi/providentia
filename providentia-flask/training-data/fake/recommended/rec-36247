Went there the Saturday of Labor Day weekend at the urging of my friend for brunch. Having seen their menu (and prices), I was skeptical. We are frequent diners at the Mon Ami Gabi chain in our area, which has similar ambiance and food, at a much more affordable price. We opted for brunch items since it was our 1st meal of the day, but I also ordered the French onion soup ($13) to gauge the place. My friend ordered the eggs benedict ($23), her friend a bowl of fruit ($13), and I got the brioche french toast w/bacon ($19). The soup came out in the standard french onion crock bowl, and I'll give them props for the cheese staying gooey til the very end, but to be honest, I prefer the soup at Mon Ami (which is also bigger, a tastier broth & only $7/8). As for our brunch items, how memorable can a bowl of fruit or eggs benny be? I thought the ham they used for the benny was so thin you could barely taste it. The waitress recommended the french toast to me, and claimed how much she loved the bacon. It came without syrup so I had to ask Â for some, and I did enjoy the consistency of the toast, but that bacon..... THE WORST. It had NO flavor AT ALL. What was the waitress talking about?? I didn't even know there could be a flavorless bacon. With the exception of the burnt bits of the bacon, which tasted just like burnt flavorless grease, there was no taste to it. I even had my friend try it, and she was equally confused. Throw in a couple iced mochas & a coffee and our bill was ~$90 (pre-tip), and compared to all the other places we ate that weekend, it was the worst meal of the weekend.
