Came here for brunch since we missed New Year's Day brunch due to a long long New Year's Eve but made it in this afternoon.  Old pictures hanging on the walls with a projector playing a warm fire made the place very cozy. The Down by Law Benedict was absolutely amazing. Perfectly sweet, savory, and a hint of spice . This was the best Benedict I have ever had in my life. Friend who was with me said the same thing so it s gotta be true right ? :-P  Chicken and waffles were also great! Wasn't what we expected but perfect crunchy and the Tabasco glaze gave the dish a perfect kick. Also, this is the first BYOB restaurant in New York I have ever been to and we loved it. We got a $15 bottle of champagne at the liquor store a 2 minute walk away and ordered a $12 carafe of orange juice and both of us had plenty of mimosas before we headed out the door. We also ordered the pork tots and the atomic Mac and cheese fire balls and loved the pork tots. If you're not a pork fan, just get the disco tots. Atomic fire balls were a little too sriachy ( if there is a such a thing) for us but still good. I felt like I was having a heart burn attack as soon as I swallowed. Service was amazing by all. Host and both servers.  This place is a must for brunch.
