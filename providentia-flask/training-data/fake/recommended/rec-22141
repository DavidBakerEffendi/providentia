I love this restaurant. The front is casual bar +food, and the back is a surprisingly light and airy restaurant. Totally feels like the South, or as close as you can get in Brooklyn. I had a sweet tea sour which was very sweet, but all the drinks and beer looked good. We shared a salad and jalapeno cornbread to start, both which were basic but delicious. I had the meatloaf sandwich which was AMAZING - thick pullman bread, perfectly cooked and seasoned meatloaf, tangy slaw, and homemade potato chips. mmmm so good, can't wait to go back! My date had the trout which he liked, but was overshadowed by the smoky crispy onion rings on the side. I wanted to try the bread pudding but was too full... Great vibe, great food, and get the meatloaf sandwich!
