Wow I just ordered the B.I.G. Burrito. Literally the worst burrito I have ever had. Who makes a greasy burrito? The Queso Fresco is melted cheddar on top of the burrito. I ended up just peeling that right off. And the actual burrito is bland. It makes Chipotle burritos seems authentic. I threw it ALL away.
