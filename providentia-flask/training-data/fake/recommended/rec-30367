I can't remember exactly what we ordered, but I do know a few things; the food was delicious, around 8pm we were seated immediately at the very comfy bar, and the Restaurant Week deal was a real steal for the quantity and quality of food we got. If you're really curious about what the dishes were I'd check previous RW reviews, but rest assured you will get an excellent meal in a hip, not overly annoying hipster spot.
