Very cute little place! Great atmosphere and service. One thing we loved: their Toma Della Rocca cheese. Loved it so I had to mention it! Do try. It reminded me of soft goat cheese, but not as tangy... more mild. Really enjoyed it. Otherwise, we snacked on the melon app, the fried cauliflower, salads, and drinks. All was great!
