What can i say? This place is one of the best places in bay ridge hands down and I have lived here all my life. The beer selection is amazing, the food is great. My personal favorite is the Johnny Cash hotdog. In the winter and summer this place is packed on the weekends and it should be. I live around the corner from Lockyard and I am a frequent patron. I hope this stays around for a LONG time!
