I've lived in New York for a while now. The Pines was, to date, the worst place I've eaten so far in the City (specifically Brooklyn). Waitress was pushy, annoying, and arrogant. Portions were ridiculously small. Presentation was comical it was so bad. Food was average at best, and overpriced. It's astounding to me that this place is still in business actually.
