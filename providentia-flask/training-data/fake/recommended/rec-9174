a while back, i gave this place 4 stars, withholding that last one due to price. but the more i go back, the more i love it. the flavors and ingredients are solid, and i recently tried their prix fixe lunch, which is a 3-course $25 meal that's extremely satisfying and well-priced... and served until 3:30pm. so even though i wouldn't ordinarily spend 25 bucks on lunch (which really ends up 30 all in), i can enjoy a long, late lunch and then have a light dinner. oh, and there's never a crowd mid-day! so i have to upgrade MFSB to 5-stars. the prices, after all, may be pricier than a local dive, but this place isn't divey nor are the prices outrageous. plus, i'mt rying to get away from the "all you can shovel in your piehole" mentality and learn to savor rather than stuff.
