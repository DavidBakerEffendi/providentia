Definitely nothing short of amazing for this Long Island City resto.  To start off our server Alexis was very friendly and hilarious.   Their happy hour specials cant be beat.  $5 Caiparinhas and that particular night was $15 sangria pitchers! Although we couldn't make it through our appetizers Im eager to come back and try some of the main dishes.   The lobster flatbread had me reeling for another order. THe manager was nice enough to check on us several times personally, and our chef Mr Nelson Cienfuegos came out to see how everything tasted. Cant wait to try the Churrasco and Paella. The location is also right along the water so the ambience of the whole establishment is a plus. Job Well Done.
