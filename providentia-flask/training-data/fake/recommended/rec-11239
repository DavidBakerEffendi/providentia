While I don't enjoy BYO brunch spots as much as I do a full service bar/restaurant ill take my money to Sabrina's from now on which is a stone throw away. Maybe if I took up the $25 special of bottomless mimosas w/brunch I would have been loaded enough to ignore the problems. I will just say off the bat that the bartender seemed to have his hands tied in making the service aspect of things more enjoyable since I've been in that situation before. I actually felt some sort of pity towards him. However the slobfest of a manager walking around in a wrinkled shirt and shorts was not helping at all. Note to manager: don't look like you just walked in from binger down at AC during some of your busiest hours...and your negative/pompous attitude was pretty apparent(hipster much?). Food was lukewarm after an hour wait and the beer was almost room temperature(was not on a beer engine). Too be honest I wouldn't have eaten here in the first place if I read the yelp review of a piece of a Brillo pad being in someone's calamari. The only way I stumble back into this place if I've had one too many. Lastly I recommend bringing your own solo cup to drink out of. If you don't take my word for it look for yourself where the glasses are kept that you put your mouth on. Cheers
