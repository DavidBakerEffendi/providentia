HANDS DOWN THE BEST RAMEN AND PORK BUNS I HAVE EVER HAD. And I have had a lotttt of ramen and pork buns... Went at like 11 p.m. when it was raining/snowing so there was no wait, thank goodness. Although I don't think I would mind waiting because it was amazing. Got 2 different ramens but I forgot which ones. I'm sure they are all fantastic, no need to add anything to them because the flavor is already terrific. The pork buns were perfect. Literally perfect. This food is what dreams are made of and I am drooling typing up this review now. Not really but yeah. The only con is that it is $$$$, but you get what you pay for I suppose!
