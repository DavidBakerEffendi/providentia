5 star review simply because the meat itself was so tender and a cut above the rest of the other places (jims, pats, etc...) But I have been eatting from here for the past 12 years or so now, and notonce have I gotten SICK, I did have Pat's once and I was sick for a few days later... Butquite frannkly I just simply love the atmosphere, even if some of the workers look pissed off. As for the signs, BIG deal! I meansure everyone has an opinion, but obviously Joey Vento's opinion includes a "Speak English while ordering" or even calling french fries "freedom" fries. Which, by the way I'll be willing to bet nobodyknows the reason behind it. Anyway, GENO'S STEAKS will always be #1 not only in the city, but also wit me.
