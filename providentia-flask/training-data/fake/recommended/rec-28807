Decided to travel from Lawrenceville, NJ to Newark to see what the rave was about. The food was outstanding and the waitress was awesome!! The food was season to perfection!! You receive good portion sizes as well. The neighborhood isn't in a bad and the restaurant was clean. I definitely can't wait to check out their breakfast items.
