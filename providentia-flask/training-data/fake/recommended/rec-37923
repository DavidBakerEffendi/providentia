I went to Village Whiskey due to a gift card I received for writing about the iPad application from Zavino. VIllage Whiskey was the second restaurant in Philadelphia to implement this technology. My boyfriend and I went to Village Whiskey on a Tuesday night, and there was a 45 minutes wait. Since they text you when your table is ready, we walked around and got a drink at Rum Bar. Not even thirty minutes later, I recieved a text that our table was ready and we had 15 minutes to get back, awesome! So we arrive at the restaurant and are seated. There are only 7 tables there, and you definitely cannot go with more than one or two others, which explains why the wait is sometimes long, although food is brought out very quickly. Everything on the menu sounded awesome, and it was really hard for me to decide on what I wanted. I ended up getting the cheese puffs (gruyere cheese? how can I say no!) along with the Village Burger with....a fried egg on top. That was a first. We also split the duck fat fries. I was terrified to try something cooked in duck fat, but they were delicious fries. Needless to say, I loved every bite. I hear things about "best burgers in Philly" and I am not so sure about that, but these burgers were pretty great. I'd love to go back to try some deviled eggs and tater tots!
