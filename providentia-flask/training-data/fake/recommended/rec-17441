This byob restaurant had excellent service and enjoyable outdoor seating.  The staff was knowledgeable about the different menu items.  I had the Crab & Guacamole Martini as my appetizer and it was excellent.  I'm a big fan of sweet and savory dishes, so for my main course I had the Hazelnut crusted & cherry tilapia with wild rice. The crust made the fish very dry and it had little flavor (as did the rice). They gave you a small cup of cherries that were whole and appeared to be soaking in something that I couldn't tell what it was.  If the cherries were used in a cherry sauce then it could have made the dish less dry and more flavorful.   On a good note, my mother had the the barramundi.  The fish was cooked perfectly in a lemon butter sauce with capers and the garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned and creamy.  My only call out here is that no where on the menu that explain in what manner some of these fish dishes are cooked.  We had to ask if the fish was cooked in a sauce. Although I was not satisfied with my main course, I would definitely give it another try based on the Barramundi and the crab appetizer.
