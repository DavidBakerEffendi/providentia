joe's "soup dumplings" are awesome.  nothing else on the menu is exciting but their xiao long bao is so good that they still deserve 5 stars. joe's is an experience.  first of all, when you show up after your inevitable wait if it's a weekend, you'll be sat at a large round table with strangers (unless you brought your own 9 friends).  there will be a lazy susan in the middle, but it will not really be used much b/c you will only be sharing your food with the people you came with that are sitting right next to you. secondly, you'll realize that everyone has big steamers in front of them.  that's what the XLB aka soup dumplings are served in.  you can order the pork soup dumplings or pork and crab.  i suggest the pork and crab b/c they are not easy to come by.  watch your neighbors closely b/c there is a technique to eating these babies.  order lots of soup dumplings as a meal or just a few orders and go somewhere else in chinatown to finish off your meal.  none of the other food here is that great. lastly, savor the flavor of those dumplings.  gina c. is right when she said you'll wake up the next morning thinking about them.  no XLB that tasty can be found in houston or LA.  i know b/c i've been looking...
