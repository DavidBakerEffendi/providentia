My husband & I visited Piccolo Angelos while in NYC on our honeymoon. We were treated like royalty! A gentleman we assumed was the owner seated us, and in his thick Italian accent, proceeded to tell us three specials. I initially asked for the pumpkin ravioli, but the gentleman insisted I try the flounder, and told the waiter to bring me the ravioli on the side. I'm glad he insisted- both were amazing. The hubby ordered lobster cannelloni, also phenomenal. We also got an appetizer, again on suggestion (calamari diavalo), which was to-die-for. Then, the female manager? Owners daughter? Overheard that it was our honeymoon and brought us a delicious wine and toasted our new marriage. It was a perfect evening! We had a lovely time. I would recommend letting yourself get bossed into being adventurous-totally worth it!!!
