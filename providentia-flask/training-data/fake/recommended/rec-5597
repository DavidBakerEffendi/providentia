A little bit ago, my boss and I took a client here for dinner and man it was the best meal I ever had in the city. I had the patte ravioli and the pizza as an appetizer and it was incredible. The service was amazing even when my boss and our client got a little drunk and started making a scene. They had a guy lubricating the inside of the wine glasses so that the wine would turn better when poured. Now listen, I love Machismo burritos and a non-lubricated fountain drink but every now and again it's nice to go somewhere and share some roast rabbit. I recommend this to anyone who wants to showcase the city to out of towners, and anyone who appreciates food and atmosphere.
