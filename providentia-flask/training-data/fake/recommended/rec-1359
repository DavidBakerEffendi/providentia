When visiting NYC and people recommend eating at a halal cart, you MUST got to Halal Guys, not the hundreds of other halal carts, even if it's right outside your hotel. I would give them 5-stars, but I'm not too sure how fresh all their food is, considering they have their salad pre-served on the plates and it's questionable how long they're sitting out for. BUT, if you're going to be eating at a cart on the side of the road for a tasty gyro or rice plate filled with mouthwatering white sauce for only $6, freshness goes out the window. Who cares? Their chicken over rice is by far the most delicious halal dish I've ever had. Just dump some white sauce on that baby, and you have the best dish in NYC for the best price. The gyros are pretty bomb, too. During the lunch hour and late at night there can be a whopping 10min wait, but it is totally worth it. Don't be fooled by other imitators who wear yellow shirts with a similar logo. I fell victim to this and was very disappointed. I even had a stomach ache. Make sure you're at 53rd & 6th! Also, unless you're a hardcore spicy food eater, their hot sauce is FIRE!! I barely touched the sauce with my fork and my mouth was burning. If you're like me and can barely eat Hot Cheetos, just stick with the white sauce!
