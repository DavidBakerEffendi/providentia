I've been meaning to try Walter Foods since it opened. Had a great spontaneous night here last weekend with one of my favorite people -- everything was just right. Walked in around 8PM on a Thursday; the space was lively but not uncomfortably packed. My friend and I had planned to just grab a drink, so we sat at the bar. Our bartender was pleasant and attentive. My friend ordered a glass of champagne, and I had a martini. I hadn't had dinner, so we ordered an assortment of oysters, which were excellent. She was hungry too, and in the end we had another round of drinks plus some lobster bisque, a crabcake and cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Everything was delicious, and given the pleasant, unobtrusive surroundings, I'm already soliciting friends to see who wants to go back for a proper meal.
