This place is the real deal.  If you're looking for high-quality food, friendly, knowledgable waitstaff, a great wine list, and a great atmosphere, this is the place.  It deserves to be popular but it makes me sad because you really have to either make a reservation or arrive at the start of the lunch or dinner hour to get a table.
