Armed with a massive hangover I hopped the train for banh mi. This was literally the same day as their grand opening a in the new location. I did what I always do on that block--fruit and veggies at the produce store across the street, baked goods at the market, and then Banh Mi...wait no, where is my Banh Mi!! After a little panic, and several I know where the store is, this is ridiculous. I finally see a sign that says they moved around the corner (it was the size of a post it note and I had a hangover). Anyway, 5 minutes later, I was holding my cure-- #2 spicy, light on the mayo (spicy chicken). The new location is great too, more space and open.
