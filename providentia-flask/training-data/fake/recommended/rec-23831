Came here for some dinner with a few people. It was really loud inside... Too loud to carry a good conversation, but the food was fairly good. I ordered the vegan chicken tacos, and the portion was huge! Could only finish 2 of them before the seitan started to taste funny (because I was full, it was pretty good otherwise). I might return but would order something else.
