I am from Chicago, so prefer my hometown deep dish above all. However, if I can't have that, give me Lombardi's any time. It happens to be my neighborhood pizza joint (that and the Ray's on Prince), and man is it tasty! Every time is like the first time: simple, delicious, fresh ingredients and toppings, ultrathin crust charred "just so" and a great house salad to start things out right. Yes, it's swamped at all times. But if you order to pick up, your pizza is ready in 10 minutes, flat. And with all the tourists there and the wonky service, eating at home is the best way to enjoy it.
