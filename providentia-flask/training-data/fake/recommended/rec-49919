This restaurant is easily one of my favorite places to eat in the entire city. For people out there that are worried about the level of spice - get this: I am definitely NOT a spicy-food enthusiast, and make no mistake, the food at Chili Szechuan is pretty much crazy spicy across the board. BUT. It is also so very, very delicious. And I find that, after eating really spicy food, I feel so good! This restaurant is making a spicy-food convert out of me. My favorites: dan dan noodles, Chinese cabbage with dry pepper and the "rural-style" lamb. Get at this, Philly. :)
