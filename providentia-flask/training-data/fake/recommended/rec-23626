Awesome Sunday brunch spot!  $25 for all-you-can-drink mimosas and/or bloody marys.  There is a make-it-yourself bloody mary bar for those who like to personalize their drinks.  Be sure to drink a lot though, so you don't pay too much attention to the food.  Okay, I'm not going to totally bash, them, I'd say it was a bit below average.  I had a breakfast burrito.  No major complaints, but it was just a typical egg in a wrap kind of a deal.  Not much flavor or pazazz to it, and there was more floury wrap than there was eggs.  The "potatoes" (i think they were potatoes) were tough to swallow.  And chew.  They were barely cooked and they had sort of a tangy or bitter taste to them.  I'm not sure what was going on there.  All in all, definitely a fun spot to go with a group of friends to start out a Sunday Funday.  Just avoid the potatoes!
