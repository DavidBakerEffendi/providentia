Honestly, this is probably the worst Fridays I've been to. The service here is terrible. We got seated and told a server would be right with us, and nobody ever came to help us. At one point we made eye contact with a waiter, who COMPLETELY ignored us and still didn't come over to ask if we wanted drinks! We were so upset that we got up and switched sections. After making the switch we had a "temporary" server who informed us our waitress was on break. she was nice enough but our food took FOREVER to come out, and on top of that it was cold by the time it reached us. IMO There are a TON of restaurants on RT 1, dump Fridays and go elsewhere, this place needs better management.
