I would give this place more than 5 stars if I could... We regularly visit NYC and normally try to catch a Broadway show when we are there.  It is great to be able to get a fantastic meal after a show (esp. when you are still on west coast time and you are starving).   We love strange foods, so naturally we ordered the bone marrow, foie gras, pigeon, and sweet breads.  Everything was amazing.   I can't believe this place doesn't have a Michelin star; I thought they were much better than Blue Hill (which we went the next night).. perhaps they did not submit themselves for review.  The atmosphere gave the impression that that owner wants the restaurant to be a hidden gem... the "Blue" Ribbon Brasserie is dressed in red and with not much of a sign there was no way we would have found it without looking at all the addresses.  It was amazing and surreal to step from a deserted snowy NYC street at midnight into a bustling cozy brasserie.  I can't wait to go back.
