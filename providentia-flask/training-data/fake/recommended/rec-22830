Two Thumbs Up! I went to this restaurant based on the reviews found on Yelp. I'm glad I did! The service was GREAT, fast, and extremely friendly. The food was outstanding and reasonably priced with what you get.(Think about 14 side dishes when you order BBQ) I definitely recommend this restaurant, especially if you are seeking a change from the standard steak, seafood, or BBQ restaurant. MUST TRY! Tip- pork kalbi was awesome! You should try!
