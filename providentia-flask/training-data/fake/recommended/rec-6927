Dined here for a Saturday night dinner. It was packed. Note to self and others: they do not take reservations and your group must be there to be seated. The food was amazing here. This place would have gotten a 5 if it was just based on food alone. I got the Hot chicken with a mac and cheese side. My boyfriend got a Boneless Beef short ribs with collard greens and cream grits. Let me tell you ...for the money, it's extremely worth it. The Beef short ribs melted like butter when you dug your fork in it. The Hot (Hot means Hot) Chicken was extremely moist and full of flavor. They give you three pieces and even the white meat was delicious. My boyfriend managed to finish it all for us both but just the entrees alone will be enough. We just wanted to try everything (esp with the price!). Also love the fact that I get my diet coke in a mason jar! Other specialty drinks are also served in mason jars. Didn't have a chance to try them but it seems like someone at every table ordered one of them. Service and organization was what disappointed me. The people were nice but it's hard to get their attention because they were always running around. It is a small restaurant and, when its cold outside, people who were waiting try to cram into the restaurant in the small aisle (sometimes invading diner's space).
