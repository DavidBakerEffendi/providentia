fried chicken - delicious and you can order by piece. hot was perfect. extra hot was insane. scrambles - decent flavor combos but overall, nothing that blew me away. we tried the turkey sausage, onion, and cheddar cheese. the other was carmelized onions, pulled pork, and scallions. pulled pork was the best ingredient out of all of these. grit - creamy and great texture. toast - unbuttered. general - great vibe and atmosphere but not worth the trek
