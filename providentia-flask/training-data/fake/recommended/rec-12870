Slightly better food than the normal tourist trap cuisine in this part of town. Nice decor, albeit very dimly lit. They have a very large chandelier in the middle of the restaurant, seemingly out of place yet also pleasant to look at. Food itself was nothing special, but also nothing to complain about. We had the Room Service Pad Thai which is served quite differently than other pad thais you have had in the past. Not bad. Room Service Pad Thai: Â "Found on the sidewalks near the ratchanatda temple. also added are fresh mangoes infused with signature pink coconut beet sauce. sauteed glass vermicelli with big shrimps, mixed seafood, brown tofu, bean sprouts, scallions, crushed peanuts, tamarind juice and wrapped in a egg white omelet" I would probably go back here if on this block and looking for a decent Thai place, but I probably wouldn't trek across town for it.
