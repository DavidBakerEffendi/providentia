Just had one of the best meals I've ever had at Mayfield's. Sampled my friends dish, which was the prawns, ham, on top of a fried green tomato special. Absolutely amazing. And only $13. I would have paid more!!! Also had the scallops, asparagus risotto, and rock shrimp. Delicious. The one thing was the waiter was a little bit too pushy in trying to get my friend to order a meal. Came back to the table 4 times with only two minute breaks in between each time pressing her to make a decision. There were a number of tables that were completely empty, so it is not as if there was a queue of people waiting to be seated. Â  He needs to calm down. But all in all a fantastic meal.
