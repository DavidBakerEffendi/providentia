Had 8pm reservations for four (adults). Waited 15 minutes. Got sat in the back next to two families with kids, one of which was playing a children's sing along video on a smartphone speaker. One side plate on our table was soiled and, naturally, replaced. Overheard from another neighboring table, "Just make sure you always have money for bail." Finally, the food arrived: filet mignon (medium) with sweet potato mash and a side of roasted brussel sprouts. The sprouts I expected to be salty, but to my dismay, the entire dish, steak and mash, was overly salted. The sprouts selected were on the larger side (and more bitter than small ones) but the texture was still fairly crispy. The steak was a decent standard steak, but, overly salted. When I heated the leftovers with an egg for breakfast the next morning and the saltiness seemed to fade some. I know I sound salty in general, but this is really what happened. Alternatively, can you blame me for being salty when my dish seemed brined in saline? All-in-all I'd guess the kitchen and floor were very busy that night, but it was a decent meal for $50: soup, salad, entree, side, drinks and eclectic company included.
