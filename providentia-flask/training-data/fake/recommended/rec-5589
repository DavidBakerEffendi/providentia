Visited 2 nights ago.  I like this place, but the only reason I was able to eat here is because I got a SS gift card!  Sorry Mr. Starr, but my pockets aren't this deep.  The entrees aren't terribly overpriced considering the quality and sustainability factors, but the drinks and side items are outrageous!  $8 for roasted butternut?  Please.  With that aside, my roasted chicken and crepes was wonderful, and AR liked the salmon.  Dessert was the star for me - fig pudding and GOAT CHEESE ice cream.  Awesome.
