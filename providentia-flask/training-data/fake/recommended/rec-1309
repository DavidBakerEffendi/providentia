Been watching B2 for a number of years and never went in until this past Saturday. Now, I am afraid, I have started a habit. A cute coffee/tea/bagel/pastry place with very little frills and a cool, calm atmosphere. If Brunch is not really your thing, and you are just looking for a quiet place to read your newspaper or facebook page while having a bagel, B2 is your place. They have a variety of breakfast sandwiches available on a bagel or baguette, fruit smoothies, coffees and teas. The crowd moves quick here, so you won't be waiting for an hour to eat. Dog Friendly!
