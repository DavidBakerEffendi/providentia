The food here is EXCELLENT. I loved it. So, why the 1 star review? The service is pretty much non-existent. The waiter talked on his cell phone the entire time and just ignored what was going on around him. I do not typically give out 1 star reviews based on service; but that is how bad the service is here. I'm just sick of so many NYC establishments hiring lazy hipster idiots who won't do their job. But I'll say it again: the food is awesome. There's pretty much no room to sit, so be sure to arrive early.
