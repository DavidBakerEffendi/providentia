This was my second time there. First was for Sunday brunch which was good. They were out of some menu items (even though they just opened) . Went again on a Sat night.  It was their one year anniversary.  I thought it was just me but just read the same comment from another reviewer...the hostess AND the waitress were very unfriendly and borderline rude!  Again out of a lot of food and specialty drinks. How are you out of drinks at a bar???  Next, my friends ordered a pizza and it was the most pathetic vegetable pizza I've ever seen. Barely sauce, barely veggies and no cheese, burned black. They did comp it after we complained and gave us a dessert. Would have sent it back but couldn't find nor did the waitress ever come back!  I hope they make it another year but it will be awhile before I try them again.
