It's really nice having a place with vegan options and alcohol in the neighborhood. I like the tacos, beans and rice, guacamole, and the chips. What I don't like is the extremely watered-down and fake-tasting margaritas. Also, the seating is super cramped which makes it awkward when you have to enter exit or go to the bathroom.
