I have to start by at least saying that I really do appreciate any establishment that's making a concerted effort to make organic and vegetarian food.  Unfortunately, beyond that, it was kind of disappointing.  First thing's not a huge deal, just a little weird: At the top of the menu (should've taken a picture of this) it says "Breakfast Menu: served all day." It then says halfway down "breakfast menu: served until noon" with the real breakfasty items, but the way it's laid out it's very easy to miss (all three of us there did, so you end up at the register changing your order). But secondly, it seemed a little strange that what they can do all day is huevos rancheros (i'll get to that in a sec), involving eggs and a bunch of other stuff, but just 2 scrambled eggs are just not possible past noon.....don't really get the logic.   So instead of getting the simple egg sandwich, I just went with the huevos.  Fine, no problem.  But then the huevos came, and I make no exaggeration when i say this, it was the worst version of that dish that I've ever had.  Really, I'm not being a food snob, these were just plain bad.   What came was a layer of tortilla chips (yes, chips).  On top of the chips was a whole lot of very runny salsa (of course making every chip super soggy in the salsa liquid). Some refried beans on the side (very grey and bland), 2 eggs with hard yolks, and some very not-melted cheese sprinkled on top.     Those are the facts. I didn't expect gourmet or anything, but what I had today should be embarrassing for the kitchen, so I write this partly to inform others of what they're getting, but also kind of hoping that word will get to the kitchen so they can get their shit together.  If the food was better, this place would be pretty cool, so I just hope they get there.
