I have been a fan of alyans since I was in high school in the late 80s. I'm sure I wore my favorite "punk" army trenchcoat there with my cvs crayon yellow dye job. Neither the food nor the decor have changed much in the intervening decades, which is Â good thing. Look for the oddly erotic painting of the woman cutting watermelons and try to sit in the houseplant laden back room downstairs. Everyone raves about their french fries so give em a try, though they were never my favorite. I go for the traditional hummus and felafel on a pita with a side of cucumber and yogurt salad. Maybe a mango juice if I'm feeling rich at the time. A great place to have lunch or a snack while you're people watching along south street.
