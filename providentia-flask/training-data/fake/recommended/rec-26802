I'm usually here for the burgers and one of the best ones is the Peter Luger burger. They also have pretty good shakes. Edit 8/4/2012: Came here in April and the menu changed. They don't have the Peter Luger burger anymore. It was pretty much the only thing that wowed me every time so it's hard to come back and be satisfied.
