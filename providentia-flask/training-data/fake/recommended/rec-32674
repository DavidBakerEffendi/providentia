A triumph of a pizza. What pizza should be. The definition of pizza pie. Perfection on a plate. My favorite from when I lived in NY. Having used the same recipe for pizza dough since the late 19th century (so says the history on their menu), Lombardi's truly does create a masterpiece of pizza proportions (that, consequently, helps to increase my proportions, but that's another story). The crust is perfectly crispy on the outside but fluffy and soft on the inside, and never burned. I usually go for the mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni - less is more with this pizza. The perfect sprinkles of basil are a great touch. (When I went last time, we got the sauteed garlic spinach in addition to the above ingredients, but as a I feared, it overwhelmed the simple, fresh flavors and I ended taking most of it off.) A must visit in NY! If only someone could develop transcontinental delivery...
