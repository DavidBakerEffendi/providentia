This dingy and narrow shack produces some great fries!  The storefront doesn't make it look particularly appealing, but the fries and the variety of sauces are fun and delicious.   They give a large funnels of fresh, hot fries and there are twentysomething dipping sauces you can choose from.  I haven't tried all of them, but I can highly recommend the Sweet Chili and the Mango Chutney.  Other sauces that I like are Rosemary Garlic Mayo and the Peanut Satay. It's great for late-night hunger and/or snack.
