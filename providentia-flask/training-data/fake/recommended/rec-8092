I was so excited to try this place on a cold Philly night, and I was NOT disappointed.  So far, I have tried the noodle soups with brisket and with meatball, and both were delicious.  As a carb person, the part I care about the most is the noodles, which are soft and tender with just the write amount of chewiness.  And you can watch them make it, which is always awesome to watch. It's not the cleanest and most romantic place in the world, but it's definitely not a dive hole-in-the-wall. Overall, fast, cheap, flavorful, delicious food that will more than satisfy you with a warm soup belly.  Highly recommend!
