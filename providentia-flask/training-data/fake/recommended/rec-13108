If you've got the time this is such a great experience. We showed up about 25 mins before opening on a Tuesday. Thanks to a cancelled flight we had the afternoon free, and this dovetailed perfectly into another visit to Totto Ramen. We were high on the list so we knew we'd have a spot once they opened. People that got there 10 mins or so after us were not so lucky as the sidewalk got PACKED! Part of what makes it so fun here is the anticipation and the whole system of waiting for your name to be called. As usual in NYC, great people watching. Anyway, the ramen lives up to the hype. I prefer the Spicy Ramen over the miso ramen. I would add an egg to whatever ramen you get. You will want to buy me expensive gifts or provide me sexual favors to thank me later. There's plenty of Char Siu pork in the normal serving I would say, but I've added extra and enjoyed it. Overall, delicious, even for chicken broth. Clean and tasty, and counter seating is a plus if you get the chance.
