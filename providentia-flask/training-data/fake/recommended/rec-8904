Even though the wait for 1 person was 1 hour...it was definitely worth it!  I had like 5 different friends tell me to check this place out for Ramen, and it did not disappoint.   Definitely get the AKAMARU Ramen and the PORK BUNS.  First i'll rave about the PORK BUNS, which, in my opinion, are some of the best I've ever had.  The pork tasted amazing and had a great crunch as well as a "melt in your mouth" quality.  They some mayo in it which adds to the richness, and it's definitely amazing.  The Buns come in a Chicken or Pork option, but even though I have yet to try chicken, I would definitely go for the traditional Pork. The Ramen....just wow.  The difference between a good and a GREAT ramen place is the broth, and this broth was simply the best i've had in America.  Also, I always complain about some ramen places that don't give you a good ratio of soup to noodle to pork, but I gotta say, this place does it RIGHT. Wait staff was amazing, and it's all COMMUNAL sitting.  I was able to meet a fellow Los Angelean who went to Berkeley as well!  Just shows how small the world is.
