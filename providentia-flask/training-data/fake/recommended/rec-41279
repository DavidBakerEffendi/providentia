I like it. Simple to order, friendly staff, open space, reasonable price and the most important the food is best of what Brooklyn has to offer. The food reminds me and comparable to Oklahoma Joe at K.C.  Best is I can have it all year round. I hope it don't get too popular , if it does the line would be out the door and around the block. I had baby back ribs ,sausage and the most delicious melts in your mouth briskets that I have ever tasted.  The hours are a little strange and I wish they would carry a larger IPA beer selection but it's about the food.
