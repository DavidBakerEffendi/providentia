I have never been a big fan of korean food (besides korean fried chicken), unfortunately my girlfriend LOVES this place. It is apparently considered "inexpensive and good". My opinion: The food is ok, the price is also ok, possibly cheap in midtown but not exactly very cheap. Though the food is claimed to be fresh, everything I tried seem to have been sitting on the shelf for over an hour. Perhaps I am bad at picking out food or I am just an unlucky guy. Again, similar to my korean joint review, Korean food requires an acquired taste and it has been a taste I never seem to have acquired. Since this is in Korean town, the place can easily fill up and be crowded, which may lead it to be difficult to navigate or find any seats to sit down.
