I have been to Nom Nom Ramen several times for both lunch and dinner. It is a great place to grab a quick, filling meal, and the broth is rich and addicting. I've tried the karai and the shio. The karai is nice if you like spicy, but the depth of flavor the shio provides is unparalleled. The pork belly is tender and delicious, further adding to this flavor profile. The final product is unbelievable! I always add an egg and bean sprouts. With that said, I couldn't allow my self to give Nom Nom five stars, simply because I think the prices are too high. If you are craving a nice, delicious bowl of soup, nom nom is the perfect place to go, but if you are looking for value, there are several alternatives for larger servings at a lower price.
