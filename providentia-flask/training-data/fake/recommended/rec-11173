Very fun place, came here on a Saturday night for dinner with friends.  We were seated quickly and began to pour over their massive list of beers.  There really is something for everyone. Had the reuben (delicious) and the mussels, which were also good.  The small size is more than enough for one person. My only complaint about this place is the fries!  Our fries were horribly over-cooked, and while the accompanying sauces were decent, where is the typical frite-sauce-mayo?  I've had belgian fries in belgium, and these sadly could not compare.  Which was truly disappointing, because I LOVE a good fry.
