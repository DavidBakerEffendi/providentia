Why do people love this place? Ikea furniture, pier 1 imports art on the wall and light brighter than Max Fish. Zero vibe staffed by people thinking they're working at a 3 star restaurant. The wait staff gives you a sales pitch instead of answering any menu questions and is spent the rest of the service impossible to flag down for a water refill, let alone drinks. They seemed more interested in turning over the table rather than serving the ones they had. Recommending 4-5 dishes per person (what!), then having them come out very randomly, including a gap of 30 minutes between some, didn't deliver a great experience. Plus, both times they forgot to bring out a dish and still tried to charge us for it. I'm assuming all of the 5 star reviews are from a bunch of woo girls and such who have never gone out to eat before.
