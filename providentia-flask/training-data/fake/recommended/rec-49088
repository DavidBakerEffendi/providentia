Forced trendiness indeed. Decor looks like a southern gas station crashed into Applebees. Came here for brunch and the crowd around me was a range of college kids and "bros" speaking very loudly of their sex life. A lot of "I was like, shut up and fuck me..." "dude, she's a 6 out of 10" Not exactly the experience I was going for when out with my husband for a relaxed brunch! The food was tasty, but for the price, I've had better. Le Grainne cafe is far superior.
