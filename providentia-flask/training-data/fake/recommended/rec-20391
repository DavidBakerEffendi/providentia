My sister lives in the neighborhood, and suggested we try this place out.  My vegetarian girlfriend was pleased to learn that they have a separate menu of all their veg items. Walking in, we found a warm, welcoming atmosphere and a friendly staff.  The wait wasn't too long (45 mins on a Saturday night at about 9) and the hostess took my cell # so she could give me a call when our table was almost ready.  What a great way to manage the wait list! I had the duck meatloaf -- delicious flavor with a lovely presentation.  My sister had their fried chicken and waffles and my girlfriend had a bean and fennel stew.  We all enjoyed our meals, and found the service to be friendly. The prices are a bit steep, but for your money, you get higher quality service and a more creative menu than at your typical neighborhood joint. Don't miss the house pickles, which make for a great starter.
