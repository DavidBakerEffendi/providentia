"The food is sexy hot! Pay in cash and get a 10% discount" Try to reserve a seat in advance, then u could sit on the first floor. The first floor's decoration and atmosphere is better than the basement seats. We four people ordered the following things. (1,3,4 are my recommendation) 1. Dan Dan Noodles- $7.95  Spicy: @@ People said it is a must- have. I think it is good but not to must- have level. Still could give it a try.  It is not the typical Dan Dan Noodles as Taiwan's. It's dry and with the sauce(taste like sesame/peanut sauce). A little bit like Taiwan's cold noodles. 2. Three Cup Chicken- $14.95 Spicy: not spicy A little bit sweet. I will give this dish a- ok. People can eat this dish with many rice. This is the only dish we ordered that is not spicy. 3. Chicken in Chili Oil $9.95 Spicy: @@@@ My favorite dishes. It is a cold appetizer. Chicken is tender soaked in chili oil. There are green onion slice and grounded Zanthoxylum( or so- called pepper of sichuan). It smells good and I felt my tongue numb when I put them in my mouth. My nose was running and I drunk tons of water. No matter what, I still love this dish so much.   4. Beef & Tripe in Chili Oil $9.95 Spicy:@@@@ Taste gooood. A common dish in sichuan style's restaurant. 5. Fried Taiwanese Sausage $7.95 Spicy: not spicy Normal Taiwanese Sausage, for homesick Taiwanese. Our way is to eat it with sliced garlic. When u pay, remember to ask the waiter whether there is discount if pay in cash! Normally they will provide 10% discount.
