Good atmosphere and very friendly staff. We were seated promptly and received our drinks promptly as well. Nice to see some real Italian orange and lemon pellegrinos. We ordered the rocket salad, which was delicious with pine nuts reggiano arugula and a nice vinagrette. I got the special, a pizza with sausage and mushrooms and my girlfriend had the prosciutto and arugula pizza. The sausage was delicious but not much of it was on the pizza, most of which could only be found in the very center and I found myself rearranging the toppings. The menu did not specify what kind of shrooms where on the pie and they looked like standard buttons, a nice local fungi would have been a fantastic addition. Unfortunately the sauce was lacking in both amount and flavor. I think they should work on a few different sauces and give the choice of sauce to the diner. The dough was puffy and delicious however mine was burned compared to my girlfriends prosciutto pie. I  tried hers and it was simple and delicious and cooked just right. Overall it was a good dining experience however I think they need to fix a few things, especially making well topped pizzas that are consistent and cooked just right. Price wise it would have been worth it if my pizza had a little more toppings and flavor.  I will return and hope my pie will be better this time!
