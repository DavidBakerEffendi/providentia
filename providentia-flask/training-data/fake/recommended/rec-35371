This is one of those moments when Yelp fails you, miserably. Blend food, this is the most Americanized thai food I've ever had. I should've known this is not the place to come for food when I first went in and saw a full room of white people. The second sign which points out that this place is only for white people is when they brought out a duck dish, with more fruits and veges than duck, and the duck was deboned. White people can't eat food with bones in it, too complicated for them. But any real foodie will know the meat around the bone are the most flavorful. I asked the waitress which curry is the most spicy, she said the red curry and thats what I ordered. It was SWEET. I shit you not. People, seriously, you are in a part of town full of thai food. Walk up 2 blocks for Pam's real Thai food, or 5 blocks down for Pure Thai, or Q2. Â They are much better and cheaper and this shit hole of food.
