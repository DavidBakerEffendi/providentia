I often bike the West Side Highway greenway path, and love to stop off here for coffee or a meal. Since it's off the road, it feels like a secret spot only the locals know of - sometimes their sign is hard to spot, you could ride right past it and not realize it's open to the public. The views are the best reason to stop. Grab a coffee and a fresh muffin (if you get there early enough!) and watch the people and boats go along the waterfront. I took my boyfriend here as well for a little birthday lunch - he got the salmon, I got a sandwich, both were good and fresh. The food here is so much better and healthier than the Boat Basin up the way, and unlike the Basin it's not so crowded - you can usually find a seat, and they still have beer and wine for your enjoyment. They are closed in the winter. Plenty of time for you to get your bike or walking or running shoes and practice the trek there. Just off the bike path. There's also a Bike and Roll on the other side of the path, if you want to make an afternoon of the river views.
