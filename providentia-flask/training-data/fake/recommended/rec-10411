Four stars for good ingredients in their half margherita/half prosciutto pie.  Subtract one for not enough of said ingredients haphazardly arranged...subtract another for charging $28 for said pie lacking said ingredients, and then charging another $9 for a plain ol' calzone filled only with ricotta cheese...are you kidding me?!  I can get a bigger, better calzone filled with gooey cheese and saucy buffalo chicken for $7 right across the street from my apartment! As if that wasn't enough to sour my experience, there's a plot twist too...We were hanging at a bar that has no kitchen, but they're happy to let you bring in some grub from elsewhere.  When asking for menus to peruse, the bartender and two patrons hastily recommended Table 87 and all but slammed just about anything eise I asked to look at.  Despite personally having favorable experiences elsewhere, we opted for Table 87, and after the pizza was delivered, the delivery person brought two extra slices for the bartender and revealed to our group that the owner was sitting just two seats over from us this whole time.  Maybe I'm being overly sensitive and it's just neighborhood small businesses being friendly with one-another, but I can't help but feel a bit slighted...whatever. After some intense games of 4v4 beach volleyball, just about anything would have satisfied our group.  To literally still be STARVING after devouring two slices of pizza, however, is an unprecedented memory in my nearly three decades of pizza consumption.  Unless they either (a) lower their prices, or (b) actually use an appropriate amount of toppings, I'll take my money elsewhere next time.
