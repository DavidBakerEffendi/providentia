Went on the spur of the moment with no reservation...got lucky and we were able to get a table....(sent the guy in with the pepsodent smile to work his magic)....it is a bit loud, but its also a see and be seen kind of place for Montclair regulars... should be fabulous whenthe warm weather finally arrives and the french doors are open.... food was good, can't really remeber what any of us had-although  the appetizers were a bit tastier than the main courses....we did have a mixed plate of  crostinis that were very good - and someone tried one of the pizzas... what we thought was sausage turned out to be mushrooms
