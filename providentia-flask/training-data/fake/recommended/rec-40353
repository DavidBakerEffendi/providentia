I always order the ceviche and they have two types the Ecuadorian style  and the Peruvian style.  The way I order is which the lemon and spicy so I believe it's Ecuadorian.  I order with tostones and it is the best ceviche I order point period I have ordered from el Cheverre and it does not compare and it's just real authentic food at Venus.  Also my grandmother has ordered a paella and you basically get a pot to your table which is enough for 3 -4 people .  Of course holiday s and weekends this place is packed but flavor is outstanding here.  I always order take out.  I'm happy all the time I go
