Don't bother going for dinner, as it's EXACTLY the same as lunch except more expensive. Fogo is pretty pricey overall but considering the quality of what you get it's probably a fair price. Unlimited salad, sides, and steak? Everything is fantastic quality and the service is great too. If you want a particular kind of steak just ask one of the servers and they'll send someone over as soon as possible. You don't need to dress up but the atmosphere seems to call for something other than a t-shirt and flip-flops (though you're still welcome to eat there if that's what you want to do). I've always had a positive experience at Fogo; definitely one of my top 5 favorite places to eat in all of Philadelphia.
