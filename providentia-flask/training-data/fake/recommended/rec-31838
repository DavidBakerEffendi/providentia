Great casual lunch spot.  We had a half dozen oysters, the tuna sandwich, and the Maryland crab cake dinner here.  Oysters were fantastic (and the gentleman behind the counter was kind enough to grab some mignonette from next door for me)-- briny, firm and fresh.  Tuna sandwich and crab cakes/fries/slaw were also good.  Portions were more than generous. A bit spendy for lunch (think Bay Area prices), but well worth it considering quality and proximity to the campus.
