I was skeptical of the decor from the outside... sure, it looked swanky, but would it be yummy? YES YES YES! The lobster mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had... such a simple idea, executed SO well. Also, the french onion soup dumplings were delicious and creative. I was overall very impressed with the creativity and quality of the menu.
