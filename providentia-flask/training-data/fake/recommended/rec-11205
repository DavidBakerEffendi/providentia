Just moved to the Northern Libs and starting to explore the local eats. First great dining experience was at North Third. The food was banging and consistent on my two consecutive nights. Highly recommend the Chicken, Shrimp dumplings, Pork tacos (special), hanger steak and the cauliflower flat bread. The hummus wasn't anything special but otherwise the menu is far above normal bar fare. Allagash White on draft to top it off. It's a bit pricey but worth it and they accept credit cards. Chill atmosphere, plenty of space with an area away from the bar. Healthy crowd but wasn't packed on Wed/Thurs evening. We were quickly seated and had great attentive service. Will definitely be returning.
