The food was very good but the service was not.  We were seated 10 minutes before anyone approached our table.  Our waiter, who looked resentful that he had to do his job, took our orders.  In addition to our food, we requested four wine glasses and four waters.  The waiter took our bottle of wine and didn't come back for another five minutes.  When he did, it was only with the opened wine and wine glasses, no water.  Our food came soon after but we never got our waters.  The food wasn't good enough to outweigh the poor service.  I'll be sticking to Viet Ai in Florham Park.  The food there is just as good and the service is quick and friendly.
