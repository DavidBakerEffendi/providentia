This place is very casual if you eat in. They do NOT have a liquor license which can be a drag. It's in an off the beaten track locale but it is home cooking, REAL Mexican and not the garbage gringo grub sold in many NYC venues. Luckily via Seamless, they have started to deliver food to the Upper East Side. The cheese enchiladas are so delicious and spicy I practically get high eating them.  The nachos are good -- not the usual glop you'll get elsewhere. The Chiles Relleno were OK but not as yummy as the enchiladas (too much watery sauce).  This is an excellent Mexican restaurant.  You would think East Harlem aka Spanish Harlem would have more fabulous Mexican restaurants but they DON'T. This is the place to go. Hasta la vista, baby!
