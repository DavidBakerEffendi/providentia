In Manhattan for one night and craved some NY style pizza.  Trust Yelp pointed me here.  Little hole in the wall with only four seats at a counter.  But friendly (for NYC) with an interesting set of slices to pick from.  I had a slice of pepperoni to set a baseline, and a slice of something like Caprese, with fresh tomatoes, basil, and mushrooms. Excellent thin crust, flavorful zesty sauce and fresh toppings. Delicious! And, unlike most places where you get a slice or two, they didn't just lukewarm it in the oven and hand it to me. They got it piping hot. Damn it was good.  I.d go back in a heartbeat.
