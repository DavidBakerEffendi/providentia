I would try this place again, I don't feel as if I experienced the best it could be. I had the lamb and spinach, which tasted just like lamb and spinach.  Perhaps it's the Serbian style not to add much in the way of seasoning,  I'm not sure. It wasn't bad, I like both those flavors, but it didn't have a harmony. The wait staff was fairly attentive, although when I asked what I should really try, what their specialty is, the reply I got was being the only Serbian restaurant in city, everything is their specialty. I was looking for a little more to go on. Also, the lamb in the stew had small bones... a little dangerous.
