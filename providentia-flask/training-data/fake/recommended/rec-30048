While I'm glad they were open on Christmas day, and given that I was looking forward to it because we've eaten there before and enjoyed it, we were disappointed with the quality of the food this time.  Services was quick.  Our waitress had some trouble understanding us (our Chinese is a lot worse!) but the order was delivered correctly. Too oily was the major problem, and the fried rice, while having a fair amount of shrimp, was lacking in other flavors and items.  The chicken in lettuce wrap was just cooked, chopped chicken laid out on a piece of lettuce.  Boring.
