I went there to entertain guests from Italy. All the reviews were very good on the food and portions. I kept checking to see if I was in the same restaurant... :( The waiters seem to rush you through your meal. One couple had just ordered a drink and when it was delivered the waiter asked if they were ready to order. The couple replied "...we just sat down". They charged $10 for a gin/tonic! I'm still waiting for the gin part. I ate at the Four Seasons a couple of weeks ago and their cocktail price was also $10 BUT, it was worth it. You could taste the gin. I had heard raves about the chicken parm so I tried it. It was just OK, nothing to brag about. My guests all ordered pasta dishes and their portions were very small. That's why there prices are so reasonable, the portions are small. I'm not looking for huge but so many other reviewers said how large their portions were and had to take some home. Are you serious? My chicken parm came with a small side of pasta. But my plate looked barren. Just a piece of chicken. They could have at least presented it better. Was disappointed. Probably won't go back.
