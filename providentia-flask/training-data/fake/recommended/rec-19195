Good place! The first time I went here, I ordered a create my own burger. It was delicious!! Cooked just right, a huge portion for a pretty low price! The second time I went here, I ordered mels chicken cutlet sandwhich which was also really good and just as filling as the huge burger! My boyfriend ordered a mediterranean wrap which he didn't really like, served cold and too many ingredients inside that don't really go together..but I would definitely go back again! Cute inside too!
