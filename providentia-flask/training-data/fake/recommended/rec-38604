I really really wanted to love Frankford Hall.  I love the food at all of the Star restaurants, even though they are a little pricey.  I was so excited when FH opened for business and I was there opening weekend.  The Saturday after they opened, a friend and I went out drinking to celebrate the impending rapture (haha, it's still funny).  We got to FH around 3:00 P.M. The food was great.  The beer was great.  I spent $21 on a beer and a pretzel. Granted....it was a pretty big beer and pretzel.  $21 is still a little much. I went in a second time the following Thursday night.  This time it wasn't as crowded.  My wife and I got our beers and took our seats outside.  I was disappointed to see that, unlike my previous visit,  there were no musicians preforming German drinking songs.   The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because of the kids.  There were a whole bunch of little kids running around (about 8-10 kids).  They kicked stones on my wife and I more than a few times and even played hide and seek under our table while we were eating.  The kids were making a lot of people really angry... but their lazy, drunken, idiot parents didn't give a crap.  I spoke with the two security guards that were walking around and they informed me that the kids were part of a large party that had booked out a section of the outside seating that night. (Thursday 6/2/11).  They apologized about the kids running around, but said that there was nothing they could do.  For over two hours they were yelling, kicking rocks, knocking into people and monopolizing the table tennis. The only thing more disappointing than a restaurant allowing brat kids to run around and ruin your night (when your paying $13/L for a beer) is knowing that their parents are irresponsible enough to take them to a beer garden in the first place. ---Update: $5 dollar cover on a Saturday night? Only Stephen Star would make it possible to spend $26 on a soft pretzel and a beer.
