I came here for brunch on a Sunday with a few friends.  We waited for a while, and unfortunately had to sit at separate tables, but with a place so small- that's acceptable.  Everything from the coffee, the cucumber drink (i forgot exactly what it was), and our food was amazing. Our table ordered the ricotta pancakes, Moroccan eggs, and the five leaves burger.  The ricotta pancakes and burger were both OUTSTANDING!  The Moroccan eggs were OK.  I don't like when a lot of things are thrown together on a plate, and that's basically what this was. I will most definitely go back again.
