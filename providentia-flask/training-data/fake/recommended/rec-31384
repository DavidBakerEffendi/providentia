Truly one of my favorite places to eat in the area. It follows this rule of thumb I have: If you see people of the same nationality eating at the restaurant (i.e Greeks eating at a particular Greek restaurant), you know it has to be good. That's never more true than at Stamna. Tzatziki is on point (I get it every time), and my absolute favorite hot appetizer is the grilled sweet peppers with feta. (Sorry, I need a moment...) Pair those peppers with some their bread: daaaaaamn!!   I love going with a group of people and sharing a bunch of everything. More recommendations: "Garides Santorini" (Greek Style Shrimp sautéed with Tomato & Feta Cheese), grilled kalamari, "Lahanodolmades" (stuffed cabbage). If you walk by and the place looks really crowded, don't be deterred, they also have tables in the back. OH! and stay away from the Greek coffee (sorry Greeks), it's like trying to drink a cup of coffee filled with coffee grounds--very grainy.
