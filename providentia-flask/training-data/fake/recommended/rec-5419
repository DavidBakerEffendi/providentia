Went there for dinner with friends last evening. Had a great tapas meal. The price was reasonable and the portion size was good. More importantly the food was great. The ambiance is very cool, right out of Austin Powers!!! There is a great roof top bar with great views of the city. After running the marathon the elevator to it was a welcomed treat.
