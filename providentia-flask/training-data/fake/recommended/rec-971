Geno's is a tourist attraction, not a true Philly cheesesteak joint. They are tossing meat on a roll and charging $9.50 to out of town folks looking for an "experience". The steaks are simply not good. Ride over to Tony Luke's for an authentic Philly cheesesteak. The place is less crowded and the food is so much better. The cheesesteaks are made to order, the rolls have a perfect crust. Just as I remembered when I lived here 20 years ago.
