Came here for dinner with hubby...I haven't been here in years and I've been jonesing for some crab fries, it's been far too long since I had some. Well the service was fast and my waitress was very friendly. The crab fries were good as long as they stayed hot. I ordered the lump crab cake, 3 in a order and no side...and for $22 I think they could've been bigger. The fries got salty as they got colder. Wasn't too impressed this go around. I don't think I'll be back sadly.
