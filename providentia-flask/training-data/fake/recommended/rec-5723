Stopped in with my boyfriend for a late night burger since we were in the area and it's rumored to have one of the best burgers in the city. The place was pretty empty. We ordered a Bistro burger, medium rare with fries and two small beers. The beers here are quite inexpensive. The burger was juicy. Came with onion, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and bacon. Overall a good burger. Would come again if in the area.
