When my friend told me we were going for burgers he forgot to mention it would be in Heaven! Happiness; bite after bite without that greasy/guilty sensation you get from the other inferior places. The best part aside from food was the music, what an unique place. It is hard to think of it as an actual franchise but a local lovely restaurant instead.
