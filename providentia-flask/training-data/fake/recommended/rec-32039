Very good food at very fair prices. I'm a college undergrad and was taking my sister out to dinner after a movie at the Ritz, as a belated birthday gift for the two of us Saturday night. I was surprised (considering location, food quality, atmosphere, and how full I left after eating) by how fair the prices were, we did no research in advance so it was totally serendipity we went there. We ordered, for $60: - Mussels (Huge Bowl) - Calamari - Gnocchi Gorgonzola - Chicken Something (stuffed with prosciutto and with vegetables) - Literally ate a loaf of bread each - Drinks The mussels we had were very good and came with an amazing broth, that was literally so good I ask for them to put it in to something to go (even a standard plastic cup, I didn't care) - so I could finish it later. The broth was even better the next day! Â Also, the calamari was good, not as crunchy as I hope, but still pretty great. I had the Gnocchi Gorgonzola, which was extremely rich, but tasty. I was pretty full off the awesome apps, so I only put a little dent in it. As you probably already know, gnocchi especially in cream sauce isn't nearly as good the next day - but, that's what I get for ordering enough apps for a family of six. Honestly, it probably could have used some herbs or something to lighten it up, but again the gnocchi on the own were heaven. Overall, great experience and I'd definitely recommending going there.
