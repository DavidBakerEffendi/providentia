BYOB- we didn't know but there was a shop just down the street that sold alcohol For appetizers: Shrimp dumpling- pretty good but nothing memorable Calamari- average octopus- flavorful, I would def recommend getting this. At least try it once, different texture. For my entree I got the crab cakes. Pretty decent sized portion and flavor was good. I mean you can't compare to baltimore crab cakes but these were pretty good too for Princeton. I came here for work event. This place is on the pricier side but def worth the money. We sat outside because it was so nice outside which was nice! Need reservations or else you won't get seated.
