I've been coming to Rye since I moved to Brooklyn in 2009.  Not only is it great for an intimate dining experience, but they have accommodated my whole family for brunch numerous times (we've been up to 13 people at times). Of course it's best to make a reservation. I always get the three egg omelette with goat cheese and caramelized onions for brunch. It comes with a hash brown and side salad and always holds me until dinner.  I also recommend the grapefruit and the smoked salmon if you want to split an appetizer. For dinner, I like to get the chicken, even though it takes a little while to bake. The staff here is unlike anywhere else in the area. They're knowledgable about EVERYTHING on the menu, from the wine to the desserts. I can't even decide if it's the service or the food that has kept me coming back regularly for the past 5 years.
