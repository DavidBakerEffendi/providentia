Excellent. I'm just visiting Philly and didn't want to find/park/wait at Genos or Pat's. I can't believe those guys could beat Philip's. I got the chicken "wit" and added hot sauce. Not much wait, but a steady stream of customers. All was perfect except the bread was a little hard. But better too hard than soggy. I will return whenever I come to Philly. Possibly the best sandwhich I've had.
