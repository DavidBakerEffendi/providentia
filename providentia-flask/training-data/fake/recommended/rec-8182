Had dinner at Pacifico last night with my partner in crime.  It was a pretty mediocre experience for the price. For the first course, we ordered shrimp tacos and an empanadas tasting.  For the main course, she had a yellow fin tuna steak with a plantain/shitake tabbouleh, and I had a crispy whole Mediterranean black sea bass with arugula salad.   My assessment:  the shrip tacos were nicely presented, but bland, and not at all like tacos.  I think the shell was phillo dough.  The duck empanada was really tasty, but the steak was not exciting.  And there was only 1 of each, for a total of 2, in the "tasting" order. The yellow fin was standard.  It was a typical grilled tuna steak, and it was a little dense -- although she did order it cooked medium, and I think a tuna steak is best prepared medium rare.  So I guess that comment gets an asterisk.  The accompanying tabbouleh was a creative combination of stuff, but not that flavorful.   My crispy sea bass was good.  It was beautifully presented -- for someone who doesn't mind tearing into something that really looks like a fish, head and tail included.   It was well prepared.  Crispy but not heavily fried.  The greens were fresh, the portion was generous, and it was drizzled with a tasty sweet plantain sauce.  For New Haven, this gets a thumbs up. Another positive:  my margarita was great.  I ordered a classic lime margarita, straight up with Patron, and it was great.  No crappy sweet and sour mix involved -- it was simply tequila, cointreau, lime juice and salt, as far as I could tell.   Perfect. I think the tab was $120 including 1 drink each, no dessert or coffee.  3 stars may seem a bit harsh following the positive words about the margarita and the sea bass, but in all, the experience was good.  Not great.
