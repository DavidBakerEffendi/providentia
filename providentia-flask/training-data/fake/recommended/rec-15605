Great brunch! Came here during Columbus day in the afternoon expecting to have there mac and cheese which is highly recommended. sadly they weren't serving lunch since it was a holiday and had been serving brunch. happy they were !! i ordered an apple cider mimosa which didn't taste like anything too special (it tasted like a magner). i had their punkin' waffles which were so yummy! the waffle wasn't dry or overly sweet. it was fluffy and had a little sweetness to it. the cooked apples and cranberries added such a nice flavor that i didn't really need the maple syrup (but had to try it anyways and made it even better despite the fact that it was already a 10 for me). also ordered a side of chicken apple sausage. you could actually see the apple inside the sausage. the place has a really cute set up. its a mix of a small french cottage house to your grandma's house. waitresses was super nice and didn't rush us at all. i could actually just sit and enjoy my meal. i'll be back for that mac and cheese!!
