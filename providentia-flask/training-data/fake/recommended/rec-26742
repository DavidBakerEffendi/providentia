Thank god the owners of ramen boy wiser up and bought a franchise from Terakawa ramen! The new recipe here is great and I'm really happy Philly finally has a great ramen joint! The combination meals are a hit, more than enough food for one person.  The spicy ramen has just enough salt and spice in the brooth, I wanted to have it as a drink to go haha. The tables are small but still comfortable.   Service was fast and friendly overall.  We came around lunchtime on a Saturday and our food came within 15 minutes of ordering.   Probably the best ramen place in Philly right now (who knows what other ramen place will arrive next..) and I look forward to coming back again.
