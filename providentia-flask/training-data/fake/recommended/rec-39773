My boyfriend and I were on the hunt for a great meal in a restuarant that wasn't too crowded (i.e. there is enough space in between two tables so you dont have to hear what everyone is saying). We were SO SURPRISED at how wonderful everything was here. - Grape Leaves UNREAL - HUMMUS - AMAZING Music was wonderful and appropriate, there was coat check when you came in, and everything was clean and wonderful. A great place to come with a small group or on a date. Romantic but not "too romantic." A MUST GO!
