Best Halal in NYC! I've been going here for years and have always seen long lines at this cart. I even saw Fat Joe ordering here once lol. I usually get the lamb and rice combo but today I had the lamb/chicken and rice combo. It was great! The portions are huge so I always have enough to take home. I love their white sauce! Caution: Only use tiny drops of their hot sauce. Their hot sauce is so spicy it's enough to make you cry.
