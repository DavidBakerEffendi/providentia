Brunch it up!  Tunisian eggs were great and spicy and the breakfast special for $7.50 is an awesome deal with 2 eggs, home fries, toast and fresh squeezed oj and cappuccino.  Great place with ample seating although on the weekends it can get quite crowded so anticipate a wait.  Must be great in the summer with the outdoor seating.
