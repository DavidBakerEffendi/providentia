We were confused as to which cart it was at first since there were 2 right across the street from each other, but they're the same (notice their t-shirts, menu, and clothing). My friend and I shared the chicken and rice and it's good! It wasn't as delicious as I thought it would be - i think mainly because we brought it home with us and it was warm, not hot, by the time we ate it. The hot sauce is SUPER hot! My stomach is still churning this morning after eating it last night. The white sauce tasted like ranch to me, but if you mix the ranch and a little bit of hot sauce, it tastes really good. I'd recommend 2 people sharing as we could only finish 3/4 of it.
