Had the hand drawn noodles with beef brisket which really hit the spot on a 30 degree day. We were there on thanksgiving day and while everyone else was closed Chinatown was still popping. Not sure what its like on a non-holiday but on that day it was pretty empty because we came around 3pm. The noodles were on par and brisket was tender.
