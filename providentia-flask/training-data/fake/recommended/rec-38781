I can't say I was impressed by our Saturday brunch here. Prices are in line with local competitors Morning Glory, Sabrina's, Carmen's, Green Eggs etc. but the food was not impressive. The House Baked French Toast seems to be a pan-baked bread pudding really. In concept that's fine, but it was overdone, hard and crunchy. The South of the Border Eggs were made correctly to order (over hard) but Â thanks to being grievously under-seasoned didn't come together. A little basil would have helped. Just a thought. I could chalk that up to an off day and try again ... but here's the thing that kind of rankled me. It's that if I'm going to splash out a bit for a place like this I want it to have some character, and Hawthornes doesn't really have it. It's clean and well-lit and filled with quirky faux antiques that have no South Philly connection, like a well-decorated hotel restaurant. Basically Pottery Barn. I felt a bit like I was part of the product, not in a real place run by real people. No help from the background music playing, which was fifties rock of the most generic variety. I mean, I'm sorry but Johnny Rockets is only a few blocks away and I could go there if I wanted...I just don't. On the plus side, the server was quick, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. This was a welcome change from the grumpy treatment you sometimes get at certain of the other places. Yes, it's an alternative, but for brunch anyway, it didn't really measure up to the local competition.
