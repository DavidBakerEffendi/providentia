Lock Yard was one thing Bay Ridge was missing ... a cool craft beer spot with some outdoor seating for you and a few friends to have a chat and soak in the warmth or cool crisp night. I love the fact that the beer lineup is constantly changing giving you a nice constant flow of different beers. The staff is super friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Love this place and glad it's here.
