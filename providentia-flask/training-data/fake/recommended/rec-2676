These 5 stars are only based off of one dinner, but it was an amazing dinner! We got the... Butterhead lettuce salad - I'm rarely satisfied by a salad this healthy and with this little cheese (there was some cheese, but still). The vinaigrette was so tasty and simple. Whole wheat farfalle - This had all kinds of kick from the pickled chilis and blue cheese. Lots of great flavor, my friend ordered it and I wanted to steal the whole thing. Smoked goat cheese cavatelli - I ordered this and my friend wanted to steal all of it. So creamy and delicious but not over-the-top rich, the bread crumbs on top were awesome and the pasta clearly homemade. the wait staff was friendly and relaxed, and the open kitchen allowed us to see that the kitchen staff was the same. The ambiance is similar to village whiskey but with an open floor plan. I want to go back immediately!
