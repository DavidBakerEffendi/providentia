Went here for lunch with a friend and had a rather forgettable experience (which is why I'm reviewing it the day of because I'll forget I even came here in a few). Even though this is supposed to be Cuban cuisine, I would say it's closer to pan-Latin Caribbean food. There are subtle differences in the seasoning of Cuban dishes than say, Dominican, and this place really makes little effort to distinguish those flavors. Yes, the food is pre-made, plentiful, and comes out quickly, but if it would cost anything more than the $9.99 per plate they charge, I would have given them 1 star. Pros: Cheap Quantity Maduros (sweet plantains) were delicious Cons: Overly salty everything The ham croquettes were stale, cold, and had no flavor. They felt "old." They do not use flank steak for ropa vieja (again, a subtle difference, but makes it less authentic.) Service; good grief, they took forever to bring water and the check. When it's busy, they don't have enough of a wait staff. Don't expect anybody to come by and ask how your food is/if you need anything else. Very impersonal.
