I love love love this sweet spot. The owner is from the South of France and the authenticity really shows in the menu, as well as all the little knick knacks and postcards covering the walls of the restaurant and even the bathroom! (Definitely something to keep you preoccupied in the bathroom...) What I also love is that the owner takes care to serve the patrons and isn't just idly standing or behind the counter. Everything from the crepes to the pasta I had is delicious and you won't regret wandering off the beaten path to this place. Great for a lunch date with girls and as a tip for guys, you'll make any girl swoon with cuteness if you bring her here on a date!
