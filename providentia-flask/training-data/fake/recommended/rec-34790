Good cheap and tasty - a bit off the beaten path in the Fashion District but worth the trek for some good Indian classics wrapped in a very flat style of naan bread. Drinks are over priced ($3.50 for a bottle of ice tea) but hey, they have to make money some how. The Chicken Tikka was good but the Chana Masala was even better!
