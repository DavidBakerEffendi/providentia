Came here for Mother's Day buffet. It was superb. Please do not change executive chef. Not only does he manage the kitchen but he also walks the restaurant floor. Â Everything was excellent. Only challenge is why is 20% auto charged to parties of 7 or more? It's a buffet. Plus you get the food and bring it to your table. I always give more than 20% but mostly for full service. They are clearing plates and bringing drinks. Basically we were auto charged 44 bucks for clearing 10 plates and brought 10 drinks. Considering that took 4 trips, not a bad take. Management should address this situation during buffet days. I am reviewing the food and service though, the tip issue should have no effect on that.
