This place is a gem! The environment is very relaxed and the staff is incredibly nice. If you or anyone you know has a gluten allergy this place will become your new best friend as well. A review does not do justice in explaining the unique and delicious menu. Please do yourself a favor and check out Plum on Park, and you will find yourself there for breakfast or lunch every day!
