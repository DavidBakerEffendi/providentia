Went to this place for dinner with a group of friends and left very disappointed. The waitress didn't come to our table for at least 20 minutes and when she did it appeared she was trying to rush us. She couldn't recommend a good wine for my friend. I ordered the scallops that were overcooked, maybe because it took 45 minutes for the food to come out. Very disappointed and I don't recommend it and will not be coming back.
