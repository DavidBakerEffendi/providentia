This is probably my favorite place to come after dinner, for the night in general, with the girls, or if I want to chalk and pee at the same time. The food is great, cheap, and served in large portions. Actually - those adjectives all work for the drinks as well. This place is fantastic. The service is quick and friendly, while the servers are always down-to-earth and equipped with some smart-ass humor to through at you. A night at the Cantina is never a dull one and getting there is never bad either as they supply you with a parking lot and endless street parking. The atmosphere of this place is just breezy and comfortable no matter the season and you're surrounded by a crowd that is always nice and eclectic.
