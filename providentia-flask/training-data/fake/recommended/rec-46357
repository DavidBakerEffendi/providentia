Beautiful setting, very good food overall. Server pushed the Tomohawk steak, but didn't tell us it was $148. One of the other main plates pushed hard by the server was the tuna, which came out overcooked and tasteless. When we complained, the server did not offer to bring a new one and did not even take it off the bill! Finally, one of our guests spilled something on his shirt and asked for some club soda; yep, you guessed it, there was a charge for $3 on our bill for club soda.
