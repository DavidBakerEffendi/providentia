The Haven was our late-night sanctuary during our college days, always the perfect bookend to a night of revelry.  To the uninitiated, it would seems to just be a normal sandwich shop, but there's just something about the controlled chaos housed within, mixed with some sort of griddle magic that makes the Haven one of the greatest sandwich shops in the world. The menu is huge, but if you want my advice, stick to the hot sandwiches, like the chicken parm, or the bacon omelet cheesesteak.  The line moves quick, and the service is just one notch more forgiving than the Soup Nazi, so know what you want before you step up to the counter. You always want the salpepperegano. The bread is fantastic.  What's housed within can only be described as the closest thing I'll ever have to religion.  The toppings are piled on liberally, and the meat is informed by the layers of seasoning that have caked their griddles and fryers for decades. The Haven is so good, that I once took a 6-hour detour during a road trip just to have a chicken parm and cheese fries.  It's the first place I head when I pay a visit to my old stomping grounds.  And when I bite into a sandwich from one of those perfectly-serviceable shops you can find just about anywhere, I always find myself pining for my first love.
