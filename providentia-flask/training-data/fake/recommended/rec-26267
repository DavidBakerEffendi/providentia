This is what real BBQ tastes like. I would've given 5 stars, but the band that was playing was so loud that we had to scream so we could all hear each other. Portions are large. We ordered a family size for 6 people to share, wings and an extra side of mac and cheese...and we couldn't finish it. Saved leftovers for lunch the next day :) The Mac & Cheese was awesome and so were the mash potatoes! We had to wait about 45 minutes for our table on a Saturday night. It was alright since the food was so good. Service was great as well. Atmosphere is great for a group of friends. Large drink selections!! See you guys soon again!
