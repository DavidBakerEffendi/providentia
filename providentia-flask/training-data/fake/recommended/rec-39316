I was guided here by my wife's co-worker, both of them being of Brazilian Portuguese descent.  The food is outstanding.  Everything I have had from fish to meat has been well prepared, except for one steak that was done well, when asked for medium rare, the staff gladly took it back and provided me with another made to perfection. On Sunday's, I now have a ritual of going for the roast suckling pig, which is "Hog Heaven".  The skin is like candy and the meat  moist and heavenly.  The pepper sauce on the side is also very tasty for dipping or pouring over the piggy! Another one of my favorites is the grilled Bacalau (Cod steak), with onions, peppers and veggies and boiled potato!   Street parking is a pain, but they have 2 lots and if you go around the usual retaurant rush, be prerpared. Also, if you are interested in the World Cup  soccer games, it a great place to watch, with numerous screens and a lively atmosphere.
