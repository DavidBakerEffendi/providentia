This is my go to place for a breakfast sandwich. sausage egg and cheese on a croissant for $6.75. The eggs are cooked perfectly, cheese completely melted, mixed in with slices of sausage on a buttery croissant. I haven't had the ethiopian food yet but I'll have to find an occasion. Man this is a satisfying sandwich. The people are pretty nice also and after my second visit he (Solomon?) knows what I want. Also, as I was waiting, I overheard one of the owners trying to get to know one of their regulars. Seems like a friendly, down to earth place.
