when i went to philly back in 04 my friends and i had steaks from pats and genos. we agreed that pats had better bread and genos better meat. i went again back in october and this time pat's was better all around. a friend of mine told me that tony luke's was the best in philly so i tried it and it was good but i still liked pat's more. next time i'd like to try their roast pork sandwich as well.
