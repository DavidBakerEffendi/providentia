I absolutely LOVE the food here.  It's a small cute spot with weightstaff that is mostly relatives of the owner.  Translation: Do not come here expecting service equivalent to what you'd get at some fancy restaurant.  They are pleasant and friendly, but they are slow to a degree. But the food...is EVERYTHING.  Everybody thinks they know how to make mac and cheese, but Ms B really DOES.  It's not just cheese and filler.  It is actually seasoned. The fried whiting is lightly seasoned and perfectly fried.  Some one reviewed it as over fried.  I've never had that experience and I have been there many MANY times...almost always ordering the Whiting. Even the potato salad is EVERYTHING...and seasoned well.  Not salty...but flavorful.   I don't eat everybody's greens.  Growing up you just didn't order that from a restaurant, but my guy ordered them and I tasted his. Very nice flavor of smokey meat and just the right amount of everything. I love the food...It's probably a good thing that it's not so close to where I live.
