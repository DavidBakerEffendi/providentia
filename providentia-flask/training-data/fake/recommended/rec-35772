An OK dining experience for $450+. (including three bottles of wine) Pork bruschetta with ramps was solid. As was salumi plate. Clams were weakly flavored, lacking love and salt. Agnolotti del plin were tops! Very light and enjoyable. Gemelli with sweetbreads and pancetta was ok, give or take the 8 or so inch hair with which my plate was laced. (they did bring a new one) Rabbit casalinga was dry( which is typical of rabbit but I'm talking DRY) and flavorless. Good polenta though! Polenta budino was one of the best desserts I've had. Perfect balance of sugar and salt(served with slightly salty hazlenut brittle.) Well done. Good wines, nervous waitress, some good food, some not that good. Not worth the money.
