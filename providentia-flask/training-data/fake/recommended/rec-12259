Crap.  I went here with my wife and 4 friends this morning.  First off, our server was in a bad mood, throwing her trays onto the counters and being loud in whatever she did.  She was obviously trying to let someone know that she was unhappy. Second, the french onion soup looked like it had a BP oil spill within it.  It was gross. Third, ALL of the entrees except for mine were awful.  The belgian waffles came out with a fake, fruit gelatin, instead of real fruit.  The griddle's had absolutely no flavor.  My scrapple was literally 2.5 inches thick, so the inside wasn't even warm.  The only good items we had were the bagel with cream cheese and milk. Finally, when we were done and our server was aware of it, it took 20 minutes to get our check.  Upon looking at it, we were charged extra for the ice cream on the belgian waffles, even though the menu said it came with it.  We told the owners son and he said it was extra and that our menu was wrong.  He said there was supposed to be white-out over the ice cream.  Are you kidding me?  We then said it to the owner and got the same response. In the end, the server didn't deserve the 18% gratuity automatically added on because she was horrible.  So we paid for the food and left her $5.   DO NOT GO HERE!!!
