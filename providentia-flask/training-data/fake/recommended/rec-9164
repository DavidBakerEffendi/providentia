This is a review of Buttermilk Channel's Brunch: I cannot say enough good things about the food and the service. This is one of the great brunches- or let's just call it a damn breakfast- I've had in Brooklyn, and perhaps in North America. Or Earth. Pancakes. One question? Is crack expensive? Because they put SOMEthing in their pancakes that makes me claw at the door at 9:45AM on a Saturday or Sunday. I've never had eggs cooked better in my natural OR unnatural life.The sausage and bacon? What is UP with that? Did they find some magical golden delicious pig in heaven and convince to become bacon? Friends: You will not be disappointed. Go check out Buttermilk Channel. But please make sure I get a table before you do! ;)
