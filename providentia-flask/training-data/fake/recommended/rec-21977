Today was my first time there. Food is very good and inexpensive. I paid 6 bucks for a burrito with rice and chicken. My other cohorts had burritos and half chicken. They all said it was excellent. If you are looking for a place to eat for lunch when your around Newark. I would definitely recommend Dario's.
