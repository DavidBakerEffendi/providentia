For more than 10 years this has been my crutch in many ways. With so many places to choose from and new ones opening everyday it seems I find myself veering back to Race St regularly. Solid, dependable and sometimes surprising ... like that person in your life you take for granted ... its a great place to meet or make an old friend, have an impromptu late night dance party or get cozy in a quiet corner by the fire. I think the staff gets a tough rap in these reviews. I find them friendlier than most ... they know the regulars and are always happy to see them. Having frequented this place for some time I have experienced everything found in the reviews and keep coming back and there is good reason to. I'd say they have always been at the crossroads of a neighborhood bar and an Old City pub. Most times you'll get the best of both, other times, well ... you learn that there are nights when you walk in, look around and decide I'll come back when the crowd fits what I'm after tonight and other nights when you say what the heck and just dive in. That is part of the allure to me ... its not perfect or the same every night. Each night isn't to be expected. .
