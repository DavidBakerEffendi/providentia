A great neighborhood spot. Great food, great service and only a block from my place! Consistency is key and Barbuto is always on point. I always get the salumi plate and the insalata stagionale, burrata YUM. I love the skirt steak and the buccatini with farm egg. Market green side dish with garlic and chiles are a great addition.
