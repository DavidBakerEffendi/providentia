Best wrap I've ever had in my life.  Brother's Grimm on the menu is the absolute best.  I don't even like wraps but this changed everything for me. All the ingredients are fresh and everything is actually spiced!  Flavor in a wrap!  Who knew... The owner is awesome too.  Another great place to eat in the LES, I can never move.
