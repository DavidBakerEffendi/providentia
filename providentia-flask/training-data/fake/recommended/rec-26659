Figs was above and beyond amazing. My fianc√© was looking for a romantic BYOB to go to after he proposed, and he selected Figs. It is a small, neighborhood restaurant. It is beautifully decorated. Being Moroccan food, it was exotic and romantic without looking tacky. For appetizers we got the melted brie, which comes with melted brie, honey, sliced almonds, and lavender oil. It was incredible and we have talked about it several times since. Sliced bread with a white bean spread comes with the meal and that was also really tasty (and a fantastic alternative to bread with butter). For dinner we got the sesame crusted salmon and the king shrimp in a light Thai curry sauce. Everything was cooked to perfection, the flavors worked well together, and the wait staff were attentive and very sweet. It's a BYOB, so people from the surrounding neighborhood also came in with a few bottles of wine to catch up with friends, in pairs or groups. If you are looking for something different, delicious, and romantic, or for just hanging out with friends to share a great meal, I could not recommend Figs more. Also, it is REALLY reasonably priced for the quality and intimacy of the place.
