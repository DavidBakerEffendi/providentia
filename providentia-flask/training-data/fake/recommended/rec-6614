My friend has been raving about this place since a first bite a few months ago, so after visiting someone in the hopsital nearby, we stopped there for a slice. TOTALLY AS DELICIOUS AS BILLED. I got a slice of the spinach and artichoke and omg so creamy and delicious. As yelpers have mentioned it tastes like a rich spinach artichoke dip spread on a thick crust. It's cheesy and completely blissful. One slice is definitely enough. I don't know how anyone could eat more than one, even if very hungry, because they're huge and super rich. I took another friend here a few days later since I was now the one raving about it, and she tried the sicilan and loved it. I took a bite and have to say it Â was the perfect blend of basil and cheese, with a delicious sauce that was not too sweet but just perfect enough to compliment the fresh ingredients. Even if there is a line I say it's worth the wait - definitely check it out and come hungry!
