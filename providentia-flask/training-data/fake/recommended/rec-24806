We recently ate hear on our way to Mystic CT based on a recommendation from a friend. It was a Friday evening and we arrived around 5PM. The place was already pretty full, but we were seated immediately. When we left at 6PM, there was literally a line out the door! The coal-fired pizza comes out on a big baking sheet. We had half cheese and half pepperoni plus a salad and it was all delicious. Even my son who is picky about his pizza really enjoyed it. They didn't seem to have plastic cups with lids for the kids, which made it a bit difficult for us with our 1.5 year old. Service was pretty good. I didn't feel like our waitress was overly friendly and I felt a bit rushed, but maybe that's how it is there since the place was pretty busy. I had to ask for a refill for my son, which is one of my pet peeves when going to a restaurant. I expect our servers to be on top of things like refills. All in all, we really enjoyed the pizza and would likely stop by the next time we are in the area.
