In the spirit of summer, I've been on a bit of a hot dog kick lately.  A few weeks ago, I checked out Dapper Dog, which inspired me to finally go to Hot Diggity. For the most part, I loved everything about Hot Diggity.  The location is awesome-- plenty of things to do and see while in that neighborhood.  I really liked the layout of the place- especially those ingenious holes in the tables for the cones of fries.  The artwork on the walls-- which depict the different hot dogs they currently or have offered were very entertaining.  I'm pretty sure our entire dinner conversation was about different kinds of hot dogs we've eaten in our lives... wow, that's sad. On this visit, my husband and I ordered one Fiesta Dog, one Southern Comfort dog, a small order of fries, and a water.  Came to about $16-- not too bad.  Although, I really wish we had ordered one of the homemade sodas (rookie mistake #1)-- next time I'll be sure to get one of those. As for the food, I'll start with the fries- they were DELISH!  I am a huge fan of really potato-y fries.  Unfortunately we didn't order any dipping sauces (dang, mistake #2 of the night!), but the fries were really good on their own. Now to the main event- the DOGS.  I ate the Fiesta Dog-- I really loved the toppings (lettuce, tomato, guac, red onion, sour cream).  They tasted so fresh and they were overflowing out of the bun. Yum!  But, like many of the other reviewers, I had some problems with the bun to meat ratio.  My husband had similar sentiments on his Southern Comfort dog:  Show us the meat! (I feel like Michael Scott would have a field day of "thats what she said" jokes on this review). Overall, I really enjoyed the experience at Hot Diggity and am looking forward to coming back and checking out another dog and getting some of those dipping sauces and homemade sodas!
