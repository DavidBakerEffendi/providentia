Yes. Big fat awesome hoagies on big fat awesome seeded rolls. Really really good hoagies, lots of varieties. French fries are humongous. What else can I say? Oh yeah, they have a good Cheesesteak too. On a side note they have, which I have never seen before, 8 oz glass bottles of sprite... 2 kinds, the normal short stubby bar bottle and a green bottle in the same shape as the classic Coke bottle... Who knows why but they get points for that.
