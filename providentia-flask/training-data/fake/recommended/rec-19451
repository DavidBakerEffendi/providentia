Great food terrible service. When we were there the place was maybe 1/3 full. The hostess sat us almost immediately but clearly didn't tell the waiters, as 20 minutes later despite seeing several waiters buzzing about the tables we had to flag one down so we finally got service (where he admitted that he had no idea who of the three tables that filled up in the last 20 minutes were seated first). Throughout the meal service was spotty to non existent, with water not being refilled (a big issue if you're serving very spicy food) and a beer ordered before appetizers not appearing until there was a reminder after we had finished our main courses. The building is beautiful, and the food was very tasty, but for that service I can't think that anyone in my group would be in a hurry to go back. It is cheap though.
