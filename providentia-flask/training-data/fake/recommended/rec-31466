What great food. I met a friend here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. I had Crab-cakes Benny. A alternative of the traditional Eggs Benedict, but with Crab-cakes. It was so good. It was all I thought about for days. The wait staff was average. The food can certainly speak for itself. I will definitely be back!
