I went here on a Friday night with a group of friends and they were able to seat us right away which was nice since we had just come from trying to get a seat at Cafe Magador where the wait time was forty minutes. The food was alright. I got a lamb sandwich. It was pretty tasteless. This place didn't really have anything special or memorable about it. The service was pretty slow too. Overall it was just ok; I don't think I would come back here.
