Actually, more like 2 1/2 stars. I really wanted to support this place since our dining options in the NNE are so limited, so we went last night despite the lukewarm reviews I've heard from several neighbors. Our service was very good and our pizza arrived quickly. Apparently, a little too quickly - the crust was doughy and underdone, and therefore soggy, and the cheese could've used more time in the oven as well. If I'd been alone, I would've sent it back for more cooking. We ordered a marinara and cheese pizza, but there wasn't enough sauce, and it didn't extend far enough out from the center. However, the toppings (mushrooms, sausage, and black olives) were fresh, plentiful and good. The weather was beautiful, so I was a little disappointed that the big garage doors weren't open - maybe next time. We may give this place another try, because we really want them to succeed - I just hope they improve the pizza with longer baking, more sauce.
