First and foremost, the food is excellent. The care and detail that goes into the sourcing of ingedients, the flavor combinations, and the presentation is of the highest level. Prices are kept very reasonable per quality. Seating is limited mainly to 3 4-seat bars, two looking out front windows, one overlooking the kitchen, and the atmosphere is charmingly minimal. Chef Park is an artist and his Tues-Thurs tastng menu is still the best kept secret in Williamsburg... a place where nobody can keep their mouth shut. But in all seriousness, the 7 course tasting menu last Thursday was one of the finest meals I've had in recent memeory. I can't recommend this place highly enough. ... I think I'm gonna try and get a reservation for this weekend...
