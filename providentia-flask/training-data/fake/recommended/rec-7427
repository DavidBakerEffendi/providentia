Crepes Du Nord is a great addition to the Stone St. area, though if you blink you might miss its understated entrance and low-key signage. The place is tiny, with limited tables and minimal waitstaff, so may not be the place to have a long brunch with 12 of your closest friends. Came here on a Sat around noon and didn't have to wait, though the parties that came in after us did have to wait for a little while for space to clear up.  I had the namesake Crepe du Nord, scrambled eggs mixed with chives and sour cream sauce tucked into a crepe topped with a generous layer of smoked salmon and salad on the side.  The crepe had a nice texture and slightly nutty flavor to it, the eggs were moist and fluffy and the salmon was salty and smoky without an overly fishy taste.  For $12, I was stuffed and satisfied! T had the crepes filled with egg whites and chives and then topped with smoked pickled herring and a side of cucumber salad (again, lightly brined).  His was also delish though a little intensely fishy for me as the first meal of the day. We'd anticipated needing a dessert crepe too but were pretty stuffed so decided to hold off for another day (though watching the chef make dessert crepes looked amazing). The waitress was friendly but had too many tables so minus a star for the mediocre service.  Atmosphere is cute, high tables and chairs, small lanterns hanging from the walls, but the music was pretty loud for a weekend brunch. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and getting my sweet crepe on!
