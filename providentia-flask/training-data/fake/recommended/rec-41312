I've been to Japan and this is the best bowl of ramen I've ever had. I concur with the other reviewer who said to get the special of the day -- the pork bone broth ramen with a slab of pork belly was fantastic. I only wish they'd included more than one piece of pork, but I guess it's more about the noodles. Oh, and be sure to ask for their special chili-garlic sauce if you like it spicy --just dump in the whole saucer. I was skeptical of their $5 pork bun, which is pricey, but worth a try. Same for the kale salad. Try the appetizers your first time, then stick to the ramen.
