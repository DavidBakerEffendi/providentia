What an amazing experience!! I have been trying to have brunch at this place for the past two year. Finally, today was the day that me and Rosewater collided. Right to it: Once I arrived, I had a 15 minute wait but me and my date was promptly seated. Truly within minutes of being seated, the cold water was poured and the hot coffee served. We were schooled on the brunch specials and off we were to completing our order. I had the butternut squash pancakes and my date had the three way. The food was umm umm good!! My complements to the entire staff, starting with chef!! I have to say, I want to return tonight for dinner just to experience what they can do with "two fishes and five loaves of bread". Rosewater may be small in size but it's humongous in creative flair across the board!!
