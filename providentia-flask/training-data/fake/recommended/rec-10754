I usually DO NOT WAIT over 30 mins to be seated at a restaurant, no matter how hyped the establishment is. Luckily Ippudo was just a stop on a long sunny day of wandering around the city with friends. I was buzzed so a few more drinks at a nearby bar while waiting to be seated didn't bother me. The sticky porn buns steal the spotlight from the noodles and every other item on the menu. I've had better ramen, the noodles just aren't worth the wait. If I visted Ippudo again I would skip the table experience and carry out the pork buns because Nom.
