2.5 Stars purely for the service and atmosphere. The staff and atmosphere gave me confidence that the whole dining experience was going to be good, but sadly the food was a huge let down. Escargot were extremely bland and of questionable freshness. No flavors, not even salt, was able to be infused into the meat. French onion soup was executed really poorly. All but 1/2 ounce of liquid had been reduced down to just a salty slurry. The flavors hinted at the potential, but alas it was a failure. Cote de Boeuf was not good. It was overcooked by at least two degrees of doneness, which should have been apparent when they sliced it for us. The flavors itself weren't very inspiring either, just loaded with crushed peppercorns. For $120, it should at least be mediocre. I certainly would not trust them with guests I am entertaining, but I might give them another shot down the road. Hope it was just an off night.
