A la Scott goes lebonese with a vibe.  Oh yeah!  It's hard to go wrong in the ecclectic space with a loud-young and youthful vibe. But the menu is anything but.   Sophisticated and varied-- Ilili's menu is overwhelming a first but be patient and experiment with everything. And with a knowledgable wait staff, no fears on asking for recommendations. Hummas,Tahitini, roast brussse sprouts and duck schwarma are fabulous choices just to name a few.  Go for anything lamb cause it's done just right.  Lamb sausage is one if my favorites. If you are not so daring go for the mixed grill.  It offers a sampling of expectable yet uniquely middle eastern fare. The space is awesome and the price point very good for upscale and a real NY scene.   A somewhat daring menu but mainstream enough to draw from the foodies to those who just want something good-different-upscale and with a vibe. No doubt-several visits in, a la Scott gives Ilili 4 stars.
