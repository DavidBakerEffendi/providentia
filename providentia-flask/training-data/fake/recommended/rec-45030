So the scoop on Penelope is the following - it's got a homey feel, yummy food, and pretty down-to-earth waitstaff. I might consider giving it a 5-star except I really can't stand places that don't take reservations or call-aheads. Granted, this place is pretty small, but I'm the kind of gal that when I'm hungry, I want to eat. Is that a crime? Anyway, this place has really delicious food - the brunch is unreal (if you can stand to wait an hour +) but I mainly go for lunch since it's so close to my office. My favorite thing there is the When Veggie Met Sally which is their scrumptious Veggie Burger cut-up and served over greens, red onions, green apples, and feta (who doesn't love cheese?) and garlic balsamic vinaigrette . It's super light but fills you up and is healthy. I've also had the chicken meatballs (so good) and the Chicken Pot Pie.. also delicious though I prefer the Pot Pie over at the Smith. Â  Bonus for Penelope since they recently started accepting Credit Cards and got rid of their annoying Cash Only rule. Definitely a great place to try!
