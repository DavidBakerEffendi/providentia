Best Mexican food in Morris County, hands down! My wife and I went the first week they opened and continue to go back at least two to three times a month; sometimes for lunch and sometimes for dinner. The food is always great and the service is very friendly and attentive. My wife is not a big fan of cilantro and they always accommodate her by going light on the spice with whatever she orders. Recently brought a group friends for dinner and they all loved it.
