Delicious and reasonably-priced spot in Murray Hill with fresh, "home-cooked" food--perfect for a take-out dinner, though the shop has one good-sized table and seems like a cozy spot to eat-in, too. I called in an order for a half-chicken meal with sides of ratatouille and cauliflower. It was ready within 10-15 minutes, when I arrived. The staff was friendly and personable. The chicken was moist and well-seasoned with herbes de provence. The ratatouille side was particularly flavorful; the creamy cauliflower was fine, but I'll probably try a different side next time.
