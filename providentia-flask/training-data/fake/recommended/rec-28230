All those months in the morning, on my way to work I wondered and wondered if someone was ever going to purchase that building that now stands before us as MP Taverna. Chef MP, I don't know who you are, but I am glad you did what you did. You are blessing us with the opportunity to reach out and diversify our palate. Came to MP on the eve of April 23rd, opening week with no expectations but an open mind and an open mouth. Roomie and I got there around 7:30 PM and was promptly seated to our table on the second floor. Dimly lit ambience was up my alley. The menu was pretty set and simple. Their wine selection was VERY EXTENSIVE. =) Â  We started off with two glasses of Rioja. Then, we moved onto the scallops and the white grilled fish. Both dishes were good and aesthetically pleasing. Our server for the evening had a professional yet witty manner. She was so smooth that we got talked in to trying the brownie for dessert and my oh my, WAS it good. Need to come back to MP Taverna 3 more times in order to consider the 4th star.
