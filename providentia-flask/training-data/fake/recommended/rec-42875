This is probably my favorite bar in the city. You walk in and the energy picks you up, makes you want to let loose and socialize. Yes, probably 50% of the crowd is average West Village--bankers and girls working in fashion--but I've met people here from around the world, artists, chefs, etc. Plus they continue to allow me in wearing a cheap Uniqlo shirt, jeans and chukkas, despite all the well-dressed gentleman inside. Drinks are awesome but expensive. Come on weeknights for a more interesting and smaller crowd.
