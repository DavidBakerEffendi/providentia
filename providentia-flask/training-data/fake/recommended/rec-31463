I love Popeye's. I went to college in New Orleans where there was one on every corner, so I really have good memories of this place. This store for some reason always seems to be out off some items. And the customer service is the worst. I know it is not a glamorous job, but I try to be pleasant and respectful and all I get is attitude. But yet, I still keep coming back.
