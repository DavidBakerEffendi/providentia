First things first - don't Google this place as just Graffiti NYC thinking that Google will be a mind reader and direct you to the RESTAURANT! Ate here for my good friend's birthday dinner - a special 3 course tasting menu was specially arranged. First course choices - pizza with mushrooms , goat cheese and truffle oil or pork dumplings. Second course - vegetable gratin I think or shrimp and Â third course - slightly sauteed strawberries with toasted almonds in truffle oil and pepper ice cream. The pizza with mushrooms was really good, the pork dumplings floppy and lacked flavor. The vegetable second course - I honestly don't remember it AND I wasn't even drinking alcohol. The strawberry dish was great as it was good flavor but I'd personally keep pepper out of ice-cream. Lastly, it's a really tight space, my husband and I thought that they may want to include loft style upper level seating (like a 2 tiered set up). Getting to the bathroom requires squeezing through a 2 foot wide space called the kitchen hoping that you don't push the chef/cooks into a hot surface:(( An experience to be had though.
