I'm from Long Island in New York and maybe I'm just used to really good Italian food, but this place honestly does not cut it. Whenever I try a new Italian place I order something basic with meatballs and tomato sauce and that is what I did here. It's a good judge of a quality Italian place. The meatball was not good plain and simple.  Their tomato sauce tasted like it was cheap and out of a jar. Seriously. Pasta itself was overcooked and probably from a package as well. With all the people I see in here, I really could not believe what was served to me.  Sorellos was pretty good and only a block away. I recommend going there 100%.
