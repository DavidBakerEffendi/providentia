What an experience. Â The food was creative, and very good. It's a tasting menu so you need to be cool win that . The only choice you have to make is your entree, and even then it was only two options. The staff was friendly enough, and knowledgable. If I had to find fault it would be the changing of plates and silverware. This is an expensive place and there are many different courses. It would have been nicer if we had fresh plates. Party of four the bill was $360+, plus the tip. Would I go again? Absolutely, just wouldn't be somewhere I would go often. But then again, with all that Philadelphia has to offer its hard to go anywhere often.
