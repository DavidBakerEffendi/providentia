I'm always a fan of a good dog. I tried the Cincinnati Skyline and it was pretty good, but not for the price. The prices are my only complaint about Hot Diggity. Three dogs, fries and a soda came to just shy of $25.00. Sorry guys, but that'll lose you a couple of stars. The dogs were good, but not that good. On the up side, the dipping sauces for the fries are pretty cool, especially the chipotle mayo.
