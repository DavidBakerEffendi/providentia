I learned how to make meatballs from a skillshare class by Daniel Holzman and my balls turned out delicious. So I had to go to The Meatball Shop when I was in New York and it's open til 2am so you could totally go after a night of drinks! I ordered traditional spaghetti, tomato sauce, and beef balls, then I got a slider, and possibly an ice cream sandwich. Okay I split and ice cream sandwich cause they told me that I could get two different cookies, which means it's almost a BOGO special. It seems like a lot, but the serving sizes are not overwhelming. I highly recommend. Perfect for late night eats with friends you've been walking around town with. And the servers are awesome!
