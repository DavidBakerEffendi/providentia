When you start of the meal with a pot of Mango Jasmine tea and that is already tasty without adding a single extra thing you know the rest of the meal absolutely won't disappoint! For appetizers we decided we try the Crispy Salmon Spring Roll and Asian Taco w. duck. Two unique things on the menu we never had at any Thai place before. The salmon was fresh inside the rolls and the cilantro basil lime dipping sauce, OMG...I need a bottle of that...yes please! The duck tacos were a great size and the shell was not your typical taco shell but more of an Asian pancake. It was juicy, flavorful and delicious! We are excited to try it with the monkfish next time (that is also and option). For dinner we ordered the Angry Beef and Thai Chili Lemongrass with Shrimp. Both with Jasmine rice. The Angry beef was tender and this may seem funny but the zucchini was marinated and flavored perfectly in the dish! The happiest Angry Beef you will ever have. The Thai chili Lemongrass with Shrimp was spiced just right when I asked for mild. The mushrooms, broccoli, peppers and cabbage in this dish was cooked perfectly and was also seasoned with the lemongrass sauce all the way through in every bite. The salad that came with it was an added bonus and complimented the dish perfectly. The food wasn't the only this great about this newly opened spot (4days old). Our waiter Brian was full of energy and so personable. Along with him and the two owners, they helped us narrow down the options of what I wanted to order, checked on us through the night and talked to us about the food and just were a great team and wonderful people. We have a menu and know what we are ordering when we come back! They are still in the process of setting up the bar, and adding liquor but u can enjoy the food and service until then!
