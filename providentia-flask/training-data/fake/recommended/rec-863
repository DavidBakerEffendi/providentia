Had Shepperd's Pie.  It was good, but the middle was not a hot as the outsides of the dish.  Little bit of a let down. Our poor waiter was swamped and frazzled.  He forgot my meal on his ticket so I got my food after everyone was pretty much done with their meal.  (He did comp it however)  Then we ordered a few desserts to share.  Turned out that they were out of Carrot Cake, yet it did show up on our bill.  Lots of mistakes, I'm sure he was pretty new. Either way, I really liked the atmosphere and it was a fun place to have a drink   I am a sucker for any Irish Bar that serves a good Shepperd's Pie! We ate in he Bar Room, not the fancy front room.
