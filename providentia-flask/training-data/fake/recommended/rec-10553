I had a great time at Becco. I went here on a date and it was a wonderful evening. The service was attentive and the decor was warm and inviting. I had the pasta tasting dish which gives you unlimited amounts of the 3 specialty pastas of the day. My favorite were the cocoa pumpkin ravioli. Delicious!
