Great place for dinner. Restaurant was well decorated with white painted brick and tin ceiling. Very cute, good for dinner with the girls or a date night. It's a small restaurant and seemed like the manager/owner was also playing the role of host and waiter. Everyone who worked there seemed really friendly. Went with 3 other ladies. We all drank wine which they serve in a large glass liter bottle with water glasses. The wine is actually a great deal and there is a M-F happy hour. I split the mozzarella appetizer with one other person. The other two ordered salads which were pretty large for an app size and looked good. Everyone liked their entrees. I ordered the special, a braised lamb shank with gnocchi which was amazing. Highly recommend. The salmon also looked good. We split a chocolate mouse/whipped cream dessert that was great. Overall, highly recommend. The only slight draw back I can say is that the restaurant was a bit warm. But very enjoyable meal. Would def go back.
