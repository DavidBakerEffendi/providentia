Looks very nice from the out- and inside. Although we both don't have food allergies or need to eat gluten free it is just a great place for proper italian food! We set down and had the Burrata, very very nice! Definitely a recommendation to share as a starter. I had the crab salad with fresh mango and avocado. I was hoping for real crab and i got it, no plastic surimi in this place! Nom nom nom, healthy and delicious. We also got a 'today's Â special' ravioli with spinach, crab, shrimp and truffle.. Although it always looks so small, when you eat thee (out of 6) pieces of ravioli your quite stuffed. And this plate was also very good! We finished with a cheesecake which we shared. I don't remember if it was a special one (e.g. flourless or something) but it was not the same taste sensation as you get when eating cake in general. I was missing the 'hmmmmm!'. So something was missing but i just can't tell you what it was. Btw, it is a very loud place! Not because of the music, people just talk with maximum volume.
