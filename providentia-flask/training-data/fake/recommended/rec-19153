Over a year later and still LOVE the food. It is my go to for good Puerto Rican without having to go into the city. Trouble is the staff is still AWFUL!!! They are so disrespectful and nasty. They continue to act like you are bothering them. they are always on their cell phones while you wait for them. If you have a question forget it they roll their eyes at you. I would eat here much more often if it wasn;t for the nasty nasty nasty staff. Â AND PLEASE PUT YOUR TIP JAR AWAY. Even when I do tip you are still as rude as always. Tips are for good service not because you decided to show up to work!!
