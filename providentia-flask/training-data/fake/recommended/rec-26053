Superb! Best whole fish I've ever eaten (I got the red snapper). The best fried oysters I've had outside of New Orleans. The ambiance is cozy and romantic.  The service is perfection. Are there some problems? Yes, cranking your neck around to see the menus is annoying, cash only, $5 corkage fee and worst of all . . . some of the patrons are incredibly loud and horrible.  You can't escape hearing their miserable asinine conversations.  Seriously, they should consider putting an age limit on people who can eat here. Anyway, none of that can take away from the food which is amazing.
