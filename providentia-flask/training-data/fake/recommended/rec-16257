The worst Italian ever!and I am Italian, so I can judge every single details! food was made in a cheap way that you can see they were trying to save money (little portions, or too little sauce on the pasta) but charging you as it was a fancy place. actually when you looked at the menu at the first place you could think that this is a convenient place to eat, but after you realize how they do that. I ordered also one appetizer that was mistakenly written in the menu, so I receive half of the ingredient s indicated.I asked and they even did not apologize to me at all! in addition we waited 2h to be served!!!the service was awful, owner and servant were more busy to chat than to take care about us! I felt ashamed to be Italian! horrible experience
