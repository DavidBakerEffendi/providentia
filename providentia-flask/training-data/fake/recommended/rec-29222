Wait, wait, wait!  A sexy chef who made the best pork soft taco I've ever eaten in my life AND shared his seasoning AND meat cut secrets with me while beaming a smile that melted my grits???!!!  YES, PLEASE! Chef Gautier is such a nice man and serves up some impeccable cuisine.  I haven't been to his restaurant yet.  I only met him and tasted his goods (oh, how I wish ;-) at the 2010 Yelp Snow Ball.  But he was, hands down, my favorite vendor and the best cuisine of the evening!  His line was the longest even during the select Elite Hour and stayed that way all evening long! I hope to try a multi-course dinner here soon!
