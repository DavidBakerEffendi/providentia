I can't count on how many breakfasts, lunches and dinners I have had here over the past 40 years but I never had a bad one. Consistency in their offerings has become their trademark and the portions are large as well. Great for breakfast and a quick lunch, salad bar is well stocked and the wait staff is efficient and friendly.
