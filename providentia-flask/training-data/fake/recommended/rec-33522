Definitely the best sushi in Brooklyn Heights proper. This small place is tucked away on Clark Street and you'd be smart to get some of the huge sushi rolls with great fresh fish. I live in Cobble Hill so this isn't always location friendly for me but I've ventured here several times with always great results. Friendly staff and great service also need to be mentioned. I'd give it five stars but it's not Nobu.
