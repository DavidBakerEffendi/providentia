I was excited to try this place after watching Marc Forgione on the next Iron Chef competition.  Similar to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, this place does not live up to its founder's reputation.  First off, the seating arrangement indoors leaves much to be desired - couples are relegated to row seating leaving very little room for private conversation. We sat outdoors for this reason (the seating outside is also cramped but slightly more tolerable).  On to the food...we were greeted with a complimentary spoonful of bacon and sour cream (the name couldn't be discerned due to the waiter's heavy foreign accent).  It was rich but not in a satisfying way.  The appetizers were probably the best part of the meal - the watermelon salad was flavorful but undersized given the cost and the jerk ribs were tender and seasoned well (this comes with coconut corn bread which was buttery and excellent).  The main courses were terribly disappointing: the rib eye steak was undercooked and fatty and the accompanying lingonberry sauce and onion garnish did little to enhance the flavor; the duck was undercooked and fatty and swimming in a very heavy cream-based sauce which made it unpalatable.  We would've opted for the chicken under a brick but we mistakenly thought it would be better to try different dishes...we were wrong.  Dessert was solid but unspectacular - we had the banana split in a glass which was something I could've replicated at home for far cheaper.  All in all, for the money this place charges, you are better off dining elsewhere.
