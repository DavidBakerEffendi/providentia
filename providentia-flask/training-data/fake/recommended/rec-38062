Great greek style pizza that tastes just as good the next day.  Bacon on the pizza is always crisp.  Vegetable toppings (including spinach) are never dried out like many other places.  Be sure to bring a bunch of quarters for the table jukeboxes and order a carafe or three of inexpensive house wine.
