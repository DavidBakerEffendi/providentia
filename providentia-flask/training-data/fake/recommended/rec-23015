Pauline's was wonderful! The food was superb! My husband had salmon and I had a chicken dish and they were both excellent. The service was wonderful as well. My husband asked for a recommendation on a local beer, and the server was knowledgeable and gave a great suggestion. The prices were a little on the high side, but we didn't mind paying it for what we got.
