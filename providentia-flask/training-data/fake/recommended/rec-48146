So I went there today because I was craving lamb and it was only twenty miles away. It was pretty muggy and the door was open and I was the only customer at 3:30 PM. The woman serving me was very pleasant and attentive and turned a fan on. She also turned the TV on that was tuned ti infomercials the entire time I was there. I'm sure they would have changed the channel if I'd asked, but then I wouldn't have known how much I needed Wen hair care products. I had Sambosa and  Lamb Shami Kabob. Sambosa consisted of 5 homemade dumplings with ground beef, potatoes, onions, garlic, herbs and cilantro (maybe other spices) in a baked pastry  served with a yogurt dipping sauce. Tasty and fresh, but not of the "I can't wait to have this again" caliber.  Good, though. I did like the sauces they served as condiments. There was a red pepper and a lime cilantro sauce on the table that went well with everything. They also places squeeze bottles of the yogurt sauce and a hot sauce on the table.  The hot sauce was not too hot and had at least some Franks Hot Sauce or Tabasco in it, The Lamb Shami Kabob.was a spiced ground lamb kabob that was quite tasty. I prefer my lamb medium rare and this was medium. Not as tender as what I had in my mind's eye. but I'm chasing the flavor of a lunch place I used to go in Boston. The cucumber, red onion, tomato and cilantro salad was an exquisite accompaniment as was the home made stuffed pita. Although I don't typically do rice, the subtle flavor combined with trying the sauces on it and by itself left just a few grains on my plate in the end. Solid place, I'll go back. BYOB. Open on Sundays (when Top of the Park isn't),
