Thanks to Dan G. I got the low down on Tommy DiNic's and their specialty: a Pulled Pork sandwich with sharp Provolone and Broccoli Rabe. Get in line to get it to go, or try to find a seat for dine in; they're pretty strict about doing one or the other. The service moved right along, and the sandwich was to die for! That sharp provolone and the greens really added a lot. Great sandwich! A must stop in the Reading Terminal Market.
