I used to frequent this establishment often even after they raised prices but after they seemed to have cute their cake sizes in half, I will not be anymore.  The $4-$5 for a cake that someone can eat in about 5 bites is ridiculous. Staff is friendly depending on the day  and I would rather go someone where they look please to have me spending my money there. ***Update, The manager personally emailed me about my review upset about the lackluster service I had received and wanted to try and make it right. It was really unexpected of him to do that but much appreciated. I decided to give it another try and had a great experience. I've gone back several times and will continue to go back because this place really is something special. ***
