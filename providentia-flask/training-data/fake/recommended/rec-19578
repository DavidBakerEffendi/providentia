going here on a triple dinner date was quite nice on this nice spring-like night and i believe we got the only large table that could fit us all! it is a small place, so come early. it gets crowded fast due to the good food and cheap prices. there are plenty of veggie options and they do offer fish and meat for us carnivores like myself. yay! Â but bring cash! cash only here. also, this place is byob. i started out with the thai tea. yums. the fresh spring rolls were just that, fresh! the veggie dumplings are delicious. whether you get sticky rice with sauteed lemongrass, shallots, and chicken or if you get curry soup and jasmine rice, there is sure to be something on this menu to please every mouth! the meal ended with fried banana with honey. of course, i was the only one that got dessert. the smallest girl at the table, but i always leave room for dessert! it's how i roll.
