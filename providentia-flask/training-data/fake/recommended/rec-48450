Due to surgery I have not been able to visit in person, but their delivery is awesome. By far the best delivery in the East Windsor area, because it doesn't taste like "take-out"... Â it is clear they are using quality ingredients and everything is made fresh. So far we've had the Margarita pizza - fantastic, Salad de Jessica - insanely delish, Alexs Masterpiece and Prime Rib sandwich - both awesome. The only so-so dish we've had was the Fettuccine Alfredo, but I think that was just be it's not a dish made for travel (the chicken it's served with was very tasty). Will continue ordering and definitely visit in person on e I am healed
