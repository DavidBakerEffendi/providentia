the restaurant is pretty large with plenty of seating.  we ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken and the Lomo Saltado, a steak dish.  the chicken was okay, i've had better.  the green hot sauce, "aji", is sooo delicious!  the steak dish was alright, the flavor wasn't mind-blowing, just run-of-the-mill beef with onions and french fries cooked in brown sauce.  we also had a side of tostones which were a bit dried out :( :( cafe con leche was spot-on.  the flan was good but the tres leche cake left a little to be desired.  on the plus side the staff is super nice and attentive and let us take our time.  but all in all, though this was my first peruvian dining experience and can't compare it to anything, i can think of other places i'd rather go for spanish food.
