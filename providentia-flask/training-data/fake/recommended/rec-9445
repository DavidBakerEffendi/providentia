I don't eat Peruvian food often so this place was pretty good in my opinion. Me and my family had the matador chicken, paella, Nikki ceviche and a couple I appetizers. The ceviche was really good! The chicken breast was too dry though. We also ordered both the red and white sangrias. I personally liked the white one better because the red was a little too strong for my taste. Otherwise the service was decent. Didn't really check up on us but we're readily available when we flagged them down. We also had a baby with us which was probably not the best idea. The back area downstairs was really loud and hot. I feel like it would've been good for then to turn on the AC...
