Truley disappointed, ordered food at 4:10 through delivery.com. My husband and I were exhausted from moving all day and just wanted to order out and save us from cooking. Well needless to say I should have just made something for us, we waited two hours for delivery and when I called at 5:15 to see if our order had been sent out for delivery I was told that it would be another 30-45 minutes, I found this absurd. I should have just cancelled at that point but really didn't feel like making anything. I got a call on my cell at about 6:05 with a man saying he was at our front door when I could clearly see him in his car in our drive way, I wasn't sure if he expected me to come to his car but that wasn't happening so I said okay so is my husband. I regret giving 15% online because clearly he didn't earn it by taking two hours with no explanation as to why or even an apology. I hope the responses to comments below are true and that they are trying to do better but if this was the attempt to do so, it isn't working very well.
