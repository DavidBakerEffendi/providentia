Two words for you ----- COMFORT FOOD! The outside may look a bit drab --- the inside drab again ---- but look past all of that and focus on the food! My husband and I had the beef birisket noodle --- out of this world! The broth was clear and soothing. The beef was soft and totally melted in my mouth --- there were no fatty pieces, all lean. The noodle were sooooo tasty --- not soggy or overcooked, just right. And the service was quick --- we got our food 5 minutes after ordering --- no joke! CASH ONLY PLACE! I will totally come back!
