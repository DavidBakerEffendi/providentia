It's always a little awkward returning to a business after giving a not-so-stellar review. Fortunately, the staff at Rex 1516 were total class acts when I showed up for lunch today, welcoming me back and immediately apologizing for the previous snafu. Much as I wanted to give that burger another try, the thought of something so heavy in my stomach before my run this afternoon swayed me into ordering the fish tacos instead. This turned out to be a wise choice. The blackened fish was perfectly cooked and heaped into two doubled-up flour tortillas, with lettuce, tomato, red onion and what (I am pretty certain) was a goat cheese cream sauce. They were absolutely delicious and satisfied my hunger without making me feel like I needed a nap. My dining companion, Allison B, tried her hardest to finish her hefty brie and bacon sandwich, but she had to throw in the towel with a few bites left. She put in a good effort, though. Our check was dropped and my tacos had been comped, which was extremely nice. Even nicer for Allison, as she graciously offered to pick up the tab (folks, she's now loaded with this new job of hers). Lunch in an hour may be a tight squeeze, but for those days when the boss is out, Rex is the perfect spot for a leisurely meal.
