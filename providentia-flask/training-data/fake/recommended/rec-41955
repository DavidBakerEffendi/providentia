This is going to be short review but full of excitement and happiness. First of all, I am not big fan of Italian food and I thought "Mercato" in my neighborhood makes good italian food so I went with that. But, my friends from work made reservations at Modo Mio and I immediately went to yelp and heard many good accolades. And, believe me, it is O My F...... God! Starting from home made bread and oil, the antipasti, the first and the second's, I forgot their names because I was in a coma from all those beautiful sensations I was getting from the plethora of flavours in food. But I digress, crab cake was just succulent and amazing, polenta was sublime, and their special evening lamb stew was orgasmic, I'm still levitating. They brought dessert assortment but everyone was full, except for ME. And the servers are on top of everything - 5 star all the way. People! You have to go and taste it - it's absolutely SUPERB. I think amidst all of the excitement I offered to marry the chef, alas he already was married :-( Cheers to all and to good food!
