Wow, I can't believe all the great reviews of this place!  I travel 100% for work and have done so the last 9 years.  Therefore, I eat out almost every night of the week.  I have also spent quite a bit of time in Asia for work and I can honestly say this is probably the worst Asian food I've had in the States.  I ordered a noodle dish and the noodles were completely charred.  Every bite tasted like burnt charcoal.  This is the first bad review I've ever written on yelp.  The two stars is only because the service was really good and the ambiance was nice.
