Had about 80% of the menu and everything is always on point. The steak and egg with siracha ketchup is bangin, midtown chicken and the village turkey homeruns. Fries are always hot and crisp, and a good root beer float goes a long way in my book. Service is fast and friendly, they don't even give me dirty looks when I grab about 400 peanut chews from the bowl.
