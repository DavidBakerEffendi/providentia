I recently discovered this place and it is one of my favorites in Philadelphia. I especially love the unique setup inside with the hammock style chairs and the general look. The food is a little pricey and I wasn't overly impressed with it. I'm a man of simple tastes and fancy isn't necessarily better in my book. However I admit that not everyone is the same in that regard and the food was very delicious. I go back for the decor and the friendliness of the staff though.
