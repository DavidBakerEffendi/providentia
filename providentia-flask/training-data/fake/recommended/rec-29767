My favourite taco and margarita place in New York! Hands down. The staff are so nice and the tacos are to die for. My favourites are the lamb tacos which have a bit of spice to them and don't forget to wash it down with a margarita. All their juice is freshly squeezed and come with a cute little umbrella decoration too. You get free chips and salsa and the guacamole is just the right combination of chunky and delicious.
