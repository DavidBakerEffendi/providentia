Loved this place!  Yes, it's crowded and can be expensive.  But there are some great deals and it's fun to look at the variety of Italian food and cooking supplies.  Had the zucchini and ricotta cheese focaccia and Italian lemon soda for about $6.  The focaccia was pretty generous in size.  Also went to the Eataly in Chicago the week before.  I loved the Chicago location and had to come to the one in NYC.
