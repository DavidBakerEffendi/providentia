Holy Crap love it here. The food is amazing. The waitress more than made up for the wait and the super bitchy mean host. I don't know what his problem was but she was amazing. Maybe that's their strategy. Frighten and discomfort the patrons, then they will be so overjoyed that the server isn't sneering or barking at them, they will think whatever he/she does is amazing, by comparison. He really did sneer. He seemed to calm down as time went by, but geez, someone needed a Zanax!. So we were starving and ordered the artichoke dip which was hot and delicious. So good. It came with little bread cracker thingys.Invariably (because this always happens everywhere) there was more dip than bread and the waitress cheerfully brought us more. We ate all of it. Every bit and were kind of (politely) fighting over it. Â I could have eaten that all day and not ordered anything else. Next time I go that's actually what I'm going to do. I had champagne with my egg dish. I can't remember what exactly was in the eggs but I think it had spinach and it was baked, I'm sure. It was really, really good. Love it here! downside is getting a table at peak brunch time is kind of annoying but if you wait until 2:30 or 3 it's almost empty and I think they serve brunch until 4.
