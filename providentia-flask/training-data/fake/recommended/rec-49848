I had late lunch here and the gentlemen that was there did not speak any english, we asked what the specials were and he said pad thai and drunken noodles.  After a couple of times of getting the same response, we ordered the pad thai and house salad.  We did not get the salad as likely he did not understand our request.  The pad thai was great, nicely mixture of spice & sweet.  We ate there and the spice mix there was good to get it to one's likely - the red pepper mixture was some strong stuff. In the middle the meal, the owner lady came in and she was very pleasant and helpful and spoke english.  I am definitely going back. If you need to use the restroom while at the restaurant, prepare for an adventure.
