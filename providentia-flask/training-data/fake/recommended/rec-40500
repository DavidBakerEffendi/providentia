I called and ordered the egg biryani, samosa chaat, aloo paratha, rasmalai, and sweet lassi. They delivered in good time but after they left - and I gave a $10 tip as well - I found there were NO utensils. I called and told the Â person who answered the phone that I had no utensils and he didn't really care. There was also no rasmalai. The samosa chaat was ok - soggy but flavor was ok. The aloo paratha was fine, the lassi was fine. The egg biryani good - nothing special.
