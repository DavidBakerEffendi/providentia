I haven't had their pizza so this review is for cheesesteaks only. Here's the thing: Their cheesesteaks aren't bad at all. They're pretty average, not spectacular, but nothing really to complain about. Good enough for drunk food or even a convenient lunch if you live nearby. One thing that's cool is if you order online they have a ton of options for you to choose from if you'd like, such as "ketchup on roll" or "cheese on top" or "cut into 3 pieces", etc. Here's the bad news: Don't bother. Every time I have gotten delivery or carry-out from this place they have totally screwed up our orders (about 3-4 times now). Just the other day we had a very simple order: - 1 cheesesteak with American cheese, extra meat, ketchup and grilled onions - 1 cheesesteak with provolone cheese, grilled onions, pickles, and hot peppers Pretty simple, right? What arrived: - 1 cheesesteak with American cheese, (missing extra meat) , (missing ketchup) and grilled onions - 1 cheesesteak with provolone cheese, grilled onions, (extra meat that should have been on the other cheesesteak), (missing pickles), and (missing hot peppers) Is it really that hard? Is it? And every time my roommate gets carry-out from this place he asks for no onions and they've put onions on it almost every time. Get it together, Fairmount Pizza and Grill. Because it seems like you just don't give a sh*t.
