I love this place...when its not busy and I'm only with 1 other person...and its lunch time... I've been disappointed on more than one occasion when I've gone for dinner. They are considerably busier but they make you wait a lot. The staff are really nice but aren't honest about wait times. I waited out front at 9:30 on a saturday night for 45 minutes (when they said it would be a 20 minute wait) before I left to go somewhere else - they never gave us an update or checked in or said anything. I cant really comment on the food because I'm addicted to pad thai and tom yum soup so i always get that. But both are delicious and you cant beat the lunch special prices and bang for your buck.
