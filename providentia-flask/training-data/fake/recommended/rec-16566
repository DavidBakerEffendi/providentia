i went here for lunch for the uni and fish roe bowl. It's $20 for salad, side dishes like octopus, and soup. It was soo worth it. The uni was very fresh (a lot of it), and everything is very CLEAN and neat. It feels very authentic Japanese. My friend ordered the udon and green tea icecream which was also very good. I would definitely come here again. A bit pricey, so lunch is probably the best bet. We went during off hours like 2pm, and it was quiet, intimate, and great service.
