The pizza at this place is simply amazing.  The wait was over an hour but absolutely worth it.  First, its BYOB...which is awesome.  Their menu is very short (large pizza and two sizes of calzones)  but they use the freshest ingredients for everything.  I also liked how they do everything out in the open for you to see.  Further the staff there is extremely friendly and hospitable and its has a authentic ambiance. If you go there don't forget to get get dipping sauce for your crust.  We got a half cheese and half mushroom / shallot pizza.  I was not expecting the shallots to be to my liking but they complimented the pizza extremely well and I really enjoyed the thinly sliced toppings. I left in a food coma but it was perhaps one of my top 5 dining experiences.  Definitely check it out.
