I am absolutely addicted to this place!! My first time here was 3 weeks ago, and already I've been here 3 times, which is a lot for me.  I live in Queens.  So, once, I actually went to the city just for this place, and right after, went back home feeling VERY happy. When I came here, all three times, it was REALLY crowded, and seating is very limited.  However, there are PLENTY of outdoor seating areas nearby (on Broadway), and so, it didn't really bother me. Here is what I've tried so far, and I love them all: - Bulgogi - Kimchee Fried Rice (my absolute fave) - RicePasta - Spicy Fried Chicken - Tuna Kimbop - Kimchee pancake - Bulgogi/rice wrap I just can't believe how cheap this place is!!  Now my mouth is watering, I may have to make a trip soon.
