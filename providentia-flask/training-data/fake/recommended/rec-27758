went here recently to celebrate my mother's birthday armed with a cheatsheet of yelp review consensus results. the atmosphere here was a bit interesting.  from the outside, I'd guess the restaurant was either a small coffee shop or the entrance of a B&B, but when you walk fully in, it looks more refined fine dining (save the casual window bay pillows) mixed with amazon-esque outdoor seating option.  seating space is plenty, but the overall restaurant is on the small side. food-wise, we all went for the 2 savory + 1 sweet combo and altogether tried the crabcake; wings; short rib; short rib burger; & sea bass.  overall very good, although not ATF levels.  portions were French-style, relatively small, but oddly filling.  (we ended up eating a lot of bread as a result, which was unfortunately a little on the tough side) clear favorite was matisse's longstanding crabcakes (even though we're not particularly huge fans of crabcake), being very flavorful.  the short ribs and sea bass were probably second, with the short ribs being cooked well (good texture, a rarity in american restaurants), and the sea bass, done very well with an overall more subdued flavor. unfortunately, I'm in disagreement with the wing-lovers here, as I found them too sweet,  the same going for the short rib burger my father ordered. desserts were good as well; my bittersweet chocolate tort(?) was the right mix of sweet & dark chocolate bite.  the capuccino was particularly good, as me and my mother are particular with coffee. overall, I would say this is my second favorite NJ restaurant now next to Lorena's in Maplewood.  like the other reviews, it is on the pricey-side, especially with the small portions, but for this class of dining, what do you expect?   stay away from the sweeter main menu items and this restaurant is a keeper, what with the dirth of new jersey fine dining options.
