It's a hidden gem, literary. As I am a vegan and also really wanted to try Ethiopian food, this place stood out. Finding it was a different story. The neighborhood is empty and there is no banner saying the restaurant's name. Anyway, the food; probably the funnest experience I ever had in a restaurant since eating with my hands was the norm. The bread they provided with the platter was a sourdough type soft thingy, pretty delicious. The sauces were a combo of spicy to basic. All of which tasted "exotic." I genuinely loved this place but wouldn't trek all the way out for it again. Definitely worth a try!
