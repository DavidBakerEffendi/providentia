I went in here with high expectations, and though I wasn't disappointed- I wasn't bowled over either. The service was EXCELLENT- attentive waitress, constant water & bread refills, expedient serving. However, the food just wasn't as awesome as I hoped. I had the game hen, another diner had the duck, and another had one of the fish entrees. They were quite tasty, and the food was certainly very high quality- but the portions were small and I'd definitely recommend or ding a couple sides if you're hoping to fill up. For a village restaurant though, it is a decent value $ wise, and it does have a great cushy, high-end, relaxed atmosphere. Overall, A-OK. Bonus at the end- they give you a plate of mini oatmeal cookies!
