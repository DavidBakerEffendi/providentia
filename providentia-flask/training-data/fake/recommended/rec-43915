I visited NY for the weekend, eating out for every meal, and this was by far my favorite spot. The service was a bit slow, but the food made up for it. We started with wine and cocktails, and were all very pleased with the selection as well as their recommendations. For appetizers, we ordered the scallops (on special) and the grilled octopus. The scallops were AMAZING. They came with a sweet potato and asparagus topping - that sounds like an odd combination but it was absolutely delicious! The grilled octopus was not quite as appealing, but it was fine. For my entree, I ordered the steak salad, which was also very good. The salad was seasoned well with the vinagrette, goat cheese, and potatoes, and the steak was cooked a nice medium rare. I was so tempted to order dessert but just didn't have it in me. Next time!
