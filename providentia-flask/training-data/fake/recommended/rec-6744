My husband and I dined at Blue Point Grill on Christmas Eve and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The staff was fantastic, the food excellent and the vibe was festive. The place was hopping when we were there but we never felt rushed.  We will definitely return. Be sure to BYOB and make a reservation.
