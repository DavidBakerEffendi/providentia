Run. To this place. We went here just last night and the host was great at accommodating our stroller for our young baby. Decor: swanky industrial. Very warm, good musicand not normal Wburg which was a nice thing ! Service was fantastic. Though the resto wasn't half full on a Thurs night the hostess, waitress and busboy staff was fantastic. Really makes a difference. Now on to the food. Our group of 4 decided on doing the tasting menu and stated we were "moderately adventurous". We don't even remember how many courses came out but it was almost probably 10 ! The chef chooses dishes based on your adventure level and he did not disappoint. Our favorites - chicken liver sopes, Brussel sprouts, shrimp tostadas, it was endless! And at 45 a person this place is a steal! We will be back!
