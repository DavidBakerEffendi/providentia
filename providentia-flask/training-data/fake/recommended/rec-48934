This place is so good. I went on Saturday around 8 and the wait time was around 10mins which is convenient because you can figure out what your going to order in that time. There drinks are really really good and strong but so tasty. I ordered the steak and collard greens which were so delicious like the fact I ate collard greens means it was amazing. The customer service was excellent and very quick. The lighting is pretty dim. They had sinks outside the bathroom which were really cute and they used natural soap which I appreciated. Overall this place is fantastic! Perfect date restaurant.
