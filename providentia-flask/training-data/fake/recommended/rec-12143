Had lunch here on 7/12.  The signature chicken dish was extremely good.  It was very flavorful, skin was crispy (for the most part) and meat was very juicy. The roast potatoes we good, but I wouldn't get them again.  They felt more like deep fried rather than what I am used to as roasted. Had a glass of their Pinot Noir with the chicken, great fit. Come, eat, enjoy, its that simple.
