I was worried about stopping to eat at this place after all the negative reviews I read about this place. But I was hungry and the big sign with the image of succulent, juicy pastrami sandwich lured me to give them I try. I was served very quickly since there was no one at the line. My food was prepared quickly and both persons working at the time were friendly. I got my sandwich and man it was Hot!! Not a bad thing at all! The cheese melting and the soft pastrami with the mustard made a harmonious combination! I do have to say that there was this one bite that was extremely salty since the added like 3 slices of pickles right next to each other. Besides that the sandwich was good and I was a happy flyer!
