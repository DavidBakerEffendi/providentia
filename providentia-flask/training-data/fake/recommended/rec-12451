To all the people working in the World Financial Center or near this building...you lucky bastards, you. Finally opened and I'm in love. It's a food-court/cafeteria-like area elevated to marble-tables, sleek black trays, fancy typography level. Everything is pleasing to the eye.... -and the stomach? The stomach likes. So many choices- Umami Burger, Dig Inn, Mighty Quinns, Sprinkles cupcakes, Num pang sandwiches, ugh... where to begin? Most have opened but some will be opening later on in the week (Umami's looking to open Wednesday or Thursday....I know, I was the chump who went today thinking it had already opened). Most of the places also offer bottled beer and beer on tap. The people who dine here are mostly corporate types- people who work close-by and their friends/families who come to "visit" (but more likely was baited by the food...ahem: me.) Prices hit in the teens... everything looks gorgeous, delicious, and healthy. Even the unhealthy stuff looks healthy (Hi Sprinkles!). Come with empty stomachs and full wallets and let the fun begin!
