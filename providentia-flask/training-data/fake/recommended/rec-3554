I'm giving Rye's Meatloaf Sandwich the #7 spot on the "Best Sandwiches I've Ever Had" list. Go to Rye and order it because: -The meatloaf sandwich is not only the most popular item (I think) but one of the least expensive on the menu at $16. Other entrees around $28 -The sandwich has been featured on a few of the Travel Channel/Food Network shows for it's awesomeness. And it's fun to see a meal on TV and then go get that meal. Right? Go ahead and youtube the Meatloaf Sandwich at Rye, you'll like what you see.
