WELCOME TO VEGAS?? Well not quite but you know what I mean. Bright lights, shining neon signs, pictures of "famous" people all over.....yeah that's Geno's. Not gonna lie, cheesesteaks are kinda expensive!! Coming from a land of $1, $2 tacos, a $10 cheesesteak is pricey. I've been here once before but came with Jay C. to do the official test. I guess it's not fair that we tried Pat's first, but the main difference between the two for me was the bread. The bread at Geno's felt stale and did not hold up very well. The meat also was OK, but Pat's was much juicier. Plenty of seats and extra bright lights, almost uncomfortably bright at night. All in all I would take Pat's over Geno's. Â I've made my decision... what's yours? -- Parking: Nonexistent. Streets are packed with cars and did not see a single open space. Suggest cabbing it here if you are a tourist.
