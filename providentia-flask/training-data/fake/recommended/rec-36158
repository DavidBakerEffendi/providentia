Casa Mono, what's with the school desk-style tables? I'm well aware I have large thighs, but even the skinniest gal at our table couldn't squeeze her legs completely underneath. We all had to sit side-saddle to be somewhat comfortable. Obviously, not a deal breaker, just sayin'. Read on. If you're deciding where to drop some bones on a meal in NYC, make this place one of them. Also, make sure you go with people you love. Part of the experience is sharing everything, so if you're not comfortable taking turns biting into a slippery stuffed pepper, you won't get the full experience. It's another place where servings are small and pricey(the whole "tapas-style" craze taking over the world), but I'm okay with small and pricey if it packs a delicious punch. And indeed they do. Between four of us, we were lucky enough to try what felt like half the menu; rabbit three ways, fried oysters, razor clams, oxtail stuffed peppers, foie gras, scallops, paella and more. The rabbit was a stand out and came in fried nuggets, skewered, and wing-style (those are all legit culinary terms) on top of a habanero cream sauce that had the sneakiest kick ever - a perfect compliment to the gamey rabbit (in a good way). I could ramble on about the food and make you start drooling right now, but what rounds out the culinary bliss here is the service. I was so impressed by our girl, who had to be super young, but knew the menu like the back of her hand and graciously welcomed our entry-level dining questions. She recommended a delicious and affordable wine and checked on us only at the most appropriate times - we were four best friends catching up, it's not an easy task. Casa Mono stays at the top of my list!
