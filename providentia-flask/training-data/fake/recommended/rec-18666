1) This is NYC, I ain't walking that far from any subway to eat just so these mother fuckers can save money on rent 2) When i sat down the server asked me "do you want to order everything you saw on the show?", I'm like "bitch what show?" And most important, 3) Although the food was fine I don't recall ordering a sodomy! This junk was crazy overpriced (especially considering you're buying off-cuts like pork neck) Overall, I'd rather lick a homeless man's back in the lower east side before going back to this joint
