BANH MI THIT NGUOI:  FOUR STARS I believe Cafe Cuong makes the best banh mi in Philly so far.  I've tried QT's and Ba Le, among other places and haven't quite enjoyed the banh mis much after the fifth or sixth visit. The boyfriend and I have had the banh mi thit nguoi here and it has been consistently delicious each time.  My boyfriend is even totally tempted to 'buy 10, get 1 free,' the deal that Cafe Cuong offers. Also, I suggest fellow Yelpers to call ahead and order - that way, you don't have to wait, but more importantly to make sure they're open (as they were closed at random days and times a few months ago).
