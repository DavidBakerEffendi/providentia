Their juices are great! I've tried all of them, and the cucumber is my favorite- super refreshing and surprisingly tasty. I ordered a huge cookie as well (perfect- tasted great w/o being too crunchy or too soft) and the other pastries look amazing. Lastly, the staff was helpful and friendly. I'll definitely have to do some more sampling on my next visit.
