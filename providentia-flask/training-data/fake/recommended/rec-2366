DiNic's voted Best Sandwich in America????  Okay Travel Channel I can agree with you.  It is up to par.  There are several Roast Pork destinations in the city, but for convenience DiNic's has it.   I go with the Roast Pork with Sharp Provo and Spinach... There can be a long line but that juicy dripping pork is totally worth the wait!
