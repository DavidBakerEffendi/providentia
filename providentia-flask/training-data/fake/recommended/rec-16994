The fried chicken was simply put...the BEST I've EVER had!!! The local catch was HORRIBLE!!!! It tasted disgusting and repulsive. As if it should have been taken out with the trash 3 days prior to my arrival. I arrived with my daughter and her boyfriend as they were preparing to open. The staff was very friendly and inviting. Since this was our second time dining there, we were very excited. We were going to try something new. I needed to use the bathroom while we waited for our meals to arrive. I did get something new. The bathroom reeked of old urine. I almost gagged! I looked around the perimeter of the toilet, and it looked as if it hadn't been cleaned for at least 2 weeks. The smell was atrocious!!! It was not like this the first time I visited Root & Bone. They need to re-group!!!!!!
