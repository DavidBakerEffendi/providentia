First stop after arriving in NY and dropping off my luggage was to head to the Halal Guys. Since my flight arrived at night it was perfect timing because they don't open until 7pm. The line was pretty long when I got there with my friend, but it moves fairly quickly. I got the mixed chicken & gyro plate and smothered it with white sauce and some hot sauce. Boy was it delicious. The meat is so tender and flavorful and they give you so much food for only $6, which is a bargain. Just remember that the sauces are located on the side of the cart after you pick up your plate and that the hot sauce is in the rack in the top right corner. You don't need too much of it, since it's pretty spicy. The non-white sauce bottle located in the larger rack is actually BBQ sauce. How do I know? I put some on my plate before I realized it wasn't the hot sauce, d'oh! And remember it's cash only.
