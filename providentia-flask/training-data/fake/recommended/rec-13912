Hands down this is my favorite brunch spot in NYC! I keep trying others trying to see if anything comes close, but so far no one can take Clinton's place. The first time I went I got the banana pancakes.  I don't know what inspired me to get them because I'm not a big fan of banana flavored foods, but for some reason these are prefection! Perhaps it's because of the fluffiness or the accompanying crack syrup that's so addictive. I get a side of bacon and OJ, and I'm good to go. I've never had their coffee, but my mother embarrassingly gushed over it during her first visit saying it was the best she's had in her life, and nearly drank an entire pot on her own! Everytime someone visits me from out of town we go to Clinton St. to the point that when repeat visits to New York are made, my guests all request to come back. I always preface the first timers with "we may have to wait 2+ hours even if we get in line before it opens," but I've polled them post-meal and they have ALL agreed that it's well worth it and keep coming back for more. A couple examples of good customer service: once after giving my name and coming back to check after an hour, the hostess failed to write it down even though she remembered me telling her. she profusely apologized and got us seated immediately; another time  my cousin brought her young children and they provided complimentary sliced bananas while we waited for our orders; finally, our orders for a party of 2-4 (can't remember exactly) were taking unusually long so they brought out complimentary fried green tomatoes. Definitely go and don't be daunted by the wait. Sometimes I even eat a pre-brunch snack at home knowing that I have a long wait ahead of me. You can always go across the street for a coffee too while you wait. They are very nice over there and the cappuccinos are delicious! Overall, I've only docked one star because they don't take credit cards - a HUGE pet peeve of mine in the 21st century, but other than that it's great!
