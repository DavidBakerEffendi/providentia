I went to Perilla in a party of 5 to celebrate my birthday and everyone was very pleased with the restaurant: food was amazing (the farro risotto is one of those unforgettable dishes... it's been almost an year since I was there, and I still remember the flavor, the different texture...), service was extremely attentive.
