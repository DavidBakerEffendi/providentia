My wife and I had a couple great meals here on our recent visit to Philadelphia. They had a newer menu than shows up on their website. I had the scallops ... wonderfully seasoned with raisins, capers, and it had on excellent flavor. My wife had the salmon .... which was a large piece of salmon, cooked perfectly, nice and tender. As an appetizer, we ordered the hummus. That was some of the best hummus I've ever had ... highly recommend it. And to top it off, they actually had Dogfish Head 90 min IPA on tap! We came back for brunch the next day, it was a very good meal. I did have one of their Bloody Marys. Great flavor, just too spicy (hot) for my taste. (And I typically like a nice spicy salsa). I would have given McCrossen's five stars in absence of that ... since Yelp doesn't have half point deductions ... four stars it is.
