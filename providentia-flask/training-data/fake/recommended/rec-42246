Kiwiana was our choice for Dine in Brooklyn this year. My husband and I never ventured into New Zealand cuisine, so we really looked forward to the dinner. It did not disappoint. I had a butternut squash soup, which was creamy and light, and my husband had a mixed greens salad, and found the dressing to be superb. I had the Marmite and Manuka braised ribs for an entree and they were some of the best pieces of meat I ever had. Tender and with an interesting "kick" to them. I wish there was a bit more of squash puree that accompanied the meat - it was also very good! My husband had the roasted Atlantic salmon which was served with with grilled brussels sprouts, apples and bacon mix. It was a very interesting dish to say the least. For dessert, we had rasberry lammington and caramel pudding and they were both very delicious. However, I was a bit disappointed that the signature dessert - Pavlova - was not offered. We will definitely be back at Kiwiana! It's a small restaurant with a homey feel and great tasting food. What's not to love?!
