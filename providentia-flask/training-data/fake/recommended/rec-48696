I fondly call this place the "Capital of Hippie Food".  Meals here are inextricably linked to a long chain of Vermont-special memories.  One of the owners used to make delicious little tofu cubes at the Onion River Co-op about 15 years ago. He's still making those lovely tofu squares you will find them at Stone Soup. You never know what you are going to find on the hot bar, because they change the menu every day to take advantage of what's fresh, good or just inspired.  I've found every dish to be delicious and as a vegetarian who loves dairy, it's great to see options for all eaters. Had an amazing plate yesterday with cheesy millet, a vegan casserole a creamy tofu stew and that great old standby, steamed kale.  The toppings are all there - brewers yeast, local hot sauce, braggs amino acids, gomasio, etc.  The Ceylon Tea/Lemonade blend added a nice slightly sweet drink treat to the meal. You might not find any of these dishes here - but whatever you do have, it's likely to be well prepared, well seasoned and good for you. I'm not a huge fan of eating healthy for the sake of eating healthy.  Flavor and a nod to the sense of the pleasure of eating are equally (if not more) important. Yes, it's a bit pricey  - but anyone who shops healthy in a decent market should understand that freshness and quality don't come cheaply.  If you're looking for a cheap meal, go to Olive Garden.  If you want quality, freshness, bright flavors and food that nourishes you, head on over to Stone Soup. Stone Soup is a unique treasure that should be visited by anyone who appreciates good home cooked food in a casual setting.  I'm happy it's still around. And lastly, THANKS to you guys for hanging in there all these years and still producing food you can be proud of and the Burlington community can continue to enjoy.
