Excellent.  Nice selection of wine.  Loved the cockles, the chicken livers, fried chickpeas.  Octopus salad was also good.  Piquillo peppers stuffed with tuna average.  The deep fried flan with flat cherries was a stinker.  Big lumps of dense blandness.  Skimpy cherries that add no splash of luxury, or joy. We discovered this gem when we finished walking the High Line.  We were browsing, and the friendly waitress/hostess waved us in.  Sat at the bar.  It is very narrow. Wish they had roast suckling pig.  They need more non seafood protein options besides lamb, jamon, and tongue.
