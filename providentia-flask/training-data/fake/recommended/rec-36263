This is Robert De Niro's restaurant and it is very hard to get a reservation, so make sure you call in and book far in advance!  Love the interior of the restaurant for a relaxed place to grab a drink or meal, and you can dress up or casual for this local neighborhood tavern vibe.  Service here is just average. My favorite steak tartar in NYC, the truffle definitely makes it!  I've come here for lunch and dinner, and the food always tastes great.  You can't go wrong with any dish, but definitely try the sheep's milk ricotta crostini to start.  I never order chicken as an entrée when dining out, but the roast chicken here is perfectly cooked and seasoned for a satisfying lunch.  Pastas here are solid but not memorable. I recommend the pork entrée here for dinner.  Dessert is always spot on, so save room.
