A few complaints: Food is so fresh and delicious, that I couldn't stop eating! Ordered chakapuly, khachapuri, elarji and kartuli salad. Really wish I ALSO ordered khinkali, soko and satsivi! (Just couldn't handle any more!!!) Dessert was probably THE BEST Georgian Napoleon i've ever tasted! I ate so much that I have to do the triple time on a treadmill tomorrow! Wine???? OMG! Stop! Service.... 5 STARS! Owners.... THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FINALLY OPENING A GEORGIAN HOTSPOT THAT IS CLASSY, DELICIOUS AND ... Did I mention the LOCATION?
