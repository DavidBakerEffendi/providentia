Perhaps I can't appreciate how authentic this food actually is, but I still think I should have been able to enjoy it.  I got the beef brisket soup and my fiancée got the roasted duck soup, both with shaved noodles.  The brisket was quite tender, but there was more fat and tendon than meat.  The roasted duck was almost impossible to eat because of all the bones.  The broth was good and the shaved noodles were decent albeit a bit doughy.  We opted for the shaved noodles because the "hand drawn" noodles looked like they came from a box.  My biggest issue was all of the shoots/stalks of greens in the soup.  They were bitter and acrid like crabgrass or something, making mouthfuls laden with greens impossible to enjoy.
