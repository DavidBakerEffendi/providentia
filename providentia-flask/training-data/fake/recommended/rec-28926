Went there with a large group - reservations were a snap in advance. Decor is very nice. It's located on a main street so good amount of street parking (esp. since it's not Center City). I went for brunch. Great combos of having exactly that -- lunch and breakfast. I always get confused when I go to many brunch spots and I have to choose between lunch or breakfast, but here I could have both b/c the entree's seem to be created that way. The food was fresh. And tasty!! There were 9 of us gals. We all enjoyed our food (each of us got something different, sorry I can't remember it all, I should have wrote this review right away), one of my friends placed an order to take home for her husband b/c she liked it so much. It's not a huge spot, but it's not tiny spot either. If you are going on Sunday for brunch, you should probably make reservations to be safe.
