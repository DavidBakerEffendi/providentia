Couldn't help but notice this place as it seems large crowds have started to gather outside almost every night waiting for tables. Managed to go in with some friends one night and was able to try it for myself. On the whole, the food was good but very strange. I ordered three of the tacos. All three of them were delicious. The verduras taco is a unique blend of veggies. The avocado one was chock-full of avocado, which was awesome. The chicken one was also good, especially for such blase fare. On the other hand, one of the other diners in my party ordered quesadillas. The quesadillas were very strange (and came out after some delay while we had all started eating). They were actually more like empanadas and only had cheese sprinkled on top instead of inside the tortilla...which was a fried corn tortilla instead of the traditional flour. It wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't what we expected.
