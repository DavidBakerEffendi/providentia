This classy restaurant seems like a good place to bring clients or a date.  Everything is well seasoned and you can get by ordering many appetizers or splurge on a main course.  The drinks were all amazing, so I would recommend them highly.   We ordered the Brussels sprouts, falafel, fries, shrimp and hummus.  The lovely pita pillows were warm and light, unlike heavy pitas I have had in the past.  Brussel sprouts were DOUSED in dressing.  It was simply too much sauce, so I find it hard to rave about them like most other reviewers.  The walnuts and grapes did make it a very interesting dish I'l like to try again without all of the sweet dressing.  The falafel was square, which made it crunchier than most versions I have had, but I can't really say it was mind-blowing like the tahini sauce it was paired with.  Fries were sprinkled with a delicious seasoning and came with a garlic dip (which was very good and didn't leave us grabbing for mints/gum).  Hummus was amazing, obviously. Service was a bit uncomfortable, pushing us to order additional small plates since we weren't planning on ordering main courses.  Another weird thing was removing the plates while we were still picking at them.   I would come back, but to enjoy their half price cocktails and small plates at the bar. NOTE: Their happy hour prices are only reflected at the bar and lounge (which has very low, awkward seating for eating.)
