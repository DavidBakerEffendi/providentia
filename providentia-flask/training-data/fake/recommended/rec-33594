Cocktail: Behind the Knees Appetizer: Mac and Cheese Entree: Roasted Half Chicken Dessert: Some sort of peanut butter and devil's cake concoction I never write reviews, but I absolutely loved my meal at Jack the Horse Tavern. My husband and I went on a random date night and being that we wanted to be near the promenade to walk to after, we decided to try this place out. The Mac and Cheese was the best I have eaten in a very long time. The cheese was smooth and the crumbs added the perfect crunchy balance. Left you wanting more.. I'm craving it as we speak! The chicken dish was delicious, moist and not overcooked.. the flavors were simple and not overly done. Perfection. The dessert was a great end. We love peanut butter so the combination of peanut butter with devil's cake was great and a wonderful exclamation point to a good meal. I love girlie cocktails so the Behind the Knees drink was an awesome partner to a wonderful meal. If you haven't tried this place yet, DO IT. You won't regret it. (Do note, PARKING sucks around that area!!)
