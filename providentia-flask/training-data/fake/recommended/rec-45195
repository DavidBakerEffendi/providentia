This is one of my favorites!  I have been going to Kafe Neo since it opened.   i can say they have had their ups and downs along the way due to the quick growth in business,however, it is an amazing place!  The food, the service, the cleanliness of the place, etc.  (I can go on and on) are just perfect.   I love going there with my friends and family.  Our office Christmas get together was just what I expected.  Food and service were spot on as usual.  Also, I swear that their Jasmine Pearl green tea keeps me healthy.  Thanks for a job well done!
