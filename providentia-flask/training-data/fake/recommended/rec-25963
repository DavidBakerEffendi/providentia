Really disappointed by the service here.  I ordered a virgin coconut drink that is usually alcoholic.  I have never, anywhere been charged full price for a virgin drink (almost ten bucks for some coconut milk and sugar).  We thought this was a mistake so we pointed it out to our server who told us that it is what is rather shortly.  I will not be returning.  NOt to mention mediocre choices for a vegetarian.
