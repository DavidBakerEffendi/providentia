Drinks are tasty and refreshing. I posted a few pics (9 dishes my 3 friends and I had in ONE visit LOL)... definitely good flavors and colorful display... if you're not that hungry this will hit the spot. But if you're definitely willing to explore the menu their selections are not disappointing. However, the matzoh ball plate is kindy salty for my taste. Either way.. Dessert hit my sweet tooth!!!!!! Sooo freakin delicious! Â Try the Sticky toffee pudding and the Brownie !!!! ;) Chef Illan Hall did a great job with the menus! Kudos!!! ;)
