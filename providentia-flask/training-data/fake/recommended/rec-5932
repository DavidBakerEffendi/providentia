So seriously, I am just going to rent space in that back booth and move in, because it's officially official - this is my favorite place in the entire city of Philadelphia. I've now come here for the food (lasagna...yum...I think they put nutmeg in it!), the beer (great selection, always makes me happy), shows (The Kills and The Ting Tings, and they both blew me away - I prefer the balcony view but the floor is just dandy, too), the people (I almost always see someone I know here and it's been the home of a fun UYE) and as of yesterday, I plugged my computer in at a table and did some work there. So they have taken care of all of my social, business and nutritional needs. And yes, beer belongs in all of those categories. Just sayin'. Oh yeah -their staff is awesome, and those bathrooms are super clean. Hurrah for Johnny Brenda's. I would be much sadder if it didn't exist. And nobody wants that, right?
