The best Thai I've had in Connecticut. Â It's an intimate setting where you can hear the workers chopping vegetables for the delicious, fresh meals. Their Thai salad and tom yum soup is delicious. The pad thai is the best i've ever had and I don't if it will ever be topped. A great little hidden gem.
