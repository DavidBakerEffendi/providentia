So in actuality, I want to rate them a 3.5 but I figured I would just round it up. If I had written this review a few months ago, it probably would've been a five star review, but after having it today I was a little disappointed. The selection of food on the buffet line seems to have decreased. But more importantly some of the food was just cold. It not like woorijip to offer anything but the best. I will say they have a few things on the menu that you can never go wrong with: the kimchi fried rice and the glass noodles. My 2 favorite items on their buffet menu. Can't get enough of them. Great for vegetarians or people looking for a great lunch option under 10 bucks. I will keep going because I love this place, but I'm hoping what I experienced today is a one time occurrence.
