Great ambiance, BYOB, great friendly service, okay food.   Overall Rating 3.5 Went here for dinner on a weeknight. We had the Fresh Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Soft Shell Crab Tempura with mixed mushrooms, Izumi rolls, Chirashi. The best dish was the Uni. It was served in the Sea Urchin Shell. It does taste fresh eventhough, the Uni is not open/prepared to order. I was told the chef, cleans it beforehand and served to order. (4.75 out of 5) The Sweet Shrimp Nigiri was okay, nothing wow...maybe because the rice was a little too hard and sour to my tasting. You get the fried shrimp heads too (3.5 out of 5) Soft Shell Crab Tempura breading was a little too thick for my tasting; pairing it with mixed mushroom was an interesting touch. It's different. It doesn't harmonize well the soft shell crab. I can see it, the mushroom as a separate side dish/appetizer because it has its own distinct taste. It's good alone. (3 out of 5 as a combo.  However separately; the crab was a 2.25 out of 5, the mushroom was a 3.75 out of 5) Izumi rolls - It's a little too small for the price. Not sure if that combo works well with each other. Note: I'm bias when it comes to Sushi roll. I'm more of a purist when it's sushi. (2.5 out of 5) Chirashi - Not worth it, as I said before, the rice was too hard and sour for my taste. The little thin cuts of fish weren't really good/fresh. It also lacks presentation. It's just pieces of fish lay on top of rice. Yes, a Chirashi by definition are "pieces of fish lay on top of rice", but normally it's better placed with some artist flare. Izumi's Chirashi are just placed on top.  (2.5 out of 5)
