So, my girlfriends took me out for a pre-bday bar hop and I didn't want to leave this spot. I had so much fun at this bar. The music, ambiance, and drinks were great. We selected the Vegetable Spring Rolls with Sweet Chile Sauce as our appetizer, and I ordered a Blood Orange Margarita. My friends are beer drinkers, which they enjoyed the drinks On Tap. The art decor is amazing, and any man would enjoy the beautiful, nude women plastered on their walls. The bar maid was very accommodating and patient with my friends that wanted to sample the ales. I can't wait to go back to have a meal, and a couple more Blood Orange Margaritas;-)
