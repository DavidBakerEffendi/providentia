Went for RW with 5 other people.  I was impressed with the size of the place - much bigger than I thought it would be.  The music was good, the staff was friendly.  I was surprised to see 2 security guards in suits there - I guess it gets rowdy later on? The apps were great - we got everything and shared everything, and were very happy.  I got the braised beef entree, and it was very good.  For desert, I got the cheesecake.  It was tasty as well. I guess my only issues were the temperature - they had the AC on and it was 20 degrees outside.  Also, the restroom doors are kind of see-through, and it's a unisex restroom, so kind of strange seeing people pull their pants down and sit on the toilet, especially with the porter sitting right outside.  I guess he's used to it. Other than that, great experience!
