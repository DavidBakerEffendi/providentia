Pulled pork that is tender and juicy-there's no need to add sauce. Buffalo wings that are meaty and spicy-once again, I wouldn't change a thing. It's been too long since I've visited the Brooklyn Ice House, but I think a trip to Red Hook is long overdue to sample your delicious delights accompanied by one of your local microbrews on tap.
