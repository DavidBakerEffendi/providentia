In my six days in NYC, I dined twice at Hu Kitchen. This place has something for . Omnis, Veges, Vegans, Raw foodists.. I LOVE the fact that the store is passionate about food and making an effort to change the way we eat. Yes, it isn't cheap, but the cost of organic meat never is never going to be lower than the non-organic version. I think Hu Kitchen charges a fair price for what they have to offer. Try making your own grain free, gluten free bread and you'll get a sense of how good a job they do. I had the Gradmaster Veg with Cauliflower mash - SO delicious. Grandmaster Veg - like a lasagne but with vegetables, marinara sauce and a cashew cream on top - delicious and doesn't sit like a rock in your stomach Cauliflower mash - I don't know how they make it so smooth but it is really silky and coconut flavored. recommended. I also tried the chocolate chunk cookie which literally had lots of chocolate CHUNKS. Crumbly and rich. My only quibble with the place is that the music is louder than most restaurants there - probably due to the acoustics. So it might not be a place for a romantic date or business meeting. Nonetheless, they still get 5 stars from me.
