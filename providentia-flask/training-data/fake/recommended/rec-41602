I love that this place popped up in my neighborhood. Plus One for Beerz: they have a great selection and I like that they have the "coming soon" section on the beer menu so you can get excited about the upcoming taps. Plus One for Foodz: the nachos are good. the rueben is to die for. they have poutine!i didn't really like the oyster po' boy that much... it wasn't fried goodness the way I wanted it to be. Plus One for Atmosphere: Christmastime decorations are so cozy and warm and happy-making! In summer/early fall, it's nice to sit out back. Plus One for Service: The last time I was there,the waitress remembered me by my tattoo. Ha! But seriously, they're classy. Those Cambridge people.
