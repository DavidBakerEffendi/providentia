Lets get the bad out of the way first... If you don't want to blow $30-$40 per person on Brunch go to IHOP.  The good news is that this place is GREAT!  Crapes, Crapes, and more delicious Crapes.  Get a table outside and it feels like your back in Paris or on the Damrak.  Their breakfast cocktails will leave you feeling like right where you left off the night before.  I am preferential to the Bloody Mary's.  They will put hair on your chest in the best possible way.  Ok... Beau Monde isn't all that expensive, it think its just that when I indulge in their brunch I go all out.  And yes, its worth it!
