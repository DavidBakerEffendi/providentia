I think they lost their chef or something because last night we were served one of the worst meals.  The artichoke in the Roasted Artichoke appetizer was totally inedible, as in they used parts that you can't eat.  The Sea Bass was cooked fine but covered in what seemed like grocery store guacamole and pureed salsa from a can.  The steak au poivre was incredibly chewy and it and the fries were swimming in a red wine sauce...the table next to us complained about their dish, and was offered a complementary drink that was never delivered.  For the price of these dishes you would expect more.
