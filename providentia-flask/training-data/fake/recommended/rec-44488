very good thai food, pretty darn cheap good food for NYC! Chicken pad thai was great. Â (ask for the sun dried shrimp.. look at the bottom of the menu on one of the pages. if you ask for it, they add it to your pad thai for free!) drunken noodles were good too. service was better this day than last time. last time I was here, i got the Room Service Pad Thai.. it's like regular pad thai wrapped in a large fried egg. While it was good, i don't know if it was worth the extra price. Good unique experience on pad thai, but i wouldn't get it twice. service was a bit slow the last time, but the place was pretty packed. if you want good thai food in NYC, definitely recommend this place.
