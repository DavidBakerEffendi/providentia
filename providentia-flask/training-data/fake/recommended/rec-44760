Stopped in for lunch right around 12:15 on a Thursday. Had just a 15 minute wait. When you walk in the staff and cooks greet you very loudly :) We were seated at a communal table at the end. We started with the shishito- spicy peppers with a citrus sea salt- these were excellent! Just the right amount of spice. We ordered the karaka ramen (spicy ramen) and the miso ramen. Both were sooo good- even till the last drop! I would definitely come back on our next trip, which we were in NYC longer so we could have gone again and tried other items on the menu- everything looked delicious.
