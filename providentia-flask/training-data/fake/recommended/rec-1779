It was pretty exciting to see this place open up in the neighborhood. It's clean, the decor is nice, and it offers some unique fare. We had 2 pizzas: - The gorgonzola, walnut, pancetta, red onion pizza was very good. It was one of the specials of the day and the gorgonzola really perked up the dish, while the pancetta and red onion added a depth of flavor and savoriness. - The mushroom pizza was also pretty good, although I preferred the first over the latter. There were several types of mushrooms on the pie, and it was really good although it seemed to be lacking something... maybe truffle? Haha. Anyway, the crust is crispy and bready, and perhaps a little wider on the outside than I personally prefer (I just like the toppings to go as far out as possible). It was also a bit oversalted. Overall, cute place, good ambience, happy that it's here!
