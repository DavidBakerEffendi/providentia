We went for a weekend lunch. The atmosphere was easy and pleasant. It's nice to be able to hear each other in a restaurant w/o the music blaring. Unfortunately the food was mediocre. It was a hit w our 4 year old who really liked his fries and chicken fingers. I had a cold steak sandwich with overlooked Caramelized onions. Dumping some hot sauce helped but I left 1/2 the sandwich untouched. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich which was also uninspiring. Â It's a peculiar restaurant that doesn't do French or Mexican well.
