I tried coming here a few times on the weekend and never caught them open, so I was beginning to wonder if the had shut down! Turns out they are open mostly 7 am - 5 pm and I work until 6 pm, so that explains that. Once inside, the place still looks like it's closed down, it's dark and kind of grim inside compared to other bakeries, but I guess it's because the name itself holds a lot of weight in these areas. Apparently the big deal to buy here is bread, but I came for a cupcake, coffee and an apple pastry. The first thing I noticed is that my entire order was only $6! Then the apple pastry was the size of my head! Since I was really not supposed to be eating ANY pastries, I cut a corner and took a bite of the flaky dough and perfect filling. You could tell it was made fresh and with love because the filling was not overly sweet or mushy. My coffee was nice and strong and more importantly the service was very friendly. The lady behind the counter even knew the name of a few guys coming in to get coffee. At first glance I thought this place was going to be a 1 star, but I'm so glad I came in and tried it out. Hopefully I can get here early enough to try out other stuff. I am so excited that there is a good bakery a few blocks from my house....this could be dangerous.
