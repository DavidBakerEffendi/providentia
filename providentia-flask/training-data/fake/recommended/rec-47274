Apart from the soft-boiled instead of poached eggs, we had a good brunch there, at a good price -- eggs dish + juice + tea/coffee for $15,50 --, which would deserve a 3 or 4-star rate, but the service was so poor that I can only give them 2 stars. I really felt like in Paris... but in the wrong way: I could tell our waiter was French only because of his attitude (and I'm French too!), unfriendly and barely polite. Not sure I would come back, I would rather go to any other place with a nice and considerate staff, as I'm used to in NY.
