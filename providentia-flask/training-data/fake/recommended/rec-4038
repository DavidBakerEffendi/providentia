Extra yummy brunch on (drink + meal for $14) had some of the Cod Hash (omg, how have I never had this before) and there breakfast burrito (what an amazing red sauce) - this place is a little tight so be prepared for a wait. But its one of those spots where its worth it. Everything they serve is based on what ingredients they can get, so sometimes the choices vary.
