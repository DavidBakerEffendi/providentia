What a great, cutely adorned location for warming up from the winter cold, catching up with old friends over a cup o'joe and some twists on some breakfast favorites~ The decour in here is very cozy, warm.. something so different from the busy streets that you escape from once you step through the doors of Penelope. The waiters were so friendly, I felt so at home and welcome. In terms of the actual meal... my friend and I enjoyed the "Punkin' Waffles" and "Nutella French Toast." The Punkin Waffles came with a side of warm, apple-pie filling YUM.. which was quite a good combo when eaten with a bite of pumpkin waffle. The Nutella French Toast could've come a little more nutella-y, but the french toast was so fluffy and fried so nicely along the edges.. . so delicious. Not to mention, the french toast comes with a side of fruit, so refreshing :) My friend and I didn't opt for this, but I was definitely intrigued by the Apple Cider Mimosa and Pomegranate Bellini, two drink choices (other than coffee/tea) that you can choose to go with your brunch, as part of the Prix-Fixe option. Will definitely have to try those drinks, sometime! In terms of the wait: Party of 2, got their around 10:30am on a Saturday, got seated after 35 minutes.
