Started with calamari and tuna/salmon tartare. The salmon was much better than the tuna, but the tuna was not bad. The calamari was alright except for the dipping sauce. It says it comes with marinara but its more like some soupy red sauce that doesnt have much flavor and is very watery. The waitress recommended the lobster roll, so I got that. I was expecting some big roll stuffed full. I was wrong. Imagine a slice of bread folded in half with a bit of lobster stuffing in it. It took about 4 bites to eat it. There was half a head of lettuce they include with it which would entirely dwarf the roll if Id used it all. The fries were the best part of the meal, very good. Unfortunately, I did not come for fries.
