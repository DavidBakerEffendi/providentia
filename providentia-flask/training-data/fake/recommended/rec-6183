Its a shame when the food is amazing, but there service is horrendous.  When the hostess passed us up twice for having a party of. 3, and four people walk (one with reservation and another was a walk in) and we are standing in front of a table for four that wasn't reserved, that is insulting.  Even better is when our waiter is outside typing away on his phone (apparently our order is not important). If you can stomach rude behavior from the staff, the food is amazing.
