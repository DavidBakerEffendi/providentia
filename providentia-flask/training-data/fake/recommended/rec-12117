Had dinner there on a Saturday night - 6 people and a LARGE check. Food was respectable (wine pours were minuscule) but this was likely the slowest service I have EVER seen at a "respectable" restaurant. It took over three hours to eat our three courses. No one provided any explanation, despite our asking. Â To top the night off, the place they referred us to for parking claiming they would provide a discount (Park America) di not honor their stamp.
