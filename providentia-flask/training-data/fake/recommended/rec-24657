The food is good.  The Bo Ssam is really good - and the oysters and all the sides that go with are really delicious.  We did the bo ssam lunch - the oysters, the greens and the delicious pancake and bacon birthday cake was DEEEELICIOUS. We went for lunch - a large group of people 16 and the service was WONDERFUL.  Right from the beginning, when I was trying to organize the group -all the bad things restaurants do to you when you imagine organizing a meal for this size group - were non existent.  They were helpful, pleasant - and that translated to the service that day. I would highly recommend!
