Loved it!  Came here with a group of 10 before we saw Rock of Ages and had great appetizers, great wine and great food.  We split a meat plate, a cheese plate and the Classico Antipasto (which was amazing) and for my meal I had the Farfalle Primavera and loved it. Sooo good!  I would come back here in a heartbeat if we come back to NYC!
