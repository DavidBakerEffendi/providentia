I had the whiskey burger w bacon and cheese. It was cool, not to die for and definetly not better than the truffle kobe burger from Sketch. The smores milk shake was like diabetes in a cup.vIt was just so unbelievably sweet. The specialty burger may be worth the hype (didnt try it) but overall wasnt impressed.
