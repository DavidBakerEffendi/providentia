Pretty disappointing.  Food was okay, and it took like two hours to come.  Service was really quite inattentive although it was a Friday evening so pretty busy. We ordered beers upon arrival and those took about fifteen minutes to come.  When they did come, the waiter brought the wrong kind.  When we asked why we were given the wrong beers, he said that they were out of the original.  That is okay, but he should at least ask us if we wanted to change the order.  We then ordered a bottle of red wine which apparently they serve hot in Italy because that is how it came out. Food was alright when it finally came, but overall not worth the hassle.
