Domo Arigato, Mr. Robataya / Himitsu Wo Shiritai ... This is a truly unique dining experience.... IF you sit at the bar.   There are two chefs kneeling behind the bar upon entrance.  In front of the chefs, are the charcoal pits where your food is cooked.  Next (and in front of you) is the food where each ingredient is displayed on some sort of wicker looking plate.  The cooking technique (bbq) is quite simple but still savory.     Hubby and I decided to order a whole fish, salmon roe rice bowl, japanese mushrooms, peppers, and one other veggie that I don't recall but it was wrapped in seaweed and tasted just as good as everything else.  Once your food is ready, it is delivered to you on this really long paddle by the kneeling chefs.  In fact, even my Sapporo beers where delivered this way too - it was most interesting! But what really stands out about this place is the service.  The word discipline comes to mind when I recall how the wait staff barks your order to the kneeling chefs and then everyone responds.  It's quite weird but also cool.  I felt like, I too should be on best behavior or else...  (I need control; We all need control!)  But seriously - there must have been one waiter for every three people because anytime I looked for our waiter, it seemed like he was always standing nearby ready to assist us.   While I wouldnt come here with a group for fear of getting out of hand, I would recommend this as a date place.
