Brunch USED to be very good here. Steak & eggs , Â pizza (capocolo) Bloody Mary's ...you name it. Went here for brunch three times within the past month & It just keeps getting worse. The Bloody Mary , which is supposed to be their signature drink, is now a glorified glass of watery tomato juice. Pizza is always burnt now. Steak is rubbery. Eggs on the Benedict were over cooked . What happened Saraghina. You were one of our favorite brunch spots. Please get your act together. Until then, we won't be back.
