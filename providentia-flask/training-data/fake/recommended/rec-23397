Pat's apparently is well known across ... well, everywhere.  If you want to experience a touristy steak, feel free.  If you want a great steak, stay far away.  The meat itself is fine, if mass produced.  Unlike quite a few other places, Pat's has a huge hunk of meat cooking at any time.  The problem I found is that the steaks sure seem mass produced.  If I get a provolone wit, I'm going to get decent meat, but unmelted cheese and rather sad onions on a rather small roll.  For the same price, I can go to John's (or even Tony Luke's) and get a much more appetizing, and more bigger, steak.  The choice for me was simple.
