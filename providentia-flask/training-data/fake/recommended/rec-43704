Two stars for fun trendy ambiance and good service.  They even have a long wooden communal table like pain de quotidien. Now the ramen, I don't eat much but even the portions here are too small for me.  I wouldn't mind what size they served it in if it was at least good.   The ramen was al dente and good, but the broth, being the most important part of the ramen was less than impressive, it was too salty.  But for some, salty is equivalent to tasty, hence lot of stellar reviews.  Also lacking in the broth was the flavor profile- very one dimensional- felt like having salty instant noodle soup- with pork fat added to it.
