It's hard to find good Mexican in NY. Dos Toros is not as good as Bay Area taquerias, but it's pretty good and the people are super nice AND they compost. (So, four stars for NYC, but if this was the Bay Area, 2.5/3 stars.) We fall into the category of Californians who eat at Dos Toros because it's as close to home as we can get. Only one tortilla for a taco? Um, no.... Dos Toros is known for its chicken, but it isn't our favorite, the carnitas is. The carnitas is amazing. Melts in your mouth. The quesadillas are filled but are still good and a great deal for a kid (we get a carnitas quesadilla for our daughter, skip the salsa but add some beans. Perfect.) Our daughter loves the quesadilla with black beans and carnitas -- messy but delicious. The hot sauce has Â a nice sweat-inducing kick. Don't bother with the chips --- they are shamefully terrible (and overpriced) -- but the guacamole is good. Also, NY pricey. Live with it.
