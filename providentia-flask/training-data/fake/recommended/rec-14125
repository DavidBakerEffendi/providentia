I grew up in an area where I was always seeing street vendors with their carts being pushed along, ringing their bells on the cart handle, selling corn on the cob with mayo and chili powder and cheese, etc. I never ever tried it before... I'm glad my first experience of that item came from here. It was THE best corn on the cob of my life. Thank You Robert Hsiao for bringing me here. You are my life saver. Life would be incomplete without the corn on the cob from Cafe Habana.
