This was a once in a lifetime experience for me because the prices are pretty steep and I came on my birthday. I love the ambiance of the place. The waiters are friendly and not overbearing. It's also a fun place to dine. You have this card with two sides. One side is green and one side is red. When you have the green side that means you want to go to the salad bar. The salad bar is absolutely exquisite and is not the typical thing you think of when somebody says salad bar. Back to the card story. On the other side its red. That means you want meat and that's when the party begins. All the servers come over with all the meat you could ever want. I think I tried about all of them my absolute favorite one was the Filet Mignon. My second favorite was the Garlic Beef. This was a yummy experience and I plan on coming back again.
