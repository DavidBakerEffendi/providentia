Tables really too small to share.  Waitress unprofessional.  Music too loud. Food ok, but not worth all the hype.  We had the Lychee Prosecco martini - good (not too sweet) the mango paneer (where was the mango?- wouldn't order it again)  and the pork buns - filling and chutney delicious, but the traditional white buns a waste of calories.   Chili shrimp - nice presentation, but a very light dish. Nothing to write home about. The restaurant is clearly a work of love by the owner, and the menu is unusual, which I appreciate, but, sorry to say,  one visit was enough.
