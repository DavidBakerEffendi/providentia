So yeah, it's a chain steakhouse, but not like Sizzler or even Longhorn, closer to Morton's, so if you're expecting it to be inexpensive, it just isn't... if you're still intrigued, here's what they do have to offer... 1. Steaks are consistently cooked to order the way you ask for them, I'm willing to spend a little extra for that, call me crazy... 2. They do use a LOT of butter. It's delicious, but it is a LOT. 3. The wine list is quite good, but a little too heavy on new world, especially in the "by the glass" wine menu, in which pretty much ALL the reds were Cali. 4. They have all the standard steakhouse sides, and they do them right. 5. They make good cocktails, expensive, but good. In short, if you're in the mood for a consistently well prepared steakhouse meal with attentive service, you will get it. If you're looking for either a bargain, or something new and different, you probably won't. Me, I'll be back...
