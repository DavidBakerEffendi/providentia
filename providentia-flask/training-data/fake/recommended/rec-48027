The most delicious chicken pasta I've tasted. The more lunchey dishes are great too, like the mozzarella sandwich. You get the impression care is put into this food. It's rare to find such a high standard of food with such a great relaxed vibe, and the prices are very reasonable. Even the music is superb! It's hard to find any faults with this place.
