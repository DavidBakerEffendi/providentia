Jalapeno Margaritas...Bang! Mexican Car Crash (coronarita)...Boom! You CANNOT beat the price of the Mexican car crash! You can get a corona and a margarita on the rocks for $6 TOTAL. Since I live right near the Piazza, I happen to frequent this joint and the food is really good as well. I dig the mac and cheese, fried pickles and the nachos. I even tried the nachos with the vegetarian "meat" option, which is totally against my texas roots and if my fam found out they would probably shun me, and it was AMAZING!
