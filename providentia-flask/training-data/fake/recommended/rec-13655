Came here cause of Bobby Flay. Best pancakes I've ever had. Wonderful breakfast! pretty expensive, especially when they charge you $2 for extra maple butter, but hey, its NYC, and man the wait was pretty long but we walked around the block (not much to see), at first our hostess wasnt too nice but when we got seated inside the crowded and loud restaurant she warmed up and took our coats, so though breakfast came to $91 for a family of 5, not a bad experience
