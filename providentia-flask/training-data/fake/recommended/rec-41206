I had the kale salad which was a bit overdressed but was still good--especially the fried pieces which were mixed in with the raw kale. I also had the miso ramen with pork. The broth was incredibly rich and creamy, the noodles perfectly cooked, and the pork so tender it fell apart with just a tug of the chopsticks. I recommend accepting the server's offer of chili garlic oil to add to the ramen. Delicious. I don't want to get in the habit of handing out 5 stars too often, but this meal was awfully close to deserving one.
