Ok, they are officially slipping on me. I've been a Dish fan for a while, but the staff is bringing the place down. The food sis till pretty good, but waiters are slow. The bartenders? For get it. Now they open twist offs with their biceps. That's nasty and gay to do it for a guy. If you are gay, that's your purogative, but it does not give you right to open my beer in a gay fashion. Use the twist with your hand. It took one hour to drink 2 bud lights during happy hour last week because of the slow service. They don;t even need to pour them! Shape up, or I won't be back for a while. BTW - it's not just me. My work buddies and I discuss it too. We're all getting a little disappointed with the service lately. It's my favorite location if you can get back on track... BTW - Best foods: Lunch = Lamb Burger Dinner = Tomatoe Pie
