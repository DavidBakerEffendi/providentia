The best brisket sandwich I have EVER had! We swung by this little hole in the wall on our way home from our visit in Brooklyn. I am so glad we did! Â My husband tried the pastrami and also said it was delicious. My kids had a turkey sandwich and it looked good too. Don't be scared away by the neighborhood, this place is a must try!
