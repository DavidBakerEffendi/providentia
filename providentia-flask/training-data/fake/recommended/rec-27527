Decor is awesome.. Very sophisticated/chic meets trendy meets antique-y. It feels like a party and a bedroom at the same time. I'm not sure how to explain this. The staff was very accommodating of our late arrival, past normal serving hours, and still gave us very attentive service and allowed us to order food. We only shared the Room Service Pad Thai, which was delicious!!! Stocked with calamari, mussels, very thin noodles, and very spicy! The whole thing was covered by egg, and decorated. Drinks were pretty "girly" all around.. So leave your machismo at the door, order some food, grab some drinks, look fabulous and check yourself out in all the mirrors they have.
