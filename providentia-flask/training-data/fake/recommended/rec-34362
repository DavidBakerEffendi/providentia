I rarely enjoy dining in a hotel but Calandra's Mediterranean Grill is different. Enter the restaurant through the lobby of the Hampton Inn and enter a beautiful decor and receive friendly service. They offer their family brands of wines along with other labels and a wide selection of Italian fare. They start you off with a plate of olives and grated parmesan on your bread plate with olive oil and fresh bread from their very own bakery! I ordered a beet salad with fresh greens and goat cheese and it was superb. Next I had linguini alla vongole and was pleased to see clams in the shell when it was served. For dessert, I had the carrot cake: fresh, moist with creamy icing. As you leave the restaurant, they give you a long, Italian loaf of bread to take with you! Good food and not too expensive.
