The surrounding area of Doyers & Pell is seedy and scummy, But we came because "yelpers" say the noodles here are yummy. After beating me at gin rummy, I was treated to lunch by my mummy. A mother-daughter afternoon...how chummy! She won the game, so she paid our meals with my money. This place is small and the outdated décor looks funny,   It's always dark inside even when outside is sunny. Hate to admit the beef broth noodles I had were not so yummy. The broth was tasty, but the noodles were too gummy. Mom snapped "I paid 5 bucks for this big bowl of noodles you dummy! Wasn't that enough to fill up your tummy?" That's my mummy... Telling it like it is with more vinegar than honey. She sure knows how to make me feel crummy, Even as she's spending my own money!
