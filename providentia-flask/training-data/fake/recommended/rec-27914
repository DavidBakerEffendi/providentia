I wasn't impressed. Yes, the neighborhood is great and the space is cute, although VERY VERY small, but the service was sub-par. The waiters kept hitting our chairs and never once apologized. Their knowledge of the restaurant's own wine list was minimal, yet their pretentious attitude was in abundance. Nevertheless, the food was delicious as was the wine that we picked out.
