Was driving thru Princeton and glanced over to see this place. Had to stop, i was hungry. Small place with lots of drinks in coolers, and a bunch of dudes behind the counter. No messin around for them, they put together a hoagie faster then i could blink. The ingredients were fresh, crisp and cool. Lots of food for the price, i got a huge #1 and a coke. It was GOOD.
