I love this place!! They have a great lunch special that comes with all the fixings and you dump it over a bowl of rice and eat it all together. It comes with a side of Kim-Chi (Pickled Cabbage) you're in Korea Town, this is the good stuff. Eat Up!! I also had a wonderful stew type of soup which was boiling hot and they give you an Egg on the table that you crack into it and mix up. The staff is wonderful and incredibly attentive. This was my first experience with Korean Food, so I was a little lost on the proper etiquette on how to eat it. The staff kept checking on me to make sure I was ok and helped me out on the soup (I accidentally cracked the egg thinking it was hard boiled..yeah, I was slightly surprised.) As a Vegetarian I was thrilled by how many options I had on the menu. **Bonus: If you're having a city day - Macy's 34th is one way and The Empire State Building is the other.
