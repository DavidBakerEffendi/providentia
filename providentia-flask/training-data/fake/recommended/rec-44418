Such a cute restaurant hidden in the middle of Manhattan.  The space is small but I think that adds to its charm.  I was here on a Saturday for a birthday party. Tasty food, great wine and our server, Chad, was fantastic!! They were extremely accommodating for our large group and it was a perfect evening. Will definitely be back again.
