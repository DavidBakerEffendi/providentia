Ok, insta-Yelp. I just got home from dinner at Kefi and I must say: delicious! A friend made reservations for my birthday this week and the most reasonable time they had was 5:45, which was fine, but we we got there, there place was near empty. If there's one thing I hate, it's when restaurants tell you they have no availability when in reality, there is aa ton of space. My friend was having a (fresh homemade) lemonade at the bar when I walked in and we were seated right away. Service was attentive, but not overly so in a hovering kind of way. We started with the dips - chickpea, eggplant, tzatziki, and a "caviar" spread that tasted nothing like caviar and was scrumptious. Our third friend was running late but our waitress didn't rush us to order, though we eventually did. Both got swordfish (~$18) and mmm. I always forget how wonderful grilled fish is. Also worth noting, the bathrooms (downstairs) are very clean, though the stalls are really very small. I'm a small person, but I'm not sure how a large person would even get through the door. Overall, good stuff, Kefi. I will be back.
