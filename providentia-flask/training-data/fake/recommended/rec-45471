We would applaud the tasty menu, which was also pretty good value, however the wait time left a lot to be desired. Putting a note on your menu that infers "good food is worth waiting for", doesn't mean your customers will tolerate a horribly slow turn around. Waiting close to 40 mins between starter and entree is unacceptable, especially when your entrees are very simple (tachos and a salad?). When this is added to the fact that you have a 3 year old in tow (who loved the food eventually), then as anyone with kids will know, it is unlikely something you will sign up for again in a hurry. Hopefully the management will give this serious consideration.
