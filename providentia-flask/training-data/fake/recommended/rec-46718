Once was enough. Thought we would try it out since burgers, beer and bourbon are 3 of my husband' favorite things.  However, they don't cook burgers anything but "some pink" or "no pink" so if you like your burger any other way this not the place for you. Sweet Potato fries are $5.00 as a separate side or an additional $2.50 as an add on to your burger. I can't speak for all of the waitress's, but ours was snippy because I asked a question about the fries (which were greasy).  Never even tried the bourbon- can get that at several other restaurants in the area where we can get our burgers medium rare, Sweet Potato fries are $1.00 extra and oh yeah the wait-staff is congenial.
