The acrobaleno makes regular salads tasteless. It was so full of flavor and it was extremely good. The polenta was an interesting dish, something I didn't expect to enjoy but it turned out differently. As for pasta, I would definitely recommend the rigatoni or spaghetti calabrese. The vanilla bean gelato "affogato" drowned in espresso with almond crunch was probably the best dessert I've ever had. Since I am a vanilla lover, the warm chocolate cake with chocolate-caramel center s/w toasted hazelnuts and mascarpone-whipped cream wasn't my favorite but I would recommend it for chocolate lovers!
