This passed April I ate here at Cookshop along with some friends and we were so impressed with not only the food and drinks but our service! Will was our server and he was both attentive and friendly. We ordered a few appetizers to share, which is always a great way to get a real taste for a restaurant. I highly recommend walking along the High Line during sunset and then a late dinner at Cookshop!
