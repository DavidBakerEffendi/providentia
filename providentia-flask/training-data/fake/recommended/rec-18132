This place is totally incredible! We went there recently (four of us, all siblings) looking for shaved ice. What we experienced there could only be described as life-changing. We only knew we wanted shaved ice, but we didn't know much more than that. The man who was working there, who was incredibly nice, took charge and assured us that he would make us something we would love. After the shaved ice that he made us, no other shaved ice, possibly no other dessert at all, will ever be satisfying. We visited on a very hot and humid day, and this was the most delicious and refreshing hot-weather dessert that anyone could possibly imagine. The top layer was ice, doused in a variety of flavors including mango, cardamom and sandalwood. Then, below the flavored ice, was a syrupy, rainbowed slushiness full of delicious fresh fruit, which by the time you got to it had absorbed the syrups. The concoction looked like something that Rainbow Brite would eat, and was more cool and delicious than anyone could possibly conceive of without first having experienced it. For only three dollars! And it was so wonderful!
