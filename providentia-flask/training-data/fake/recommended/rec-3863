Simple, good Italian food.  I had the fruity di mare and the pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was very flavorful without being too rich or overwhelming, just enough seafood.  Our starter was the gnocchi fritto with stracchio cheese.  I thought it was actually cheese filled but it was just fried dough squares with a cheese spread.  I thought it was okay, my dinner companion enjoyed it however.  For dessert, we tried the tiramisu and ricotta cheesecake.  Both very good, though I didn't really care for the orange marmalade sauce with the cheesecake as much.   Great service and ambiance, will definitely come back.
