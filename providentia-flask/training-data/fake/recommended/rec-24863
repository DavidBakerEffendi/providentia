Tapas to die for. Amada is the perfect Spanish restaurant with great tapas from heavier meat plates to cheese and veggies. I would go back and have their lamb any day, anytime. The service was wonderful. And the atmosphere is perfect lending itself to the kind of great, intimate, fun conversations you usually only read about, yes this is one of those great restaurants you'll want to tell all your friends about. I was invited as part of a rehearsal dinner and I can assure you this restaurant is a good venue for private events. Amada means loved, and I loved this place.
