So, as an appetizer I'm going to serve you: Service was charming. Went to Perilla on a double-Valentine's date... I ordered the spicy duck meatballs to begin, and, although it was enough to fill me up, I kept on eating...from quack to delicious quack... As a main dish, you get this: Grilled Prime Creekstone Hanger Steak; which was properly portioned with a bit to spare. Mmm....
