The vegan boneless ribs are amazing! If I hadn't known these were vegan, I'd be certain they were the real thing. Very flavorful and incredible texture - inside and out. I sucked them down hard!! My friend ordered a second entree they were so good and we sucked them down together. Mostly him though. The only not 100% positive vibe I got was the service -- the waiter was busy waiting on like seven other tables. But that means business is good and I support China Pan business!! Can't wait to suck down some more ribs =]
