I had an amazing meal and experience...and I was even robbed! My two friends and I sat at a cute table outside. We had finished eating and were drinking our bottle of wine when I overheard yelling behind me. One of the servers had noticed that a homeless-looking man, not a customer, had sat at the empty table behind me. My purse was under our table, and he had inched it over to him without us noticing! Because the server had the courage to point it out, I was able to snatch my credit cards out of his hands! The server then called 911, and the restaurant manager chased the man down the block! This is definitely not part of their job description! The police arrived very promptly, took a statement from all of us, and drove me around the block to find the thief. If it wasn't for the server and manager, I may have had my whole purse stolen! To my surprise, they even took our bottle of wine off of our bill...and they had NOTHING to do with this incident happening! It was definitely above and beyond! The food was delicious but the service was even more outstanding! I'm so grateful to those Zavio employees. I'll definitely be back again soon! Just keep your purse close if you are sitting outside. :)
