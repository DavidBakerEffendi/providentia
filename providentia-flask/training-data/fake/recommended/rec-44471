We just had breakfast there today. My husband had the French toast and I had to stop myself from stealing it from him - it was golden, buttery and delicious with real maple syrup. Â I had the Migas which is scrambled eggs, tortilla and salsa. The tortilla strips were nice and crunchy and the scallions and salsa bright and vibrant. Not to be missed here are the lattes. I'm a Starbucks addict but coffee here is in a class of its own. The coffee has a delicious caramel taste to it and is robust but not acidic. Service was friendly and professional. We sat outside on a beautiful sunny day. A great way to start the weekend!
