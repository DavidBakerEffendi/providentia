I haven't had da pan ji in awhile and the big tray of chicken here was quite nostalgia evoking. Â I remember these dishes being larger, spicier and a little more varied in terms of ingredients back in China, but Spicy Village's take was still pretty satisfying. As mentioned by previous reviewers, order noodles to go with the dish ($2) - they soak up the sauce so nicely! The pork pancake was also satisfyingly crunchy. Reminded me of street food in China. An unpretentious hole in the wall with spotty but friendly service and an interesting mix of styrofoam cups and plates.
