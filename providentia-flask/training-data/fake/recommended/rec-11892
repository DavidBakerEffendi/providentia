As a group of 5, we arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday for dinner and got a booth towards the back. We had great service and our waitress made some great suggestions. We ordered several items and shared everything: cheese board to start, risotto (my favorite), meatballs, the special pasta (fettucine), polenta (could have passed on) and pork. For dessert, the sticky winter pudding was excellent!
