A few friends and I went there yesterday to try and fell in love with it.We  ordered the crawfish and shrimp in garlic butter , canjun style crawfish and lobster, shrimp cocktails, oysters and chicken wings. I absolutely LOVED the Cajun style crawfish and lobster, it was my favorite!!! DELICIOUSSSS!  Everything was so tasty and fresh.  Also, service was outstanding! The waiters would come asking if everything is ok a few times during your meal. I can not wait to go back for more! Definitely the best in NYC!
