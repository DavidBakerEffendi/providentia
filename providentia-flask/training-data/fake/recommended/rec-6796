I learned about Matt & Maries from a Tweet sent out by the Wharton School on Twitter. I was driving near 18th and Arch yesterday with my 15 year old daughter. Â I asked her to run in to get us take out from Matt & Maries. She informed me upon re-entering the car, "I got you the Italian Stallion". Many years ago, as a college student I lived in Boston's North End (Italian section of Boston). I am spoiled by outstanding pizza and Italian sandwiches. Matt & Marie's sandwich gets a solid five enthusiastic stars from me. It was that good. I cannot comment on the ambiance of the store or anything else because I waited in the car (in a loading zone) while my daughter ran in. Bottom line: The sandwich was terrific. I will undoubtedly find a reason to detour through the Logan Circle area whenever I am in Philadelphia. It was worth it.
