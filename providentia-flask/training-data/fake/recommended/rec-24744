Had a wonderful dinner here on a Monday evening -- I had the lamb tenderloin and it was fab.u.lous. The first floor of the restaurant is smaller and intimate, and you get a very "neighborhood-y" feeling. Food is a little pricey but well worth it. They have wine and Â beer, but it's also BYOB. Highly recommend this place.
