It's so great to have a stand-by great Italian restaurant in the heart of the theatre district! The service is excellent, the waiters authentic, the food delicious and the prices very reasonable! What's not to like? The menu has classic Italian dishes, nothing unusual. However my husband's veal piccata was the best that either of us had ever tasted and my veal artichoke also divine. The mista salad fortunately NOT oversalted as in so many other places. The valpolicella recommended by our waiter excellent! We will look forward to coming back the next time we go to a Broadway show!
