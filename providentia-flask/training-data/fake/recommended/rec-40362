Just thought it was nasty. With pizza, even bad pizza gets a pass cause it's still at least pizza, something hot with sauce and cheese and cheap, and that's all I can really say about this spot. Plain slice had an almost penne vodka sauce taste to it, very gross personally, had a sickening sweetness to it, which I hate in pizza (anyone who's eaten papa johns understands) . Ate it cause again, even bad pizza is edible but wasn't digging it.
