I love the food here. Last night I had the Lamb Kebob Kabeli Palow and the pumpkin puree side. Rice pudding for dessert. This is one of the top three places in West Hartford for tasty moderately priced food. They didn't know what Gluten Free meant that was the only draw back. Sitting outside watching people go by added to the enjoyment.
