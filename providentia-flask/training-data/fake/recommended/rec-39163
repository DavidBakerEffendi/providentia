I was just in Philly for a weekend and was looking for a nice restaurant. I saw this one on yelp and decided to try it while there. We did have to wait an hour but I am very glad we did. The food was very good! We really enjoyed the restaurant and the staff was friendly. I am glad I used yelp as I would not have known about this place without it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Too bad I can not go regularly :(
