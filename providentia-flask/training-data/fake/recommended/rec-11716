So Northern Spy has been one of my favorites every time I come to Manhattan, which is several times a year.  The food was always fresh, nicely prepared and the staff was (emphasis on the "was") always friendly and helpful.  Something has happened.  Since they take only limited reservations, tonight I put my name in with the host, was told nothing for over an hour, but because I was craving a dinner there, agreed to wait.  Besides, they always over- estimate the wait, I assume because they want to be sure you REALLY want to eat there.  About 30 minutes before our appointed time, we returned, were greeted icily (being charitable with that description), were told "I told you x time".  When asked if we could have a drink at the bar while we waited, his reply was "the bar is full", with a look of "get the hell out and come back when I tell you".  We left, went less than a block away to Back Forty, were greeted with a great smile and welcome, and had a delicious dinner served by one of the friendliest, helpful waiters I've experienced in a long time.  Bottom line, folks, let Northern Spy know they're good, but o one has to be treated like it meat.  I highly recommend passing it by as you head to Back Forty or one of the many other good, solid restaurants in the area.
