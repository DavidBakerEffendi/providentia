This place was great. I was lucky enough to not have much of a wait, but noticed a long line forming after I was seated. I will cut to the chase: this place is not cheap, but it is worth every penny. With $$ in mind, I wasn't sure what to think at first because, while waiting at the bar for a table, I noticed the least expensive beer was around the $6 mark, while most were around $8 or $9. My friend and I were stopping in for a late lunch and had a mind to split our entrees, so that made things a bit more reasonable. The beer and wine menu were particularly impressive and the bartenders and servers were both knowledgeable and charming. Â  We split the Glean salad and the veggie burger. This was one of the better veggie burgers I've consumed and I've giving the credit to the kimchi. I look forward to returning and will continue to spread the good word.
