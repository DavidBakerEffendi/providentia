i have NO idea how i forgot about this place. it used to be a staple for me back in the day and then i just lost contact somehow. but last night whilst craving sangria and knowing i had the perfect companion for it, i went back. thank G-d for that! it was even more lovely and delicious then i had remembered...the service was perfect. the sangria was amazing. the food just right. really nice menu and specials...something for everyone here. spicy, savory, sweet. everything. not even one complaint here. GO.
