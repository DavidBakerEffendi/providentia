Did the power weekend in Philly - Avance Friday/Vernick Saturday.  If you're not jealous, you should be. We got there a little early and started at the bar at where I had a really good cocktail, despite it taking forever to get the bartender's attention.  This is the second time I have been here and the place is packed each time. I can't blame them but a little nod to let us know you see us goes a long way. The dishes here are simple but tasty.  We loved the toasts, of which we got three. They cooked my fish perfectly. The service was a bit slow but they treated our party of 4 really well along the way. It took an very long time to get our wine, which my guest mentioned was a little annoying because they had called earlier to see if they could bring their own bottle AND pay a corkage fee and were told no.  That's a little ridiculous Otherwise things were very good. The desserts were great!!  This spot is loved in Philly for good reason.
