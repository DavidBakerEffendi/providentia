ok, so my 5 starts comes not from a fancy place but from what makes me feel good...and here i felt great! I saw this restaurant progressing when it was under construction and couldn't wait to try it out. I am glad I did. Brick walls, good food and wine and all of this without spending a fortune! great place to hang out with friend, family or why not a first date.
