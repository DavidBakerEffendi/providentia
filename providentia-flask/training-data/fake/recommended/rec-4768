Amazing! Already making plans to go back. Service was exceptional. We were a party of four and our server helped us decide what to order so we didn't have too much food. Two of us are meat eaters, two are vegetarian. We split four crostinis and one panini between two of us. Between the four of us we had two tapas. The baby string beans and fingerling potato salad tapas were phenomenal. The string beans were covered in cheese with the most delicious croutons, and the potato salad was equally delicious w/the truffle aioli sauce and fried shallots. I was one of the two vegetarians. The crostinis are vegetarian paradise. We had the egg salad, goat cheese and fig spread, spicy avocado and goat cheese, and ricotta and black olive spread. The goat cheese and fig and the spicy avocado and goat cheese - whenever I go again I will tell my party these are a must try. It was that good. Â  The fried eggplant panini was delicious too. Some posts have mentioned the parking, and I agree. It's to be expected in Astoria but it still requires patience to circle and circle one way streets with aggressive drivers in no mood to wait for parallel parking. But I'll deal just to have those tapas and crostinis.
