A great dinner just a quick walk from the Franklin Institute.  Great place, comfortable atmosphere and great, friendly service.  Menu was interesting and offered several appealing choices.  I had the scampi spaghetti, and my husband had the pickled beet salad and hanger steak.  Both meals were fantastic.  The salad was fresh and bright.  The steak cooked to perfection and the chorizo-rosemary potatoes were to die for.  The scampi was light, flavorful and delicious with ample jumbo shrimp.  Our picky 11 year old enjoyed her grilled chicken sandwich from the bar menu and said the fries were some of the best she's ever had.  We finished our great meal with Praline ice cream, Raspberry sorbet, and fresh-brewed coffee.  While we did seat on the early side, a table of 10 arrived at the same time as us.  The service & the kitchen kept up, even as the rest of the place filled.  We were looking for a nice place to have a dinner/drinks while we waiting out the traffic before heading out of the city and McCrossen's Tavern was a spendid find.
