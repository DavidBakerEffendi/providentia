Parker and Quinn gave me the worst restaurant/bar experience of my entire life. My friends and I came in for a few beers and sat in an area that was near the front door.  One of the employees kept holding the front door open while he was talking to his friends that were standing outside.  We asked him nicely if he could close the door since it was 30 degrees and windy.  Instead of accommodating customers like a normal person, he immediately grabbed all of our drinks and ran off with them.  My friends and I only had a few a sips  of our beers.  When I asked to speak to a manager...the guy that took our drinks away claimed to be the manager.  He then ran away into the back room after I snapped a photo of him.   This was the most disrespectful and unprofessional act that I have ever seen in a place of business.   Whoever this guy is...and I'm posting a photo...should not be in the restaurant industry.   I was considering this place as option to hold a large business party.  Obviously, after my run in with this guy....word about the despicable and disgusting "manager" here will be spread all over midtown.
