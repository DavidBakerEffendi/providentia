First of all, hats off to the staff--Empire Diner ran like a well-oiled machine on a busy Saturday night, even though it only opened a few weeks ago! Our server was great, and the pacing of the meal was perfect. Thank you. Chilli cheese fries were like poutine from heaven: sweet potato, tart salsa verde, and rich chilli that resembled shreds of well-cooked beef brisket brisket. My matzah ball came floating in Â amber-colored marrow broth, with tiny carrots and slices of celery; the ball itself was fluffy and pleasingly mealy, and tasted like a pinky's worth of horseradish had been mixed in to the batter (very original, and very successful). Oyster and pork belly pan roast--a "just trust us" dish--was superb; both molluscs and meat were meltingly tender, paired with a crisp wedge of pumpernickel bread. Friends said their burger, fish and chips, and apple pie were also very good. A welcome addition to the neighborhood, and lots of fun!
