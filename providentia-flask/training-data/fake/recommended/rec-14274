Freemans is at the end of an alley..  A cluster of bicycles with a certain hipster flair were parked out front, so I knew I was in the right place..   My cellphone was absolutely dead inside the place, which I think was kind of appropriate cuz it really did seem like you were stepping into another realm when you walk in.  The place has the feel of an old hunting lodge.  A herd of dead things adorn the walls, judging you as you eat.  I ordered the "Freemans Cocktail" at the bar, which was super neat cuz the bartender set something on fire as she served it to me.  Poof.  Cool.  The "devils on horseback" appetizer was delicious.  We ordered a second serving.  The artichoke dip thing was super tasty, get that.  The lamb shoulder I had was ok, not spectacular.  But yah.. all in all, Freemans gets my nod.  Check it out.
