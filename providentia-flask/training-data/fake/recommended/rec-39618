A M A Z I N G!!!!   It was such a noisy little place but what do you expect in new York???  I can't even start describing how my taste buds felt after dinner. I had ginger margarita, tasted the Bellini, sake and wines. All wonderful. Sorry, I'm going to be using my mini dictionary of awesome descriptions to write this. For appetizers, we had several items, my favorite, the mushroom toasted bursts with flavor, totally yummy. We has some salad and a few other items I can't quite remember bc the chef lady sent out so much. For my meal, I kept reading roasted duck but it was roasted pig suckling??? Yea didn't make much sense, but the server said it was cooked in duck fat so that was good enough for me. Oooo it was so soft and tender and flavorful. I ate everything of my plate and if there was garnish, I ate that too. Two margaritas later, I was cutboff since tequila makes me a but crazy so I went with tea for dessert. Ooooo. And the chef sent out all kinda of donuts and desserts and ice-cream that I completely devoured. Lol lucky for us, my boyfriends sister has awesome friends. My mouth was in a  flavor coma, apparently they go through great lengths to make sure everything is fresh and beautifully delicious. Of my entire trip and the hundreds of places I have ever dined, I would have to say the uncountable blasts of flavors from this place makes it a must visit if you hit up new York!!
