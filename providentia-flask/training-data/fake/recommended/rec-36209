I have been in the service industry for over 10 years and know the definition of great service.   After having been to Balthazars just a few times, I have come to realize there is no one better than Cisco (the bartender)!  He always greets me with a warm smile and remember s my name.  No matter how busy the restaurant is, he is on point....as well as the consistency of there food.  It's my favorite place to go for oysters and champagne.  Save room for the apple tart too if you are feeling a bit indulgent :)  No matter where you sit inside, I'm sure you will have a great time, but do try and sit with Cisco at the bar.....he will be sure dazzle you!
