Better look at the menu and know what to order or you just may not get served.  This is by design.  Don't even think about asking for ketchup or they will throw you out (and you'll deserve it).  These burgers are the bomb and if you try to screw with the simplicity of what has been done exquisitely since 1865 then you don't deserve to eat at Louis Lunch.
