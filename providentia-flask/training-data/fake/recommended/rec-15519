This place was really good :]! Very nice authentic Italian restaurant. With that being said I didn't think it was gonna be so authentic lol, could barely read the menu. Â Also I guess fettuccine Alfredo is not the most authentic Italian dish lol so it wasn't on the menu. Guess that's a positive cause it made me try something new. I can't remember what I got. But I do know it was delicious!! It's been awhile, but I do remember it being some sort of pasta dish, with no sauce! (Which surprised me lol, I guess I'm too Americanized huh?) But it was really good!! I would definitely go back, who doesn't love authentic food? Lol
