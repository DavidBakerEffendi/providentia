If I was basing this only on food it would get 5 stars, I was very happy with the food.  Unfortunately for them, that is only part of the experience.  I'll start with the food though.   We started wit the calamari, which was very good.  I had a few chewy pieces but it was nothing that ruined the meal.  The sauce worried me but it was actually very good.   My son (5) got a mushroom pizza.  He gave it 2 thumbs up, said he wanted a 3rd slice but was too full.   I got the chicken francaise, it was cooked perfectly and very tasty.  I wanted more, but was too full to eat another bite.   My husband got a seafood and pasta dish, he said the same thing we did.  He wanted to eat more because it was so good, but was just too full.  So I would say foodwise it was a hit! Now, let's talk service.  Everyone was very nice, but also very slow.  We got glasses of water when we sat down, they were not refilled until we were almost done with our meals.  Over an hour.  The only person who came to our table in that time was to bring the food and he ran off before we could ask, and we couldn't get the attention of anyone.   While we got our menus right away, it took 10 minutes for them to bring a kids menu.  We knew he wanted pizza so it wasn't a big deal, but it shouldn't have taken so long. We were there for about 90 minutes, which considering we didn't get anything special and no dessert was just too long.  Especially since no one came to the table for an hour of that.   Before we got our check the waiter came and asked if we wanted "expresso", there is no x in that and as silly as I know it sounds that ruined a lot of the experience for me.  In an Italian restaurant they should be able to pronounce such a common word.   In all, we would definitely go back but I would do so on a date night because 90 minutes is too long for a family (though our son was well behaved I won't chance that again!).
