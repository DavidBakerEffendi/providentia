Easily 5 stars. If I could give 10, I would. Let's start here. I made reservations for a Friday evening. I got a all on the Wednesday before to thank me for choosing to dine there and that they looked forward to having me. Well, that was the first of many great gestures. Arrived that Friday about 25 min earlier than reservations because of off timing on my part. They were glad to seat us early. Second great gesture. Then when ordering, we were so impressed with how knowledgeable our waiter was. He knew the menu-- this is rare these days so we were sold. They even allowed us to hang out at the bar to wait for the heavy rain to pass when we were about to leave. This is just the service, people!!! The food here is so incredibly well done in both presentation and taste. We had the lobster fried rice with a chicken entree. Phenomenal. Had the Zengria cocktails, a peachy sangria. Now it's pricey, but worth every penny. You get exactly what you pay for and more. Do not leave Philly without stopping here folks.
