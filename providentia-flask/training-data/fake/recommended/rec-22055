The dinner pre-fixe is an amazing deal. All of the starters were standouts - green tomato pies, pretzel rolls, and bluefish pate were fantastic. We ordered the lamb and striped bass as mains - lamb was great, bass was a bit bland. Definitely redeemed with dessert though, as well as with the chocolates the chef brings out at the end of the meal. All in all a really great experience with exceptional service.
