This is Harold Dieterle's new place (winner of season 1 of Top Chef).  This was during the soft opening...the official date is Monday the 7th. I was very impressed.  Everyone was very friendly...I just walked in by myself at 9:30.  They have about 4 booths, 10 seats at the bar and then a good amount of 2-4 person tables.  Really can't put my finger on the decor; but, it is just nice and clean and inviting. The food is an american (fresh farm) menu with a few asian influences.  I started with the maui onion soup that had some fava beans and oyster.  I was neither here nor there with the oyster; but, the fava beans provided a nice punch.  My main course I opted for the ravioli since I had eaten a bit earlier and didn't feel like meat.  It was ricotta stuffed with a shaved bordeaux truffle.  Smooth on the inside and then the truffle had a bit of a kick to it rather than the subtleness of black truffle.  I finished off with an espresso and a strawberry confit with barley custard and lemon foam.  Everything was delicious with great flavors.  The biggest problem was what to decide on having...I really need to go back a few more times to try a few other dishes that looked great like the crab salad and lamb.  The only thing I could have hoped for were maybe an amuse bouche just to sample some of the other flavors that were on the menu. Bravo Harold!
