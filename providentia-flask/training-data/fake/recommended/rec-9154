This place was a recommendation from a friend and a great one at that. I loved this place. Located in the east village. I would probably never go into this place if I just walked by. What a pleasant surprise! When you first walk in all the staff welcome you by shouting at once. It was hilarious. Love the decor. It's like a cozy Japanese dining room. It's also always comforting to see primarily Japanese people at a Japanese restaurant. It gives me the sense of authenticity. The pork steamed buns were the best I've ever had. (Slightly spicy) I also enjoyed the Akamaru ramen. I've never tasted anything like it. We also enjoyed some hot sake (sake!sake!sake). I would definitely return! From the way the staff shouted at us in thanks when we left, I think they want us to return!
