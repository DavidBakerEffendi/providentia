It's a good thing this place is not close by or else I would be going there all the time!  My boyfriend and I had a fantastic meal here.  We pretty much went overboard, but we were on vacation.  He had the onion soup, ahi tuna, two beers and I had the escargot, steak frites, two beers and we shared the brown butter pie.  Everything was wonderful.  We also loved the local selection of beers.  Great waitstaff and the decor made it feel like we were somewhere in Paris.
