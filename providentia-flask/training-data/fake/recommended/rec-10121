While there is a lot of hype surrounding the place, it mostly lives up to it.  A lot better spot for lunch than dinner as the portions are relatively small.  Mix and match different meatballs and sauces and dont be afraid to share! Con: if you cant get a table against the wall, you're sitting at one long table with strangers directly next to you (it was so awkward last time that my girlfriend and I barely spoke throughout our meal)
