This place would get five stars if not for the rather slow service.  This is the most authentic Mexican restaurant in Northern NJ. It is truly a hidden gem.  Try the Quesadillas here and you will never go back to On the Border or Chevys.   The enchiladas (cheese or chicken) are excellent, and taste as though a lot of preparation has gone into preparing them. Just make sure you leave at least 2 hours open in your schedule as the service is very slow.
