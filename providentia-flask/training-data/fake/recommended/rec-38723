I have never liked buffets, it's true. But outings are fun and spending time with people is fun and brunch is always fun, right? Well, I tried really hard to like this place, but I just couldn't. There are those old-school restaurants where you picture lots of people in their 80s gnawing on mashed potatoes that give an air of charm, and I've been to those kinds of places. But this place, charming as it may seem, just doesn't have that likability to it. The decor is old and tired, the colors are bland and sleepy, and the wait staff seems out of place. The way the buffet was set up was awkward -- several round tables with three to four food trays on each; a long table with muffins and veggies and salad; and a man making omelets who was not there 75 percent of the time. For $15, on Sunday for brunch, you get the buffet and a "complimentary" mimosa or bloody Mary. Now, the food quality is definitely not up to the par of necessitating a cost of $15 a plate -- all you can eat or not -- so the "complimentary" mimosa or bloody Mary is more what you're paying for. I consumed a variety of things -- the roasted red potatoes were really delicious; the omelet was subpar even though it's made fresh; the french toast tasted more like cinnamon toast; the fruit was a little beat up; and the only thing I really loved was the "croissants" that were more like stuffed french toast or crepes -- raspberry and cream cheese on the inside. Oh, and the mimosas were delicious. To be honest, I just can't bring myself to say this place is good or even worth giving another go. It was just stale, tired, bland, and disappointing. But hey, the company was outstanding, so I suppose that's where these stars come from. Basically, just proceed at your own risk!
