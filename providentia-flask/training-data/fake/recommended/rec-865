Brought my sister and niece to Philly for a traditional Cheesesteak.  We traveled to South Philly to get the real deal and was highly disappointed!  We have better Cheesesteak in the suburbs and will take Ray's over Geno's any day! What ever happened to diced steak and quality meat? You can't cover lousy wit whiz!
