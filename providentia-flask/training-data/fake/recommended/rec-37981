I have been frequenting Egan's since it first opened. It really is the only nice bar in town (halcyon next door has a nice bar too). The food and service has been consistently good for a causal moderately priced place. Expect to be pleased with the wings, burgers, Mediterranean burger and Ruben toasties. This is where they really shine.
