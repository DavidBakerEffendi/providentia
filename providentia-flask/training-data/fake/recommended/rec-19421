New place just opened by the former chef/owner of Sola (Dave Clauser).  He just opened Wishbone, a "craft" fried chicken take out with limited seating.  Excellent fried chicken - no bones.  This is gourmet fingers.   They are fresh, hot, crispy, delish - as are the dips.  No veggies or sides.   We did dine there - cozy seating up a few steps.  It is in the building where Lee's Hoagies was - big improvement.  You should try it.  Adult food but if you work at or near Penn and want to bring home a real treat for your kids - make the stop and pick up. He also makes a "pie of the day."  Sort of pockets - today was pumpkin.  Didn't try but they looked tasty.  Also an interesting assortment of beverages.  I had a SNAP - lime, agave, cayenne.  Oh -- ask for the "secret" sauce.  They sometimes have something special if you ask.  This is going to be a new addiction for us.
