Exceptional!! (and trust me I'm a pretty worldly girl) Greeted immediately by a super friendly waitress, we quickly felt comfortable in this cozy little pub. Upon learning it was our first time we were offered some samples of some Scottish and some local brews so that we could make the perfect choice. Pints are priced extremely reasonable, particularly if you're traveling and used to higher city prices. Food impressed just as much as the service and comfort of the place... Nachos as an app were heaping, more than enough to feed 3 of us well. Two of us ordered a the steak pie on recommendation from a nice man sitting at the bar and it was DELISH! Exactly right for a brisk Vermont evening. A huge portion for a great price. This is a must stop if you're passing through these parts on a jaunt to the snowy mountains or even if you just life a town or two away.. Will not disappoint!
