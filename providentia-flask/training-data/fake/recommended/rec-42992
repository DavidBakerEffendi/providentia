Part of my job description is to seek out sexy things...and I guess I do it in my personal life as well.  I am here in NYC for a job and I wanted dine/eat at place that was dark, sexy, amazing food, with creative mixologist drinks.  I was able to check all of these things off my list. The steak tartar & the billionaire cocktail are at the top of my list of why I love this place.  The tartar is a orgasm in your mouth & the cocktail will take you pleasantly out of your mind - both so good you want to eat/drink them slowly to enjoy every moment of it. The service is excellent.  Our waitress & the manager were both a delight.
