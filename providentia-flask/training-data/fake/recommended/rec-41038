We had to order the spinach chaat, since everyone on yelp raved about it. It was really delicious, but it was fried and greasy. I would prefer to start with something more fresh. We also tried the veggie samosa, which was pretty standard, it came on top of flavored chickpeas, which were very good. We had an order of naan plus saag paneer and paneer tikka masala for our entrees. The saag paneer wasn't very good- bitter spinach flavor, but also felt very oily and heavy. The paneer tikka masala tastes better, but still more greasy than I would have liked. The service was a bit slow, but it was nice not to feel rushed. Very nice atmosphere, upscale, good for a date. I probably won't go back, but I'm glad I tried it.
