Awesome hidden gem somewhat off the beaten path.  We discovered the place while watching the Food Network Thanksgiving professional chef cookoff, which The Little Owl owner won (after we cheered him on for his smart, innovative, yet homey and sensible interpretation of the meal, and his great attitude).  That style shows at the restaurant for sure.  The place is tiny--look at the kitchen and marvel and applaud what those guys go through in there (it appeared the prep area for some of the items was actually downstairs, requiring the cooks to go outside and down a different stairwell).  Totally funky.  Very dark, without being serious.  I'd hate to be there when it was crowded, given the nearly impossible table configurations.  This place is open very late, and even near closing, is friendly and spot on.  Opentable.com does reservations for them, which is a good choice, since their phone system does not take in person calls and is generally a typical, annoying IVR system.  As for the funky bathroom people mention, that was the low point of the experience for me, being that it wasn't that nice in there, although there was a couple interesting cookbooks to read, should you read cookbooks in the bathroom.
