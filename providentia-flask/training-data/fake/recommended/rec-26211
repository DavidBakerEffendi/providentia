I ordered the Beef Panang Curry $15 (medium spicy) and it came with a side bowl of rice. Thai panang curry comes with coconut milk, string beens, white button mushrooms, snow peas and bell peppers. The beef was a little tough but was very flavorful. The service was very attentive (not many customers at the time) and our food came out fairly quickly.
