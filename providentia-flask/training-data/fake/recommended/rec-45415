I ate here last night and had an excellent meal.I really have no idea why people waste their lives ranting on here, so negatively about a restaurant that hasnt even been open a week. Get a life. The fava bean salad was incredible. Charred favas, lemon, chili and delicious cheese. The cavatelli are homemade, too. And much, better than Frankies, or others. The ambiance was very inviting, and it makes an amazing spot to relax and enjoy some delicious food . Â Cant wait for breakfast and lunch to begin!
