My boyfriend surprised me with reservations to this restaurant.  The service was phenomenal, and the homemade pastas were to die for - definitely worth the carbs!  I MUST recommend the olive oil cake.  They serve it with a golden raisin compote, and it will take your breath away. I almost licked the plate...but there were too many people around me.   The wine list is very educational and breaks up the wines by region of Italy.  I am not well-versed in Italian wines, so we just told our server what our preferences were and they provided us with some of the best Nebbiolo and Barolos by-the-glass I have ever tasted.  This is probably the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to.  What an enjoyable, fun experience!
