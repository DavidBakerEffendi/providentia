The food is great, however the staff S-U-C-K-S.  And that is being kind.  I've never been treated so poorly when dining.  Every person from from the "hostess" to the bartenders are so rude.  I've been many many times, hoping for a change ... with each visit the attitudes get worse.  Not sure how the owner looks past this huge issue???
