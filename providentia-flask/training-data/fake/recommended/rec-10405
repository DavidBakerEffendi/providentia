For Years (30) The CORNER BISTRO was Perennial # 1 Best Burger in NY .. Love this place, great prices, and great ambiance and energy. Sad to say, the Burgers have gone Down in recent years. Wish they'd bring the quality of the Burgers up as I love this place cause I have lots of great memories from good times over the years. I'd gladly pay a couple bucks more for Â a better Burger, and thats saying a lot from me to want to pay "More Money" but I just want the place to be great! I Love it!
