This was a recommendation from my cousin that lived in East Village for about 4 years. I was told that this was the best burger he has ever had. Myself, I tend not to take others people food opinion seriously. That was until I saw some pictures of this amazing burger. I ordered a Bronte burger. Sat quietly by my self checking my phone, until my order finally came out. My first impression that it was small. I then separated the bread and looked at how the meat was perfectly evenly cooked with lots of juices left. I've been to a bunch of burger places in the Los Angeles area and I truly think this might be one of the best burgers I have ever had. No point in going to shake shake when you can support this amazing tiny place with great food.
