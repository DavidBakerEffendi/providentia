Baked pastries always tasty- casaba pone, bread pudding, pumpkin bread, muffins, etc. some un/sweetened. Grain porridge is a must in any season. Mini market. Vegan entrees with Jamaican flair. Juice bar with fresh produce, although probably not organic. Patties are wonderfully spiced- veggie, spinach, "fish". The "fish" was ...different. All patties have whole wheat? dough, not the usual yellow dyed flaky crust. This place is a neighborhood gem. Also, the owner is quite pleasant. Small area in the rear for dine-in, like a cafe. And bar top for on the run munchies.
