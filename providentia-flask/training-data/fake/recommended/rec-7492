As weird as it may sound I'm ok with receiving poor service if it's super busy and everyone is equally receiving poor service. It's another thing when I feel and see that poor service is received only by those of a different age group or a different race from that of the normal customer base. Today brunch was pretty terrible. Service was obviously better for some people when I see the curly haired waitress joking around and asking how everything was going for other tables. Yet she never once came to our table other than to take our order and bringing our check after having to flag her down. If your going to be bias please don't make it so obvious by being loud about it with the table across from us and then completely ignoring us the whole time. The eggs in the huevos chorizo were dry and flavorless. The mole in huevos mole was ok I guess. Nothing spectacular. One star for guac which was pretty good and a big portion and one star for the unbiased busboy who refilled our water. I guess I'll have to keep an eye on my statement since it seems like they like overcharging the tip we leave.
