As mentioned in other reviews, the service was very good. Our server came by multiple times to check on us and was very friendly. Â The food itself was OK, but nothing to write home about. We started out with fried calamari which was decent, and was quite generous regarding portion sizes. We then had the eggplant parmigiana that was mediocre (although, who's ever had amazing eggplant parmigiana?) and the paperdelle porcini, which was better, but also not amazing. The ambiance of the restaurant was one similar to a large chain restaurant, like a nicer Olive Garden, which we didn't expect and the prices were not exorbitant, but not worth the product. It was worth checking out, but we most likely won't be going back.
