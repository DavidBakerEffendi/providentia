Never had Â halal before, but I was told that this was the place to be. There are several locations, and they are all rarely seen without a line. I ordered the gyro/chicken over rice, and omg it was amazing...tender and fragrant meats that pair so nicely with the equally fragrant rice (WHAT do they put in there...crack?!) that's all tied together with their famous white sauce--makes me want to keep eating!! Also, VERY well priced, as one bowl can pretty much feed 2-3 people! Even my health-conscious friend inhaled half of it on her own! Amazing. I want some right now argh!!
