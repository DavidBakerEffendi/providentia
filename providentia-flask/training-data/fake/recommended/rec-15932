Nice food, good drinks, and service was attentive and warm.  We sat inside in the booths, and had a great time.  It is expensive ($90pp - inclusive of drinks and good tip). I had the fried chicken which I thought was too fried (burned a little) but still tasty (hey, its oil, fattening and chicken!).  Oysters (we ordered 25 for 5 people) were a miss, in my opinion.
