Good: Farm-freshy gourmet comfort food. Flavors and textures of everything; well thought out, well-done. Small, cute space. Down-to-earth, unpretentious. Bad: Black-eyed peas with the amazing lamb were kinda undercooked.  Not tragic, but... I think they should call the bacon brittle "candied bacon peanuts".  Hm, not as sexy.  Ok.
