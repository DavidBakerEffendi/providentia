The wait was about 30 minutes on a Monday night. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is characterized by dim lighting, a relatively tight space that makes it cozy. The food is good, but not amazing. I sampled the bone marrow with ox tail, which comes with a dish of sea salt, and I must say it was refreshing. The roast chicken was so-so, but the mashed sweet potatoes were great. Overall, this is a decent place to take a date or hang out with friends for an evening. The one thing I would recommend is going as a group and trying the Paella Royale, which looked delicious and amazing as I was walking out.
