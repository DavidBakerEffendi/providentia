Was super excited to finally try this place out because of all the raving reviews. Went on a Saturday night with 8:30PM reservation, tables were all hustlin' and bustlin'. Pretty big place with a nice bar/waiting area on the side. Bathrooms are modern with tiny neatly folded hand towels but it's unisex so each stall smells like there's urine all over the walls. The hostess, wait staff, and bussers were all really nice and helpful. We ordered a bunch of tapas plates to share family style. We had the pita and hommus, moussaka, duck shawarma, beef shawarma, lamb kebob, and black iron shrimp. The duck and lamb were a bit dry and the beef was mashed into a mush and tasted a bit sour? I've had tahini sauce before but it never tasted like that. Took my friends here who are from out of town and was pretty dissapointed with the turn out. 2 stars for the pita and hommus and nice decor.
