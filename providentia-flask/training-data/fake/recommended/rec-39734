I would give it five stars based solely on their Tuesday night half price tapas deal. (Half price tapas until 8 p.m.). Get their early as it fills up fast, but all tapas are half priced. These aren't your average tapas portions though, these are legit and 2 or 3 plates per person is MORE than enough. The Espresso bbq "costillitas" are amazing and the meat literally falls off the bone. The mussels, chicken and beef tacquitos and guacasala are all amazing too. I also am a big fan of the Empanadas, but please do not sleep on the BBQ costillitas (ribs). I also head to Yucca bar for brunch, and their brunch menu is equally as good. Crab cakes Benedict will kick your ass, but it is muy delicioso. The service is also great, friendly waitstaff and outdoor seating is a big plus. A meal (on Tuesdays) for 2 people is around $40 plus drinks and tip. It would probably be a bit overpriced for my liking on a non-half-price Tuesday though. Fun place. Delicious food. Highly recommended.
