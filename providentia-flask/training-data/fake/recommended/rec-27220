I came here to celebrate a birthday with my family, and we had a great time! We ordered the taste of Mesob for 4. There were 5 of us, but it was more than enough food! The food was great, and with the sampler meal we were able to taste pretty much everything. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful, and the vegetable dishes were just as good as the meat dishes. The service is extremely friendly and helpful - our waitress pointed out her favorite dishes to help us decide. Mesob is BYOB, and as soon as we arrived they brought out wine glasses and an ice bucket for us, and sent someone over to open up the bottles. Now that's what I call having your priorities in order! Be warned that the space can get very loud. When we first arrived there were a lot of families with small children, and by the time we left the restaurant had filled up with a more adult crowd, but at all times it was rather hard to talk across table due to the noise. The waitress even had a hard time hearing us because of the noise.
