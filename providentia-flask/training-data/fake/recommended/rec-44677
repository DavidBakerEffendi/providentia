A great unassuming spot in this area, this place delivers in food and service quality. I first came here for a lunch and was blown away by the bronte burger that all yelpers were raving about. Bread was perfect, meat was well cooked, and hands were not oily afterwards. I've also tried the chicken cream pasta and spicy sausage pasta, both in perfect portion and full of great flavor (but not too overwhelming). It's a small place so don't go at normal peak hours. Expect to be seated closely with another party. I would recommend this as a place to catch up with a friend or go on a casual date, don't go with a group..the wait will take a while..
