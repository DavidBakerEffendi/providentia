This place is OK.  It was REALLY cold inside, and VERY LOUD!!  I had the 'special' chicken cutlet, cheddar, bacon LT with ranch dressing on multigrain bread.  The special was advertised with a 'side salad' for $7.99.  My salad consisted of 1/2 and artichoke heart and 2 bites of carrot with a very recognizable bottled dressing.  The chicken was as dry as a bone, and tasteless!  We also had liverwurst with horseradish sauce, brown mustard L and O.  Having worked in a deli, and made quite a few sandwiches, Liverwurst is not something you "load up" on.  There was easily 1/2 a pound of meat.... if it was roast beef... yes, sure... liverwurst.. not so much.   So for the 2 sandwiches and 2 bottles of water it was $21.00!  Don't think we'll try it again!
