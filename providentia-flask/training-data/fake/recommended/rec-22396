I really like this place. The Pizza is really close to being on par with the famous New Haven establishments, but getting the pizza is much less stressful (no hordes of people to fight through). I love the famous places, but sometimes I feel like I'm fighting for food in some U.N. refugee camp. At Costa it's a breeze to get your food and it is GOOD!
