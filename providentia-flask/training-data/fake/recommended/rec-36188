This place is the closest bar to our apartment, but I have never felt welcome. The bald bartender has the a huge arrogant, attitude and that is when he isn't ignoring you.  The fireplace is wonderful in winter, the sidewall seating is great in the warm months, and the food is ok, but I still can't get past his attitude. Went there to meet friends on a Friday night and the place was busy. I gave him my credit card and it went downhill after that. I asked for another beer after waiting for 10 minutes with an empty glass. I was ignored by the girl bartender too.  I couldn't remember the name of the beer and he was not helpful at all.  I hope they can rely on their regulars because I won't be going back.
