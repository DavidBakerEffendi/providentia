This is one of my all time favorite Brooklyn spots. The food is fast and always good. I am a huge fan of the french toast, it is not too overdone and fancied up like the new yuppie places down there. (although i technically am a yuppie i have a natural resentment to fancy breakfast places, maybe this review explains that!) The people are nice and regular, and i hope it is around for years to come!
