Never before have I been so eloquently insulted by a restaurants attempt to pass such greasy-- over cooked and generally flavorless dumplings off as food. Nonetheless, I was. Naturally with my 7:05pm order arriving at my apartment at 8:20, so I should have expected such a disappointment. Dumpling were quite literally the worst I've ever had, and I am a fanatic, stuffed wontons were pooling with the grease of a fryer which clearly hadn't been changed in weeks, and the general Tso's chicken (egg roll missing of course) was mediocre at best. I am a professional chef and I believe Yelp to be the worst thing ever invented, but this vent could not be withheld. Hopefully others have better experiences than myself... But May God have mercy on their souls for sending me those dumplings.
