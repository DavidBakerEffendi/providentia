Cannot say enough good things about this place. Food = Super FLAVORFUL with incredibly FRESH ingredients. Arguably the best Thai on 9th Ave Service = Excellent Atmosphere = Cozy, open to the street, great music Go, you will not be disappointed! Fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Note: BYOB until their liquor license is approved
