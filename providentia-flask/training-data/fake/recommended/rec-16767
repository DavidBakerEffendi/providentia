Fantastic food! I had not had such a good caldo verde since I left Rhode Island!  There were many other wonderful Portuguese items on the menu and I would've liked to have tried them all, especially the mussels & clams. But realizing that my eyes were bigger than my stomach, my sister and I opted to share a perfectly cooked T-bone, baked potato & salad.   The service was wonderful, very attentive.  The prices were very reasonable & the manager, Paulo, is a darling -- Will be sure to come back to this place when we are in the area again!
