My husband and I rode our bikes past this new Thai restaurant in a our neighborhood recently and decided to give it a try Saturday night. We are huge fans!  The food is native to Northern Thailand.  They don't use coconut milk.  As my husband, who has lived in Asia for years said, "I have never tasted flavors like this."  It was great.  The place has only been open for a couple of weeks, so we wanted to write  a review hoping more and more will try this great new addition to the neighborhood.  They say their Pad Pad's are some of their favorite and we tend to agree.  I got the duck. Can't wait to go back. It's BYOB right now, so even more cost effective. I'd even say this rival Sri Pa Phai in Queens!
