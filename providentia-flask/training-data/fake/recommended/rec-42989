I actually first went to Corner Bistro after Lent when I had given up eating meat for my 40 days and 40 nights. I'm not a huge meat eater anyway so I had NO IDEA how much I would crave a cheeseburger THE WHOLE TIME. There are many places in the city to get a good burger, but I was told this place was the way to go. The burger was sumptuously delicious and when washed down with the McSorelys dark for ridiculously cheap I really did find my gateway to Heaven! I wouldn't go so far to say it was the best burger I'd ever had, and maybe I'm over-rating because I wanted a cheeseburger soooo badly by then and I happened to go with my roomie and her adorably flirty brother (shhh!) but I'd recommend loading the burger with everything you can and just enjoying. Docked a star for the tiny tiny space and long wait when I was literally salivating on the floor in anticipation. Added a star because the teeny menu makes it easy to pick what you want and I suck at making choices. Big menus give me anxiety.
