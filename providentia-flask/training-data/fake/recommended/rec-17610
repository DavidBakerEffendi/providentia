Hmmm, alcohol is average priced. The place looks nice, design wise. It's connected to a random other bar under different ownership, which I find hilarious. I'll tell you now, if you graduated Montclair or Bloomfield High and you don't want to see them EVER again, don't go there, ha. It's like a high school reunion. I've run into every ex and crush I ever had, ha. It's a good thing if your hotter since you've graduated ^_~.
