This place makes me wish I was French Canadian just so I could have grown up with Poutine. I feel that having Poutine for the first time at 25 is just too way in life. How have I lived without it? Lived without french fries covered in gravy and cheddar cheese curds? HOW?? We found the place by spotting the line that was out the door. Luckily we got there when we did because the line doubled within 5 minutes. Luckily the line went pretty quickly, which I think it impressive since they make small batches of fries. The 2 people there had a good system of making the fries, seasoning the fries, portioning the fries and then making it into poutine or serving the fries with different dipping sauces. The sauces looked great. I would have gotten them but the poutine was calling me. Longingly....'geeeeet meeeee'. This was my first poutine so I am no expert but this was fantastic. They gave a generous amount of french fries, plenty of gravy and a lot of cheese curds. When making the poutine the guy would add the fries add gravy and cheese and then smooch it all down with a ladle and repeat. I can easily understand the line out the door. Stick it out- it is worth the wait.
