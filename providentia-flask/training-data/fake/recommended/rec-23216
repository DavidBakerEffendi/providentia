The BEST Indian food in New Jersey, period. I come fairly often for the lunch buffet, and it blows everyone out of the water. Yes, even Palace of Asia (which I love, by the way). The weekend buffet (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) is more extensive and spicier (yay!), and slightly more expensive but WORTH IT. The dining room is spacious and clean; when you enter it, you'll be greeted by three huge brass lions that have had their tails screwed off so they don't trip customers. The tails are stored beneath the lions; it's a riot. The wait staff are prompt and friendly and happy to answer questions you may have about the dishes. Everything is clearly labeled and DELICIOUS, with nuanced flavors. YUMMY.
