Do not be fooled, Devils Fan. This place is open until the start of the every home game and that is the best secret you can know. The food is delicious with huge portions. We had the split pea soup, a corned beef/pastrami sandwich with spicy sauce (Sorry, I forget the name now), and a reuben. We also got the poutines in honor of Marty, which was good but VERY FILLING. The service was also fantastic. Various people stopped by to see how we were doing in a non-invasive way (I believe they were the brothers who owned the deli). You feel like you're being welcomed into their home and they're taking care of you.
