Review for delivery only!  I live fairly close to this place but I am too lazy to get out of my apartment. Anyways, I ordered the garlic bread, breakfast pizza, sweet potato fries and hummus. The order was packed very carefully and arrived hot. They even took into account condensation :-). The food was delicious!  I am definitely ordering again.
