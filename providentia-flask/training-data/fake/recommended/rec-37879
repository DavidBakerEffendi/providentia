Everytime I go home or have visitors in Burlington I HAVE to come here.  Probably one of my favorite places ever, and everyone I have ever brought here absolutely love it.  The specialty flatbreads are always amazing and unique, the beer is great, and the ambiance is perfect.. it defines Vermont.  The wait may always be long but it is most certainly worth it.  Service is always impeccable and super friendly!  Oh flatbread how I miss you!
