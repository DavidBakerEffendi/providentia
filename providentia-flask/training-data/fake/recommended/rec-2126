After Philadelphia Magazine ranked this as the 2nd best restaurant in Philadelphia for 2008, I set high expectations and couldn't wait to try it for myself. I have to say that my expectations were not met. The entrees were hit or miss and were surprisingly bland.  The wine selection was acceptable and the brussel sprouts on the summer vegetable appetizer plate were incredible. However, I wish I could say the same for the rest of my meal.  I found out later that maybe I just ordered the wrong items.  But for a restaurant with such high esteem I'd expect anything I order to be top notch.  Inconsistency would be the key here. I will definitely give it another shot but next time I'm ordering the pizza and hoping that I fare better.
