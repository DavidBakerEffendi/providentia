I'm a huge fan of Mexican food. I'm also a fan of popular places with a vibrant atmosphere like Tortilla flats. Reading from previous reviews I heard this place tends to get crowded, making it difficult to be given a table. Normally, I don't care. And to my fortune or maybe my timing, got there at 6:30 on a Friday, only had to Â wait 20 mins to be seated. I ordered the Grapefruit Margarita and will admit, it was a very well balanced drink. Not too strong nor fruity. So I fell in love. Then I ordered the Enchilada de mole. I regret to say I wasn't satisfied with the meal. The plate itself was too bland and not very filling, meanwhile the price is another story, an unpleasant one. The coconut flan puzzled me a bit. Just because the flan has coconut flakes on it doesn't make it a coconut flan... Regardless of the confusion, it tasted delicious. But the portion was too small and this is not the first time i've had flan in Manhattan for the same price. Overall, I doubt I will be visiting to this place anytime soon : (
