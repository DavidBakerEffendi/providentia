Great MorningSpecial - only $2 for a double-egg-cheese on hard roll AND a coffee. The sandwich is great.They grill the roll and the cheese melts all over. The staff is friendly and the customers are happy. Most customers appear to be repeat clients. I go a few times a week. You can't beat $2. The lunch offerings are good quality and the prices are very reasonable.
