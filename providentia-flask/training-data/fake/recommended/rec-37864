I decided to visit Philadelphia. Of course, I neglected to visit the Barnes or the museum or art, nor did I eat a cheesesteak, but I did go to Zavino's and... I regret nothing that I did or didn't do this trip. It was a rainy night, I had forgotten my coat and umbrella back in the woods of upstate New York, and my friend and I were craving something vaguely Italian. I threw "pizza" into Yelp's search bar, and Zavino's was close, not obscenely expensive, and rated well. And it deserves its rating. First, we got calamari. It was delicious, slightly sweet from the balsamic and slightly bitter from the olives. Then we got the Polpettini. And without really thinking it over (how much money do I have? Not much.), I ordered us a bacon pizza. Everything was just fantastic. I'm going to be craving those veal, ricotta-filled meatballs for a long time. Josh, the bartender, was also fantastically friendly and diligent. I said I had no regrets, this was a lie. I regret that I couldn't tip him more.
