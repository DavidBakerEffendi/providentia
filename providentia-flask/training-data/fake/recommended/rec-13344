The wait time for the food sucks...but I still love this place! The pizzas were excellent...we had the buffalo chicken and prosciutto and arugula.  The wood-fired lasagna was okay.  My mom had the pappardelle Bolognese, it was nothing great.  Mussels in white wine was pretty good.  Try this restaurant if you are in the mood for pizza.
