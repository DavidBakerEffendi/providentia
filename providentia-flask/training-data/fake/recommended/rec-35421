Tonkatsu is one of those dishes that carries over well to the American Palate.  Rarely have I met a non-Japanese who couldn't get behind this deep-fried pork dish, assuming they eat pork, of course. Lots of Japanese and mixed-Asian restaurants have tonkatsu.  But it's rare to have a tonkatsu so good, I can't complain about some aspect of it.  Great tonkatsu comes from both the ingredients and the preparation and all too often, in many restaurants, one or both are inferior.   Katsuahama's regular Tonkatsu is absolutely amazing, nice and thick, and juicy on the inside while have a nice, light crunchy outside, and the tonkatsu sauce is just perfect.  If you like the pork a little fatty, they can arrange that too. They also have another version of Tonkatsu, using kuro-buta, which literally translates to black pork, referring to Berkshire pork.  It's to pork what wagyu/kobe is to beef.  And...damn....it's good. Over the passed 10 years, I've gone to New York about a half dozen times and this restaurant is another on my list of must-do's.  This restaurant has satisfied in quality every time.   What is there to complain about?  Oh yes, one thing...whenever I leave, I know it'll be two years before I can go back....
