I was super excited to try this place, and we finally did on my birthday. Unfortunately, I have to say that I've had better cocktails elsewhere. The welcome drink was a fabulous touch- and that drink actually was the best of all. The other drinks we ordered were either on the bitter side or were extremely potent. I would've loved more flavor or some uniqueness. I thought the place was a little over-rated. The decor, glasses and menu book was very interesting. We ordered fries and zucchini fritters- they were just about OK. Also, we had serious looking Â uninterested server.. so may be that added to the experience. Not sure if we'll go back.
