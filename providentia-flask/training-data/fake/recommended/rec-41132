My yak's brother and wife (both very much into good food and actually own a brewery and restaurant out west) were in town.  We got lucky with the reservation. Friday night style. Less Go.   To be short: It was a meal I'll never forget. Service: A+ Food: A+ Drinks: A++ (almost freakish pairings. Makes you realize what these somms do and how creative and next level they can really take a meal). Obviously it's expensive. You could do a lot of things with that kind of money. I could easily name a few dozen endeavors my yak and I could get involved in. You could hire Peter Cetera to give a private, acoustic solo concert in your living room for that kind of loot but we lost interest in Cetera's solo work after the "Glory of Love" era. Bottom line: If you want to do it, do it. It's incredible. GET THE DRINK PAIRINGS to take it to that special level of "WOW baby, let's get back to the house and watch one of those movies you like."
