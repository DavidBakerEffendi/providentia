The interior and staff were great, but the food was too poor to give it more than two stars. Let me acknowledge something positive. The staff was quite attentive and knowledgeable. Beer selection for what it is was pretty good (Corsendonk Brown, Stones Smoked Porter, Orval). Onto the food. My girlfriend and I had chosen burgers, which they have an option of five (pork and ginger, bison, ostrich, sirloin, lamb) different meats due to time constraint and to test the water. Â She wanted to try the dumplings with Mongolian sauce(?) which I knew would be of frozen fare with some kind of soy sauce side. And that's what we got, quick and tasteless. The burgers arrived, ostrich and bison. The meat was cooked well to my liking but was unfortunately thrown on a cold bun. Ostrich burger was bland and our fries were sad to look at and even more pathetic to try and consume. Hers were stale and mine (sweet potato) were flimsy and did not hold up to the recommendation from other reviewers. There was also some kind of cream cheese with garlic and basil that looked and tasted like paste, which at an early age of self discovery did not compare to my memory.
