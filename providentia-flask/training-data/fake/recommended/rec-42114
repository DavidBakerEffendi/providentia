A wonderful addition to the neighborhood.  Breakfast is a steal and the food is really tasty.  The restaurant attracts a very diverse mix of folks and is accommodating to all.  Servers are all friendly... I've been living around the corner for almost 5 years and this is a really welcome break from the Vanderbilt scene.
