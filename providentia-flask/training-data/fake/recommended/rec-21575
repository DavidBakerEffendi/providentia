We went here before a Philles game this past weekend. It was pretty good. I would not rave about it. They were very nice, the sandwiches came out fast considering how busy they were. The flavor was good. Not super juicy or overly flavorful. It wasn't disappointing, but there is too much great food at the market for me to go back here.
