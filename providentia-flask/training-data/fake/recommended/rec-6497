I'm very stingy with 5 stars, but this place earns my 5 with fab food, friendly service and appealing ambience. Four of us sampled about 10 menu items, so I feel we got a good sampling of the kitchen's skill at producing dishes loaded with flavor and eye appeal. Also, despite the good press, the restaurant is welcoming and friendly and did not rush us, even though we took our sweet time enjoying the food and company.   As for food, the daily special ceviche -- with lime and hot chiles -- just burst with flavor and texture, really exceptional.  The DIY hommos was good but not exceptional (although the light, puffy bread was exceptionally addictive).  The fried cauliflower went down real easy, even for those non-cauliflower fans.  All in all, very enjoyable food and a casual, welcoming ambiance.
