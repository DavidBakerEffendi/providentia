When I first moved to Philly I lived a block away from Nanzhou! It became my go to place, mostly due to my hectic work and 1st year graduate school schedule! After working an 8 hour day and sitting in lecture for 4 hours, I didn't really feel much like cooking. Nanzhou is cheap, quick, and good! Best of all with all the different choices of proteins and vegetables it's hard to get sick of this place! I think the hardest decision is making the choice between hand-drawn or shaved noodles... Personally I'm a big fan of hand-drawn, but go ahead and experiment it's less than $10!
