Visited the Drunken Munkey with high expectations given the feedback on line ----and can confirm that praise is well deserved. Cozy , intimate and fun atmosphere , Food that is flavorful and has a home cooked feel versus the usual Indian restaurant fare; is well presented and comes plated . Â  Being open late is a huge plus and we will definitely be frequent visitors.
