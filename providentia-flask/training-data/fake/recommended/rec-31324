Ladurée is probably the most famous macaron shop in the world, so if you enjoy macarons, this is a not-to-miss stop.  Thankfully, there's a location in New York. Service:  It will seem super slow as you wait in a 20-30 minute line on a nice day, but the people behind the counter are very kind and will patiently explain the different flavors (probably hundreds of times in one day). Ambience: It's a bloom of pastel colors that will leave you in awe of these Marie Antoinette macarons. Food: The texture of these macarons are divine, and there is a large selection of interesting flavors And there are also some Hello Kitty memorabilia in the non-macaron section.
