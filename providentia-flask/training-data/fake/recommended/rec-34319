What a pleasant evening.  The staff were all so pleasant and attentive. The food is really terrific. They had live music which I was afraid would be too loud, but it just made the experience more special.  You can tell that the owners really care and try to make everyone have the best experience.  Prices are great too and it's BYOB. Top notch all the way.
