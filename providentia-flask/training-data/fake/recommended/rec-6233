Great food, attentive patient service (actual Greek waiters) & lovely Mediterranean decor. They bring warm bread & eggplant dip to start, delicious! We had 2 differently named salads to share as starters, very nice though somewhat redundant. I had the lamb chops & they were extremely good. The waiter was happy to make a vegetable substitution when I was ordering my dish as I didn't care for one component. My companion had a whole fish dish which they de-boned & rendered headless & tailless as per his request he thoroughly enjoyed it along with 2 orders of lemon roasted potatoes, I guess they were tasty. I always look forward to grilled octopus when I have Greek food but I'm sorry to say it was dried out, small, & flavorless; totally disappointing. I had a glass of retsina and it was mildly resiny which I very much liked because some can be a bit too strong, followed by red wine with the lamb of course. It has a romantic vibe although the tables are a bit close together. Also suitable for dining solo at the big marble communal table in the back, I imagine that could be fun for a big group or for maybe chatting with other solo diners... I usually go to Uncle Nick's when I want Greek but I kind of like this better because of the ambiance (Uncle Nick's has none) and waiters (these have some personality & are attractive + well dressed), although the octopus is killer @ UN's & they have inexpensive carafes of decent Retsina. I would definitely go back to Pylos & next time request my Oktapodi "tender".
