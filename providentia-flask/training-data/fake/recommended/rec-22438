Fogo is a mans dream come true. For a set price you can get unlimited amount of steak. Is there anything better in life? The service is top notch, the drinks are great, the desserts are even high class if you have room left. The house special, the filet, the parm crusted pork are some of my favorites. The lamb chops are by far my favorite though. You can not go wrong with Fogo. It is probably my favorite restaurant of all time.
