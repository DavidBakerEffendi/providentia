I've come here twice since really yearning for some Pho.  The first time we came we had a group of 5 and the service was pretty terrible.  It took an extremely long time to get our food.  So to put it in perspective, under NO circumstances should any restaurant take this long to serve food.  Seriously, it's pho...it is supposed to come out fast. The second time we came it was a much smaller group...of 3.  The service had some improvements and the food was even better than the first time we came.  I understand it is fairly new and I was happy to see the improvements.  They still need to work on being a bit more attentive to what people order and making sure you don't fail twice in a row.  2.5 stars.
