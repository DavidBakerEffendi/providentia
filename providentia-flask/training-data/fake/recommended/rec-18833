Stopped in here for lunch today and found it very enjoyable.  The downstairs dining area was very small and therefore I slightly suspected that maybe the food would not be all that great.  Fortunately that was an inaccurate notion. My wife and I shared the chips w chipotle guacamole. This guac rivals that of El Vez.  I usually prefer a bucket of sour cream to accompany my nachos/chips.  The guacamole at Pistolas was creamy and the chipotle sauce dressed neatly on top set this app off. For our entrees, I had the spicy pork quesadillas and the wife selected the chicken tinga tacos.  Both portions were of very good size.  In fact, in hindsight we could have split one meal to go with our app since this was a lunch visit.  Both entrees were very delicious but I think the quesadilla is the victor here.  This was absolutely delicious! Service was nothing out of the ordinary.  The food did come out after a not very long wait and water glasses never hit E.  Just not overly friendly, but we will pass them on attentiveness. Now if you gulped down a few glasses of water like I did, be prepared to climb three or four flights of stairs to hit the restroom.  I am thinking that there may have been another restroom that was out of order but this was the only game in town during this particular experience.  One very small bathroom with a mirror hung low enough to admire your mid section and nothing higher... This place is worth a visit and got the feeling that it could be a fun weekend spot!
