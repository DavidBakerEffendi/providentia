We've been going to the Cozy for 20 years.  Under the new-ish owners, the food has been improved and updated.  It looks old-fashioned, and it is, in a very nice way.  I often get their salads, which are outstanding!  My husband loves the cobb salad and I get the chicken over Italian; both enough for two meals. Burgers and sandwiches are ok, more like a diner's, but main courses are terrific.  Unassuming, but great.
