This is more of a 3.5 star place, but three stars will have to do.  I liked my Classic Umami burger, but my dining companion found his truffle burger a little too salty.  He also deemed the truffle fries we ordered on the salty side as well; I agreed.  Meanwhile, the house salad was pretty good, with a strong umami flavor in the house dressing.  Sure, the Umami burger was a little salty, but I liked the kick and taste; its flavor was distinct, and perhaps slightly reminiscent of oyster sauce.  Anyway, I'd go again, but was a little underwhelmed after all the hype.
