What a great place especially for the summer! Walked in and was helped right away. The decor is simple and the food speaks for itself. Had the taco of the day - salmon fish tacos and the thai calamari. Â Portions were extremely good and everything tasted on point. The calamari sauce was a bit too sweet for my own liking (rather have a spicy sauce) and will do the house calamari with the aoili next time... regardless it was delicious since it came out so quickly. The salmon was lightly battered and the pickled onions to replace the salsa made it even better. Definitely a must go... will try the fish and chips next time!
