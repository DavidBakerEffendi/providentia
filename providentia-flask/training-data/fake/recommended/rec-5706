A friend suggested this place, so i went.  Very cool/ trendy decor so that was a plus, seems like a cool meet up spot for friends before a night out.  The drink menu was eclectic (which is refreshing) the dinner menu was also very diverse.  I ordered the fillet mignon it was delicious but all and all the portions were more "lady sized".  But then again the waitress kinda of described the food as tapas style so no big surprise there.  Next time ill go with more people and we will all order different things and share!!
