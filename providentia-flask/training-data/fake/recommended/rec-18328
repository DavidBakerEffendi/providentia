Miles Table is awesome!  It is a nice, friendly, casual neighborhood cafe that is great for brunch and open earlier in the morning than most brunch places.  The food here is really good and the service is fast.  It's a bit small though, so if you come at a popular time on a weekend, you will have trouble seating a party of four.  The specials are usually really interesting dishes.   One criticism I would give is that (at least the last time I visited), they did not have a regular pancake dish on the menu.  They only have it as an occasional special.  That doesn't make sense to me.  Regardless, this is one of the best places to get brunch in Graduate Hospital.
