The worst ! The staff is the real let down.  Our server was nasty.  The attitude was unbelievable... wish I could remember her name.  We had been waiting at our table for a welcome from our server for over 20 minutes. Finally my husband asked one of the table prep guys to please get our waitress and when she came over she had the biggest attitude as if she was doing us a favor of some sort... After taking our order she then went out of her way not to ask how we were doing as we waited another 40 mins. for our food, but she pampered everyone else she was serving. We are not the type to require a lot of attention, but it was obvious that some how we had offended her.  We ordered the Brooklyn Crab Royal for Two, which is a heck of a lot of food so we didn't mind the 40 min wait, but when it finally come out  it was cold! and the crab was dried out! Then we asked to speak with the manager and she came to the table with, yet again, an attitude and approached us with "what's the problem ?" not  nicely like "how may I help you?" She was just RUDE, RUDE,RUDE ! She then touched the food, understood that it was cold and then took the food back for a re-fire.  My husband and I just looked at each other in complete shock, because of the lack of customer service.  We left our table, spoke to the manger again, who then was more congenial when she saw that we were going to walk out. She offered to refund the cost of our drinks (one lemonade, and a root beer) and to prepare our order for take out but we decided to leave. To be fair, we have been to the Brooklyn Crab once before and had a lovely time.  We just had a really bad encounter this last visit, but we will not go back anytime soon, if at all.   In addition, I lived in Maine for five years... I know what fresh seafood taste like and the seafood at Brooklyn Crab is not fresh, it's very much frozen! But hey, on the brighter side, I give it a 4/5 for the great views!
