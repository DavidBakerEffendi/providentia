Wow, some scathing reviews here. Maybe it's me, but the three times I've been to Sonny's, I thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Â I've never experienced a line - even the day of the Phillies parade, it's indoors, there's a television...oh yeah and the steaks aren't bad either. I'm a fan of Pat's and Geno's, but there are just some times when you don't want to wait 20 minutes for a cheesesteak. Also, in terms of convenience, this place gets points. Is it the best cheesesteak I've ever had? No. In fact, I went in May and went back last week (Halloween) and it actually seemed like the steak was smaller than the last trip. Of course, that could also be my brain playing tricks after spending several hours in a sea of drunken enjoyment at the parade. Who knows? But it's worth the trip and you can do a lot worse when in Philadelphia.
