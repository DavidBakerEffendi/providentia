I went to Scannicchio's on Saturday night with my family. It was good, solid italian food...not my absolute favorite BYO italian place in Philly, but it was good enough to make our trip worthwhile and I'm not opposed to going back. The appetizers were the best part -- the grilled romaine, sausage with figs, caesar salad -- they were all fantastic. We all ordered pasta as our main course. Although I'm not sure if the bread, pasta and sauces were home-made, the meals were solid. Â The staff were incredibly friendly and our waitress gave us free lemoncello after our meal.
