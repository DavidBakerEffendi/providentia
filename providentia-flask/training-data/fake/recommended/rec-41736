I've never gotten delivery here because it's relatively close to my house, but these tacos are damn delicious. You might have to stalk some people that are getting ready to leave to get a seat in this tiny place, but the tacos are worth it. Everything is good. The margaritas were okay and kind of overpriced, so not really worth it. No worries though, I will happily come here just for their delicious tacos.
