We came here on Saturday night for the second time, and it made us wonder why we don't get over here more often. Waitstaff is really nice, 2 for 1 martinis that are delicious (cucumber and ginger at the top of our list). I had the tuna steak which was cooked to perfection and my bf had the rack of lamb which was beautiful. The meal was so good we were in a state of bliss the whole night. I wish this joint was in my neighborhood!
