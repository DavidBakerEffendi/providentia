The entree was terrible! The Rosemary Chicken was covered in thick, greasy skin and cut very poorly, making it extremely difficult to get the meat off the bone. The garlic mashed potatoes were overpowering with garlic (I had to swish water and wine around my mouth several times to get rid of the dominating garlic). The ambiance and the BYOB aspect are the only reason it gets 2 stars. If they get a new chef, I may re-visit and re-rate them.
