Perfectly delicious, greasy breakfast food for next to no money. How can you go wrong? It was so good I went two days in a row, spent $10 both days, and was almost unable to keep down the amount of food they gave me both times. The old-fashioned atmosphere is great; it's like turning back the hands of time just walking in the door. The first time I had 2 eggs with hash, toast, and home fries for $5.50. It was so much food I almost puked it back up (which would have been unfortunate, since it had been so good going down). The second time I had a bacon, egg, and cheese for $3.49. She asks if I want home fries for an additional $1.50. Well shit, if you're gonna twist my arm like that, I guess so. FYI, it's a small place, so it can get really packed. If you're willing to sit at the counter instead of requiring one of the seven(?) booths they have, you'll have a better chance of not waiting terribly long. Suggestions for the Quaker Diner: 1) Offer pitchers of drinks. Sometimes people get thirsty. 2) Take credit cards. It's really cute how you take personal checks, but seriously, it's 2011 (even if it's still 1931 inside the diner). 3) Steal the Dunkin Donuts' recipe for iced coffee, because yours isn't very good.
