I think our slightly negative experience was mostly our own fault, so I am certainly willing to return and will probably rate Frankie's higher then. After having drinks and snacks at nearby Prime Meats, my friend and I came to Frankie's for dinner, except that neither of us was particularly hungry. So we ordered a few vegetable sides (cauliflower and sunchokes), the fennel salad, a bowl of olives and the meat tasting board. We also each had a glass of the house red wine. We were seated, mind you, after coming in over an hour and a half earlier to put our name on the list; I do like that they will take your phone number and call you when a table is ready. The food was fairly good and the service was prompt, but the meal just wasn't that satisfying. Next time I will be sure to order a pasta dish, which seems to be the way to go here. The host was a master at turning over the table once we were done. Within minutes of the waitress clearing our plates, he came to get our empty wine glasses.
