It's a bar named after a U2 album; how can you go wrong? Now, I'm not a beer or a bar guy -- but my friends are and I was incredibly impressed by the rotating selection here. For $8 or $12, you can drink a beer "flight" consisting of four 4 oz. pours of the beers of your choice from the menu.  This menu is constantly in flux, so you'll never try everything! I enjoyed a Crispin cider and had a blast hanging with my friends.  It was booming at 5:30 PM on a Saturday evening and the Yankees/Sox game was on rain delay. Service was fantastic and the waitresses we met were adorable.  If I ever get into beer, I would definitely do a flight.  Otherwise, it was a nice, laid back place to drink in an excellent location.
