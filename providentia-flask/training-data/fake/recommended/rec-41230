This isn't a place you go to to get good Korean food. I don't normally go here to eat but to drink. The fact that they sell food is a plus because you'll probably need something to eat while drinking. My friends and I typically drink here because no one has to wait on you and you don't have to worry about tipping. But remember if you are buying soju, sake or wine, the cashier will ask you how many people are at your table and you will have to go back to your table and bring everyone's ID to get cups. Try to bring the IDs before hand.
