We had gone to Little Fish on our first date at the old location, so a visit to the new one seemed quite appropriate for our anniversary. Still very cozy, but somewhat more polished than the old location. Our waitress was attentive but not intrusive, and even accounted for my fiancee's nut allergy by bringing us olive oil with the bread rather than the house pesto. For appetizers, she enjoyed scallops with a apple-potato gratin and bacon marmalade. The accompaniments had a pleasant smoky-sweet vibe that played nicely with the perfectly cooked and very tender scallops. I enjoyed king crab with rice noodles and broth, which was sort of a grown-ramen. The noodles still having a very slight bite provided a pleasant contrast to the crab and the broth, which was deeply flavorful with the right amount of spiciness. For main courses, she had striped based with braised romaine and bagna cauda. Tiny croutons added textural contrast to the very clean flavors of the dish. I felt that the real highlight was the sturgeon, perfectly cooked, with gigande beans punctuated by crispy cubes of pork belly and spinash with a happily subtle mustard sauce. A truly delightful evening with the best seafood to be found in Philly. We haven't been to Fish yet, but find it hard to imagine it besting this gem. (We opted to skip dessert due to prominence of nuts in the dishes, but enjoyed crepes down the block at Beau Monde.)
