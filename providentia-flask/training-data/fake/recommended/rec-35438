Really good, classy and chill place for great Italian food. I have been here several times now and love to go back. Appetizers are nice, there is even a menu just for olive oil. Entrees can be either pasta or something fish/meat - all are amazing. Desserts - get the afogato. Service is Â friendly. Only minor thing is that you cannot have reservations after 6.30pm and because it is so popular, you sometimes have to wait, esp on weekend days. But that's something I can live with. (we usually go to Naked Chocolate for coffee or pre-dessert while we wait). Oh and it's cash only.
