Atmosphere, food, and service were all first-rate. Had to send my Salmon Benedict back for the eggs being overcooked, and they redid it without drama despite being slammed. Hollandaise was the perfect consistency, and the salmon melted in my mouth. Outstanding, and my "not good for kids" rating is meant as a compliment.
