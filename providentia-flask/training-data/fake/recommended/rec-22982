Location: First of all, I love a restaurant named after its location and you can find Church and Main, well, on the corner of Church and Main Streets. There has been a good deal of turnover with establishments at this location but upon my first visit there the other day I hope it stays so I can enjoy other items on the menu. Inside you will find seating at the bar and along the side window. There are tables in the back of the restaurant. Finally, there is outside seating. If the weather is just right, nothing beats sitting outside on Church Street to dine. The staff set up a table for my party by making room for a new space. I felt a little like Henry Hill in Goodfellas, where, snap, a table pops up in a primo spot just because I arrived. Food: For an appy, I had the "Point Judith Calamari," which was dusted with rice flour and bathed in a delicious ginger sweet chili glaze. This was a unique presentation of calamari and one of the best I've had in Vermont (the best, IMHO, is "Fred's Calamari" at Julio's in Montpelier (I don't know who Fred is but I'd love to shake his hand and thank him...I digress...)). For supper I enjoyed one of the specials for the evening: the pan seared trout served with a cold potato/green bean salad. The trout was spectacular. I was making the male equivalent of Sally from When Harry Met Sally sounds while eating the trout and all these theatrics marginalized the cold salad from my palette's radar. Price: An appy, the trout special, and two vodka tonics later I'm in for about $55. While a little on the pricey side the quality and presentation of the food is manifest. I can't wait to go back!
