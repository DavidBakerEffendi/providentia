I almost feel bad writing this review for the now famous Tommy DiNic's, the darling of the Travel Channel and other foodie-centric television programming. Bourdain raved about it. Adam Richman crowned it the "Best Sandwich in America". While I wanted to check out all of the wonderful goodness that Reading Terminal Market offers, DiNic's was the reason why I came. It was my mission. And what I had was a very very good sandwich. But the best sandwich I've ever had? Not quite. Since the wife and I strategically decided to get to RTM early, we were able to find a spot to sit at the counter together with little hassle. We ordered the famed Roast Pork with the traditional toppings of sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. The wife and I decided to split one since we wanted didn't want to over-indulge ourselves here and not try anything else at RTM. The nice lady who took our order understood this, and served us each a 1/2 sandwich. The bread was, as expected in Philly, fantastic. The pork had a nice flavor but I thought it was just a bit on the dry side. I thought the broccoli rabe would help with that, but not quite. The sharp provolone used is excellent however, and that is really what gave the sandwich a kick to the next level. I certainly was not disappointed - it was very tasty and just eating at DiNic's in RTC is an experience unto itself. But next time, I'd change it up and probably get roasted peppers on it. The bartender at our hotel (Latham) doesn't eat pork, but said that the roast beef there is one of his favorite sandwiches. So maybe I'll give that a try in the future. I'll be the oddball who goes to DiNic's and doesn't order the "best sandwich in America". I'm good with that.
