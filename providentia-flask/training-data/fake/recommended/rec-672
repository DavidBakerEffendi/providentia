Stopped here to eat on the way back to our hotel. It's the average burger joint with a twist on toppings and the beef  & hotdogs are organic. I had the chicken hotdog stuffed with apples and onion rings and both were good. The onion rings are huge. My husband had  the brisket burger and fries. He said it was alright. We didn't try their custard.
