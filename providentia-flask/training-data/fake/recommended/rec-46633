This place had delicious burgers with a variety of yummy toppings (e.g., truffled mushrooms!). Also the duck fat fries were good and they have an assortment of homemade pickled items. Very neat location and ambiance. Be sure to get there early, or be prepared to wait, Â as they place is small and seating is limited.
