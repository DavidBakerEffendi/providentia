Dinner & Broadway show was the goal.   Only went to this restaurant a few months back because it was convenient to where my wife works.   I seldom am critical of service when judging an overall experience of a restaurant.  Nevertheless this was one of those exceptions.   I had a waiter who had no sense of accountability, who mistook my order because he was too "cooool" to not use a note pad.  When the main course came out I noticed he misunderstood the order, and I addressed it.  I would have eaten it had I not been allergic to lobster.  Nevertheless he insisted that I ordered the dish which I'm highly allergic too and walked away with an attitude.  From their on the service was awkward and slow.   This all happened during a slow time of the day, I can't fathom how worse the service could have been if this kid was swamped. I eventually ended up getting the Branzino I originally tried to order which was nothing special, just like everything else we ordered.   We expected so much more from this place and we're unfortunately let down.  Hope your experience is different... Ohhh and Wicked the musical was amazing!
