Let the naysayers nay!   I love a good burger...to the point that when I've had a bad one, I've made one at home the next day (and once the same night).  For me, a good burger place is all about consistency and I will take a burger place that scores an 8 with me every single time I go, over a place that I had a 10 at ONCE, any day.   I have been to the Corner Bistro countless times (seriously, I have no idea how many times I've been there, maybe 50?) and every time I've gone there I've had a very good-to-great burger.  I've been to Five Guys, I've been to Burger Joint, I've been to Royale, I've been to Pop Burger, I've been to Daddy-O..all multiple times; and I can honestly say the Corner Bistro's burger keeps me coming back.   (Seriously, what's so special about Five Guys?  The fact that you can put jalapenos on your burger?  Seriously, somebody tell me)   The burgers are cooked to temperature (a major pet peeve of mine is over-cooked burgers.  When I order a Medium-rare burger, that's what I want.  A burger that's fairly pink inside and cooked to no-more than 140 degrees F.  If I was concerned about possibly getting sick from eating undercooked meat, I wouldn't order my burgers Medium-rare, but I'm not, so I do); the beers are cheap and the fries are pretty good.   If you want to put 4 toppings on your burger and you want curly sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo and an Appletini, then maybe the Corner Bistro isn't your kind of place.  If you want a burger that tastes good and crispy fries, then head on over.   Don't bother with the chicken or the chili; order a Bistro Burger, a plate of fries and a McSorley's Dark...$12 bucks later, you're fat and happy!
