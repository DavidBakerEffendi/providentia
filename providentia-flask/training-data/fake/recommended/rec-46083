So wow! We had high expectations when we read other reviews about this place and we left fulfilled. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was a very quiet, small place to eat. The staff was very polite and did a great job. They tried to speak tagalog to me, but they unfortunately didn't know that I speak more cantonese than i do tagalog (I'm Â chinese/filipino). I had the "crispy chicken", which I would describe as a a Thai/Malaysian coconut curry chicken dish. I kid you not, I ate that dish clean! The one thing I did not like was the small serving of rice it came with. I'm sure if you're Asian you would understand since it's the staple of most Asian dishes. My wife had bistek (they called it something else on the menu, but I know well enough what it was). The beef was flavorful though a little tough, so that was another downside. We're adding this to the list of local places we like. Cheers!
