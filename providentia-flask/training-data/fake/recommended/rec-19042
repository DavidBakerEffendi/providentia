I'm really sorry to give this place one star as I really really wanted to like it and was so excited to see something new & different come to the neighborhood. However, my experience here definitely doesn't warrant more than one star...we arrived on a Sunday night and were seated right away which was nice. The place was full, but it's small with only about 20-25 seats and 3 staff members to work the tables. The waitress seemed a little nervous and stressed but took our order of 2 appetizers and 2 mains. She came back to tell us they were out of the satay appetizer, which was totally fine by us, and we got our drinks ( Coke and homemade ginger tea, which was not too exciting). Then there was nothing. Nothing nothing nothing for almost an hour, during which we see other tables get seated and served before us. I ask for our food and am told it'll be ready in 3 minutes. 6 minutes later we still have nothing on the table so we get up and leave. The waitress comes over saying that the food is almost ready and will be out in a minute but by then my patience with this place was over. I understand they're new and have kinks to work out but to me this is unacceptable, especially since there wasn't even a hint of an excuse or acknowledgement that they screwed up. Maybe I'll go back in a few months but sadly I am really disappointed by the place and the lack of engagement. Hipster staff looks cute but it doesn't make up for not doing their job.
