There was definitely potential, the place is cute and in an easily accessible location. However, the wait staff rushed our perusal of the menu. Then were curt with our questions. I ended up ordering the Pappardelle Ai Sapori sans asparagus, considering most ingredient list include the ingredient that is used the most first I was expecting more than 2 medium shrimp and no peas, and a garden full of mushrooms. When I asked another server because our waiter was no where to be found, I was told the $26 item always comes with 2 shrimp. I understand seafood is expensive but understanding the homemade pasta was store bought I definitely expected a full protein serving. My friend ordered the Pollo Sapori with sauce on the side but received veggies drenched in butter sauce. I'd say the entire experience left something to be desired. Needless to say I will not be returning.
