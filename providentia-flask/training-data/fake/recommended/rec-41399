Four course prix fixe for $35 is a super deal. BYO is certainly helpful. Atmosphere is interesting, in a living room of a brownstone. The AC didn't seem to work as expected so we all took our shirts off. No. No we didn't. But it was a relief to get outside (which was cooler.....in August). Â Food was very good - dessert was baller. I'd go back.
