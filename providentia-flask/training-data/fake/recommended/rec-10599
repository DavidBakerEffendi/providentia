Every time I visit my cousin I request we go to this place. I love the seasonal menu options and even though the menu is small I always have a hard time deciding. It's a great place to bring a small group (4 or less) with varying breakfast tastes. (my cousin is a vegetarian, but I am certainly not.) They have limited booths and tables, but plenty of counter service space if you don't want to wait. Their fresh juice options are delicious and the omelets delicious. I often wonder how they get the eggs so thin on the omelet. Seriously its like an egg crepe. Oh and definable don't miss the opportunity to try the plum jelly on EVERYTHING. It's great on bread, but also delicious on the cheesy grits.
