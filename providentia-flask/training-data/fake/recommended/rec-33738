Ate here as an alternative to 30th Street Station fare on a two hour stop-over. Cannot recommend at all for the food. Turkey dinner is more like 3-4 smal pieces of turkey on one piece of toast. The turkey was good, but was less than an appetizer portion. The waitperson also got my order wrong as I ordered the additional ceasar, but she substituted the salad for the mashed. The salad was over dressed with way too much vinegar in the dressing; and the roll was stale. I then ordered the mac and cheese, which looked ok and the crumb topping was hot from the salamander, but then the center was still refrigerator cold. At least the iced tea was good, the staff was helpful and the beer selection looked good, but all in all, a culnary disaster.
