Okay, for a diner, the food was better than other diner's I've been to.  But considering it wasn't typical diner-faire, I'll compare it (not the atmosphere) to a restaurant.  I did not go to the club...my boyfriend and I were starving and ate here prior to going to a metal show at the Electric Factory earlier this week.   To be honest...I wasn't impressed.  I've seen this place on Food Network's Diners Drive-ins and Dives and was extremely curious.   My boyfriend got the roast beef french dip with au-jus.  ...the meat was dry and the roll seemed stale (I tried a bite).  I ordered the "Baked Macaroni and Cheese" and the tomato soup with cheese bread.  So, putting a piece of dense bread in the middle of soup and dumping some parm on it makes it "cheese bread"?  And I'm sorry, but BAKED mac and cheese isn't soupy.  It tasted like stove-top cooked mac and cheese that was put into an oven with some bread crumbs to make the top slightly crunchy.  If it had been advertised just as mac and cheese, it would have passed (slightly), but it wasn't baked.   But maybe I'm just too picky. I will admit, that having a bar in the diner is nice, considering I love alcohol.  But the food was nothing special.  And it was way over-priced.  Does their menu change?  ...because a lot of the dishes mentioned on Diner's drive-ins and dives weren't on the menu...at least not that I remember.   I wasn't all too impressed with the service, either.  They acted more like they were interested in themselves instead of the customers.  Perhaps it's because we were there in the early evening...but that shouldn't matter.
