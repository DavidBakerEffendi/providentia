Everything is relative right? It's unfair that I try Terakawa after I've tried a lot of amazing ramen places in LA and NYC. I ordered the house ramen. It had a really strange scent! And it wasn't just me. The other two people I ate with (I like to eat with strangers) said the same thing. I found the broth too salty for my taste. Service is impeccable, though. And the stools really fit my butt nicely. I wish they served alcohol (sake and beer specifically) but it is BYOB, which is nice, but it sucks because I don't want to always bring my own beer!
