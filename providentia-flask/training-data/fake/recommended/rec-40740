Smashing place. They serve Strongbow at a nice price, the menu is good and every order comes quickly.... BUT Â I just wish they would chill out on those fries. i mean, i love fries, but if im ordering a burger, 80% of the plate is fries. im all for more food, but i would take a small portion of crispy frenchies over a oversized slab of wet and soggy strings of potatoes.
