They don't take reservations and the wait is incredibly long (think 2 hrs +). Food tastes ok but of course my expectation would be higher if I wait longer, just not worth it. Plus, we were even willing to sit at the bar instead of at a table. Poached eggs are fine, not different from other places, Nutella french toast is too sweet for my taste but apparently is a popular choice.
