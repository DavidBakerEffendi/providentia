Loved this place. Fabrizio, the owner, is delightful (and so damn cute) and the food is equally warm and inviting. He immediately suggested a wonderful red wine that was perfect to warm my friend and I on a cold night. We ordered oysters and the pork belly croquettes (previously sampled at an edible mag event that we fell in love with) and a full Branzino. Everything was beyond delicious and we were very comfortable- despite the annoying make-out couple near by. I will definitely visit again.
