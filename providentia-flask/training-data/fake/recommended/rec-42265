I hardly ever write reviews, but felt compelled to this time. I used to love this restaurant, the fried chicken is amazing. Service was always top notch and not too crowded if you go early. But unfortunately the owners ended the lease on Blue Ribbon Sushi next door and decided to merge the 2 restaurants together. What has resulted is an overly crowded restaurant unable to keep up with the the flow of customers and level of service. Our waiter, who seemed very inexperienced, didn't come by for at least 15 minutes. He then forgot to give us menus and proceeded to tell us specials and then asked us, "is there anything else I can get you?" We told him he can give us some menus! It then took over 30 mins to get our appetizers and more than an hour for the food. When I walked through the restaurant on the way to the restroom I noticed many tables who were still waiting for their food. Once we got our order, however, the taste and quality did live up to it's standards. Other waitstaff did also come by to check how the food was, etc, but I was still really disappointed at how different the restaurant felt prior to the merge. Blue Ribbon Sushi was a pretty nice restaurant, with it's own decor and setting, and it's a shame to see it water downed to a side menu at the Brasserie. Last but not least, the busboy clearing the table dropped utensils twice on me and my daughter when clearing the table. Thank goodness one was just a butter knife and not a steak knife! He tried to apologize but was so embarassed just ran away after the second time! I'm not sure if they just got a bunch of new waitstaff, but I was pretty appalled. C'mon Blue Ribbon guys - you gotta work on training - while you're at it, bring back Blue Ribbon Sushi!!
