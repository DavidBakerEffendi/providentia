Balls of meat so simple, yet so damn good. I've had them in hero form, naked, in a salad, over pasta.  No matter what way you have them, you know you're getting something good.  So good, so juicy, and so damn sexy. The way to go is classic beef, or spicy pork and any type of tomato sauce.  So many options, and you've keep going back to try them all.
