This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. A hidden gem. Went here again last night. I had the gluten free spicy penne, so yummy. They have GF pasta's and pizzas and bread! My family and friends can also eat "normal" food here which they love as well. The artichoke appetizer is a perfect starter. I usually split a salad as well. The wine list is small but it's good wine. The owner, Anthony, has always been so nice and always remembers you. I highly recommend this place.
