Having DJ'd off Broad st. in a few choice neighborhoods near Cambria and Germantown in North Philly, I'm surprised at other reviews saying this location is less than desireable.  This in fact is quite Disneyland like in contrast.  We had a great time at this place and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We started with a pizza with an egg on it which initially had me scratching my head but it proved to be quite delicuious.  Next with a Feasant lasagna, which at first I thought my taste gamey buit was very chicken like and moist.  Service was adept and attentive.  Overall great...but not over the top amazing.
