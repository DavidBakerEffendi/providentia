Underwhelming. The first time, during restaurant week, I had the etouffe, which I actually quite enjoyed. The seafood was plentiful and flavorful, and the Cajun spices were subtle (I had been afraid that it would be too spicy for me, but it ended up being perfect). Unfortunately, there were pieces of rice that tasted undercooked, and the sauce wasn't well mixed with the rice. The edamame dumplings were surprisingly good, but seriously overpriced for 3 dumplings. The chocolate chip bread pudding was quite good though a tad bit too sweet for me (I don't like sweet things), and I especially liked the light whipped cream that it was served with. All in all, I was satisfied with my meal, though not blown away. The second time, I ordered the mixed grill, which came with Salmon and mulloway. I chose to get it with the sweet potato. The dish came with two sizable portions of fish for $29, but I was not particularly impressed by either fish. The mulloway, which had been highly recommended by the waiter, was bland, and the salmon was good, but not melt-in-my-mouth good (like Elements). Both were just simply grilled. Certainly not worth the price tag. I don't really get the hype over Blue Point. It's a safe choice but nothing phenomenal, and I'd actually prefer to go to a standby like Teresa's than Blue Point if I was looking to impress. Â The prices might have been worth it during restaurant week, but on its own, it's certainly an overpriced, underperforming option.
