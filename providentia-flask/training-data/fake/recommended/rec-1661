I remember visiting Pat's when I toured through Philadelphia last Spring.  Upon seeing this place on the travel channel and hearing about it on countless occasions, I knew I had to try this place along with Geno's Steaks.  Although Pat's is not as boisterous with the multiple signs as Genos, they do offer a very good steak sandwich.  I ordered two "wit whizzes, wit peppas n onions."  Those two did not disappoint at all.  The portions were on par and the flavor with the sandwich was perfect as well.  I chose Pat's over Geno's because of the wider variety of toppings they offer.  My only wish is that they slice their beef the same way Geno's does.  If Geno's offered more toppings, their sandwiches would trump Pat's IMHO.
