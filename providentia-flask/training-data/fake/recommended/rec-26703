The wifey and I came here for an early-evening dinner on a Tuesday, so it wasn't crowded at all.  We were seated immediately - let me finish - between two cramped-ass tables, so it actually felt like a bustling Friday night. Service was very good, and the food was incredible, with one exception - there was a hair in their (otherwise pretty delicious) olive butter.  Wifey was rightfully alarmed, but decided to keep it to herself.  It was clear they noticed, because new butter was brought out and dessert was on the house, without any awkward "uh, there's a dead guy in my soup" conversation. For the meal: artichoke appetizer was great, and the orecchiette with spicy sausage and broccoli rabe was really well done.  The scallops were also perfectly cooked and super tasty.  Unless you have a bigger group, I'd recommend passing on the assorted meats and cheeses (but definitely get one or more of their pretty excellent olive oils). Minus one star for the hair.  I mean, it's a hair.
