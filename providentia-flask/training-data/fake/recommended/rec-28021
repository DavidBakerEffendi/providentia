I'm one of those people who is wary of food from street carts. I also feel like some places are overly hyped, that I'm let down when I finally try it. BUT THIS WAS SO GOOD. Admittedly, this was my first time eating halal meat. Once I took my first bite, I thought, "Why did I wait this long to try it out?!" I ordered the chicken and rice, and I covered it in the white sauce. I think the chicken has enough flavor where it could stand alone, but that white sauce...it's a week later and I'm still thinking about it! Loved that it came with pita bread as well. The line moves relatively fast. The Halal Guys is a well-oiled machine; once I placed my order, I received it in less than 15 seconds. Cash only! A great deal for the price. I already want more.
