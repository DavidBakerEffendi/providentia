How this place gets negative reviews is beyond me. I've had a lot of burgers in my time, and this was arguably top 5 best burgers I've ever had. Burger was cooked perfectly, you could tell that the meat was high quality, they didn't short us on the toppings, I mean even the bun was delicious. I also really liked the decor of the place, good mix of retro burger place, but not so much that it felt too old school. I mean come on, how can you not like a place that serves alcoholic shakes with their burgers? Hey if people don't like this place by all means go somewhere else, more Burger Baby for the rest of us
