SOOO GOOD!!!! We all 4 people enjoyed our breakfast. The place was also very nice and nicely kept. I had a breakfast burrito that tasted so fresh and no heavy at all for an early meal. My friends had some scrambled eggs & turkey bacon, and pancakes, and they were so good that I had to try them as well... Let me tell you, I've eaten a lot of pancakes, but these were the best I had so far! We also met the owner and chef, she was a lovely person, and we appreciated so much the love she puts on her dishes :) will do definitely come back for the brunch!
