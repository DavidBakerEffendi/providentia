Wonderful new Thai restaurant.  The place itself is beautiful and comfortable.  The people are warm and professional.  The food is outstanding - fresh, delicious and consistent, as we've both eaten there, and had delivery, 4 times already.  They don't have their liquor license yet, but don't let that hold you back.  Grab your favorite alcoholic beverage and go - or order in. It's a great, and needed, addition to the neighborhood!!
