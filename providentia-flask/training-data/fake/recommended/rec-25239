For 6 bucks its a pretty decent deal, and they give you a ton of food. However lets be entirely honest here.... the food isnt amazing by any stretch of the imagination. The white sauce is just mayonnaise with some stuff in it, and the BBQ sauce tastes like ketchup. Havent tried the hot sauce bc I was too scared after reading the reviews. Good drunk food I guess, but if I want good tasting food I'd go elsewhere.
