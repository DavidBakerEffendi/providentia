While waiting for our table at Lombardi's, we contemplated making a quick run to Cafe Habana for the infamous corn. After very little debate, we made a mad dash and picked up a few ears and started munching only to find out our table was ready. We snuck the corn in and snuck bites under the table. Hot corn juice dribbling down our chins and cheesy, spicy, stolen bites of the most awesome corn EVER - totally worth the scolding we got for bringing 'outside food.' Just a few days after, we went back for more corny goodness and a shared platter of roasted pork, beans and rice. YUM YUM YUM YUM -- the only thing that could've made it better are the added dramatics of breaking the rules and eating it in another food joint. NYC and Cafe Habana-- I'm coming back soon...and I'm definitely coming back for your CORN!!!
