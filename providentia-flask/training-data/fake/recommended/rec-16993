Old fashioned pizza pies. That's what I'm talkin' about! :) I am an italian food connoisseur. I really appreciate old fashioned roots when it comes to a pizzeria. I do not like anything modern or manufactured. (ex: Domino's/Papa John's) This place is nestled in the heart of south orange. It's so super cute over there but most places are so modernized. Reservoir is one of the veterans on the block. My grandfather used to go here when the location was in Newark decades ago! Onto the pie...so we had a traditional cheese pie with mushrooms and olives as toppings. Ugh, it was so fantastic, we ended up purchasing two! My boyfriend and I scarfed down nearly the entire thing. I did not want this pizza to end! I'm not generally a meat eater, but my boyfriend ordered one of their antipast salads and was in heaven. If the food doesn't get your gut, the price will. Everything is super affordable. I think it was like $12 for a pie and toppings were a little extra. The amount you get for your money is so worth it! FYI: The wait is ridic on weekends, go early. Oh...and bring cash...and your own vino. (There's a liquor store a few blocks up.) Don't order take out. It will not taste the same. The cheese will fall off the pie and you'll never come here again. Take some time, sit down and relax here. The owner is super friendly...I feel like he could be an uncle of mine.
