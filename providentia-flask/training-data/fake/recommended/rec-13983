I have been here a few times over the years and while sometimes the wait is only 20 minutes and sometimes it's 2 hours, raining, and you have to wait outside- the food is ALWAYS amazing. I've never had a bad meal there. Sadly, the major drawback is that wait. I'm very hesitant to bring out of town guests, or even go with locals unless I have half a day to blow.
