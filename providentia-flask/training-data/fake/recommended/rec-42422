This is an outstanding fast food establishment. Healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced eat-a-pita will give you your money's worth and more. I had the falafel pita. It was loaded with good veggies, wrapped neatly in paper for "to-go" eating.  I highly recommend their pita sandwiches for a healthy, quick meal. I've had pita sandwiches in  a lot of cities. None better than Eat-a-Pita on 12th Street, Philly.
