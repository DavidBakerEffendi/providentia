Finally got the chance to try Alta and what an amazing experience! We split a ton of tapas and left the restaurant bursting at the seems. I've ranked the tapas from favorite to least favorite. 1) P.E.I. Mussels - So much flavor! I was literally licking the sauce off my plate. A must have! 2) Grilled Srhimp & Chorizo Skewer - Love the combo of shrimp and chorizo. Would order again. 3) Seared Scallops - Cooked to absolute perfection! Would order again. 4) Avocado Relleno - I love anything that pairs avocado and seafood. 5) Pulled Pork Empanadas - An interesting twist on a traditional emapanda. Great with the dipping sauce. 6) Braised Short Rib of Beef - So tender and juicy. Loved the meat, but could pass on the noodles it comes with. Be careful, this is much bigger than an average tapa. 7) Spaghetti Pepperoncini - Simply delicious, especially for something you do not expect to see on a tapas menu. 8) Squid Ink Paella - Delicious. Also, a bigger portion. 9) Roasted Bass - This might be so low on the list, simply because it came out last. I was too full to enjoy the flavor. 10) Bacon Wrapped Dates - Orderd these becase of all the rave reviews, but honestly they are nothing special. 11) Skirt Steak - A bit bland and chewy. Wouldn't order it again. 12) Whipped Deviled Eggs - I don't know about you, but I don't like my eggs to taste sweet. Skip these! Overall, a great experience. The meal felt a bit rushed and the sangria was not my favorite, but the tapas made up for everything else. Don't plan to dine if you are on a budget. The meal get can expensive pretty quickly.
