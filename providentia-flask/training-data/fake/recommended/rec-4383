Yum!!  On a first visit several months ago, the service was slightly stand-offish and the ramen didn't have a lot of flavor.  I went back today for lunch and it was a great experience from start to finish.  I went a different route and ordered a Japanese chicken curry, the chicken was fried, seasoned and covered w. a delicious curry, came with a salad w. ginger dressing and some fresh tomato slices and rice.  It was hearty, maybe a bit Americanized, and plentiful.  Started with pork buns which were like sliders, fresh bun, nice mayo and vegetables, pork was good, maybe a tiny bit chewy.   I will definitely go back.  The staff were extremely friendly and offered to answer any questions.  other patrons, some Japanese, seemed happy to be there.  I can't speak to the authenticity of the food or the soup, but it fits my bill for a filling, well cooked, nicely spiced, pleasantly served lunch. nice wooden floors/walls/tables--feels great sitting in there. Second visit: curry chicken was off. Maybe cooked at too high temp?  Center was kind of slimy--buns though were great.
