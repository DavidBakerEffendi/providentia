The boyfriend and I went to Slate last night for dinner. While I would give the food 5 stars, there was a very long wait for the food to come out, so I deduct 2 stars for that. So, let's start with the food: I had the tilapia special with crabmeat, shrimp and scallops with veggies and truffle mashed potatoes. The boyfriend had the hanger steak with parmesan fries. We split the chocolate mousse cake for dessert. The food was very delicious - perfectly cooked and super tasty. The service: The severs were polite and friendly and our drinks came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, the wait for the food (45 minutes between ordering the entree and it coming out) was really ridiculous, considering there were only a few other tables occupied when we were there. I saw an earlier review that suggested there may only be one chef working in the kitchen, which would explain what took so long. However, no one seemed to acknowledge or apologize about the wait time. Management should really consider hiring some help back there. We'll probably be back sometime, but with less frequency than we might otherwise, knowing how slow the food is.
