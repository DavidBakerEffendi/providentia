While on previous visits to Philadelphia's 9th St Italian Market, I never had the opportunity to visit this store. I finally had the opportunity to visit today! The retail floor of Talluto's is not large, they pack plenty of Italian goodness into a compact space. The line to check out is rather long, but the wait is definitely worth it. It's a difficult task trying to figure out what kind of pasta you want to take home, since the selection is so wide. They also have an assortment of pre-prepared Italian food to go. We settled on some chicken Parmesan to go, along with a very expensive bottle of imported balsamic vinegar. Just in time for Easter, we were also able to buy a Panettone cake imported from Italy. So impressed with the selection and prices, I'll make it a regular visit on future visits to the Italian Market.
