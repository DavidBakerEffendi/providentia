I went here with my mom because we were looking for something a little different than the norm. Wow, were we surprised!  It's way more modern than other places that I've been to. No  traditional dress or music.  To start, the waiter brought over papdum (crisp lentil flatbread) with mint chutney and mango chutney. I really liked the mint chutney. It was cool and creamy,  and paired very well with the papdum. For our main course, we both had the Navrattan korma. It was to die for! We also had the kashmiri naan, which was filled with coconut and raisins. I never had anything like that in my life! Seriously, we heard about the place from a YouTube video--Buzzy, the chowhound. I'm definitely going to be back! A great place if you're looking for something to do that is reasonable and different.
