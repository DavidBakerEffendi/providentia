Had dinner here earlier this week and had the Buttermilk fried chicken with cheddar waffles and savoy cabbage slaw, it was da bomb.  Roberta's in Bushwick has fried chicken which is okay but pales in comparison to Buttermilk fc.  The person at the table next to me got the burger which looked yummy and the salads are great.  Definitely going back to try other items on the menu.
