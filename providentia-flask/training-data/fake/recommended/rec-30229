The hostess was the worst. There was a couple in front of us who were told that it's a 30min wait inside or immediate seating outside (they decided to wait indoors). When we asked for a table for two she said 30min. I called her out asked about the immediate seating outside that I heard her say to the group of two in front of us and she made up the worst excuse stating there was a "waitlist". Why lie? This management group is definitely losing it hiring a hostess like her. 180 degree difference walking into Westville a few blocks away.
