This place is one my two defaults in Greenpoint. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and it's all quite delicious. The wait staff is great and so is the owner. They really take good care of you. My ONLY complaint is the portion size. So often, I get food from here and I'm wondering where the rest of it is. Perhaps that's because it's too delicious or perhaps that's just because I'm a fat dumb American (in which case, if you're not a fat dumb American, you can probably just ignore me). Either way, the prices aren't bad here for the quality of food you get. This guy could charge a lot more. Honestly. EVERYTHING is good. I just wish he threw a little more food on our plates.
