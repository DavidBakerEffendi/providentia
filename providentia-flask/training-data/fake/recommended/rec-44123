The Eulogy!  The mussels!  The enormous beer list!  The Belgian Frietjes!   Friendly atmosphere, even if dining/drinking solo at the bar.  Prices aren't bad, given the neighborhood.  The upstairs is a little quieter than the noisy downstairs bar scene.  The beer recommendations by the servers and bartenders were appreciated and helpful.  I'm not sure I would go out of my way for the Eulogy, but if you're in the area it's definitely worth a visit.
