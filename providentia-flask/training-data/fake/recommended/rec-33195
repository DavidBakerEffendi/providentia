Even though I give it only 3 stars, I still like it a lot, and will probably be back for pre-theater bites, or when I'm in the area and am looking for a place to go. It's right next to/under Sapporo, which is more like a fast food diner compared to Hagi.  Hagi is more of an Izakaya.  The atmosphere is very laid back, it is run by Japanese people, and the food is authentic.  The waiters are busy and very nice.  They have specials up on the board, and the potato spring rolls on there were really good.  Another review says they have uni specials some times... MUST KEEP GOING BACK! The prices are reasonable too.  My only complaint is that the menu is way too small, especially for an izakaya.  And they didn't have katsuo that day.  But that's fresh seafood, so I understand that can happen sometimes.  They don't have any salad items on there.  Barely any vegetables, for that matter.  But what they had was very good, and the rice balls are huge! It's not a nice restaurant with "interesting dishes" and such, but the atmosphere, food, and waiters remind me of Japan enough that I will definitely be coming back many times.  In the end, I had a pleasant experience there!
