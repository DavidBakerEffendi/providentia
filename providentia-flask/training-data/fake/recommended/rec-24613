Corner Bistro was one of the first places I went to when I moved to New York 7 years ago.  What an amazing introduction to the New York burger scene.  The burgers are cooked perfectly, the flavor is meaty and delicious, and the fries - those taste like bacon.  Which is what everything should taste like.  Also awesome is that they have a full bar with cheap drinks.  My ooooonly gripe with this place is that there's often a pretty hefty wait.  And when you're craving a burger, a long wait just won't do.  And if I had to pick a second gripe, it would be that the massive size of this burger makes it difficult to eat like a lady.  It usually ends up falling apart before I get to the end.  But I guess that's a small price to pay to the burger gods for such excellence.
