I can't believe I lived next door to Petite Crevette for almost 2 years and never tried it.  We avoided it because we only noticed the front room with the few tables strewn about.  But we came here for dinner about a week ago and there is also a CHARMING hidden* back room.  The lighting was perfect.  I loved all the mirrors and antiques decorating the walls.  The food was FRESH and absolutely delicious.  I ordered the tuna burger and it was savory and done rare.   I also love how they are BYOB--it really adds to the overall experience as well. *Not actually "hidden," and it's not part of a gimmick.  It's "hidden" due to a weird angle upon entering.  I don't know if they realize the appeal of having this room seem hidden.
