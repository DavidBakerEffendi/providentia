Totally quaint little spot. Small operation that has a cozy feel. Mac n' Cheese, truffle burger and sweet potato fries we're all on point. There was a delay with the food, so they sent some fries out first which was thoughtful and the cook came around to ask how things were and to chat with some other patrons.
