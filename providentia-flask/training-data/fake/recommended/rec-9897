Yes, these macarons are good. Yes, they are from a fancyyyyyy French establishment. Yes, they come in cute boxes. But ohhhh man, these 2 biter desserts are expensive as efffffff. If I remember correctly, they were $2.75 each?!! It hurts me inside just thinking about. 3 of my friends and I ordered two macarons each, just to get a sample! I ordered the salted caramel and pistachio. Both flavors were rich and sweet, but not to the point where I was overwhelmed. Regardless of how overpriced these babies are, it's definitely somewhere you should stop by if you're in NY because this is the only location in the US! It is something to try once but not a place I would frequently visit. If you're rolling in dough though, this cutsie little shop might be your best friend for desserts. Some of the people in line in front of me spent over $100. To me, that is just plain ridiculous. I will always have a special place in my heart for these yummy little sweets but man, they sure do make my bank account sad.
