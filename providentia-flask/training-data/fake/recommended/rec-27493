Yum! I've eaten here twice (once for a work thing, so comped). The paella appetizer was fantastic. Scallops were pretty good, a little on the blander side for me The char was great (chose it based on other reviews), buttery, rich, literally falling off the fork Desserts are nice - beignets delicious, ice cream refreshing and rich (i really liked the rose flavor), hazelnut thing which was good too. Drinks-wise, i had the corpse reviver, mostly for the name (!), it was okay tho. The red wine i had on the other hand was ridiculously great.
