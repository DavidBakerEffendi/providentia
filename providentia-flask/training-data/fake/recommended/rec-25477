Subsequent to my review.  I received a message from the General Manager, today.  He responded to my unfavorable report on the salmon, and offered an apology as well as took the time to describe some steps he is taking to avoid that unusual event from reoccurring by working with his staff.  He also invited me back, and shared his contact info. While I may not have the opportunity to return, I am appreciative of the fact that he took a constructive view on my comments ... as they were intended to be constructive.  That reflects favorably on his management style.  I am therefore bumping up my rating to a more neutral rating, while I have not returned to the location to try again, it leads me to believe that my experience was truly an outlier experience.
