After having several great meals at Chef Jesse Schenker's other restaurant, Recette; I was very much looking forward to checking out The Gander and it did not disappoint. Our table was ready promptly at our reserved time and the hostess and front-of-house staff couldn't be friendlier.  The menu had so many choices that sounded excellent that it was tough to choose!  And the wine menu had just as many excellent choices. Among the dishes ordered at our table, the sea trout tartare and brisket tots were big hits as appetizers.  The homemade bread on the table was fantastic too.  The spaghetti and clams had three different kinds of clams in the sauce, with pasta that was cooked perfectly.  The steak was an excellent value -- something that I would usually see at twice its listed price at other restaurants in the area; and was also prepared perfectly.  A shared chocolate mousse was the perfect end to an incredible meal. I really hope to get back to The Gander soon because I'm still kicking myself for not trying the lamb pastrami that was on the menu.
