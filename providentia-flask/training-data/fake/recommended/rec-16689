One of those restaurants that doesn't "fit" in its neighborhood. After walking down a pretty dreary stretch of 9th Ave, I walked into a trendy Asian Fusion restaurant complete with futuristic decor and house music. Felt Â more like downtown than Hell's Kitchen. Thai is thai, right? The dumplings and pork rib appetizers were phenomenal - entrees were good but not great. Lots of creative drink options, especially mimosas. Service was uneven - waiter wanted to take our order within 10 seconds of getting the menu, server had a hard time with multiple plates on the table, didn't get a dessert menu despite asking for one, etc. Add this to the (short) list of restaurants that make it worth the trip to the neighborhood.
