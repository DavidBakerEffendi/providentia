I live down the street and am guilty of eating here sometimes more than once in a week.  It's not a traditional bahn mi but but it's mighty tasty nonetheless.  I usually get the pork sandwich (not spicy because I'm a baby) and it's pretty much always perfect.  I think once the bread was a little on the burnt and crispy side, but I let it slide.  The taro bubble tea is also a guilty pleasure.
