Someone here gave this place positive reviews because "it's not in the back of a bodega." I want to kick that reviewer Â in the eye. Ok, now for my review of this place. 1 star for service (I added a star for service because the owner invited me to come in and give them a second chance. That's good service.) 2 stars for food. 1.5 stars total. I walked in ready to spend some money to try out this new taco/burrito joint. I couldn't believe the cold, unfriendly reception I received. The woman at the counter knew I walked in, yet didn't even look up to say "hi" or "how can I help you?" or anything. I've lived in NYC for more than a decade and so my standards for service aren't tremendously high, but this was ridiculous. I had to interrupt her guac-making to ask her if I could order, to which she responded not with actual words or eye contact, but with a sigh of annoyance followed by a mumbled, "what do you want?" I don't know why I didn't listen to my senses that were screaming, "You're a jackass if you stay here. Take your hard earned money elsewhere!" I went jackass at that moment and ordered a terrible, terrible chicken burrito. As she finished the little tiny thing this place calls a burrito, I was struck to see her cut the burrito in half with a long diagonal. Pause and think about why this absolutely does not work for a good burrito. Chicken salad in a spinach-tortilla wrap - yes. Juicy meaty burrito with salsa, guac and melted cheese -- hell no! As soon as I picked up my first awkward triangle half, all the sad flavorless rice just poured right out along with the bland fillings. I had to eat it with a fork. There's Crif Dog next door and a authentic "bodega" tacos on 13th/A -- much more interesting food on which to spend your hard earned dollars.
