This is one of the best BBQ places in the city. Dish by dish ... Let's go. Fav Meat Choices Beef Brisket - they are famous for this and rightly so. It is so good. Get the lean kind to avoid the unnecessary fat... Unless that's your thing ;-). Ribs - these are some of the best ribs I've had in the city. I've been to almost all the best BBQ places in the city, and the ribs are on point. Don't forget to smoother on the sauce. Fav Sides (lighting round) Baked Beans - they have burnt ends in them... Sweet. Jesus. Cole Slaw - they have vinegar and mayo based kinds. 5 stars for diversity. Go vinegar! Sweet Potato Souffl√© - hmmmmmm Fries - classic... add some BBQ sauce on the side.
