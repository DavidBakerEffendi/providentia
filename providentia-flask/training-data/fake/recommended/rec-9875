I went to Brickyard Gastropub last night for a company POST-Holiday party in their back lounge area. A great time was had by everyone. The waitstaff was very attentive (we didn't have to ask for refills) and the finger foods were great. Highly recommended - mini burgers and crabcakes. DELISH! :) I will definitely come here again with some friends for a couple of drinks.
