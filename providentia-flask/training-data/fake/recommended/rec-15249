We called to place an order for take out. The young lady on the lady was very polite and helpful. We opted for a small margerita pizza as we were also going to have dessert. 10 minutes later we show up to pick up our pizza, to our disappointment, it was not small, it was TINY. I, alone, could have ate 3 of those. But that was not the main issue, the main problem with the pizza was that it was COLD. The cheese was barely melted, and the crust was chewy. I'm not sure if it was an old recycled pizza, or if they were having a bad night...but our pizza was pretty awful. The pizza was not expensive, but it definitely was NOT cheap, and I was very disappointed with the quality of the ingredients.
