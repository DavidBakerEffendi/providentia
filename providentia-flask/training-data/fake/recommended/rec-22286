It's good.  I've been about five or six times.  A few times for lunch, a few for dinner.  Once or twice it was fantastic.  More often, its very good, but I then I get stuck on prices (which are very fair, but a bit more pricey than I can afford every time I go out). One bummer, they didn't have ginger beer to make a dark & stormy (but they do have Guinness on tap)
