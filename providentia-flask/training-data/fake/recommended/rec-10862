This was a really fun one!  My husband and I snuck in after seeing a show in the theatre district.  We were instantly impressed with the staff and immediate seating. We spent an hour enjoying the lovely wine (the $25 price tag made it that much better!) and never ending assortment of  3 pastas.  All the dishes were excellently prepared and tasted fabulous.   My favorite was the gnocchi while my husband couldn't get enough of the seafood dish.   The only point of contention was the fried calamari we ordered as an app.  It didn't provide anything remarkable and seemed a bit fishy for my taste. We came hungry, left entirely full and would come back again for more!
