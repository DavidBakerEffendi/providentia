"Who - Who ? "likes a delicious meal full of flavor staged in an intimate atmosphere? If you already agree its "you" then please make a point of visiting the warm and inviting Little Owl. I do highly recommend making a reservation a month in advance or there could be at least an hours wait! The ladies and I started our evening with the moist & delicate Meatball Sliders (beef,pork,veal and pecorino). Only to be out shined by the savory & distinctive entrees! The Cod Fish With the Squash Risotto and Braised Cabbage lingered with "this is too good to be fish " wth light sweet flavors while the Colorado Lamb T-Bones (goat cheese-potato fritters and watercress) spanked your taste buds into check , and last but not least the not overrated Pork Chop with Parmesan butter beans with wild dandelion made be believe the poor mans white meat can do a Mickey Rourke come back! The evening couldn't be complete without the "I've Been a good Girl may I have the Rasberry Beignets with Nutella!?" Â Needless to say,there was no plate unturned! The culinary experience was complimented by the approachable & knowledgelable staff while the intimate armosphere made it all the more memorable!
