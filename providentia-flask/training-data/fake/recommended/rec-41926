Three gals went out for a late dinner - we had the following Edamame appetizer (more than enough for three to share) 1 extra dirty dirty gin martini (extra olives) 2 Magner's Hard Cider Vegetable Flatbread (huge - plenty of leftover) Kite and Key Burger (without onions), Medium Rare Caesar Salad Edamame was delicious and there was plenty.  French fries with the burger were a bit overdone.  Burger as ordered Medium Rare but was more Medium. Waittress was attentive and, overall, the food was good!  We will definitely be back.
