My friend and I really enjoyed dining here. It was a great vibe, really huge bar scene. We went around 10:00 and were seated promptly. The nachos mama's were amazing!!! A must try. They had a variety of food to choose from. I also got the enchilada's mixtas. It was delicious and HUGE. I recommend sharing this entree with two people. My friend got two different taco platters, he loved it! Overall great experience. They even had a black & white photo book that you can take pictures in. Really cute touch! Definitely give this place a try if you're in city center.
