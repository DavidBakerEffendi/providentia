I love coming here for drinks with friends. In the summer the roof top deck is awesome! It also offers the best of both worlds in the downstairs area when it comes to night time fun...quite cozy restaurant section where you can sit and have converstaion or you can take 5 steps past the host's stand and enter the world of sidebar...where the music is loud, there is great energy, and Â they even have a dance area downstairs (my personal favorite). You can't beat it! As far as the food goes, eh just ok, much better places in the center for grub, but come back here for drinks!
