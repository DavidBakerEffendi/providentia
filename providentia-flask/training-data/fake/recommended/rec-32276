Not only is this the best roasted pork but the service is also awesome. I don't need to expound on the sandwiches because so many others have already covered that - so I will give a takeout tip. I was headed upstate about a week ago and went to get some sandwiches to be consumed the following day. I told the very nice woman at the counter and she not only proceeded to pack everything separately but provided much more. There was more than enough peppers and sharp provolone for the Sammy's but she also gave me detailed instructions on how to reheat and assemble to recreate the perfection that you get At the counter. Needless to say everyone loved the Philly treat and I could not have been happier!!
