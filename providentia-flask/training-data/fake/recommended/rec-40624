I visit Jones any time I am in Center City.  I love the atmosphere and the food is always amazing.  My favorite is the control freak salad because lets be honest... I am one and want to be able to create my own custom meal outside of a salad-works!  The turkey is also fantastic.  Wish they had a build your  own sandwich option for people like me.  Servers are usually really friendly too and its super clean.  Never experienced a wait.  Big fan.
