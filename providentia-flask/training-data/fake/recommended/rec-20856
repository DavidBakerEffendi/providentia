My boyfriend and I come here almost every weekend and always order the same thing. We start with two banh mi (egg and ham is my FAVE), I order the spring roll and veggie pho and my boyfriend orders the spring roll , chicken and veggie pho. He also sometimes orders the fried rice. The sandwiches are delicious and simple and the noodles are excellent. The food comes out fast, and while the woman who serves you will never come over to ask how everything is, Â she still is very nice. We both really enjoy this place.
