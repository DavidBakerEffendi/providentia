This place is terrible.  It starts with the owner TommyUp and goes right on down to the line cooks.  First off...the food is overpriced for what it is.  I just got out of a year lease at The Piazza and I can honestly say that in that year I saw a gradual decline in not only the quality of the burger's, but also the size of the sides (fries).   My personal biggest problem, in addition to what everyone on Yelp mentions about the servers just not caring at all...are the fact that "TommyUp" allows them to wear tank tops while serving!!!!!!! Again....tank tops while serving.  This includes the male servers people! If there is one thing that I'd rather not look at when giving my order to a lackadaisical server its his pit hair jetting out from his Smiths Tank Top. Now like I said earlier...I lived a year at the Piazza...so I have a very good pulse about this place.  I literally saw the place every.single.day.  The shooting and unfortunately ... the murder that occurred on the morning of the 11th is by no means a shock.  Tommy has done nothing to quell the loitering right outside his restaurant by these thugs.  Hell...they have even added a old yellow Winnebago to serve drinks outside.  (P.S. the Winnebago looks like a P.O.S, and in my opinion is an eye sore for the complex).  If they wanted to get rid of the clientele that are causing these nightly scuffles and shootings...they can do so.  However Tommy is willing to sacrifice this so that his pockets are a little fatter. Hey Tommy, remember when you had to institute the mandatory 20% gratuity?  You think that may be because of the clientele you open yourself up to?  The very same clientele that are now causing you a world of problems?  Think about it....fix it...or seriously...just get out.
