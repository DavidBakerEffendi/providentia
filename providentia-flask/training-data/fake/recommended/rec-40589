Mannino's is one of those Italian places that's half pizza joint, half sit-down restaurant.  It depends which side you choose.   My family normally has a sit down meal on the nicer (though slightly tacky) side.  I used to love this place, but we've been going there less and less because of problems with our food.  They've messed up a few orders and some things even worse than that but I won't really go into it. I feel bad only giving it three stars, but Mannino's just hasn't been living up to what I know it can be.  They used to have amazing bruschetta that came out before your meal, but they've changed it... if they even still do it at all.  The chicken parm is usually good, the Gnocchi with Vodka sauce is delicious, but overall I just think Mannino's needs to make some changes.  They haven't been up to their own standards.
