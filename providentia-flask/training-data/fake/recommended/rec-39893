Their sandwiches are amazing, bully busting, true Philadelphia treats.  They start off with great bread base, and add well cooked meat and veggie or cheese toppings.  If you go, make sure you get the roast pork with broccoli rabe and provolone.  This is the best combination to get.  Something amazing happens to the bread when the juices from the roast pork make it a little soggy- it's so delicious eating up the sopped up pan juices!  One of the great reasons to make Reading Terminal Market a part of your weekly shopping routine!
