Local joint with local people. If you're looking to go in to watch a game or just have a few beers it's a great place. Definitely not a fancy place, by any means. Beers are cold and the food is surprisingly good. I usually stick to their sandwiches and apps, but everything is always good. Try the Firebird and you'll never order anything else on the menu. Service is slightly lack luster if you're not a frequent patron, but it's not terrible. Don't let the area scare you off you'll be happily surprised!
