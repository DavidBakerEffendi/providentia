Was looking for a brunch spot on a Saturday Morning.  Turns out most places on 5th Ave. don't open 'til 11:00am.  We were greeted very pleasantly at 10:20 by a very nice wait staff. Food was delicious.  The home made apple butter was very good.   French Omelette stuffed with fresh herbs and cheese was very tasty as well. Egg sandwich with Chicken Sausage and salad was the perfect serving size.  Not too little...not too much! Looked over at the next table and was jealous of the man's order of buttermilk pancakes...I was tempted to ask him for a bite. Very nice decor. I will definitely be back and next time it'll be for pancakes.
