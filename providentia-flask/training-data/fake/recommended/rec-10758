Best German on Staten Island! This place is great if you just want to sit at the bar and have a beer or come for dinner and sit at one of the tables. It's small, but quaint. The decor is very Bavarian and it just feels comfortable. Staff is really nice. Will help you out with menu suggestions. My pick- Sauerbraten with the potato dumplings. And you must order one of their handmade pretzels just to use their AMAZING house made whole grain mustard. In the summer, the back is patio is open and they cook on the grill. Really fun biergarten atmosphere.
