Almost everyone I know has heard about this place and love it.  Their food is great, I always order the lamb over rice which comes out to 6 dollars.  The lines are rather long sometimes but they make it as fast as possible. You're up, order and they have it ready right away.  It's the longest line I have ever seen for an outdoor corner vendor.  I'm giving this place a 5 because of the great tasting food, the fast service, the convenient location and seriously its as good as a street vendor can get.
