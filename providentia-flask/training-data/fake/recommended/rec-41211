The lack of 5 stars is definitely due to the extremely long wait times. However, the noodles are awesome. The menu has a good variety of interesting choices and their daily specials are definitely worth trying. I went with two friends, and it is definitely worth going with a group of friends that are not afraid to share bowls. Not only is this the most cost effective method, but the best way to find your favorite bowl of noodles. Basically, each person can order a different kind of ramen dish. You can eat that entire bowl and then ask for a noodle refill that only costs a few dollars. Once you get the refill, everyone can switch bowls and try each others. This way you get 2 meals for about 15 bucks and you can take it home too. The wait staff is extremely nice and friendly, even for such a busy place. Another possible plus is the seating arrangement. If you bring a small group you often share the large communal tables with others and that's always interesting.
