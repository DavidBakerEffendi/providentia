As a belated birthday celebration, my brother brought me here today for lunch.  This place is out of this world. Nurnberger Bierhaus has old world charm, a large assortment of draught beer and well over 30 beers in bottles.  They even have German music playing in the background.  No domestics here. We started out with our beer selection.  My brother went with a pint of Spaten Lager.  I am first and always a big Hefeweizen fan so my choice was the 6 liter Weihenstephan which is the world's oldest brewery (founded in 1040).   For an appetizer we split the pretzels, which is served with 2 types of mustard, one spicy and the other sweet.  I probably could have made a meal out of this alone.  The portion is huge and the pretzel was soft, chewy and a great price. For lunch, my choice was the kielbasa plate and my brother had the Nurnberger bratwurst. Both were served with homemade sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  The sauerkraut was a lot different than what I am used to.  It was sweet, not the usual briny stuff you get on a hot dog. The food was very filling and the tab was under $30 for lunch for the both of us.  We were lucky, we parked on Davis Avenue and walked 1/2 a block.   I can't wait to come back and try the Biergarten next door when the weather gets warmer.  The waitress mentioned May 1st as the date it would be open.  They serve food in the back with live music (German of course, and classic rock).
