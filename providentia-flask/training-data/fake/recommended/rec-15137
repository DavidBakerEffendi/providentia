A bit of research told us that the "big two" are famous but the cheese steaks are not very good at either of them.  Bonus: Sonny's isbin the neighborhood we were visiting anyway (three blocks from the Liberty Bell ... Tea Party Patriots w00t w00t!).   They've got a big hunk of rib eye on the slicer and they're making everything fresh.  I know "cheez whiz" is the classic but we had provolone.  Really really good, I could probably eat two of them :) Friendly service, too.
