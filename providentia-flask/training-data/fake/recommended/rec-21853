Just had brunch at the Mercer for the first time in too long. This place is one of the best kept secrets in Philly. All the food is freshly made with fresh ingredients. The place has a very local vibe and you feel right at home there for breakfast or lunch. There is never a huge wait, no pretentious hostesses, servers, or design just amazing food. Standouts include bottomless La Colombe coffee, crab and asparagus omelette, their famous mascarpone and berry french toast, egg & cheese on a fresh crossant, and the best eggs florentine I have ever tasted. This place is truly a gem and the perfect cure if you have had one too many the night before.
