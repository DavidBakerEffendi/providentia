Came here after my friend recommended this spot. There is at least an hour wait so put your name/number down waaay before you plan to chow. The most memorable dish was the uni sashimi. Everything else was alright/comparable to other izakayas in the city. Although the meal was decent, I'm not sure if I'd come back. I see myself more likely to head to St. Marks if I'm feeling this type of food.
