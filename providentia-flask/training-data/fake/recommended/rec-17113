I've been here a few times in the past and I must say the quality of the food is well worth the wait. Lucky for me I've never gone with more than two people so I've been seated rather quickly. Because of my previous positive experiences, I decided to celebrate my birthday here last night with a small group of friends (a couple even traveled from Queens). The waiter insisted that we place all our orders at once, which wouldn't have been a problem if all the food didn't come out at once. As expected, the food was great, but unfortunately everyone had a tough time enjoying the tapas because they rushed our plates out of the way to fit the entrees. We spoke to the staff about the rushed service and they apologized, but at least six times throughout the meal the servers attempted to clear our full plates away. For food that is prepared this good it would have been great to have the opportunity to actually enjoy it. If I was basing my rating on the quality of the food, decor, and atmosphere I'd have definitely rated them higher, but having good food that you barely get a chance to chew is pointless no? A huge part of the dining out experience is service, which last night left a lot to be desired despite his included gratuity. We also noticed that the servers were preparing other customers beverages at adjacent tables with the liquor provided, but out server did not and he didn't even offer napkins and water until we asked. Pretty disappointed in the latest experience.
