Come autumn, all I want to do is drink beer in the West Village. It has that glamorous, bohemian, "New York" feeling, that i'm-wasted-in-a-cozy-sweater feeling. That I-could-be-a-great-writer-if-i-really-tried feeling. So after two weeks of eating healthy and avoiding alcohol, I decided to cash in big time at Corner Bistro with my favorite dining partners: me, myself, and I. The crowd at 3pm on a weekday is old and haggard, with a smattering of GQ types and a few foodie tourists. I sat down at one of the ancient wooden tables, carved with various symbols and the names of previous customers, and promptly ordered a Cheeseburger ($6) and French Fries ($2.75). I read about a page of my book in peace, wondering whether I should've gone for the gold (McSorley's for $2.75) when my order magically appeared in front of me. The burger was huge eight-ouncer, with a familiar, juicy, homemade taste.The onions snapped off like broken rubber bands after the first bite, but they were raw, so no big loss there. On the other hand, the fries were pretty terrible and McDonald's-esque, with an aftertaste that sent me scrambling for the nearest dessert. But that burger and the calm, dark, autumnal atmosphere gave me such a great feeling that I really couldn't care less about the bummer frites. Next time I'll go for a burger, a beer, and the company of a few Hemingway types. We'll discuss the pros and cons of being married to the sea, trade wooly cardigans, and all will be right with the world.
