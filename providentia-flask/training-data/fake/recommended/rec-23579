I despaired of ever finding good takeout Chinese in Burlington.  But man.  Hung Tao.  What a lucky accidental find. Based on the one appetizer and two main dishes we tried, portions seem enormously generous.  We have five meals out of less than $30 worth of food, and it would have been six if we hadn't so enthusiastically stuffed our faces with those dumplings. Each item was a superlative of its dish.  The fried pork dumplings (surely the most important item on the menu) are huge and have a perfect dumpling texture.  The moo shu vegetables are cooked to within an inch of their lives, but marvelously flavorful.  The General Tso's chicken has great flavor, just the right amount of sauce, and strikes the perfect breaded-Chinese-chicken-dish texture. Here on out, this will absolutely be our go-to Chinese takeout place.
