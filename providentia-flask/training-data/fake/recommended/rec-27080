Classic new jersey diner fare. You honestly cant go wrong with anything ordered off of the vast menu. This place can get quite busy especially on sunday mornings but none the less they still manage to seat everyone quite quickly. I haven't had a bad meal here yet... The service is always great but the fireworks always seem to start when the front end reviews the scene and corrects the help. Its subtle but if you pay attention you will catch it. It probably stinks for the Â help but as a consumer its a great sight to see attention to details. Dont pass this place up!
