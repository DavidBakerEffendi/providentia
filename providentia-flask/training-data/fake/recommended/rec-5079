I've passed by this place several times late at night and have always thought, "That looks really cool and I need to go there at some point." Finally made it, and was totally glad I did! The ambiance is great. Wooden tables. Funky art. Fireplace. Tiny performance stage in the corner. I can't just pick one highlight of the meal, but the cocktails are a strong contender. Basically everything's $10 each. I had a whiskey drink with pumpkin spice in it; it was called - get this - PUMP UP THE JAM. Had to order it just for that name alone. I also had the Bijan-Tini, which was spiced up with cayenne. If you can't tell, I love spicy! Also tried my friend's Frisky Whiskey, which was tasty as all heck. Our waitress was awesome and helped me choose the chicken breast as my entree. I was worried it'd be dry. But nope, it was juicy and spiced really well. Fall off the bone tender too. Would definitely recommend it. If you're in the area and looking for a nice cocktail bar or semi-romantic dinner spot, definitely throw Bijan's on the short list. They also play great semi-indie music in the background too!
