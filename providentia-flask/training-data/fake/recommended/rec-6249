I love breakfast.  Yes, and I love eggs, but even if I didn't, I'd find something tasty to eat here.  Like the tofu scramble...wait...does that have eggs? I think not. Burlington's finest.  It is. I wish they didn't butter your toast.  Wait, do they butter your toast for you? Eh.  Either way, good food, good memories.  Go with a friend, and the wait won't seem so long.
