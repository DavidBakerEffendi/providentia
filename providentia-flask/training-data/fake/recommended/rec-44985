Ruby has good burger and pasta. I've tried the Bronte burger and thought it was pretty good. I wish they had fries though. They have no fries here and with the burger they give you little bit of salad. I returned here recently and had their shrimp and avocado salad. It was yummy but I felt hungry afterwords. It was $13 and I felt hungry. The portions were tiny. I think I'll stick to their burgers. oh yea their cash only policy is annoying.
