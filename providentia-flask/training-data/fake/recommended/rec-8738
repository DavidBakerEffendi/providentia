Got here around 6pm so there was no wait (because they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 5 people). The restaurant itself is adorable and romantic, with dim lighting and dark walls. All of the food we had was amazing! I got the hanger steak and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned and just omgzzz delicious. They have a lot of interesting things on their menu, and I liked that it wasn't too large because, let's be honest, who wants to deal with the headache of not being able to decide what you want from a 5 page menu. It was a perfect girls night out and I hope to come back here soon!
