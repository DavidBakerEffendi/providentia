I came to New Haven to visit a couple of my old college friends and one suggested that we go to Bar for dinner.  I was really impressed with the atmosphere (very laid back) and the food. The pizza has nice thin crust and was great.  The waitress served the pizza on a table side stand and we ate it on paper plates. As far as the beer, my friend and I had two of the locally brewed specialties and thought they were pretty good.  Overall a great place to get some inexpensive food and catch up.
