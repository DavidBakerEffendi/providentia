Bumping my rating down after an unfortunate experience recently. My friend and I were sitting downstairs, by the staircase. Towards the end of dessert (luckily not earlier) I noticed something by my feet, but wasn't sure exactly what it was. My friend reassured me that it was likely the shadow of someone coming down the stairs. I believed him until a 3 inch (not exaggerating) cockroach emerged on the wall by my friend, attempting to climb the white wall, failing miserably and falling down in the space next to him. My friend went on to smother the bug with his napkin, with an audible crunch. If this experience was not bad enough, the waitress's reaction was even better. After being told by us that a large dead cockroach was resting under the napkin, she went on to pick it up and bring it closer to my friend's face and said "ooo this is just a little water bug!" WTF. The shit was 3 inches long, wide bodied, definitely not a water bug. The women sitting next to us were disgusted and said "this place should definitely be downgraded to B." We were appalled by A.) The nasty ass bug and B.) The waitress' response. Will never go back and have told my friends to stay away.
