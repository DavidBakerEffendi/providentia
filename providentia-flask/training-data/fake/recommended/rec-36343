Get the parpardelle with sausage and truffle oil. You won't regret your decision! And for the price, this place is awesome. Tower of vegetables was pretty good like other people said. Had tiramisu for dessert, and you would like it if you like a very fluffy, creamy tiramisu (not so much of coffee/liquor flavor...so it was okay for me. But my friend love it).
