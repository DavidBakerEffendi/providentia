For $6, you can't beat the quality of flavors, portion, & convenience. A word of caution with the the hot sauce - a little goes a long way. I usually have a high tolerance for spicy stuff..but boy, did I underestimate their hot sauce! the BBQ sauce is also good, and of course, the white sauce (tastes kinda like ranch). Stopped here after watching Wicked & I'm glad we did. I didn't even finish half of my gyro & chicken bowl. :(
