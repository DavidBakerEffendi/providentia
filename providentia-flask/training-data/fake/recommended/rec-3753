I ate here on day 2 of my fried chicken extravaganza.  OK so I didn't really set out to have fried chicken 2 days in a row but whenever my friend is town we tend to overeat unapologetically. Make sure that if you're meeting up with friends you go to the right Peaches.  As soon as I sat down I realized my other friend who was meeting us was at the Peaches on Lewis Ave. The food was great!  I had the fried chicken (very large pieces) with the potatoes.  It's certainly enough to split with a friend or enjoy a few hours later at home.  My other friend had the shrimp and grits, which she always raves about and my other friend had an omelet. She liked my chicken so much that she ordered some to go. We had several waiters that were all good except for one snarky rascal.  My friend read the other Peaches' menu online before she left the house and saw buffalo wings and when she asked if the hothouse had them she condescendingly said:  "No honey, this is the hothouse.  I know it's hard to wrap your head around that!"  Ha!  Easy lady.  That however, did not stop us from enjoying our meal. I would suggest that you get there earlier for Sunday brunch.  We were able to get a table immediately around noon but soon after folks had to wait some time to be seated.
