I have been coming to Almaz regularly for a few years.  It is consistently fantastic.  The spongy Ethiopian bread is beyond heavenly.  The service is spectacular - and - it's sure a fine alternative to "Shake Shack" down the street.  I hope that the crowds there will detour to a much healthier, finer place only steps away!!!!
