Absolutely horrendous service. We sat for 20 minutes before being acknowledged by anyone. The bartender was clearly drunk or hungover or something. I ordered a "bottomless" Bloody Mary. The bartender served me ONE and then disappeared for about 30 mins. I ended up having to ask a server to give me my bill... 45 mins later. While I'll admit the food was pretty good, it was certainly not worth the awful service that came with it.
