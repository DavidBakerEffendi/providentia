randomly stopped in this place on my way home. it's a tiny little place, nothing fancy, not even any place to sit. there's a long bar-type shelf where you can eat. i got take out. told the guy to pick the 3 best things on the menu and he was happy to help me decide. 3 heaping portions of a potato/onion dish, a spinach dish, and a chickpea dish + gigantor amount of rice = $5.50. brought it home to reheat it -- flavorful and just spicy enough. will definitely go back again for some cheap latenight.
