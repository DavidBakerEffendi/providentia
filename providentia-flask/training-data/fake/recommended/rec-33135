It's a tiny restaurant so make a reservation. We had to wait 20 minutes and there is no waiting area so it was awkward. When we were seating one of the owners spoke with us and he was very warm. He talked us through the menu and his favorites and shared a little about growing up in SÃ£o Paulo. The food was flawless. I mean... mouthgasims. This place is now in regular rotation. I'm obsessed with the acaraje. I had the pollack- phenomenal. Can't say enough positive about it.
