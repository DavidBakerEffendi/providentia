If I can paraphrase Paul Rudd in 40 Year Old Virgin, "Well it is $9 pretzel night." I'm split right down the middle on this place because I live under Starr's poverty line. It's cool. Looks great. Beer is well selected. I enjoy seeing Philadelphians forced to figure out how to share the giant tables. They have ping pong and it is a legit beer garden. I can't afford it and there are just a hair too many popped collars for my tastes. The end!
