The ambiance was excellent, and the food was superb.  I celebrated a birthday here recently and everything really was fantastic.  The staff was attentive without being overbearing, and they seemed to accommodate our needs without being asked;  including keeping rounds of drinks going, and bringing out the cake at exactly the right time.
