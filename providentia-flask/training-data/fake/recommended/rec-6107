Overall was a very nice experience; lovely outdoor space, and great service.  I tried a few dishes and didn't love any particular one; but the ingredients were fresh and the dishes were interesting. The cobia was the most flavorful dish - it had an interesting smokey flavor.  The Trout was a bit more boring, though I loved the cherries it came with. The pasta dish was the most boring, and felt like a rip off to me.  It was the one with squash and ricotta..$29 for some pasta with some shreds of cheese.   The Peach-blueberry cobbler was good but not outstanding.  I'll.come back when the menu changes.
