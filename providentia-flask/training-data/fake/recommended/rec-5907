Intoxicating smell of briny mixed olives and pungent cheeses upon entering the shop. Incredible pastas, particularly the cannelloni, which has been baked many times with a burgundy wine marinara and topped with fresh mozzarella for a show-stopping meal. Wonderful fresh pasta. Good, tangy buffalo mozzarella. Meatballs in sauce are too salty, an admonition of those who neglected to bake their own. Prompt, friendly service. Highly recommended.
