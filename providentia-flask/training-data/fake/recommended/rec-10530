although i've only eaten at one other gyro cart... this by far is the best gyro halal cart in nyc! walked by the cart a couple nights before, and the line was at least 30-40 people deep (at 3am in the morning). so we decided to hit this place up some other day. we went back on a monday night at 12am, and there was no wait! the gyro platter over rice and salad is delicious to say the least! can't beat it for 5 bucks. it was so good, my friend ended up going back for seconds here (along w/ everywhere else) haha. all this talkin' about food is making me hungry. ugh the problem with yelpin...
