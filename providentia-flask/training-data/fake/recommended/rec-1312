I know this place is kind of new and very popular, but for good reason. It's such a cool spot. I have been here several times including when the weather is great and when it is snowing in the winter, and in both cases the courtyard is packed. The fire pits and umbrella heaters really make the cold bearable. The picnic table set up makes it great for groups. And of course they have great beers on tap which you can get in Liter mugs. Really cool atmosphere at this place. I am always willing to go back.
