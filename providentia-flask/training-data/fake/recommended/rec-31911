4 stars for the bread which is similar to JoJu. Theirs is better than banh mi saigon bread which always cuts the roof of the mouth, but Paris is better than banh mi saigon bread, just that the filling reallyyyy sucks, but JoJu bread is the best.  Anyways, enough about the bread, I ordered the hog and the beef.  It was sad that both cuts of meat looked identical and tasted identical! What the?! The balance was totally off, It was just meat and no daikon and carrots, which I need to say, where are the daikon shreds haha! I probably had 2 shreds of daikon in comparison to a lump of carrot. The balance of banh mi is that there is a perfect ratio of meat:veggies.  Absent daikon and carrots & cilantro :( so sad... Also got the lemongrass taco to try. Sadly this tasted just like the hog and beef and the color was the same as them! Is it all the same sauce? Someone tell me 2 stars for the waiting time for the food and the guy in the front who didn't even smile.  Ok guys, I know it takes 5-10 mins to make the sandwiches, it's posted on the wall.... but I waited 15 whole minutes... too long for a sandwich... I felt sorry for the group of 6 who came in after me...they didn't know they were gonna wait 30mins for theirs! Let me say, this was mid weekday too! (FYI no bathroom)
