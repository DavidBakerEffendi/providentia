Finally came here for brunch.  And it was tasty.  The stuffed french toast really was a remarkable dish.  Sweet and savory and really just kind of perfect.   I also had the painkiller cocktail, which was good, but sort of an afterthought compared to the awesome food choice. Everyone else's looked awesome too.  Even the coffee was delish.  And the service was great too. It was cramped and loud, normal Sunday brunch crowd, and it's definitely on the splurg-ier side for brunch, price-wise, but otherwise I can't wait to come back and try more of their stuff.  Really very good.
