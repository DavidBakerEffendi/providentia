So, this place is in my top 3 favorite places in Brooklyn and probably top 5 for NYC.  The seafood dishes that they serve are bangin'.  I got the monkfish and my partner got the skate.  So much flavor, great combinations of seasonal ingredients, and just delicious.  The service is great too.  I couldn't decide between two wines and the waiter brought over a taste of both, not like that is worth the good service merit it was just nice and surprising that I didn't have to ask for it; the waiter offered.  Also, we ordered the two types of oysters that they were offering that night...they were awesome. I would disagree with the Restaurant Girl's review of the striped bass.(restaurantgirl.com/cuisi…).  I think that dish has great flavors and is embedded in my memory as the best sea bass I have ever had.
