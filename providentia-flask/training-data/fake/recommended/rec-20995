Enjoyed a week night dinner with another couple.  Seated promptly at time of reservation. Grilled calamari appetizer was tasty, with spicy kick. Calves liver entree flavorful, a bit skimpy on the meat portion and a shade overlooked and tough.  Wife enjoy the skirt steak, cooked just right.  Pretty good leftover too!
