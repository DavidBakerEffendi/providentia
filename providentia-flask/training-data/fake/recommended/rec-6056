PROS: - Excellent service and cozy atmosphere. - Vegetarian-friendly. - They have a plethora of Greek wine options, which can also be a con for some if they prefer other wine selections over the Greek ones. CONS: - When we wanted to first go, we were told that they were booked. So we made reservations for the next week, which was an easy process. I recommend that you call in advance and make a reservation, if you think it is needed (especially with a huge party). * Overall, we had a memorable experience, especially since my friends and I never really had authentic Greek food (unless you count the countless gyros). I love exploring different cultures and their foods, so coming to this restaurant was a new experience that turned out to be quite welcoming. Our waitress was really helpful when we were still confused with what to order. We ended up with the grilled octopus, shrimp pasta, lamp chops (YUM), salmon, sea bass, salad and eggplant.
