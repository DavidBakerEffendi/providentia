Upon entering Jones, the first thing you will notice is the stucco-brick facade, mod-style booths and seats, and the fireplaces in the center of the restaurant. It's kinda a throwback to the Brady Bunch house in a way, it has a 70s feel that has been modernized. Of all the Stephen Starr restaurants, this one is my favorite because it pulls off its theme the best. It's an upscale type of diner/lounge vibe, with American comfort food. Menu items include grilled cheese and tomato soup, mac and cheese, fried chicken with waffles, and one of my favorites--Thanksgiving Dinner (which includes turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and cranberry). The food is relatively inexpensive (between $8 and $20 for an entree) and the dessert options are quite delicious. It's a great place to get a full meal for less then $20 a person, the service and ambiance provide a great addition to the food offerings. This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Philadelphia.
