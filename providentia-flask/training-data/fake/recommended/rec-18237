When I first moved to the area I was excited to see a Mexican place named after a seldom-found Mexican dish I first experienced at "Toro Partido" while living in Hamilton Heights. That tinga was so tender, moist, and flavorful it'd make your head'asplode - THIS tinga, errrr...not so much. "Tinga Taqueria" managed to actually remove flavor from the chicken, as well as any moisture and color. These bland "tinga" chunks were served with bits of iceberg lettuce and a lazy piccadillo on a too-huge fried flour tortilla. It wasn't horrible, it wasn't good - it was just boring. I'm not some sort of Mexi-snob - I like all styles: TexMex, CaliMex, D.F. Mexicano, The Ball Fields of Brooklyn, mas o meno, you name it - they all try to excite the taste buds. On the other hand, "Tinga Taqueria" is not trying that hard, because really, they don't have to - I don't see much in the way of GREAT Mexican places in Montclair that can compare to (the 3 years I lived in) Sunset Park... ....then again, I'm just a noob here and perhaps I'll think "Tinga Taqueria" is AMAZING when enough apathy sets in. ^__^
