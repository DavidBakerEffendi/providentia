Was here for brunch with some friends before a big day in the city and was very pleased by the fresh ingredients they use in their food. The selection was very good with a number of unique and classic sandwich/wrap combinations, all for very reasonable prices given Manhattan trends. Also very cute decor inside makes for a great place to hang out with friends or take a breather before a busy day.
