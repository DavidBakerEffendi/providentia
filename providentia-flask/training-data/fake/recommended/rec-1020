Have to agree with Ina L. that the concept and decor are very similar to Qi in Times Square. In fact, I thought the owners were the same, but alas they are not. Room Service is a dark restaurant with a nice glass centerpiece in the middle. The interior IS beautiful and looks rather upscale, but once you look at the menu you will quickly notice that it is not all that different than any other Thai restaurant. I can't comment on many of the items as I only been here once, however I did get to try the Thai Iced Tea (of course) and one of the restaurant's signature dishes (no surprise here) the Room Service Pad Thai. The Thai Iced Tea comes in a rather tall glass, which is a GOOD thing if you love Thai Iced Tea! Flavor was no different than what I had expected. As for the Room Service Pad Thai, it was QUITE interesting looking. The actual Pad Thai is wrapped up in an egg and was definitely one of the more unique looking Pad Thai's I had ever eaten. It's a good size serving and as for the flavor it was very good. The noodle was moist, had good flavor and alot of the typical side ingredients (i.e. scallions, bean sprouts, etc). I can't say the flavor stuck out in anyway, but the presentation was certainly different. On a final note, the prices were fair and the service was fast. No complaints there. It's a nice Thai restaurant to visit if you want something a bit more "upscale" looking, but don't be fooled by the decor as the menu will make you feel right at home if you're looking for solid Thai food.
