This has become my favorite place to grab a cocktail before heading out for dinner... The bartenders are great, the attendees are usually chill and the drinks are always eccentric...I found this place because I wanted something different for my date...  It jumped out when I looked at the menu, 'If you would like a custom cocktail based on the ingredients below, please indicate so to the bartender, who will take the time to learn your tastes and create something just for you.'  You pick a spirit, texture, spice, flavor and fruit then they make a custom drink to your liking..  An unusual experience due to the variety of spices and flavors the bartenders can create..  I always advise friends to ask the bartender for a customized drink, it's what sets this place apart from every other bar...
