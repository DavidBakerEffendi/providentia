So I met this girl from Vermont while I was studying in London. We dined, we traveled. We partook of the finest cuisine in Naples, Capri, Rome... But when I looked in her eyes, I saw... silent, profound disappointment. No, of all the meals in all the cities we visited, none could stand up to her ideal. The most "wicked best Italian Food on the Planet," she would call it. If you're reading this, that means that you too have heard of the legend. Yes, Papa Frank's of Winooski is the place of which she spoke. She took me there, one rainy Halloween. Would my life be changed forever? Would I learn that everything I had known, that everything I had seen, had been a lie? ... Uh, no. I wouldn't. Katie. And the floor of this restaurant is definitely sloping a dubious 45 degrees to the right, in case nobody had noticed. Give me my 3 seasons back, you crackhead!
