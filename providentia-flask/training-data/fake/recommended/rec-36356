YUM! My boss and I came here after landing in NY on a snowy winter day and it was just what we needed. The food was amazing and it's definitely authentic Malaysian food. We ordered 4 dishes off the menu for the two of us and devoured it all! The roti canai was scrumptious. I wish we ordered more of that, but the rest of the food was great as well. Portions are big and I can't believe we ate it all. The next night, my boss was craving more Malaysian food, so she ordered some curry to go. Food was still great at 11pm. It's been reviewed sooo many times and has zagat ratings too. I'll definitely come here again on my next trip out to NY.
