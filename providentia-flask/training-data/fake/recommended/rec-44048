Decided to make our anniversary dinner our first Garces experience as well. I picked Amada because of the recommended location and romantic ambiance. The place is pretty packed on a Saturday night so reservations would be a suggestion. We got there a bit earlier than our reservation and decided to grab a drink at the bar an greeted by a very attentive staff. Your everyday drinks are well made and strong. Their specialty drinks are a must try. Even though they are a bit pricey, the taste and potency are worth the $12+ you pay. I do think they need to make the bar area a bit more bright as I literally saw a guy holding a mini flashlight just to look over the menu. Front dining area is where you want to be seated for people watching and if you are with a more lively crowd, but we were seated in the back where it is a bit more intimate. The menu is a one-pager but it can be a little daunting trying to figure out what to order and how much. They recommend about 3 plates per person which seemed about right. Even though they are small plates, you will start feeling full towards the end of your meal as most plates consist of bread, protein or cheese. The standouts items were the bacon wrapped dates and the pork flatbread. The disappointments were the filet which tasted more like a cheap cut of meat (esp. for $19) and the goat cheese dip which reminded me of Stouffer's lasagna. Service was attentive and happy with the experience, but not to the point that I would venture back into the city to try it out again.
