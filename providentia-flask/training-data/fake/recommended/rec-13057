Me and my wife went for dinner a few nights ago. Get there a little before 6 like we did or you're gonna have to wait a while. The food was excellent. Friendly service. And they even gave us 2 scones from lunch to take home with us for free. We had them for breakfast the next morning and they were delicious. We'll definitely go back one day.
