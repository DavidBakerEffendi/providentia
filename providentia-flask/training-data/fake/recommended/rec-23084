The moment I climbed up the stairs into this teahouse I was awed by the Japanese tea house decors!! The atmosphere was very soothing and relaxing. It had the Japanese teahouse look/style with a modern twist. The teahouse isn't very big, but there was enough room between each table to give he customers privacy and space. Also, I saw that there were tea rooms to the side of the house, which looked very cool! So far, I've tried the smoked and grilled salmon toast! I adore the smoked salmon toast! The salmon was very fresh and thinly sliced onto the crispy golden toast, and romaine lettuce (or something similar) were layered on top of the salmon along with a drizzle of creamy and appetizing dressing. I also had the matcha tea with red bean. Green tea is considered in the cooler side and red bean on the warmer side, so the mix of the two created a nice twist and flavor! More importantly, the matcha tea had lots of flavor. My second time coming here I had the chrysanthemum blossom tea ($6) and the hojicha anmitsu ($8.50). I was expecting the tea to be sweeter since it has chrysanthemum, but the tea was rather light with a hint of spiciness. It ended up being a good complement with the dessert because the dessert was a little too sweet for me! The green tea ice cream would've gone well with the balance of the lightly flavored jelly and glutinous rice balls, but the addition of the black syrup made the dessert a little too sweet. Overall, it has a good variety of desserts and teas and a selective few of main food/tea sets, which allow them to focus and specialize into making those good! The environment and service were very impressive!
