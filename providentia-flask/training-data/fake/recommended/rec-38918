I came here while visiting on my last day in town.  There was a 45 minute wait to sit outside, but we were able to get our group of four seated right away.  The vibe inside was great; the outside looked great as well.  The service we had was really good, the server was really knowledgeable.  We started with some beers and a cheese plate....we ate up that cheese super fast, it was great!  I got the Vermont Cheddar Ale - INCREDIBLE and the Kale & Arugula Salad - also delicious.  My friends all enjoyed their food as well - burger, Vermont Heritage Grazers Pork and the Spring Quinoa.   If I come back to Burlington, I will absolutely come back here. If you live here, I don't know how you couldn't come here for every meal!
