It all started when one of my girlfriends took me over there. I loved it 2 appetizers and one entree for 7 bux! GREAT! Most places like this only give you one appetizer. Anyhoot they got me hooked. I was going for about a good two weeks for lunch. Even though their credit card machine got broken and I had to pay cash at the last minute...(yeah they told me when I was done eating) it was OK I kept coming back Today - that streak ended. I waited for 10 minutes to be acknowledged (water, tea coffee?) something to keep me sane because I was starving but of course nothing so I wait and then the waitress comes over after I was getting my bag to go (she was cleaning the other tables in preparation for the next wave of guests) she took my order I waited, waited and waited.....then my food came..I had pad thai, crispy rolls and a curry puff. My curry puff was frozen in the middle. when I told her about it she said...oh im sorry I will bring another, I said, no, I have to go back to work now....no manager was available and this girl was barely understanding what I was saying....her words "itll never happen again" (regurgitated in her bbest English accent) ...you betcha cause i will NEVAH be back
