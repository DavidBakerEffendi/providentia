A must-try if you're in NYC: delicious AND cheap! We got a combo plate (comes w/chicken, gyro [lamb], rice, lettuce, and pita bread) - it wasn't quite enough food for 2 people, but that's OK. Â The chicken and gyro were both super flavorful. On the side, they give you this spicy sauce & also a creamy yogurt sauce... but frankly, I didn't think the food needed any sauce because it was so delicious already. I don't know what their official hours are, but they were already open a little after 7pm on a Wednesday. My only tip: If you get the food to-go and don't eat it right away, the pita will get grossly soggy -- no bueno.
