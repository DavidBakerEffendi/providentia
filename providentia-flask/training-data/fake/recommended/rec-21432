Menu: ANTIPASTI-Applewood-Smoked Salumi, Roasted Olives, Pickled Fennel and Celery, Salty Egg, Fried Butternut Squash, & Herb Ricotta e Bianca  And... Margarita Pizza whicc has San Marzano tomato sauce and topped with chiffonaded(sic)  basil.     My friend and I loved sharing these amply sized platters. Innovated fresh  and imaginative are the best way to describe both. Served up in a hip, minimalist decor which works great for the vibe of the neighborhood. Service was attentive and quick despite the fact it was a Thursday and mobbed. And no one made fun of us because we are over 40 :-)   Double bonus. We will be back.
