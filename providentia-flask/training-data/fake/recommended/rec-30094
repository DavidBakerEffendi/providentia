So I dont get into New Haven often enough, but we made a trek there for another event and wanted to get some apizza heaven before.  Dropped the family off at Modern, went to park.  Wife says 40-50 minute wait.  Sigh.  Turned on Yelp and there was a lot of good reviews for Da Legna.  Popped in, said no wait, so I went to get the family out of the other lobby, and came back and the table was ready. Staff were very nice, attentive.  Tables were comfy and ambient noise wasnt bad at all. Menu looked pretty interesting and we settled in for a plain pie for the kids, some bruschetta and an eggplant artisan pie for us. The bruschetta was great, basil baked into the bread.  So good! Then the pizzas came.  Absoulutely a smash hit.  Their sauce rocked on the plain mozz pie and the kids didnt even complain about the charring, which they always do with apizza. Our eggplant pie was simply amazing.  Cant believe we didnt finish it.  This apizza was fantastic.  Crust was great, it hit all the right spots.   Was a little worried that it wouldnt be that kid friendly as it looked a little fancier than a typical pizza joint, but maybe since my kids are older now they are not as obnoxious?   Friendly, quick service.  Nice folks.  We'll be back!
