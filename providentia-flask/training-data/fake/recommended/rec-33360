Update: they should come up with a locals card or something because a 3 hour wait is just unacceptable.  I haven't sat down in this place in over 4 months because it consistently turns you off when you have to wait that long for a pie at 9 pm.  But I guess it's popular, and since the food is good to go along with that, it's gonna be packed.  So, stars are downgraded because they need to figure that one out.
