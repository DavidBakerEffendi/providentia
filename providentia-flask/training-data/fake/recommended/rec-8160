I have mixed feelings about Vientiane Cafe.  I like the neighborhoodiness of it.  And the food is alright, I've had some really good, nothing ever down-right bad, but mostly alright fare here.  The menu seems basically straightforward Thai, with some exceptions... which was a bummer to find after walking in the first time thinking Laos... even though there's overlap. I get the impression that the whole operation is afloat by a shoe-string... which is sad.  I hope it all gets sorted.
