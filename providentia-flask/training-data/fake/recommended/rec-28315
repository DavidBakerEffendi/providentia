Big portions, a bowl of lemons, outdoor sidewalk seating, delicious seafood, and if you're lucky, a complimentary dessert.  What's not to like? This traditional Greek Taverna is something you'd find on the streets of Athens, serving fresh Greek seafood.  It's a fantastic place to go with a group or with kids because you get so much food and it's healthy, yummy, and reasonably priced.  The traditional greek salad is exactly what they serve in Greece and it's to die for, with yummy olives, and a big slab of feta to break apart with your drizzle of olive oil and herbs over fresh chunks of tomato and cucumber. There's a long wait and a high demand for outdoor seating here, but it's worth the time.  Taverna Kyclades focuses on the food, the wine, and the air, and leaves all the gimmicks aside.
