I really liked my hot dog. I got the brooklyn with a vegi dog, it was very good, I love sourkraut. I am eager to eventually try some other dogs. Only weird thing was employee atmosphere. Maybe it was a weird day for them, but they just seemed sad. It made me feel weird to order a hotdog on a Sunday at 12pm. Get some suga in your step people! But forreal, good dogs.
