This is probably the healthiest place to eat in NYC. They have a strict standard Â of serving "real food" that would surpass Michael Pollan's highest expectations. I agree with some of the other reviewers that some of the food can be a little on the bland side , but that is only because our palettes have been perverted by the typical, highly-processed american diet. So, if you want a healthy, quick -serve meal this is an excellent choice
