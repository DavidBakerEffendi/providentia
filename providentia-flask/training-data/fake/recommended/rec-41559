Having passed by Meme on a number of occasions, I thought it looked promising. I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to seat us immediately around 7 on a Saturday night. The restaurant is very small. It took some time for them to bring us menus. When we went to order, they were out of the wine and the figs appetizer we wanted (not a big deal, but not a strong start). We ordered the butternut Squash and hallumi salad which was the best part of our meal, which isn't saying much. It was good but really nothing special.  The babaganoush was okay but a little under-seasoned and would have been better if it were smokier.  To top it off, the bowl came with four triangles of pita, definitely not enough to scoop it up with. Luckily, we weren't interested in finishing it. I also ordered the lobster cakes. I specifically asked if they had pepper and was assured they did not.  While the cakes themselves didn't, they were covered in a salsa that did. The cakes themselves were okay but nothing special.  My friend had the risotto which was overcooked and under-seasoned. Instead of serving us in courses at our tiny table, all the food came at once, making the table crowded and made us full rushed. Overall, the food was disappointing.   The women at the table next to us sat at their table forever. When we had just paid the bill and I still had a full beer, we were asked to finish our drinks at the bar.  While I would have understood if we had been lingering as the women next to us had been, we weren't.  The whole thing felt a little rushed. Based on my experience, I'm honestly shocked to see reviews this high. With so many great restaurants in NYC, Meme was lackluster at best.  I have no intention of returning and I would strongly suggest going elsewhere.
