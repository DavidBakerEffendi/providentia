This place was excellent across the board. The cocktails were unique and tasty, our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and each dish lived up to expectations created by our waiter's vivid descriptions. All of this, together with its intimate ambiance makes for a 5-star experience. For dessert, I highly recommend the warm custard brioche pudding, which was a fantastic way to cap out a great meal.
