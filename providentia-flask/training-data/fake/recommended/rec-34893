You MUST come and try this place out if you're visiting NYC. It hits the spot after the very first bite. I'm salivating just thinking about it. I ordered the combination plate and it was just delicious with the ranch sauce. Beware of imposters that stand on other corners. They are directly across from the Marriot (if I remember correctly.) The smell is so fragrant you would want to eat it right then and there!
