Cute French place. Went here for breakfast and I think I made the right decision. It's in the Flatiron District and not much going on the street and not too hard to miss. Inside, the dining area is a bit small and kind of cluttered to me but they do have outside sitting in the back. The kitchen is right out front and not saying the food was bad but they were prepared by not French chefs but Mexicans. I only ordered their Belgian waffles with strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. The waffle was good but the fruit could have been a little more sweeter. They tasted really sour or not ripe enough. Service was great. The staff seemed knowledgeable and they have pastries, cafes, and dessert! Next time, I have to try lunch and dinner entries. I'll give them another try!
