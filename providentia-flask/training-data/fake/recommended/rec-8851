Cheese fondue, clam chowder, and steak tartar at 3:30 am?  Yes, please. Even at that ridiculous early morning hour, the food was delicious and well-prepared.  The portion sizes were generous,the atmosphere was intimate, and the service was terrific. An amazing late night snack, but probably also excellent for dinner.
