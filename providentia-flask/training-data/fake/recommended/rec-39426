Definitely go for half price bottle night! I've loved getting together and going here with friends. I find that most guys generally dislike tapas (not full unless they get a BUNCH, which can be pricey) but I've had a few fun girls nights here. Love the crispy peppers, patatas bravas, etc. After going to Spain, I feel like these tapas are right on.
