Had a great time here with my girlfriend the other night. We stopped in for a late night snack after Fashion's Night Out, and the food was delish! Â The Honey Ginger KFC had a kick that I enjoyed, and the shumai was delightful. Great music and a good vibe from the crowd makes this a place I will definitely visit again!
