I can't believe there are not more reviews for my favorite Philadelphia restaurant.  Make a reservation since the restaurant is tiny.  Has an open kitchen.  The chef goes to the docks daily to make his selection and the menu centers around his choices.  I've even had fish I never heard of before (escolar) and I'm a huge foodie (chef's wife).  The food is incredibly fresh and the desserts are house made as well and equally delicious.  The chocolate pot de creme is not to be missed if you're a chocolate freak.  Oh yeah, there are non-fish items as well.
