AMAZING!! Best place in Chinatown. I kinda do have to pour a lot of Sriracha into my soup, but that might be because I'm obsessed with spicy food. The soups are filling for me, but my boyfriend is a tall, big guy and is never full. The noodles are amazing... I usually opt for the vegetarian soup because I'm not comfortable eating pig ears, etc. The best part about this place is that it is CHEAP!! Cash only though!
