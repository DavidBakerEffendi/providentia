Loved this place... been dying to go for quite awhile. It was late night (about 11:30PM) and we stayed until about 1:30AM. I kept it simple with the drinks and had a couple of drafts (Bells was on tap) but the food was incredible. My girlfriend and I stuck with the cheeses and small plates and all 3 or 4 of them were amazing. Great atmosphere inside with seating also available outside. Will definitely be back soon!
