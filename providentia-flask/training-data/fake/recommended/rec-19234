Came here for happy hour in honor of a friend passing her oral defense. They had a selection of meats, cheeses, and pickled veggies to choose from and wines. I was most impressed with the pickled veggies. I tend to roll my eyes at places that offer bland veggies as the non-meat option but they were delish. The selection of wines was also impressive and not as expensive as I thought considering this place got three dollar signs Salads were also good and not your average caesar. Overall, I would recommend to others.
