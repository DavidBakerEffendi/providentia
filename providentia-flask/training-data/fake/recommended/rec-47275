I have mixed feelings about Yerba.  The space is attractive but it was deafeningly loud.  Part of that is the people, to be sure, but I should be able to hear all my friends at our table of four. I would come back here purely for the cocktails. I tried the poquito picana (so, i can't spell in Spanish :) which was so wonderfully spiced with pepper and cilantro. It was amazingly good. I can't describe how much I liked this cocktail. On to the food. We ordered tapas style the croquettes, gauc, calamari, avocado fries and the habenero ceviche.  I thought the gauc (despite being over priced for the portion side) and ceviche were outstanding. I loved the idea behind the avocado fries, but  I didn't like them. My party did, so don't be deterred from my lack of enjoyment there. I thought the calamari was too salty, but again, my friends all seemed to enjoy it. The manchego croquettes were pretty good. I would have liked them better with meat, but the bite sized preparation was great for 'polite eating' vs normal croquettes that you are either biting in half or shoving into your mouth. Overall, the amount of food for the price and the noisey ambiance knocked my review down.
