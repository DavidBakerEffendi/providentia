I own the salon two doors down and I have to say, I eat here regularly and so does my staff! The food is so fresh and really good everytime. It's really a hidden gem in Newington. I was not a fan of sushi and I'm still experimenting with some of the menu but, everything new that I discover is always sooooo good it's addicting! My staff are the sushi experts and they should name a roll after us at this point we all eat there so much! If you love Sushi you can not go wrong with this place at all!
