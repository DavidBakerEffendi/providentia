Good for a quick bite that will fill you up.  I knocked off a star because it's very pricey for burgers and fries but it's so tasty that I'll definitely be going back at some point.   The atmosphere here is industrial but clean and bright, but there's not a ton of room so I'd avoid coming with a huge group for the best experience.  House sauce was really good, my only complaint about the burger was that the bun fell apart really easily.  Staff was nice, too.
