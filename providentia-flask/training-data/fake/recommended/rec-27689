Great service, but a&s isn't a solid competitor to other pizzerias on the island. I recommend Romeos, and Paesanos for some of the best pizza on the Island (in my opinion. Also, don't even think about coming here in the summer because it's super hot in the restaurant and they have no air conditioning or fans running. Oh, there is a fan working but it's pointed to outside of the restaurant to keep the hot breeze out. Ridiculous.
