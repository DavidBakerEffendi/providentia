We used to love this place when it was at its old location years back where Meme is now at 22nd and Spruce.  We lived right down the street so it was a great neighborhood BYOB with awesome food and fair prices.  But after it moved down to the Sansom St. location, our experiences and opinions have changed a little.  We still enjoy the food but it hasn't been as great as we remembered.  We've been to the new location only 5 times since they've moved and I'd say my experience overall was just average. One of our favorite dishes remains the mussels steamed in white wine, tomatoes, garlic, etc.  However, the last couple of times we went, the mussels were on the smaller side and weren't as meaty.  The spicy fish stew is great but that's something that I am partial to because I'm a seafood lover and also enjoy a little kick in my dishes.  We love that it is still a BYOB and those are just always fun to begin with!  It's still up there with La Viola and Branzino as a top Italian BYOB choice for Center City.
