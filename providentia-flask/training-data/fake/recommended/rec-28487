Personally, I really don't get what's SOOOO great about Ippudo. I'm a huge ramen fan but I think their noodles are too thin - almost like angel hair. Their broth is very greasy and oily, and although it's delicious on the first few slurps, I'm regretting it by the end of the meal. My favorite thing on the menu are the pork buns. I actually wouldn't mind going there, having an order and a beer as a quick happy hour, if I were in the neighborhood. I'm not going to complain about the wait because it is what it is. Although, they now encourage you to leave the area and call them back to check on your status. That was a great improvement. I will however complain about the greeting staff. Understand that people are waiting for upwards of 2 hours to eat a bowl of noodles. I heard a customer say, "I hope my name comes up soon, I've been waiting a long time." She gave a smile, and rolled her eyes as she turned around to face me. Basically, she rolled her eyes at him in MY face. Then she gave me the same "smile" and asked me to confirm my name. I blankly stared at her and realized how futile it would be to even say anything. You're the short, doughy greeter at a noodle shop, not the door person at a club. Get over yourself and learn how to be courteous to your customers - especially at a Japanese restaurant to a Japanese customer.
