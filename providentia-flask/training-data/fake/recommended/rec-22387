the food is fantastic.  the drinks are great (they DO have a liquor license now).  Be sure to splurge and get the good margaritas (made with fresh squeezed, and not a mix:  it's worth it.)  The staff is fantastic and friendly and helpful  this is authentic, delicious mexican food. There is only one thing that could make this place better:  more vegetarian options.  Yes, there are a few, but i'd like more.  There are plenty of fabulous fish entrees...but more veggies would be welcome.
