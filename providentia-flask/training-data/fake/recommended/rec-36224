I ordered the bistro burger, which was very good. My boyfriend made the mistake of ordering the chilli burger, which was downright disgusting. We didn't know that 'chilli' (or 'chili', with one L, as you guys spell it) in America refers to chilli con carne, so we were horrified by the mountain of meat that was placed on the table before us. It looked and tasted like an enormous pile of crap. The bun halves were so drenched in meat and sauce that they had been pulverised into mush. See my second attached picture for reference.
