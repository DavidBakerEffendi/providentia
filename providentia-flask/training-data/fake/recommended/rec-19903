This is my favorite place to get brunch in all of NYC. The scrambles are out of this world and so is the french toast. They also make my favorite bloody mary in town. The only problem is it is impossible to get a table, no matter what time of day it is. I live in the neighborhood and despite all of my efforts to find a time to get in for brunch when the wait isn't long, I have never waited less than an hour for a table.
