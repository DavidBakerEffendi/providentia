We came across this deal on gilt city & decide to give the place a try. The deal says to call & make reservations , not necessary it is not that kind of place very laid back you can just walk in. They have a pretty decent menu , not huge but plenty of choices we decide on the following 1) Truffle fries amazing ...so good goes perfect w the garlic aoli sauce (2)  Sticky salad , not bad noting special. On the Chicken we tried the (3) General Tao's crunchy ... these were really good nice taste not very spicy w a nice sweet taste Next the (4) Buffalo fingers fried ...pretty good & spicy , then followed by  (5) naked buffalo , which is griiled good . Next the (6) Lemon Lime fingers , naked ...really good & so far the favorite , great taste. The slaws we tried the (7) Spicy Carrot  has a nice kick to it  (8) Creamy pineapple not bad , a bit sweet. Sauces ... Garlic aioli  was the favorite ...Thai sweet chili ,  Dejon honey mustard , tangy BBQ , ranch all pretty good. During our visit we happen to meet the owner of the place  he was very nice & even gave us some free chicken to try, nice guy. This place was a great find, the chicken is really good , prices are pretty decent , friendly service as well. We enjoyed our meal & will definitely be returning. ** Just a quick update ** I stopped by again recently & this time we tried the Bada Bing chicken , wow amazing so good with the sauce & cheese dripping out very nice taste. Also tried the Vampire Killer , pretty good as well the chicken was a little dry this time but with the sauces to dip it in not a big deal still pretty good lots of garlic flavor. The string bean fries are surprisingly good , I would not have thought this because it's a string bean but hey I guess if u fry it why wouldn't it be good lol so far this place has turned out pretty good each time.
