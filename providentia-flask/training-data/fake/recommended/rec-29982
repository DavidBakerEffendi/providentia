My Rating: 3.5 ($40 - $70/person) Favorites: Mushroom risotto, Roasted beet salad Eno Terra, loosely translated to mean "earth and wine", combines all the enviable aspects of a traditional fine dining restaurant (atmosphere, exclusive drink list) and the modern sensibility of an environmentally responsible business. But does that translate to a winning menu? Unlike its inviting decor, Eno Terra's style of food left no memorable impression on me. Consequently, I was let down by the roasted beet salad and three cheese agnolotti. At this price level, I would just expect more components to a dish. The roasted beet salad was dressed well but was accompanied by a ricotta cheese flan, which just did not pair well with the acidity of the vinaigrette. The flan tasted like a sweet cheese custard and, in my opinion, has no business being on the plate. There is a reason why goat cheese pairs so well with arugula and spicy greens. When it comes to the agnolotti, the pasta was cooked well (albeit a little cold when I received it). However, the filling had no distinct flavor (all cheeses just tasted the same). The real star of this dish were the excellent vegetables, which I wished came in a greater quantity. Overall, the bland filling accompanied by a very simple pan butter sauce melded into a singular boring flavor. Yet, looking past the agnolotti, I can recommend the excellent Bent Spoon Trio ice-cream (catered from a local creamery) for dessert. Eno Terra fails to impress in an already over saturated Italian restaurant scene. While they utilize quality ingredients, which according Â to them is sourced from local farms (farm-to-table), they fail to excite the palette with meaningful flavors. That is not to say that patrons would not be satisfied with their meals, but don't come looking for anything other than straightforward Italian cuisine.
