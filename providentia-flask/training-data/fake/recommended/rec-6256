Best burger I've ever had!! The original is the bomb although the truffle one was really good too. It's that crispy Parmesan cheese they put on top of the patty that makes it sooo amazing! We tried the fried pickles, smushed potato and truffle cheese fries too. Â I'd recommend the pickles and the truffle cheese fries. Many people were ordering the onion tempura too which are huge! Will try them next time. Wait time was about 45min for 2 people on Sunday at 5ish. Omg! And their home made ketchup was super tasty too. I was just eating that on its own lol.
