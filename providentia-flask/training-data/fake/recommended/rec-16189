People (zagat et al.) say that the neighboring restaurant has the best Vietnamese food in Philly, but really I don't think there is a comparison in terms of flavors.  Despite the cafeteria/mass-produced stylings, for quality of food, taste, and speed of service this one wins hands down.  And Chinatown Vietnamese (a la Vietnam/Vietnam restaurant) are not nearly as good as anything on Washington Ave.   If you must go to Chinatown try Pho Xe Lua.   I was introduced to this place by a Vietnamese friend, and have been hooked ever since.  I'm still looking for an equally good place in NYC.  Don't go for a fancy date or for atmosphere,  but do go any other time you want excellent Vietnamese food! (good take out too!)
