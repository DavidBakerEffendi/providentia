Fab breakfast!! Their scrambled eggs are made with an espresso steamer... very creative and the result is the lightest, fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever had! Excellent coffee as well. They had a great space, with country decor and a table fit for our large party of 8 that put us in a somewhat secluded space, great for catching up.
