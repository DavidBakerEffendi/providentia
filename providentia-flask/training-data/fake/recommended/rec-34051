Wow! Can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place. I LOVE SoCo! I've been here 4 or 5 times, and I've loved it every time. All of the entrees I've ordered have been awesome and the drinks are delicious! The service is excellent, and I've always been seated immediately when I get there, and I never have a reservation or anything. The restaurant is very clean, and the atmosphere is very nice. The crowd here is very nice, too. Everyone looks presentable. Great date spot, or a place to get drinks and a meal with your girls. It's actually great for everything, in my opinion. I can't wait to go back!
