Both people who made my tacos were super friendly and accommodating. Apparently this place is Tex-Mex with an emphasis on Tex, i.e. Texas style foods in a Mexican presentation (i.e. tacos, burritos, etc.). I say allegedly simply because I am not acquainted with Texas food per se. However, in terms of creating smoky flavors in their meats and toppings, they really do know what they're doing in terms of creating flavorful dishes. The smoked portabellas with special sauce were especially good. I would be more of a fan if they used antibiotic- and hormone-free products.
