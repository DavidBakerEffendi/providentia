I had dinner here with my honey on a Friday night. It is an authentic Italian restaurant. We had reservations and they sat us right away. Our waiter was amazing. He was always there making sure we were satisfied. We ordered chicken alfredo. It was prepared to perfection!! The alfredo sauce was thick and not runny like many places. The chicken was grilled and tender. The presentation looked spectacular. The dessert was also delicious. We ordered the cannoli, my favorite. and My bf ordered the poached pear in red wine & cinnamon. Its an acquired taste but yummy nonetheless. The cinnamon does help the dessert. Its also served with fruit and vanilla ice cream, always a good arrangement. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thumbs up =)
