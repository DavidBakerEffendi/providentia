This was a nice place for lunch.  We shared a lobster sandwich and a side of cauliflower.  It was enough for a light lunch.  Sandwich was very flavorful, but not too much lobster.  The side salad that comes with the sandwich was fresh and dressed with just a bit of dressing that didn't overpower the salad.  Overall, a cute little space.
