Stopped by while walking down Broad Street on Saturday afternoon for a quick bite to go. There was a restaurant part in the back that looked pretty nice, but I hung out in the front counter area instead, with its red leatherette cushions and beat up cafeteria glory. (Personal preference: I love places like that.) The chicken burger and its roll left a lot to be desired in taste and texture; I walked out muttering to myself, "shoulda gotten the cheesesteak", which is what a lot of other reviews seem to be focused on. It wasn't really worth the $5.50, but at least the guy heaped a lot of greens and pickles and whatnot. (He felt guilty because he dropped the first attempt on the floor. He didn't try to serve it though; points for him!) There was a line the whole time I was there, with one guy working grill and one other taking orders/running the register (which was out of change, delaying things further). For a short-order to-go place, it took a while (20 mins) to get just my burger and go. Both employees were friendly and chatty, the food didn't make me sick, and it was a convenient place to stop for some noms. If I have a chance to stop again, and I can get the cheesesteak in 15, and it's delicious, I'll probably bump this up to a 4. Also, the cookies looked AMAZING.
