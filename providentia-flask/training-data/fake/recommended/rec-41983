Perfect meal for my Mom's 70th, with uncles & bro in from out of town. Everyone very impressed with everything: service impeccable, food exquisite (except lamb shank "boring, not tender enough", I didn't have that), and a terrific time. Been here a few times before & always loved it. Again: superb. Maitresse d'h√¥tel was so welcoming, to top it off. Just absolutely lovely!!!
