Wow, went here in a group of 4 and had a fantastic meal.  We ordered the El Sabor, which consists of tableside guac, 1 app pp, and 1 entree pp.  The guacamole is the best I've ever had.  I always thought I made a mean guac but mine is nowhere near this. Among our apps we had the Queso Fundido, Chorizo y Papas, Tostadas de Ceviche, and the Huaraches.  All were excellent.  I think my fave was the chorizo y papas. Our entrees were Costillas de Puerco, Pollo, Albondigas, and Salmon.  All were great.   I casually mentioned to the waitress that my Albondigas was very spicy.  I was not complaining, I love it that way.  She thanked us for the heads up, then the manager comped us desserts and shots.  Amazing. Great service, great food, great place.  Our server was Sara and she was very talented.  Her attentiveness and professionalism made the night that much better.
