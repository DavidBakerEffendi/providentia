I had been dying to visit The Little Owl, and my lunch there did not disappoint!  The restaurant was cozy, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations.  I had the lobster risotto as my main course and the chocolate souffle for dessert, and they were both phenomenal!  I truly cannot wait to go back!  It was every bit as delicious as I had imagined.
