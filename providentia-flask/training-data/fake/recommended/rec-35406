Had dinner at Katsu-Hama with my husband on a Friday night. We were seated promptly and decided on the $20 prix fixe -quite a good deal that included miso soup, rice, pickles, your choice of katsu (pork, chicken or fish) and croquette. The freshly toasted sesame seeds in the mortar and pestle provided a nice touch. We were not disappointed - the katsu was nice and light and the servers were very attentive.
