The other day I was in the neighborhood waiting for a friend and I watched a man, who I guessed to be homeless. He was "messing" around with some flattened pieces of cardboard in a vestibule. As I stood there for a moment, I realized that he was Muslim and preparing to pray. I appreciated that he found the time to do so in the chaos of the city and was able to drown out all the noise that surrounded us. But after he finished, he took a short walk to the corner and started working at the 53rd and 6th cart and I didn't see him wash his hands or use any anti-bacterial. Health code violation, much?
