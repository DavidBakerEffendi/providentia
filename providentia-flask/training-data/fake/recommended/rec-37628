This was my first visit to Zizi Limona, though my roommate has been a bunch of times before and always enjoyed the food and had good service. We took her dad, who was visiting from out of town, and her cousin, who lives in New York. To spare you all the boring details, our food took forever and in the end we waited about an hour and half to get our main dishes, which never actually made an appearance at the table. My roommate's dad went to talk to the manger (who is also the owner) and he said something along the lines of, "this is my world! you gotta wait!" and more or less berated my friend's dad for asking when the food was coming out. Ok dude. We talk about it, and decide that it's probably appropriate to leave, and let the owner know and offer to settle the bill. The owner comes out starts yelling at us and insulting everyone in the party - "Leave! I don't want you here! This isn't Manhattan!" It was crazy. I've worked for many a service industry asshole, but never one that would scream at customers. It's a bummer that a cute neighborhood spot with good food has a serious asshole for an owner.
