Eating here is reminiscent of the elegant dining this restaurant must have offered a 100 years ago. The atmosphere is stunningly beautiful, food was delicious and the wait staff friendly, professional and attentive. My only complaint was that they were too attentive. At the time we ate, there were more waiters than tables and they stood lined up just a few yards away from our table, watching and waiting. It felt a little unnerving. All in all, though, a very good meal.
