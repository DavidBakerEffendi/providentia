Just ate here this afternoon and loved it! I've been to the original Peaches and we were worried we would have to wait for a table there so we came here instead. Not too crowded and we were seated immediately. Server was great! Attentive but not hovering. I had the sangria which was strong and sweet followed by the BBQ shrimp w/ crispy grits and finished w/ chocolate brownie and ice cream. All the food was flavorful, good portions, and wait wasn't long. The menu is one of those ones where everything sounds delicious and I'll definitely be back to try the shrimp and grits, watermelon salad, french, toast, etc. I don't eat chicken/beef but I know they're known for their fried chicken. Overall great experience and only a block away from my house so this could be my new favorite spot. They also have a full bar and well made drinks so it might be worth it to stop by in the late evening for small plates and cocktails.
