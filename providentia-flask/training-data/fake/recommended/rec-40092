Maybe I'm just not a fan of pork in my sandwiches, but I had both the roast pork and the pulled pork on multiple occasions here hoping to understand all the hype surrounding this place.  In general, the sandwich is just too dry for my taste.  i have to either soak my bites in hot sauce or put oversized dollops of ketchup on it.  I don't know if this is a fair comparison, but the roast beef sandwiches I had at Portillo's in Chicago were above and beyond the sandwiches at Dinic's.
