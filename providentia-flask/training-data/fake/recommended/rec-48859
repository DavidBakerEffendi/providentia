I just discovered this awesome Thai spot right around the corner. Inside seems very chic and modern, so it's ideal for lunch dates. Prices are decent, especially good for this being in the city. I ordered the red curry chicken which could have had a little thicker curry though still tasted very good. Their Thai iced tea is on the sweeter side compared to others I've had but it's definitely a fix.
