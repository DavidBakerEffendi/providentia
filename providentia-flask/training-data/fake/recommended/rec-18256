Moved to Hillsborough last year and really fell in love with this place. The past two times we have had food from here we have had serious stomach issues with symptoms along the lines of food poisoning. Not sure what's going on in that kitchen, but one instance the quesadilla caused it and this time the seared tuna salad with cilantro lime dressing caused it. Saw another post referencing undercooked meat so there may be a theme here. It's a shame because other than this everything has been fantastic. The staff is great, the place appears to be kept very clean, the tenders are awesome, the pot pies are our favorite when they're available. Obviously this can happen anywhere and to anyone, but multiple times was enough for me to voice concern.
