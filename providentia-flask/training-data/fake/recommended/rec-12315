Happy hour is an awesome deal!! Happy hour is everyday, even weekends. Everything on the menu is $3.50 and $10 for pitchers of Sapporo. I recommend the shrimp shumai and the crispy spring rolls. If you check in on Yelp you get a free bowl of edamame! The space is really cute too. It's small, but has exposed brick walls and ceiling and neat light fixtures.
