The sad irony about Little Italy is that it's hard to find any standout Italian food, paisan. Walking down Mulberry Street, you see all those slick-haired goombahs in white aprons shouting, "Hey pretty lady...I'll show you-a my meatballs-a!" After giving a good glare, I usually thank them and give them my phone number. Pellegrino's stands out simply because there was no one squawking at the passing tourists. It's downright subtle next to the likes of Puglia or Umberto's House of Clams. And the food is actually pretty good, not amazing but a cut above the regular touristo trattoria trappos. I first went with the $7.50 Tricolore Insalata, made up of arugula, radicchio and endive and mixed with a house balsamic vinaigrette. Nothing ambitious but good enough. This was followed by a $9.95 plate of Spaghetti Bolgonese. Good pasta, not great and a tad gritty in texture but certainly filling. Good waiter, not great and a tad gritty in texture but certainly...serviceable. No checkerboard tablecloths, no wine bottles with candle wax dripping over the lip. Pretty generic decor actually, and the tourists still come in droves. Oh well, maybe I'll just go to Chinatown next time I'm in the 'hood. FOOD - 3 stars...good Italian for peasant stock like me who don't like to be yelled at on the sidewalk AMBIANCE - 3 stars...clean and non-descript SERVICE - 3.5 stars...got sad when I couldn't finish my spaghetti (I had a big breakfast) TOTAL - 3 stars...when in Little Italy, you could do worse...much, much worse
