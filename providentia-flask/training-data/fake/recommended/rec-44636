This place is amazing. I went here on a Sunday afternoon to "watch the football" with my sister. We had a charcuterie board that was completely out if this world and beautiful, in addition to the truffle chips. I'm a sucker for anything truffled, and these were absolutely no exception. The drinks were great (I had a jalepeno something that I would go back for in an instant), but my one comment would be that the service was very slow.
