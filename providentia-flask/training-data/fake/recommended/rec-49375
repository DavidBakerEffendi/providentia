I went there, because I was in the city walking about, fell upon that place by accident. Walked in surprisingly it was empty, the guy was really nice and welcoming. The only thing you should know about that place is that it's all vegan... I didn't know that, but that did not stop me. I tried the spicy mang and it was delicious. Highly recommended.
