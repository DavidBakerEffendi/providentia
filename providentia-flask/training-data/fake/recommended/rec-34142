Heard about this place and was really disappointed in its food quality. It's similar to Oh Taisho in St. Marks and I thought the food would be comparable but the skewers were really overcooked and tasteless. The only thing I liked here was the fried chicken which was like a twist on chinese sweet and sour chicken - of course 10x better.
