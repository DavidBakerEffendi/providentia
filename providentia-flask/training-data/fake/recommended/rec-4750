This place is expensive for the food and service it has. Although the menu looks very creative the final product itself is not something you will remember for a long time. The seafood appetizers were flavorful but inconsistent in the way they were cooked. Some of the poly legged creatures were cooked to perfection others were over cooked. We had the liver pasta as main course and it was delicious. Don't remember the other two dishes we got. The service on the other hand was very cold. And this was on a day when it wasn't too crowded nor it was too late. The waitress rambled of the specials in a monotone. The rest of the dinner service was similar. At the end of the day, IMHO that dinner for 3 was not worth what it cost $$$$.
