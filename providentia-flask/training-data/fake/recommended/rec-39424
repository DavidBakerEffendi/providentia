I love me some empanadas! This is such a great find in Corona! I run down 108th frequently and I can't believe I've missed this place earlier. One of my friends told me of this great and affordable empanada place along my run. It's a cute little place Â and it's easy to miss if you're not looking closely. There's only room for maybe 5-6 people sitting inside. I love that the menu has a variety of choices ranging from fillings to the flour type used. They have lots of vegetarian choices too! It takes about 10 minutes to wait for the empanadas, but it's well worth the wait. The empanadas are small and I recommend 2-3 if you want to feel full. Try the hot sauce too, it adds great flavor. Afterwards grab some ices from Lemon Ice King down the road!
