Ate here on a busy Saturday night, had several tables available but was asked to politely finish dinner in 1.5 hours. Challenge accepted. We started off with beers, I had never tried Pacifico and as the chef suggested it on the menu I gave it a whirl, excellent choice. We then had the guac sampler, and it was killer. All three guacs and the sauce were spiced to perfection. Its that feeling of heat without the "OMG IM GOING TO DIE WHERE IS THE WATER" heat. My girlfriend had the fish tacos and spiced kale. Let me be frank and say I dont enjoy kale, but this stuff was great. I had the chicken toloache and again, spiced to perfection. We all enjoyed our meal and moved onto the churros. They were presented nicely and both sauces were on par with the excellence of the meal. After a brief discussion with the manager about the food and atmosphere, we were politely given a nice tequila shot. Overall, I would consider walking here in the cold again, the food was excellent as was the service.
