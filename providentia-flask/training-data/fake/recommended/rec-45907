Stumbled upon a true gem while traveling to Stowe. This little local bakery has friendly service,small town charm and wonderful coffee. I also ordered a breakfast sandwich which was made fresh and delicious! The homemade Mango chutney was such a wonderfully unique tasty addition! Will definitely stop again if passing though the area!
