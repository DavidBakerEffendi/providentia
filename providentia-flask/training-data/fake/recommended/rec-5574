I recently went on a date here and it was incredible! Super small, cozy and romantic, all very French. Our waiter was super nice and friendly, and didn't even judge us for bringing cheap wine to a nice restaurant (its BYO, which is great, and really trims down the final check). They even pour your wine into this cool decanter. Also, the chef kept walking around and saying hi to people, and various tables were speaking French, so I really got an authentic feel from this place. Ok, so the food. The food was perfect. We ordered the escargot (which I'm not usually the biggest fan of, but it was buttery and delicious) and the truffle risotto (creamy and decadent, and the truffle wasn't at all overbearing) as appetizers, and I recommend both. Also, if you're not super hungry at the end of your meal, just order some coffee and they provide complementary macaroons and meringues, which honestly, were better than the actual dessert we ordered.
