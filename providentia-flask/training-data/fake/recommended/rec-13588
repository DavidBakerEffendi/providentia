Meatballs: 3 stars Ice Cream Sandwiches: 5 stars Average: 4 stars For my first visit, I wanted to go simple.  I got meatballs with tomato sauce over rigattoni.  The meatballs were fine.  The pasta was super al dente and I actually love it that way, so I think I liked the pasta more than the balls.  But the ice cream sandwich.  Oh holy hell, that should have been illegal!  First off, it's huge.  I got chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream.  The cookies are thin and hold the ice cream well.  The vanilla ice cream was pretty outstanding, if I do say so myself.  My shirt might have had more of it than my mouth did, but it was totally worth it.  So, mostly, I think I'd go back just for dessert.
