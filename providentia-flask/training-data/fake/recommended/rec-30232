I've been here twice with one great experience and the second tarnished by a waiter who rushed us out. Everything was wonderful the first time - delicious food, great lively atmosphere, and fine service.  On our second visit, for a special occasion, we were done eating our entrees 45 minutes after getting there.  The waiter then asked us if there was anything else he could get us rather than offering dessert and coffee or asking if we wanted it (we did). It was fairly early and there were plenty of empty tables, so I have no idea what the rush was other than that we look young so he thought we wouldn't spend a lot? I really have no idea, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.
