Welcome to the nabe David!! Top notch. The fit out is terrific, reclaimed wood and what not dominating, and a great looking bar. A delicious cocktail list, bourbon leaning but as balanced as it gets. Eager and friendly staff tending the floor and incredible pizza. The watermelon salad was perfect, cool, crisp melon and cucumber with a nice salty spike from the ricotta salata. Pies we ordered were the Fort Greene with sweet figs and salty gorgonzola, perfectly balanced. The Sunset Park was also killer, as were the cocktails. Great drinks, very nicely balanced cocktails. We had classics, Manhattan's and an Old Fashioned. Proper Old Fashioned, no muddled fruit or soda anywhere. Not sweet at all and garnished with an orange zest. Perfect. As for anyone that feels the need to comment on toddlers/kids, I'll say this. I have a toddler he's 18 months old. I work in a well known Manhattan restaurant. He, and most toddlers, behave better and make far less noise than a lot of patrons I've seen in the city. As for not knowing where said toddlers come from, welcome to the neighborhood Paul. You're clearly not from around here. To everyone else, enjoy. Come along anytime, you won't be sorry. The noise level, even with a few kids is no more than what you'd get in the city on any given evening. If you can deal with that, you'll love it!! If you can't, get your crochet rug out and warm up a cup of cocoa and stay in.
