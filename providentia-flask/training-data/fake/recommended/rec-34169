Loved this place. Nick, the owner, is very welcoming and full of useful information about the area for traveling ignoramuses such as myself. I knocked off one star for our server - he seemed like he had much better things to do than provide menu recommendations, or anything else for that matter. I highly recommend the trio of tartare. Will definitely return on my next trip!
