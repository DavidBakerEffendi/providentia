Wow, there are a few hard reviewers out there. For me, Umami did live up to its hype. My friend and I went to finally try Umami on a Wednesday afternoon around 1PM. I was afraid we'd have to wait on a long line, but luckily, we were seated right as we walked in. There were a few other guests waiting though; they were probably waiting on their friends or were a party larger than our 2. Our server was very nice, although I didn't catch her name. My friend and I both ordered the Original Burger, and we also ordered the Sweet Potato Fries, Onion Rings, and Fried Pickles - yes, we're fatties; I'm aware. The Original Burger was simply BANGIN'. Maybe it's because my standards for an amazing burger are low, or maybe Umami's just seriously good. The bun was toasted, yet soft and tasty, the meat, cooked medium rare, was pretty soft and it felt like it melted in my mouth. Of the 3 appetizers, my favorite was the Fried Pickles. Kinda looked like chicken fingers in the dish, but it was good, especially accompanied with the sauce it came with. The Onion Rings were ginormous, but they weren't that tasty. And those Sweet Potato Fries... I generally love sweet potato fries, but Umami just makes it a little waaaaay too sweet. I could do without the extra brown sugar that you put all over them. For dessert, we only had a scoop of ice cream each; I had the Green Tea, and my friend had the Sea Salt Caramel. Green Tea was on point for me, but the Sea Salt Caramel was a little strong in the sense that it was too sweet and too salty both at the same time. Definitely going to come back in the future. I'm hoping to try another burger, as well as the Smushed Potato appetizer, and some other desserts! :) Even after all the positives I've mentioned, Umami hasn't really earned a 5th star from me, mainly because of the greasiness, and some of the disappointing flavoring in certain items. I hope to see that changed in the future though!
