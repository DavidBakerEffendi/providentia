Nice place. Good date spot. 2.5 stars. The food was decent but nothing special. The bacon brittle was ok at best and not really worth all of the praise that I've read. I had the fried chicken. The chicken itself was amazing. Moist, crispy and delicious. The sides that it arrived with were meh. For home cooking it would have been nice to have something like mash potatoes. Instead cole slaw and greens. Â Boo. The service was also a bit slow. It took too long for our meals to arrive. Unfortunately I was disappointed here. I wanted to like the place, but the food wasn't so phenomenal that I have to go back. For the money, I'd go elsewhere.
