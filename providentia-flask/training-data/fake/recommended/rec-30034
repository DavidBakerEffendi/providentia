Disappointed.  Had high hopes for this restaurant since I love the farm to table concept and am a big fan of the sister restaurant Mediterra.  Everything in my meal ( and wife's) was underwhelming. The watercress salad was underdressed and had many too much stem. The fish was tasty but was swimming in a vinegary broth. The 'cobbler' had what seemed like a bisquick topping. My wife's carrot cake was just not good. Service was good and the decor is lovely but at this price point there are better options in Princeton.
