Decent place to drink, awful place to eat.  Food is cheap and you get what you pay for.  If you ever had German food before you'll wonder how they get off calling this a German Restaurant.  I live locally but felt I'd wandered into a tourist trap, where they don't expect anyone to visit a second time.  There are many better options in the area.
