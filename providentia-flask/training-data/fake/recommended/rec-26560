Monday night chill crowd. As an out of town-er I felt genuinely accepted and welcome in this small funky-dive bar. Flow of local crowd in and out over a few hours was definitely partying with drinks, shots and good edgy music. However, maintained a cool atmosphere of friends pleased to bump into each other but sticking to their own thing. Not an obnoxious ass to be found all night. Rose the bartender was on it, made sure you had what you needed, never let you run dry without imposing, lovely girl with a sultry voice. I'll be back next time I'm in town.
