Came on a weekday about 3:00, it wasn't busy, so I was happy about that. The waiter got the orders mixed up, I ordered mashed potatoes and my brother ordered french fries. At first she expected us to scrape the sides off into each other's plates, we looked at her like she was crazy, and then she said she would get new mashed potatoes, Â lol! I enjoyed the portion size. The waiter wasn't too attentive, and that annoyed me because it wasn't crowded. If you want good BBQ, this is the place.
