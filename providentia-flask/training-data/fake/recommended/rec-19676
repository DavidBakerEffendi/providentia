I normally go downtown to Spice or Sea but one day I came across this gem as I was on the bus. THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!! I always order the Lunch special and have never been disappointed. Food is flavorful. You can not beat $7.57 for an app, salad, and entree!!!! I recommend this place to all of my friends and have not been to Spice since.
