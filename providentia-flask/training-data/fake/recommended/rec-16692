The food here is amazing. Â There were 4 of us, and we had the vegetable tasting menu. The progression and the portions of the food were great and provided a very good variety. By the time we finished, we felt full, but not grossly so. I would recommend the vegetable tasting menu, just so you can get to the barley risotto. There was unanimous silence on the table when we took the first bite. SO good. The service is very commendable. Everyone treats you like royalty. Lots of small bowing, showing, gratitude, and impeccably rehearsed performing of the 'specials of the night' monologue. It was impressive. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 of us found our absolute favorite wines on the wine list by the glass(how often does that happen?) And do not miss out on the cocktails. They're great if you don't like your drinks too strong (my pet peeve with cocktails in some other places) Ok. Thats all. Its good. Go.
