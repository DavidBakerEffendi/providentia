This is my new favorite restaurant in Bayonne. The food is healthy and delicious. It is a one man operation and he can be a bit busy on weekends, but it is worth the wait. You can also call ahead and pick up your order. I tried many dishes here and they were all outstanding. My favorites so far are the crab cakes and eggplant rolletine. I am not a vegan but I tried some of his vegan dishes and they are unbelievably good. A lot of places like this with a healthy menu have the caveat that the food is good "for a healthy meal". That is not the case here - it is good no matter what you are looking for. Whether you care about eating healthy or not, go here for a great meal. The healthiness is a bonus.
