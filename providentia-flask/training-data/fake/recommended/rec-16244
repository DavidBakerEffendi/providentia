Nice atmosphere and good solid food options. It's easy to walk by the restaurant, but that just adds to the low-key vibe with lots of dark wood and low lighting. Service was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I loved all the fancy cocktails.  Try the Reposado with homemade ginger beer.  I enjoyed the crab croquettes and the beet salad was beautifully presented.  For my entree, the whole fish was huge.  I'm a big eater and I had trouble finishing it along with the fingerling potatoes and asparagus.   But, the highlight of the meal is dessert. You must get the warm lemon cake.  Normally, I shy away from most cakes because I think they are usually boring.  However, this warm lemon cake was delicious.  And you must get an after dinner drink.  The milk punch with brandy was delicious and a dessert in itself.
