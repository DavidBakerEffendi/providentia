I found this gem about half a year ago and the review is being written now because I MISS IT! The noodles are some of the best I have ever had and I've sampled a lot of Chinese places. Actually, my family is from the Nanzhou province and they claim this is as close as it gets (other than hopping on a plane back to NW.China) The price is very affordable and the side dishes are mouth-watering. Feeling adventurous? Try the intestines-good compliment to the noodles. They seat you fast and be prepared to share tables. Place is always pack so get ready to wait about 15 minutes. Next time I'm in Philly, I'm making a stop there.
