This was another great find for me in Park Slope, a neighborhood brimming with great restaurants!  I came here on Christmas Eve as it was one of the few restaurants that were open in the area that was not Asian food - so it was nice and quiet, which helped as I had amazingly attentive service.  But really, it was the food that got me.  Everything we ordered was simply delicious - and I loved how the menu seemed quite unique and creative, different from your usual American fare - with a nice New Zealand touch to it.  I definitely want to come back to try brunch, as that seems to have some rave reviews.
