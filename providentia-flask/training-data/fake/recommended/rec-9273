This place is great! Super cute atmosphere....very much a true Italian feel. The service was nothing over the top, but worked! I tried the calamari app which was awesome, I had the special salad which was fantastic, and the pasta with Ragu sauce for dinner! I was pretty much in heaven. They have some decently priced wines. Overall the whole experience was awesome! I will definitely go back!
