Great pizza is not hard to find in this area. Fortissimo serves up excellent pizza and has very fast delivery. It is a tie for first for the best pizza in West Orange between Fortissimo and Franks. Their appetizers are great but way overpriced. The entrees are typical, quality italian fare that you would expect from a NJ pizza shop. I would give 4 stars if the pizza was hands down the best in town and 5 stars if their prices were a little better. Overall you get GREAT pizza, average everything else but pay a few dollars more than most other local joints.
