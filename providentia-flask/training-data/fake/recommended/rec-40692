I spent an hour and a half there early one Saturday evening and it was way fun. Why? The bartenders were so friendly (but in a deliciously subversive way) and were all too happy to jump right in and give opinions on my date and my conversation about online dating. They didn't charge me for my last beer (which dateguy said happens to him a lot there). Great beer selection and the bartenders were pretty helpful about making recommendations. Plus, the MASSIVE half order (yes, half!) of chicken nachos was so, so good that it distracted me from the conversation several times. And we were talking about underpants, people! Underpants! (And right now, I'm patting myself on the back for working "underpants" into a restaurant review. Twice. Go me!)
