I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's small and if you walk in, you're waiting for at least an hour.  So my friend and I hopped over to a bar nearby, the host promised to call my cell when the table opened up.  Well guess what - she never called!   Though slightly upset, we did go back, remind her we've been waiting for over an hour.  She said she called us which was a flat out lie but we decided to sit down for a meal anyway. Soon after food started arriving, we forgot all about how she forgot to call us and lied about it - simply bc the food was amazing!  We got the pork chop and cod - both were excellent, we practically licked the plates!  Don't really remember the starters, I think they were uneventful but not horrible. In the end, we felt bit pressured to leave bc people were piling in and just standing around our table which was right by the door - the host did not pressure us to leave but we felt bad.  If it wasn't busy, we would've stayed longer.
