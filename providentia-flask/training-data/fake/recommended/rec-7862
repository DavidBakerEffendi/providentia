This nicely attired place offers a fairly priced selection of food and drink. The choice between draft and bottled beer is extensive enough to satisfy most beer lovers. The various plates, while being attractively named, were somewhat flat in presentation and taste. Service was somewhat lacking when It came to refilling water glasses and following up on drinking and menu selections.
