I was looking for a new spot near UCB and I love tapas so I made a reservation using Yelp and headed here with Lisa M. after taking a little stroll in Central Park. We enjoyed polite, quick service, good drinks (sangria for her and wine for me) and some tasty tapas. The croquette of the day was cheese and was amazing. I'll be honest: the color of the filling kinda freaked me out. Didn't stop me from wanting to lick the plate. We also had a toasted baguette smeared with tomato that came with a trio of spreads and was delicious. Definitely coming back. Definitely reviewing again. My guess is that the next experience will include dessert and prove that this is definitely a five star spot in Chelsea. Of note: the date that was going on at the table next to us was one of the most entertaining things we got to see for free that weekend.
