I love this place. I've Only been there for dinner never brunch but it never disappoints.better to make reservations if it's more than 2 of y'all. They allow walk-ins but will always offer the kitchen bar 1st...which is cool if u wanna watch them make your dish but it can get hot near the flames. My go-to is the khao Soi or Sizzling Sisig with coconut rice.The rice is really good and goes with everything. The portions are generous on both dishes.The mango salad is really good as well...tried the mussels they were nothing special. The drinks are meh! so go there to eat not get drunk. although Â $15 bottomless cups of beer can be a good night starter if your looking to do damage. The vibe is upbeat and it feels young and hip.The playlist is always decent with something for everybody.A little heavy on the hip hop side but they do a good job of mixing it up. Will be back soon.
