My friend and I stumbled upon this place Saturday night - this place definitely stood out amongst the bodega's inhabiting the area. Walking in we were greeted by a very friendly waiter who sat us immediately. The decor of this place is very clean and warm looking. The dim lights make it an excellent date spot. The nice waiter came by again to explain the menu to us - small plates, family style. I rather enjoy family style so I was already excited. The waiter then places a bag of popcorn for us to munch on while we waited for food. The popcorn was salty and I could taste the fat indeed and I LOVED EVERY BITE. Finally after about 6 minutes our food arrived. 1.Crack and Cheese - basically fried gnocchi topped with a creamy and rich cheese sauce and finished with bacon bits - I really enjoyed this dish it was super filling. 2. Oxtail terrain - I wasn't sure about this dish at first - But, once I cut into the oxtail and watched is fall apart so easily I was in heaven, it melted in my mouth. On top of that the mushrooms provided an excellent balance. 3. Fried Chicken - usually I love fried chicken, but I didn't enjoy this one. I don't know if it was too salty or if I was already too full. Overall, I really enjoyed this place. I definitely will be going back again. The only thing bad about this place is that they don't have a liquor license yet.
