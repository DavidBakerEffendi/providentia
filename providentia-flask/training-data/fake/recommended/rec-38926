A nice diner with oldies playing on the Muzak. Had a Double Cheeseburger, with Ketchup, Mayo (which she handed me a packet to add myself) , Onions and Pickles, and a Cup of Fires with Large Cheese Sauce. Now let me say, I was expecting a small portion, like many places skimp you, but this was a LARGE cheese sauce! They used to be Cash Only (ATM at the Front Door) but they now accept Visa and MasterCard. There is also Al's Ice Cream, a window you can walk up to around the side on the outside.
