Breakfast are good. I had an egg and bacon on a brioche and it was decent not exceptional but good. I tried a lavender macaroon which can be a risky flavor but it tasted great, too bad however that it didn't seem super fresh. I am French and I went to this place because of it's name, mirabelle which is a French fruit and one of my favorite. I was very disappointed to learn that they aren't using the fruit in any of their pastry. I would have given the place 4 star but will have to stick to 3 for that reason.
