Get your cash ready and know how to order before you get to the counter, oh, and make sure you speak English or they won't take your order.  In this city of 'brotherly love' I was extremely disappointed with the sign that clearly states you have to speak English- Geno's is patriotic, I will give them that, but simply rude.  Their sandwiches were only average. Do not go out of your way to go to South Philly and if you do go across the street to Pat's, it's a better sandwich for the same price.
