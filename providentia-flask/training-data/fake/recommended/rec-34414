Pizza is good, but small and pricey for what you get. The serving plates are tiny, and the pizzas are cut into 4 pieces. This is to make them look big, because if they were cut into 8, they would look ridiculously small. Â You get a lot more for your money just up the road at American Flatbread, which also has brick oven pizzas. Four of us ate 3 of their appetizers (3 for $10) and 2 pizza's and still left hungry. Service was excellent, however.
