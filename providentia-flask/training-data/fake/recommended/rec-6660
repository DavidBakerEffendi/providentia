I've been here twice randomly. 1st, the day after new years2007 with a crew of friends and a stranger(I was the stranger, but the rest were ladies ;) )...and recently when I was in nyc trying to find a parking spot mid day, and bahm, it was right next to Penelopes. Both times, I was incredibly satisfied with the home grown fresh warming food in this semi diner like space with a charasmatic staff and yummy brunch like menus. The people that come here seem to be the same...very chill, happy, love their warm hot coffee in a big mug, and great food with company. Come here with a small crew(2-6), bring a book, newspaper if by yourself. Enjoy their homemade food, and chalkboard full of specials. i'd come back for brunch any day! Come here wiht a few friends to catch up early in the morning or during the day. Grab a cup of joe and chat away.
