I walk by this place daily so I was excited to finally try it. meh. what a disappointment. The food is below average Lebanese - it does not have the flavor or complexity I expect in this cuisine. The hummus had way too much tahini and thus was bitter. The pita seemed like it came straight from a grocery store. The lahmahjun spices were off. I did enjoy my lamb chops and my husband enjoyed his fish but they were not standout dishes and were not worth the $7 suppliment to the prix fixe menu. Maybe this lackluster experience was due to it being restaurant week? or perhaps the fact that we had just had AMAZING Lebanese food in Detroit that blew this overpriced tasteless meal out of the water? I guess I'll never know since we won't be coming back to ilili.
