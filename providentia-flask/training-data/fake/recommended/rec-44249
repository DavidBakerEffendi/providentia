I love, love, love this place. I have never had a bad experience here. The food is great - my favorite is the 'skirt steak'. Its served with a salad, rice and your choice of red or black beans.Of course the empanadas Â are really good...especially the shredded beef and the shredded chicken. Its a good place on a date or with maybe a couple friends to do like a weekly gossip session with a pitcher of sangria. Did I mention the sangria? Order a pitcher of red sangria! Its a small place and its not equipped for a large group at all..but who cares? The only thing that annoys me about this place is that they bring everything at once. Appetizers and main course. I have no idea why ...its just an annoying thing that they do....but you'll get over it because the food is that good. Check it out!
