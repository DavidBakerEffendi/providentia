A great little wine bar without any pretence. To me it is not hip or sophisticated, but that does not take anything away from this establishment. What impressed me the most about this place is its bartenders. The bartender I spoke to was nice and spot-on with wine suggestions. I arrived there around 8:30 on Friday night and did not have any problem finding a seat at the bar right away. There were two, three tables open as well, but I heard a bartender tell someone those were reserved. It started to get busier after 9 pm, so reservation may be recommended if you want to be seated at the table. The food menu is short, and even though one would expect that at a wine bar, I wouldn't mind seeing a couple more selections. I ordered meatballs, and they were simple and tasty. I also had chocolate lava cake; although I love my chocolates, it was very rich, and sharing it with another person would have been just right for me.
