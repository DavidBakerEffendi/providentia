Came here with my bf when we first started dating. We were all over each other and really gross - probably ruining many of your dining experiences. I apologize. We were already drunk and went here on a whim. Good decision. Burger hit the spot. I know everything tastes better when you're sloshed but despite my inebriation, I was Â able to see that this was indeed an excellent burger. Open til 4am - awesome late night spot. I no longer eat meat so I can't give the burger another go. If they add a veggie burger to the menu, I'd be all over that though [hint hint CB]
