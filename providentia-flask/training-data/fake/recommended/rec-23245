I love Tashan! Brought my biyfriend here on his birthday and we both had a great experience. The food has so much delicious flavor and yes, the portions are small, but this is an upscale restaurant. I wasn't surprised when I saw the portions. I will definitely be back and I hear they have an awesome happy hour.
