It's simple when you think about it. Â Target your audience, pick the right location, serve food that stays fairly authentic to the ethnicity, price it right. For a restaurant in the heart of university city, that's exactly what Hummus does. No flashy frills, a decor that's super casual and almost 'take out', generous quantities for a menu that stays under $10 for the most part. We were a group of 8 - with vegeterians, white meaters, and omnivores. The food arrived super quick and the staff was super friendly. The portions were large (more meat than lettuce!) and sure enough, quickly decimated. If you remember the raptor feeding scene from Jurassic Park, you know what I'm talking about. I don't see myself driving back to university city just to get to Hummus. But if I'm in the area, I would easily be a regular.
