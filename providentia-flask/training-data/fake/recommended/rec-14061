The Upper West Side has a lot of perfectly satisfactory restaurants, but hardly any I would go out of my way to visit. Kefi is one rare exception. The sheep's milk dumplings are - and I'm pretty sure I've never used this expression before - to die for. The dumplings themselves are tender and creamy and literally melt in your mouth, while the sauce is rich, spicy, and flavorful.  If you like sausage and feta cheese (and who doesn't?) you'll be in heaven. The crispy cod appetizer is also incredible: soft potatoes topped with a tastier cousin of the fish stick. Try the chocolate mousse with sesame ice cream for dessert.  And eat slowly, because your dishes will be whisked away the second you finish. One cautionary note: you might not think it to walk past, but this place gets booked well in advance. I had trouble getting in on a Thursday night. OpenTable it or call for reservations.
