This place has an amazing brunch. My fav item here is the chocolate chip brioche with sea salt butter. Sometimes I get a craving for this delectable, scrumptious (and might I add, slightly sinful) toast and I have to have it. Â  Last time I went, even though that was the "only thing" I stopped by for, of course I ended up getting the cheese grits, eggs and sausage with escarole. Mmmm. Would like to try lunch/dinner there, too.
