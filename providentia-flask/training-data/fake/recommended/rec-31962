I was at duffy about 9 days ago it was crowded night and service was backed up but then I found out why there was a medical emergency  a man had orderd food and had passed out the only two bus boys and waitress there had tended to the sick man. They did a fantastic job...food orders were back on track and everything was excellent. Food great beer great atmosphere awesome I go there quite often.  I am alittle disturbed about a women I heard   complain that she didnt get her food fast enough and then to give a bad review...there was a medical emergency in restaurant and to have the staff tend to this man and make sure he was ok then still get food served and also to apologize to this woman on top of that..and to say they werent deserving of a tip....lets hope this one review by this one rotten apple of a person dosnt keep people from enjoying such a great place
