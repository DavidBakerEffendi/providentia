Must get "Chicken and Rice" with extra white sauce. The lines will be long, but it will be worth it.  There will be two Halal Guys carts on the corner.  Look for the yellow bag and the cart with the flagship sign.  The line will be longer, but your chicken and rice will be from the original cart.   $7 dollars will get you a delicious hot plate of delicious chicken, rice, pita bread and white sauce for the mixing.   This place is a MUST EAT while visiting New York City!
