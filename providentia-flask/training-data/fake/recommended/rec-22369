There were so many incredible parts of hosting our wedding reception at ROIA, it's hard to know where to start. We chose ROIA because we couldn't find a caterer that we thought could create a farm-to-table dining experience for our nearly 200 guests that was EXTRAORDINARY... and VEGAN:) After all, in our experience, the bigger the party, the lesser quality the food. Our community is a foodie community - they care about the quality of food, wine, beer. Avi and Meera were able to exceed all our expectations in every food and drink category, from homemade sorbets to crunchy and juicy bruchetta, full bodied wines and local beers. We couldn't have been happier with the food and drink. The venue itself is stunning - high ceilings, classy tables, a perfect combination of romantic and exciting. We were able to have the dance party upstairs for our wild friends, and the conversations downstairs for our older friends and family. Folks danced for a while upstairs, then took a break downstairs and then went up again to boogie some more. The venue was a perfect mix of relaxing and partying. The servers and staff treated all our guests like royalty. And Avi and Meera treated my then fiancee and me like the most important and special guests they had ever had. Everything we dreamed of, Avi and Meera helped us achieve, and within our budget. We had numerous tastings and meetings the year before the wedding so that when the day arrived, we were clear about our vision and able to realize it fully at ROIA. I cannot recommend ROIA highly enough for a classy and remarkable experience all around. The best part is that our family and friends go back and eat at ROIA all the time now - and every time we are reminded of the exhilarating evening and are grateful to have had it there.
