I am in LOVE with Room Service!  I've been several times and have never been disappointed with the food or the service.  Their lychee sangria is simply to die for, and I'm a big fan of the Steamed Shrimp in a Clay Pot and the Andaman Basil.  Beautifully prepared, and absolutely delicious.  I love that they have dishes that they won't make less spicy (presumably to suit American tastes) because it ruins the integrity of the dish. The decor of this place is a little ostentatious but if you sit near the front, it's less...sparkly.
