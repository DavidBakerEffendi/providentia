Have heard about this place a few times and was finally able to try it out the other night.   Walked in and pretty much fell in love with the place.  Nice cozy atmosphere and ambiance.  Tables are close together but you don't really notice it. Started off with the cavatelli and I enjoyed it.  My date and I both must have missed the mushrooms on the ingredient list, but even though neither of us care for them, I didn't mind the flavor in this dish.  Just pushed those suckers off to the side.  Plus they were nice enough to split the cavatelli into two plates, brownie points for them.   Decided on the crispy pork chop as my main meal...nicely cooked, not too dry or tough.  The slaw and spaghetti squash went well with it.  Did remind me of a basic schnitzel but I enjoyed it.  Also had a taste of the chicken and that might have been the winner of the two dishes.  Juicy and tasty and all that good stuff.   Service was attentive without being overbearing.  Waitress was patient enough with us when it took us eons to actually look at the menu and decide what we wanted.  :) Definitely need to come back for the desserts, they had me at the avocado gelato!
