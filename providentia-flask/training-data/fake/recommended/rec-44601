I've brought a group of 15 here once and another group of five.  The place no matter how busy accomodated us, moved tables around.  Service was great, food was very good.  I had sariwang lumpia.  If you are on a diet, don't go here because you'll be tempted to quit it, like I was.  The owner is very friendly.  We were on a scavenger hunt and he helped us out.  It's almost as good as my mom's kitchen.
