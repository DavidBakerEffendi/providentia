HELL YES! Buttermilk Channel is the move. Me and my Mother went here while in New York for the "Legends of The Summer" JAY Z and Justin Timberlake concert. This place was definitely one of the biggest highlights of our trip. We took the train and got off at the Carroll St stop. We walked for almost a mile until we reached this unique brunch spot. Once inside we were immediately greeted by the host and the constant conversations taking place at every table. All tables were packed and there was a wait to sit, so we sat at the bar where there was space available. We sat in our barstools, and placed our orders. The woman behind the bar had on cool retro frames and exuded a warm inviting spirit. It only took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive, despite the packed house. My mother...a fried pork chop, cheddar waffles, and mimosa. Me- pancakes, hash browns, and egg scramble with mushrooms and spinach. The food was fantastic! Everything was hot and fresh from the kitchen. My pancakes were fluffy and savory, the hash round was browned to a perfect crisp, and the scramble was seasoned well and was NOT greasy. I tasted Mom's cheddar waffle as well and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. I didn't try the pork chop, because I don't eat pork, but Lord knows I wanted to. For all of the comfort food connoisseurs reading this, Buttermilk Channel will give you the "itis." Fantastic food, fantastic flavor, fantastic service. Can't wait to go back to BK for BC!
