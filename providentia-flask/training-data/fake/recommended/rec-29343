I'm a Philly Native.  As usual I ordered a plain cheesesteak with sliced american.  No ketchup.  Dont ever put ketchup on a cheesesteak ever! This place smells great.  Tucked in the basement of a row home packed with customers and an excellent, attentive service staff. Dalessandros was rated "Best Cheesesteak" Zagats 2012.  I had to try.  They chop the steak very fine and pack the roll heavily.   I almost couldnt finish.  I like my steak cooked in its own juices and the finely chopped steak doesnt retain the juices though this steak had a great meat taste.   The steak needs a litte more salt for my liking. I noticed most of the patrons order condiments like peppers, onions and sauce which I would definitely recommend when ordering.  I am gonna go back and try some of the add-ons.
