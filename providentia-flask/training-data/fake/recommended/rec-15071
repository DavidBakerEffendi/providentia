3.5 Stars **THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFICALLY IN REFERENCE TO MY PHILLY CHEESESTEAK TASTING ADVENTURE - Please refer to my review of Cosmi's Deli for background & stipulations of the quest** Tallying middle-of-the-road scores in most categories, Max's cheesesteak stood out for its intoxicating aroma and first-rate, succulent meat.

Finishing smack in the middle, Max's 7.1 overall score is bolstered by the noticeable quality of his meat. (Full result details can be found at: 22ndandphilly.blogspot.câ€¦)
