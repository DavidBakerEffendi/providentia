Sat at the bar since I was alone, 830pm on Sunday evening. Not busy. Heard great things, sadly I didnt experience any of them. Waited 8 mins 3 bartenders no one else at bar, finally one asks have you been helped? Â Got drink, nasty iced tea, sat another 5 mins, am asked you want some bread? Duh? Finally one came over and asked if I wanted to order. Chicken Marsala, finally came after awhile, longer then it should of since everyone 3 tables were all eating when I walked in, mine was the only order. Chicken was cooked pressed flat and dry, sitting in a large plate of sauce? with way to short pasta and mushrooms. Chicken took some cutting. You could not spin the short pasta on the fork and it took 3 uses of the fork to even get enough for a decent bite. Was there an hour. Didnt have the marsala taste, just tasted like water poured into skillet after chicked was cooked, probably had half a cup of watery ? when I finished eating. Maybe it was the perfect storm, since others said it was so great.
