Every time I visit home, this is the place that I want to go: the most delicious, fresh noodles with awesome flavors, and so affordable! I always have the hand drawn noodles with soy/meat sauce and it never disappoints. $8 for what's definitely two meals worth of food (but which I always eat in one anyways)? So worth it.
