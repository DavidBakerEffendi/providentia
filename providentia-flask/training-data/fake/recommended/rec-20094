I only gave 2 Stars , but this was the 2nd visit to WF and I was not very satisfied . When we arrived no one greeted we stared into space and looked around and seated ourselves . The waiter seemed a little spaced out as she came over to the table did not  introduce herself and began to pour the water into the glass  she acted as if we were not there ....... The chicken lollipops are technically (buffalo wings ) not your regular chicken lollipops . The half chicken is ok no flavor just spicy with a tangy after taste .The ginger beer is fantastic !
