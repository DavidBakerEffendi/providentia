I would love to say that this place is wonderful.  I can't say it's terrible because of one bad order, but they should certainly pay attention to what is heading out of the kitchen.  The veggie burger is basically just a rice patty.  There were no actual vegetables in it.  The special was a veggie burger Parmesan which came out as rice on a wheat roll.  My son's veggie burger was delicious, but that didn't help me out much.
