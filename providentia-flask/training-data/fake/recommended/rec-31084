I love this place. I've only been twice, but on both occasions I found the staff very friendly and personable. The restaurant is in a great spot, along the river with easy highway access and plenty of parking. It's quickly becoming one of my preferred places to stop in after work. Most importantly, the Burrata and Saugage and Peppers pizzas are to die for. The only thing I like more than those are eating the leftovers the next day.
