I can only speak for their delivery service, but it was top notch! Sushi and entrees for 4 people ordered around 2pm on a Saturday was prepared and delivered to our place on Tillary Street (normally a 10 minute walk away) in under half an hour! Their menu is friendly to vegans, vegetarians, and people who don't even really like fish or sushi, which is great when eating in a group with varied tastes and diet restrictions. I ordered their Spicy Mixed Vegetables roll, Sweet Potato Roll, and Avocado Roll all made with brown rice, which they were happy to oblige. Three rolls filled a large box because each roll was cut into 10 pieces (instead of the normal 8) and was more than enough food for 2 meals, or one extremely hungry one! I was the only one in our group who did not order an entree, but they still gave us 4 miso soups which were warm, had big chunks of tofu and seaweed, and was not salty like many Japanese restaurants make it.
