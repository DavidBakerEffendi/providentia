I went here around last year on summer time with my girlfriend and I. Overall, my girlfriend and I HATE this place. We would never come back to this place. The interior of the place is beautiful. Bright lights, beautiful design and overall, the place is very upbeat and just have an exceptional design. However, we didn't come to this place to just stare at how beautiful this place is, we went there for the food! Honestly, the food were horrible. My girlfriend and I are Asians, so we know what is a good Asian food should taste like. I understand this is Asian Fusion but we didn't like the food at all We ordered the Chef's tasting. On the menu it said $45 so we thought that our bill was going to be more or less around 45 dollars but we didn't know that it was $45 PER PERSON, therefore our bill was around 110 because we got tricked into ordering Fiji water when we only want regular water. This is what we ordered: Edamame Dumpling- This was horrible, I couldn't explain what it taste like but it was really gooey and we both hate it with a passion. 0/5 stars Korean BBQ beef- This was the one of foods we enjoyed, this taste like every other Korean BBQ beef therefore it taste really good but it is nothing special. 4/5 stars Crispy Rock Shrimp- This was best food that we had that night. This taste similar to calamari but in a shrimp form. Taste really good! 5/5 stars Kim Chee Fried Rice- This was horrible, I don't remember what it taste like but I remember hating it. 0/5 stars Crispy Szchuan Chicken- I do not remember what it taste like. I guess it taste okay because I could not recall what it taste like Beef Short Rib- This was horrible, for some odd reason the beef and lo mein taste so sweet. It not those good type of sweet but a bad one. 0/5 stars Soy Glazed Chilean Sea Bass- This was the WORST dish we had that night. The fish was SUPER SALTY, so salty to the point it was almost inedible. 0/5 stars
