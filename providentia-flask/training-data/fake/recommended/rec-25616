My review is solely based off of the Soba/Udon noodle station. The vegetable soba is delicious and reasonably priced! The man working behind the counter is also always super friendly. I love the selection you can get here, from the noodles to the add-ins to the broth. I like to be able to pick and choose what is in my dish. As someone who is meat and dairy free having the option to choose veggie broth is awesome! Most other places throw in whatever ingredients they have on hand and only have beef broth as an option. They also have different sauce add ins to make it sweet, spicy, etc. Would definitely recommend!
