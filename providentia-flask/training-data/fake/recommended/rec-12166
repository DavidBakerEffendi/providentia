Whatever.  This is another example of Starr's Disneyworld approach to restaurants -- all form and no substance.   The beer selection isn't great, and the food is barely even fake German.  The worst part: no reservations and you seat yourself.  You're meant to hover over tables until someone decides to leave.  Then, you go to the bar to order drinks and to a cart to order food. I found the whole thing incredibly annoying and nowhere near worth the trouble.  Go to Brauhaus Schmitz for better food, better beer, and better atmosphere.
