I came here because I had a $25 restaurant.com gift certificate. Wasn't really expecting anything crazy but HOLY CRAP THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS. Took a little long for the food to come out BUT it is well made and so good, so I'm not complaining about that part. All of the dishes are gigantic so if the entree prices scare you just be aware you are definitely bringing some of this home. The staff was so friendly and so lovely the entire time, they made it beyond pleasant. The decor is a little crazy but it's a Greek place....and I'm eating the food not looking at the walls. This place is sort of hidden away and if you see it - get in there and eat.
