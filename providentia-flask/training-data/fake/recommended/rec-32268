two extremely good things about cantina: 1. vegan friendly (there's veggie options, vegan beef, and you can ask for things without cheese without feeling ashamed..) and the food is good. 2. there's delicious frozen margaritas. if you are a small girl like i am, these can be powerful things...both powerfully delicious and powerfully intoxicating. (i recommend the blood orange.) overall, cantina gets a thumbs-up.
