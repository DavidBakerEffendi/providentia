There are only two good oyster poorboys in New York. Cheeky and also the take-out window at the Oyster Bar in Grand Central. Cheeky's is the closest to New Orleans flavors, and they know that to add the hot sauce as part of the seasoning. I only wish the owner would see the gem he's got and clean up the join a little, maybe add a few tables and make the kitchen look less like a bicycle storage area. But you can't beat the taste.
