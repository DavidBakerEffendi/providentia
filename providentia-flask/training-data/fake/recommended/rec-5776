Continental Midtown has a nice decor, I like the second floor bar and the Sky Bar. The food is decent, I like the cheeseteak egg rolls. The beer selection is cool I was extremely pleased that they served Hoegaarden. I'm not big into martinis, but they make a good astronaut. It's a nice date spot, and a nice place to meet up with friends for dinner. The crowd is good mix. It's a nice place to hang out on a Saturday night, there are usually a good number of attractive girls there as well, which at the end of the day is the most important thing.
