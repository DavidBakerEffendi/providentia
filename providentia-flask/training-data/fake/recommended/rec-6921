If you're looking for a traditional slice of NY pizza, Table 87 should not be your destination. However, that doesn't mean it isn't a great place to stop by. The beau and I split the apple-almond crunch salad and a personal margherita pizza. The salad was a pretty good size (I balked at the $10 cost until I saw it), with delicious grilled apples and ample raisins and almonds. The "personal" pizza was big enough for us to split after the salad. Evenly-cooked thin crust with that delicious char. The right amount of sauce (not too little, not too much to overpower), and the full basil leaves were a nice touch (perhaps they've read some reviews, because I found that the basil was spaced out nicely and wasn't too much of a good thing). One of my favorite parts was the spoon-it-yourself "toppings". Without needing to pay for anything extra, they provide sizable containers of fresh roasted garlic and spicy peppers, for you to pile on as much as you want. Keeping in mind that it's garlic and spicy peppers, of course, so you won't want to grab too much. The peppers were marinating in their own spicy oil which I enjoyed enough to sop up with the crust afterwards. The place was empty but service was nice and friendly. Unlike some places where only one or two tables are filled, I didn't feel like they were hovering, waiting to refill water once you took a sip. The server and host were friendly and just the right amount of attentive. It's a little too pricey for pizza to do on a regular basis (salad and personal pie came to $20), but it was a nice treat on a chilly Sunday. I wish this new business the best!
