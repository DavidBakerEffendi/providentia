UPDATE! After our unfortunate experience, we were contacted by the management and owner of The Runner.. They were very kind and apologetic for the changes and unfortunate experience. They invited us to come back in a weeks time to make it up to us and last night 11/19/2014 was the night. I must say.. Well done! They took all of our criticism to heart and brought everything back to normal. Even hired a new head chef who seems to be taking things to the next level! The food isn't only as good as it was, it is now getting better! I'm not sure how they made the turn around so quickly but wow! Its great to see a small business in the neighborhood that really cares what their customers think about their establishment and more than that, are willing to make it better.. Their wine selection made a 180 as well as the food. We got to try some of their new appetizers (a baked coliflower disk topped with Parmesan cheese and a butternut squash dish topped with oats over a coli-flower pure) both were really good. Knowing how disappointed i was before with their mushroom tart, we had to order that again. That too is back to perfection! Oyster mushrooms, some sweet onions topped with fresh tarragon and a mild goat cheese. We also got the 16 oz dry aged ribeye and the salmon over a coli-flower pure and kale with shiso. The Ribeye was cooked to perfection. It was a little salty but paired perfectly with the wine recommended and had some nice, crispy edges. The Salmon was also very good. A crispy top and perfectly cooked. Not to mention the coli flower pure and kale went really well with it. Anyway, i don't want to say much more. You should experience it for yourself. If you are in the area, stop by The Runner and have a quick bite. You wont be sorry you did. Im happy to see that The Runner is being restored to its original quality of food and service. We will be back soon.
