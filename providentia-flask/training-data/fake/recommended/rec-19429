I have been here twice. Both time I ordered a short stack of pancakes because they are the cheapest full meal they have - the other foods are out of my price range. The pancakes are $5 plus 50 cents per topping. Both times, the pancakes were tasty, and there is a decent density of topping within the pancakes. This time I got the seasonal blueberry topping as well as another topping, and I noticed that the receipt said the blueberries cost $1 instead of the promised 50 cents -probably because it was a seasonal topping. On my way out, a waiter asked me how my visit was, and when I told them about the price being 50 cents more than I expected, he gave me $1 to compensate - so they are good on customer service. The music is certainly quiet enough to talk to people over, but a little loud if you want to sit and think to yourself.
