I'll take Corner Bistro over Shake Shack any day of the week. I really like this spot. Another place that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but focuses on one product and does the hell out of it. Bacon cheeseburger with fries for under $10. Frosty cold draft beer. Cool vibe taboot. Old creaky wood tables with names carved into them. Jukebox. I've only been for lunch, but should probably swing by for happy hr or dinner sometime.
