Absolutely beautiful!  Every detail that has been put into the interior of this place is just perfect.  I came for a late breakfast/lunch with a friend on a weekday - it's a bit of a walk from my apartment, but once we arrived we realized it was completely worth it!   The Gouda with black bean hummus, guava jam, and pickled jalapenos on brioche was amazing.  Probably THE best grilled cheese sandwich I have ever eaten.   My friend ordered the Gruyere, so we each sampled a bite of each other's sandwiches.  I still thought mine was the best, but the Gruyere was pretty darn tasty too. Oh, and the tomato soup was quite good too!  The curried pumpkin seeds were such a great, original touch. Definitely highly recommended.
