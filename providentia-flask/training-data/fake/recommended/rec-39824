This place has lots of potential, but overall I'm going to have to say it wasn't worth the money I spent.   By the time we showed up at this place, it was packed.  It can get crowded here real fast, but I'm guessing that this is part of the ambiance.  We ordered a pitcher of the sangria and it was pretty good.  We would have loved to go for the mojitos, but the pitcher is actually the perfect size for two people.  My friend and I ended up splitting the paella and the roast pork.  The paella, while good, didn't really hold up well against my roommates paella (FANTASTIC!).  But this place really lost a second star when our roasted pork turned out dry.  It was still good, but c'mon man!  It's a cuban restaurant!!!  You're supposed to know your pork!  Having spent $40 for my meal, I do have to say I was a little disappointed.
