Way overhyped and overpriced for what it is.  For my group of four this past weekend, our tab was approximately $120 p/p and hardly worth it.  The evening started off strong with good drinks (although I found the wine by the glass portion controls to be a little sad) and excellent cheese.  Things dropped off from there.  Service which was bordering on overly attentive at first became absent to the point where coffees took 20+ minutes and two requests to appear.  Scallops were either not cooked properly or were not of proper quality--not firm enough and a bt off tasting.  No one in our group was wowed by their entrees (which included duck and hangar steak).   The brioche rolls everyone is raving about were really nothing special and fairly flavorless.  We tried the doughnut and cupcake assortments and found them to be not exciting.  French press coffee was gimicky and not better than the LaColombe you get at most places of this caliber.  I won't return--there are far better restaurants at this price point in Philadelphia and many for much less.
