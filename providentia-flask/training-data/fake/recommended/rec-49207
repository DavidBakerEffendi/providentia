A great place to go if you can't get a table at Little Owl. That's what I did, anyway. Table for two, around nine on a Thursday, we waited about 20 minutes and then were seated at the bar. Wine list didn't have anything below $40, but the $40 bottle of Temperanillo that we had was great. My crispy chicken with broccoli and fontina fondue was delicious. (The fondue was definitely something I've had at Little Owl.) Great spot to take the parents, spacious, fun decor that feels very natural. I will definitely return (and hope that someone else picks up the check).
