I went to this spot last night with 4 friends ... the place is cute, atmosphere is perfect.  However ... about 1/2 way into our meal, there was an enormous cockroach CLIMBING UP THE WALL!  Our table jumped a mile, and the waitress came over to try to kill it... but it got away.  Horrible and gross, but NYC.  Well ... as we continued to sit (uneasy) 2 more were climbing up a wall on the other side of the restaurant!  AND then a woman came screaming out of the bathroom that there were 2 in there ... We asked for our bill and paid and got the hell out.  I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again!!  It clearly doesn't deserve an A rating and I have already contacted the board of health!
