I may go back and try this place a second time to see how they do, but here is my experience: Pros: The owner and waiter were extremely nice. Super accomodating and friendly. The food we ate (turkey burgers) was also pretty tasty. The decor is nice and they have a nice, big space. Cons: The service was really, unbearably slow, even though the place was almost empty. We wanted to order appetizers but we wound up just getting dinner because we could tell that it would take forever for anything to arrive. The menu is also really limited...I would use this as more of a lunchtime place for salads/sandwiches than a dinner option. I am interested in trying the brunch, though, and might consider trying it once more. Also the dinner option I was most interested in was unavailable for the night, so in addition to a tiny dinner menu, some of it wasn't available. I think this place has a lot of potential but they need to amp up their service (and also order real menus..their menu is printed on computer paper). EDIT ON 5.27.2014: I went back with some friends for brunch. Again, the food was very good and the servers were very attentive. I would add back in a star for faster service (much more reasonable this time), but would have to take it back out again for these two issues: 1. Brunch was a bit overpriced for what we got...$12 for a bowl of Muesli is a bit much. Â 2. Two people at my table ordered a sausage-biscuit sandwich thing, but one person's was missing the top biscuit for some reason. There was also a weird moment of tension where a group of servers stood near our table and seemed to be having a light argument over something. So I'm keeping at three stars.
