If I could give Jose Tejas 3.5 stars, I would. Tejas is pretty unique. It has a "family TexMex restaurant" vibe, and is always packed, even in between shifts. The food just happens to be good. It's not the most amazingly authentic: the menu is a disorganized mix of Creole, TexMex, and Mexican items. But it is perfect for those days when you crave some TexMex and a solid margarita. The prices are insanely low, especially for decent food. Â The dishes that stand out the most are not the taco/enchilada/etc but the blackened catfish and salmon, and the various roasted chicken type dishes. The "pacing" of the restaurant is very fast. Meaning, the orders are taken quickly, empty dishes bussed immediately, food comes out super fast, and visits from the server are frequent. This can be a good thing if you don't want to linger. And this is not the type of place where you will linger. The margaritas are potent and delectable.
