Yum, this place is gem. On a Friday night we didn't have to wait for a table and Testo even has sidewalk seating. Our waiter was cute, friendly and attentive. I liked the handwritten specials and wine list. I enjoyed the vegetable lasagna with homemade pasta and fresh, chunky tomato sauce. The sauce was just right, not to sweet or garlicky. My dates lamb sauce and gluten-free pasta was delicious too. Too bad there was no room for dessert, I would have liked to have tried them all, or at least the raspberry sorbet. Testo isn't in the hip, touristy part of Williamsburg, which explains why there was no wait, and the moderate prices. If you prefer a cozy, intimate vibe over the Williamsburg chaos definitely try Testo.
