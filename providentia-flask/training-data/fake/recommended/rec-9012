This place jumped up onto my top five burger spots the first time I went.  They have some interesting flavor combinations (have fun trying them, there's also an option for a surprise), but the best part is the burger patty itself - they use good meat, and when you order it rare, you get a perfect rare burger.  Surprisingly few places can make a rare burger properly, as it involves more than just taking it off the grill first - chop meat behaves differently when it's more raw, and it's oh-so-good. Add that to a pretty good tap list: not long, but all good stuff.  I'll be back often.
