I truly enjoy coming to Halcyon, and the most recent visit was no exception.  This is a special occasion place for us and we have not been in a couple of years since the birth of our daughter.  Funny enough is the fact that this was also our last meal out since we are about to have another baby and who knows when we will be able to go out next(!!!) :). Truthfully, this is a bit of an odd setup with the fact that it is attached to Egan's and a hallway separates both the cuisine and clientele.  With respect to the food it is fantastic!  The seafood is super fresh and always full of flavor.  We enjoyed a delicious(!!) octopus salad and the dumplings to start.  The main dishes were the 20 oz. strip and monk fish special for my wife.  The steak was a very nice cut and tender...unfortunately, it lacked flavor which was a shame but I still left the bone to be taken away.  My wife was raving the whole time about the fish and I will definitely stick with seafood next time.  Lastly, it was unfortunate that the dessert left much to be desired with only a few pies and sorbets.  It's just a personal peeve of mine when it's such a limited (much like our server's personality) menu and I was hoping for a molten lava or some sort of chocolaty dessert with ice cream.   All that aside, it's definitely a restaurant that is not to be missed and we look forward to our next visit...just don't know when that's going to be.
