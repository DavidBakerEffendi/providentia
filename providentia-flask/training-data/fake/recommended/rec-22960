I read the reviews prior to go to San Sai for the first time.  I had received glowing recommendations from a handful of people in the Burlington area that i work with.  I'm from Boston originally and i am accustomed to good sushi so i was skeptical walking in.  My expectations were met with an enthusiastic server (Sarah).  She seemed knowledgeable and friendly.  It was pretty packed but i didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to order. -The spicy squid as an appetizer 8.5/10 (one of my favorite parts of the meal) -Chirashi - the Sashimi variety was good.  (the rice was some of the best i've had in VT) 9/10. -The drink she made was great! Lemonade with maple syrup and Vodka! who would have thought!?8/10 I have to say out of the handful of spots I've eaten out at downtown, this is in my top 2 along with VPB.   If you like sushi I would highly recommend, if you haven't had sushi try it here. ~Susan
