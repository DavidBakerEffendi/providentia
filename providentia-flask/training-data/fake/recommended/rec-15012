This place is pretty excellent- definitely a go-to for me and the BF.  Some notes: -HAPPY HOUR and LATE NIGHT:  Happy Hour is 5-7 weekdays, and gets you half-price margaritas ($2.50 is hard to beat).  Late night is Sunday-Thursday 10pm-12am, and gives you half-price margaritas AND draft beers (usually they have a few decent craft beers). *update- all specials have gone up :( bummer.  Alas! -$1 per person endless chips, smoked pico de gallo and salsa verde- DELICIOUS, and perfect happy hour/late night food -Be wary: the margaritas can pack a punch.  It may be the cheap tequila, but inevitably these hit me after the fact in a weird and often headache and/or hangover-inducing manner that margaritas (even strong ones) don't usually give me.  Drink lots of water, that's for sure- and don't let this deter you.   -Vegetarian Texas Cheesesteak?  AMAZING. -Brunch includes a free drink for each adult over $21 (Bloody Mary or Mimosa).  VEGETARIANS BE WARNED- the Bloody Mary mix is NOT vegetarian, and not all of the waiters know that.  I asked, was told it was vegetarian, had my BF try it, asked again to have them double-check, and found out it wasn't.  I lucked out, but if you are allergic to seafood or vegetarian, stick with the Mimosa and make sure the waiters double-check anything that could mess with your dietary restrictions.
