First, this is unrelated to the food but I'm completely in love with ilili's logo. Look it up on their menu, its beautifully done. Ok now, on to the wonderfulness of the food. I went here wtih 3 friends and we shared several delicious appetizers , including the falafel & Chankleesh (cheese). Then I had the Chicken Shish Toauk (chicken breast marinated in garlic and lemon spiced pita), which was amazing. This lebanese restaurant is one of my NYC favorites now. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
