Great lunch special! You get a salad or soup, small appetizer, and large entree for $9-12. Very attentive wait staff that never let my water get empty (which is quite the tall order). The food was out quickly and tasted great! The pad thai (my litmus test) was delicious. Highly recommended. Living across the street means I will be back!!
