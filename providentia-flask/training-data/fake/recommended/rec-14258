I'm frankly a little surprised that Clinton St doesn't have a higher overall rating, because I honestly think it's the best brunch spot in Manhattan (and I have tried quite a few over the past few months). The blueberry pancakes are so light and fluffy that they literally melt in your mouth, and the same goes for the banana walnut pancakes. Their omelettes and egg dishes are nothing to sneeze at either - the spanish scramble is absolutely delish! I have come here at least five times in the past year and have never been let down. I agree that the wait can get annoying (up to an hour and a half, esp. on weekends), but IMO, it is well worth it. Go try it, I promise you won't be disappointed.
