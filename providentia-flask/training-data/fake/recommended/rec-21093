Was walking around the area and decided to stop by here. This place is very homey yet sort of intimate. I like the vibe in here. The paintings on the wall are interesting and with the Olympics on the tv, what could go wrong. Greeted with two classes of water and a smile. That's how every place should do it but I digress. The menu has a wide variety for pretty much anyone. I saw the pictures of the pulled pork on here and decided that's what I wanted. They ran out of regular and spicy fries so we had to get sweet potato. Eh. The pulled pork was delicious but didn't like the slight hint of spicy it had. The bun was super delicious. The sweet potato fries were crunchy but I just don't like sweet potato fries but if I did these would be good. My friend ordered the baked Mac and cheese and chicken fingers. Didn't try the Mac and cheese but he said it was pretty basic. It took about 40 min for them to make it, which is fine because it's fresh but needed maybe a bit more seasoning or some other ingredient. The chicken tenders were delicious. Nice and crunchy and the chicken is soft and moist. They just need to update their menu on their website so it's accurate. Wanted a grilled cheese but they changed their menu.
