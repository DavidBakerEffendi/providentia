Loved this place. Went here for the first time a couple nights ago for a casual birthday dinner. Great atmosphere, loved the background music and vibes. Food was delicious and the staff couldn't have been more wonderful. Our waitress Jessica was just fantastic. Great recommendations, and I just loved her attitude. Some places hit you with a professionalism that feels kind of cold. I found the staff here to be so warm and welcoming that it felt like home. I seriously wanted to befriend everyone in this place. I can't believe this place is open until midnight. We tend to eat late and often lament that so many of our favorite restaurants don't serve after 10p. We'll most definitely add Rucola to the rotation. What a great neighborhood find!
