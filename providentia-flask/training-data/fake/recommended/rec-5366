I am torn because the food here is pretty good but the service is really lacking. They did some renovations to the space but service did not improve.  Many times that I came here...I would see guests wonder where their server went....and if he would come back to take their order. Sometimes people would go right up to the counter requesting for their server.  This is really poor service that I haven't seen in a long time! It is really best to order take out and enjoy the food at home.  We normally order the bun no hue (spicy noodle soup) which is quit delicious....I never need to add anything to it.  I also order the special pho which have different types of beef....since I can never decide.  The beef wrap in grape leaves with vermicelli and rice paper is also very tasty and you can ask for the pineapple sauce on the side. The crab noodle and tomato soup is also one of my favorite.  The food there is very good it's just the service that's lacking. I would give this place a try base on the food....you can rate the service yourself and see if you agree.
