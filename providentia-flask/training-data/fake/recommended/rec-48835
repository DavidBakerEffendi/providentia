Loved the food here! Still thinking about it 2 weeks later.  I had chili with the works, jalapeno cornbread with honey, and spicy kale on the side.  Everything was delicious.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad on the side which I tasted and was also amazing.  To drink I had the Shaggy, I highly recommend.  Can't wait to go back and try the wings and brunch!  The place is small on the inside and was crowded on the Sunday night we were there, we opted to sit at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table (I think they were estimating a 30 minute wait).
