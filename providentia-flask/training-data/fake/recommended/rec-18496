This is one of the best spots for a romantic dinner in NYC. Ideally, you will get here early enough to have a seat outside, but if you get here late or don't have a reservation the indoor seating satisfying as well. The service will always be attentive and helpful, and the wine and menu options are plentiful. The hanger steak and pork chop are both excellent. Is this an amazing gourmet restaurant? No. But is it a great place to take your significant other to have a very romantic, intimate dining experience. There is a balance between the two and this place treads it!
