I mean, it's just pizza. Okay, don't yell at me! I took the long walk from Manhattan to Grimaldi's because I had a friend in town and we needed a place to eat....we also really wanted to walk in the rain (yeah, no). We ended up at Grimaldi's because a) I've never been, b) we were in Brooklyn, and c) nothing else was open on a Monday. The line was nonexistent and the place was definitely filled with tourists - the group who was next to us, tipped zero dollars (the waitstaff was less than thrilled). We ordered a small mushroom and pepper pizza, which was actually quite large! Honestly, I would recommend it if there is no chance you'll have to wait in any kind of line, but otherwise, you can get the same kind of pizza in Manhattan, or a place with no line. And the ambiance is quite blah.
