Finally getting around to giving Salute the four stars it so deserves!  While we were in town on business, this was the name that kept coming up to go for dinner and drinks.  Sitting outside is really a good idea at this place, getting to people watch and it's in a nice setting.  The waiter was really cool and joked a lot with us.  I can't remember everything we had because we kept a lot of appetizers on our plate and was picking and drinking the entire night.  It's a great, fun place with really good food!  This is my first stop when returning to Hartford.
