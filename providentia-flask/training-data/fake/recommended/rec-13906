A sandwich shop in NY that doesn't have the chicken fajita panini, or any or those crap pre-made shit sandwiches at all of the other delis. Pho sandwich is so legit. I ate with amazement how it actually tasted like Pho. Rare roast beef with sprouts, onion, cilantro, avocado, hoisin and sriracha. The should give a small bowl of pho broth and it could a "Vietnamese Dip" Curry chicken w/ Seafood salad was delicious as well. All the ingredients were fresh. Nothing was wilted or browning. Meats were fresh and tasty. Delivery too!! I will probably be eating this everyday for the next month.
