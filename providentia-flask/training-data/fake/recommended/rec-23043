Went Friday night to hear a great Band, and was pleasantly surprised by Towne Tavern ! it was very busy , packed , had a great vibe, good lighting , and delicious food ! People were dancing to the band which is great ! Â It is casual, but the food was more upscale than i expected , the waitress was super nice and attentive and fast ! The Bar tender was nice and fast too. The Seabass special was so good, and came with salad and bread. Only draw back is it's in a strip mall - but hey , that's Jersey ! We will go back for sure ! Oh , and forgot to mention - the shrimp quesadillas were amazing , cooked perfectly and better than most Mexican places !
