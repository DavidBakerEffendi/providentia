I have to say after reading all the great reviews here, I ended up a little disappointed. We got the country chicken herb crepe which was on the dry side unfortunately and not too filled. The prosciutto crepe was better, and the dessert crepe (we had the crepe Suzette which was Grand Marnier) which was probably the best but still nothing to write home about. After splitting 3 crepes between the 2 of us, we weren't too full. With coffee/tea, our brunch tab came up to $45 or so....which we felt was rather high for what we had. Probably wouldn't go back, unless specifically for dessert.
