Could we call this our favorite BYOB ever?  I think we could.  We save this spot for special occasions, every couple years though.  I absolutely love the feel of this place - I am a sucker for a cozy, casual-chic, kinda atmosphere where you're so close to the other customers that you can rub elbows with them.  It reminds me of the tiny little restaurants all over Italy that have absolutely fantastic food.   And the food.  is. so. GOOD!  We end up not being able to resist ordering a meat and cheese plate (prosciuttos, french and belgian cheeses), which we realize doesn't take much preparation.  But it goes so well with a nice bottle of wine and it really sets the mood for the whole dinner.   Every dish we've ordered here have been excellent.  Most recently, the market salad, Spaghetti and grilled octopus, Crispy skin striped bass. The service was friendly and good, but it was quite slow the last time we were here, and we were almost late for our theater show (we'd reserved for 2 hours before the showtime).  Oh and the serving sizes are quite generous too, for a restaurant of this type.  We took some leftovers home, and didn't have any room left for dessert.
