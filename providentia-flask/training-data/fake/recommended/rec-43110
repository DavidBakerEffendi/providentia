"Identity crisis" is right. Display counters + chalkboard menu + couches, pillows, comfy chairs + people on laptops equals a cafe to me, albeit a very large one. So when I am greeted by someone behind a counter rather than a host,  I'm not expecting to then be told to sit down so "the waiter can take care of me" when I only want 10 minutes to eat a sandwich I can just as easily grab from the counter myself when it's ready. There were maybe four occupied tables in the whole place, and none of the parties looked like they were having much in the way of a square meal, if eating  food at all--so zero need for the poor guy, at least on a cold weeknight. I think if this place insists on being more "restaurant" than cafe during the evening hours it needs to more firmly distinguish itself by kicking out the laptop users and taking the counter out of commission. Or it should just be a full-on restaurant and nix the counter all together. It's a gorgeous space, indoor and out; just seems like it's not living up to its potential.
