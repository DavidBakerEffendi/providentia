Came here for a double date... lol... first thing i noticed was how the waitresses were dressed (sort of reminded me of the roaring 20's)... it was cute. Then i noticed the chandelier... i liked the decor. We had a little bit of a wait. There was really no room to stand around... it was kind of crowded. And the other reviewers weren't lying --- it was kind of loud in there. I couldn't even hear myself think... I was starving so i played it safe... i got some pad thai w/ chicken... honestly it was just ok. I've had better. Overall it was an ok experience.
