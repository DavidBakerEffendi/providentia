I'll just reiterate what others have said.  As a neighborhood resident, it's so nice to see something beautiful done with this old bank building which always looked like it had potential.  The food is solid but the sandwiches a bit repetitive - they are all flat bread variations as the name Manaakeesh suggests.  We've tried the fava bean spread (excellent) as well as several flat bread sandwiches and salads.  However, the real winner here are the amazing pastries.  We've tried several now and they are all equally amazing.  The owners are friendly and seem invested in the neighborhood.  A welcome addition!
