Amazing unpretentious little spot tucked on a street corner in the west village. We popped in for lunch and it was a treat! They had soft shell crab on the menu as the special so we both ordered that and split an artichoke salad. Perfect lunch on a sunny day. The artichoke salad featured raw artichoke. It was uncommon and delicious. Apparently popular in Italy. The dressing was light and tangy. The crabs were perfectly crisp and fresh, served on a bed of tangy arugula. Light and wonderful. We also ordered the truffle mushrooms (admittedly they did not go, but we wanted to try them). The mushrooms were good, but not amazing like the other dishes. The ambience of this place is amazing. It is small and cozy with a ton of natural light. Very cute and comfortable. Our server was attentive and friendly, but kept his distance. We didn't have a reservation, but they took us anyways. Overall wonderful. Would love to come back for brunch or dinner next time!
