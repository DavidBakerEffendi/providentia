If sandwiches were an art, these guys would be Picasso. These have got to be the best sandwiches I've ever had! They're so creative and delicious. How can you hear, "Whole Roasted Suckling Pig" and not instantly want to eat here? You can't, try it. I've had the Arista and Gustaio and both are excellent. The big flavors coming out of this little shop are amazing. I can almost guarantee you won't be disappointed. Seating inside is limited but they've added some outdoor seating which is nice. There can be a little bit of a wait but it's well worth it.
