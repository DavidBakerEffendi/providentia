My boyfriend and I went here last week to celebrate a late Valentine's Day/our 2 year anniversary and we were not disappointed!! We had an 8pm reservation and were seated with drinks by 8:07...not to mention that our food arrived by 8:15--despite that the place was packed!! Even though the food arrived quickly, it was still delicious! It is loud (though I was forewarned from other reviews!) so this is not a place for quiet, romantic dinners. Great food, nice wine list!
