Food A variety of tasty food that left me feeling healthy! No tummy ache or discomfort! It felt like food meant for my body. Satisfying portions and flavors. Environment Unique seating but limited. I took off stars for the massive inconvenience this place is to those with wheelchairs and strollers. God forbid a paleo mom wishes to bring her paleo baby. There are no changing tables in the place and I had to use some small table in the upstairs bathroom in a very precarious way to get a clean diaper on my kid. I know the world doesn't have to cater to anyone and I should (and have!) adapted but it's not hard to get a $50 changing table from restaurant depot and screw it on the wall. No one will care about aesthetics in the bathroom. Seating downstairs is so limited and the seats are oddly shaped such that you are in an almost squat. I am very tall and it was not comfortable. Oh well. Foods good.
