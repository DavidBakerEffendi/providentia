Came here for brunch on a Sunday - it was really crowded and we had a reservation which helped but still had to wait for 20 minutes.  The staff was super apologetic and brought donuts for us to snack on while we waited which I loved.   It's a great atmosphere an the waiter was really friendly and attentive.   Our food was really good but the menu was pretty standard brunch nothing really unique.  The cheddar grits were delish...
