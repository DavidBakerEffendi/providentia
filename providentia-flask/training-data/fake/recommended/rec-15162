Great food, but I would not recommend dining in.  They are located in an old McDonald's and they have kept most of the decor, but for turning the M's upsidedown and making W's from them...They deliver and their pizza is quite good, believe it or not the shrimp pizza is one of the best I have had.  The pizza can get quite greasy, but they are generous with the toppings and Grinders are BIG and quite tasty.  Perhaps a better option for takeout or delivery...
