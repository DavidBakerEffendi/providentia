Wait an hour for what one of my friends describes as "the best brunch in NYC?"  Sure, but as a member of a generation used to instant gratification, I scoffed at the idea.  Thinking that we were so clever, my friend and I decided to visit Clinton St. Baking Company early on a Monday morning, when most people would be at work.  Oh, silly us.  That's right; the restaurant was full and there were a lot of people already waiting. So wait an hour we did. Right before I was about to collapse from low blood sugar, we were shown to two chairs at the counter right in front of the street window.   Maybe the food tasted better because there was a crowd of hungry people enviously watching us eat, but that brunch was worth the wait!  We shared the Eggs Benedict and the potato pancakes with the smoked salmon, boiled egg and fresh lemon cream, and both were deliciously sinful.  Every bite was rich and full of flavor.  And of course, how could we not order the sugar-cured bacon?  Regular bacon will never make the cut in my eyes again. Sorry!
