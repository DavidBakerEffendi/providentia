I once ate 26 ravioli here and I was in 7th grade... later on in life I was lucky enough to meet Glenn, the man in charge of all the head chefs at all the locations and he is great... Â I have also worked with cooks from carmines and they are amazing co- workers. its no wonder that the restaurants are great as well
