I recently took my visiting Dad to Ilili after hearing great things from some of my coworkers.  My company frequently takes clients here for lunch.  Let me just say I was not disappointed.  We were seated promptly, even though we were waiting for my friend to join us.  This was a big plus, since most places refuse to seat you until your entire party arrives.  The service was outstanding.  The waitstaff was extremely attentive.  Since it was our first time at a Lebanese restaurant, our server walked us through and made some great recommendations!  The duck shawarma was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  Great wine selection and great atmosphere.  The lighting was a bit too dim, but then again, I was with my dad.  Had I been on a date, perhaps I would have appreciated the dim lighting.  Overall, great food.  Will definitely be back!
