I have been anxiously waiting for HOTW to open in Burlington, since Waterbury is a bit of a drive.  Considering how fantastic HOTW was in Waterbury, I had very high expectations of their new place...and yet was still totally blown away! The ambiance was perfect...cozy, rustic Vermont feel, but with the attention to detail you are more likely to find at a hip new NYC restaurant.  The menu was unique and diverse, yet still local and fresh! We sat at the bar and shared a few plates:  two cheeses with the ham (their homemade crackers are to die for), the lobster with parsnip (out of this world), the HOTW mushroom toast (great combination of flavors), the hanger steak (very flavorful and perfectly cooked), and the crushed potatoes. As a native Vermonter, who is now a foodie living in NYC, I was ecstatic to enjoy such an wonderful dining experience from start to finish in beautiful Burlington VT!  Well done, HOTW!
