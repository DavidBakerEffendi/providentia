Very meh. We have lived on the UES for years and have been eager for a good thai place to be a go-to (there's a dearth up here!). We were really disappointed. Tom Kha (with veggies) was watery and flavorless. The Tom Yum soup was also bland, with no kick like it should have. The veggies in both soups seem like an afterthought -- a stick of carrot, a piece of lettuce, one grape tomato sliced in two. It was very strange. Saut√©ed veggies with tofu and ginger sauce was okay, but a very tiny portion for the money. Same with the pad see ew, which was fine I guess but really small portion. Definitely nothing special, I'm sorry to say.
