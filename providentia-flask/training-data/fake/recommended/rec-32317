All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Mistral immensely. The food was delicious, beautiful, and daring. And that's a very welcome thing in the Princeton area. Aside from Chef Anderson's other venture, the area is (frankly) awash in mediocrity. With the guaranteed audience of university students, parents, and local professionals the restaurants in the region pretty much have to turn out something edible and they'll be printing money. Mistral tosses that aside and does what the hell it wants. And the Princeton area is better for it. I'm not sure if it's going to be informative to describe specific dishes as the menu seems to be constantly in flux, but I will point out that (at least on my visit) everything was prepared artfully and with precision. The remoulade that was served with our fried olives was comparable with the best I've ever had in New Orleans. The special foie gras soup (with lentils and seared foie gras) was positively ridiculous. It managed to be intensely rich and light at the same time. It was kind of a masterpiece. Really, everything was at least tasty and interesting if not amazing. The only knock I would give to this place isn't really this place's fault. If I could, I would give this place 4.5 stars and knock of a star because I just hate 'tapas style' dining. I'm all for family style dining and this food should be shared and experienced by everyone (dietary restrictions excepted). But really 'small plates' in the US is a way to make a really expensive place seems deceptively accessible. Oh, a 16 dollar entree! Not really. A per person cost based in reality for Mistral is probably 30-50 dollars. And that can be a tough thing to swallow (for lunch, in particular). But none of that was to take away from the significance of the meal. I'm not sure if you can chock up earlier reviews of the service to growing pains, but our service was immaculate. Everything was well paced, well described, and served warmly. I'll definitely be back again.
