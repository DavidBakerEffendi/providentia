So I went on my pre-birthday date here... since I have classes on my birthday from 9am-9pm (how unfair is that??). My birthday dinner was pre-planned in my mind - I wanted some LASAGNA!!   We scouted out some Italian places here on Yelp, and decided on Pellegrino's........................  and off we went. We were instantly seated (7:30 on a Thursday nite), and our food came very quickly after ordering. Sadly (minus one star, that's how sad) - no lasagna. No complaints other than that though - the food was amazing!!   We started with the stuffed artichoke heart antipasti ($15), and had the chicken stuffed with duck, a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus ($25), and the lobster ravioli with shrimp ($25). All was delicious, the service was incredible, and the experience was all in all quite lovely.
