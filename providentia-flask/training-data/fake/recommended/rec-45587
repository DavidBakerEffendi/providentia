It was a little annoying to have to wait about an hour to get a table, but the food made it worth it.  I went with standard scrambled eggs and bacon.  It came with a huge freshly made delicious biscuit, a real treat.  The people I was with got the frittata and the pancakes.  Both were very good.  The homemade ketchup was thinner than the typical heinz/hunts ketchup, but quite delicious.  Coffee is served in a cool old timey metal mug and was quite good.   The place is pretty small inside, don't plan to come with a group of more than 4 because you'll need to wait forever to get a table.  Groups of 2 had the easiest time getting a table.
