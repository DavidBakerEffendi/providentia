Wafa is the man! I mean woman... This place is amazing. Even though it is no bigger than a go kart at your local amusement park, it packs a tastebud punch! Try the spinach pie, the falafel or the hummus and you will not be disappointed. Did I also mention the meat pies? the gyro's with turnip cuts and spicy spicy sauce? Its wonderful. Wafa herself makes all the food and is the best little place in Forest Hills. Enjoy
