If you love seafood and byob this is the place to go!  This resto is part of the JM Group which also owns Witherspoon Grill, Nassau Seafood Company (fish monger next door), and runs the Princeton Farmer's Market.  Ok, lets talk about the food.  They have a daily selection of fresh shuck oysters. I always opt for the Tasting  which is 18 oysters you choose for $52.   The New England seafood chowder ($7) is a must and actually have bites of seafood and is really tasty.    The Grilled Portuguese Octopus $16 is grilled to perfection!  By then I'm probably stuffed so I'll share the daily fish of the day (grilled, broiled) with my DW.   Service is prompt and water is poured frequently.  The place gets pretty packed so best is to make reservation.  They do have a small bar section (5 seats) and you get to see the kitchen and the oyster shuckers in action!  My only dislike and I docked a star  is that after your done eating and you can't stuff anymore dessert, they'll slip you the bill (walking by now and then) so they can fill in the next table.  It's a good thing if your the owner but as a paying patron and ate close to $100 I would like to finish my wine instead of chugging it.   Tip:  There's a small but well stocked Liquor store about a block (next to Hoagie Haven).  The owner there knows his winea so grab a bottle and enjoy!
