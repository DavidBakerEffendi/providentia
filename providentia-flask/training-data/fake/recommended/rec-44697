My friend who gets delivery to his place at 172 culver ave regularly, turned me on to Lins gourmet few months back when he ordered the ribs. The spare ribs are outstanding and tonight I said to try the chicken wings. Well they are golden crispy and fresh also. Not your regular old Chinese chicken wings. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.
