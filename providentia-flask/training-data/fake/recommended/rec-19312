Now usually, Sabrina's is one of my favorite restaurants. From their Challah french toast to Mel's Chicken cutlet (my fave) they are on point and just generally good food. But today I was very disappointed with the service. I ordered my usual, Mel's chicken cutlet, for pickup. Not only did they not call me when it was ready like they usually do (when I got there they weren't especially busy). But the fries were soggy, and they gave me salad that was half spoiled. Not good at all Sabrina's, you can do better than that.
