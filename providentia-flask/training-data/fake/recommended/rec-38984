Usually excellent, but... When searching for a place to make brunch reservations on Opentable yesterday, the menu page for Odeon showed they had BLT's.  My 8 year old daughter LOVES BLT's, so we booked a table at Odeon.  Drove from Brooklyn, paid $18 to park, got seated, and then discovered the brunch menu did not have a BLT (it's on their lunch menu).  I figured it would not be a problem to get one anyway as it is just bread, lettuce bacon and tomato.  I asked, they refused.   So I ordered a side of bacon and a toasted bagel (both on the menu) and asked for a side of tomato and lettuce.  Had to assemble it ourselves at the table.  Not the end of the world, but I find it surprising that they couldn't make a simple BLT for an 8 year old.  Even more surprising is that they preferred to have the customer assembling the sandwich at the table rather than having the kitchen do it.   Thanks, Odeon.
