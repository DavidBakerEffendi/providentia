These are the best crepes I've had anywhere in the US. The goat cheese, caramelized onion, fig and honey crepe was super great. The crepes themselves were fantastic, both savory and sweet. The creme de marron (chestnut paste) dessert crepe was fantastic. And the socca appetizer was addictive. It's a thick crispy pancake made from chickpea flour. It needs a sauce or condiment, though.
