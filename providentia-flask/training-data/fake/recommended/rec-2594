This may be my favorite place to see a show, from the balcony, natch.  It's small and there is not a bad place to be.    I was hesitant to go because it's in FRIGGIN FISHTOWN but now that i see how close it is to the El, and that I don't have to wander too far all over the place, I will go back again and again.
