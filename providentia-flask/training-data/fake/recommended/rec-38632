I went to this lovely little cafe for an early dinner with some friends on a Monday afternoon. Two of the party had been before and recommended it highly. I took to it immediately as we were welcomed by the friendly staff who informed us what was available (the full menu is only on offer Wednesday thru Sunday). We purred at the fresh goodies at the counter before taking a seat around the back in the roomy, pleasant dining area. I had a really smooth and creamy milkshake and a veggie burger, which was fresh and tasty. With the number of options available and the relaxed atmosphere, I'd definitely go back when I'm in West Philly again - they certainly know what they're doing. Gold Standard indeed!
