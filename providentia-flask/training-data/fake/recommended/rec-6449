this place was UNREAL (in a good way).  we had to wait an hour since we were a party of 7 and they were packed, which from the looks of it seemed like a normal night even though it was a tuesday.  i had one of their beers by the bartenders recommendation and nothing special but they do have another 40 or so it seems and a bunch they brew themselves. as for the food, even as a new yorker, it was some of the best pizza i've ever eaten.  the wood fire oven made a perfect crust, cheese melt and pizza.  everything in the store was local and mostly organic which made things even tastier.  we split their sausage pizza (from the menu) and their special puttanesca pizza that night.  absolutely delicious in every bite!
