Yum!!! My friend's and I had the fried catfish, porkchop, chicken wings, macaroni & cheese, okra greens and mashed potatoes. Everything was excellent. I can't say the the service is fabulous or speedy. But it was adequate and I didn't expect fast food anyway. The door guy can be a little gruff. But the food more than makes up for it. I just hope this place doesn't go the way of Sylvia's. ;)
