We came at 5:30 on a weekday and had to wait about 10 minutes because according to the hostess, "I just seated someone in the same section and the waitstaff won't be able to handle both parties sitting at once". I should have realized what was to come. The staff here is obviously very inexperienced. After we sat down, we saw people waiting to be seated for long periods of time. We counted and there were 6 tables empty in the downstairs area (there is definitely an upstairs area that I've seen when I ate at the restaurant that was here prior but I'm not sure what they do with that area). Â The food takes a very long time to come out. After getting our food 45 minutes later, I had to ask 3 different people for ketchup before I just got up and went to get it myself from the bar. In instances like this, you have to blame the management and those running the restaurant because they are the ones responsible for ensuring that they have a proper waitstaff that are competent. The food is fine. I had the truffle burger and was only able to finish 1/2 of it because it is just very heavy. My friend had the hatch burger and said it was just fine also. I would definitely not come back here because the service is seriously lacking. In a city like NY where you have plenty of people who are career servers, you should have much better staffing. I also would not come back because they make people wait hours even though they have empty tables in order to create some kind of sense of demand.
