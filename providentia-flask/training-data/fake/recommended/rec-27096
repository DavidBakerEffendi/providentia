I am not that big on rating chains, but there aren't too many of these places and a lot of people don't know about this place yet.  You walk in and wait in line to order at the counter and then wait until they call you and your order is ready.  I like how they prepare your burger with any topping you would like and they do it for you (I am not a big fan of topping my burger - it always seems to taste better when someone else does it for you).  You can snack on some peanuts while you wait.  There are peanuts everywhere, which is kind of cool, but you may have shells all over the table you sit at. Overall, the food is pretty good.  I don't like how you can't get your burger cooked the way you like (everything is done on the medium-well side).  They do give you a huge bag of fries and the fries are good.  If you are looking for a quick burger and some good fries, this might be the place for you.
