Quite good, but not good enough to justify a $100-per-person tab. That said, if you go, I'd recommend the following: Beirut Sunburn cocktail (amazing spicy-sweet combination of your preferred bourbon, jalapeno and St. Germaine) .... Risotto with peas, Parmesan and rye - perfectly cooked ... Octopus with luscious lamb belly ... Chicken confit - wildly moist, and I believe you can/should substitute an extra leg/thigh in place of the breast kebab. One big drawback to note: Weak wine-by-the-glass list featuring such lowlights as $12 glasses of freaking Beringer, and cheap basic wine glasses that make the dull selections even duller. To reiterate, food/drinks are mostly very nice, but are a good 15%-20% more expensive than is warranted.
