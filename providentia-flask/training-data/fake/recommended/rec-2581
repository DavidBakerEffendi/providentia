I was at Kefi for a girls' night out and I really enjoyed our dining experience here. The atmosphere was cozy, the service was attentive, and the food was delicious. We ordered a bunch of different mezes and bigger dishes. Like other Yelpers mentioned, the Sheep's Milk Dumplings were absolutely amazing. I couldn't stop eating them lol. The Grilled Octopus, which was perfectly cooked, was also wonderful! It always makes me happy to eat octopus that doesn't resemble the texture of rubber... yikes! Although I wasn't too crazy about it, my friends also enjoyed the Braised Lamb Shank and the Meatballs. The service staff did a pretty good job accommodating our big group. But I can see how Kefi would be good for a date night. I would definitely come back here whatever my party size is :)
