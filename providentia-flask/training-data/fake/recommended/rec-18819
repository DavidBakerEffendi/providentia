One thing I realized while eating my way through New York City is that mid-range restaurants are much more wallet friendly than in my hometown of San Francisco. Take Kefi, for example. Most of the dishes are in the $13-$17 range - a similar restaurant in SF would probably charge $18-$25. Our dinner at Kefi was solid across the board. I had the Branzino with potato, olive and tomato. I love all those ingredients and the dish was perfectly prepared. And at $17 it was a steal, especially considering the portion size. I was also able to sample a lamb chop (one of the evening's specials) and loved it. A perfect medium rare with some crunch to the meat. Mmmm, lamb. We tried a couple of the speciality cocktails and they were just ok - when I return I'll probably stick to beer and wine. Luckily Kefi is a few blocks from my friend's apt in the UWS...next time I'm in town I'll be insisting that we make a return visit to Kefi!
