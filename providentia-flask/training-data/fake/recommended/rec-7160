This review is soley for drinks. I love the pig theme! hehe litto piggies sho cute. The bartender makes a sick jalapeno margarita. I guess it's not on the menu anymore, but it used to be so if you ask for it, they probs know how to make it. Just a hint of sweetness, the perfect kick for an aftertaste, and boozie just the way I like it. My friend and I just hung out upstairs in the bar area. The ambiance was super chill and laid back. I loved it. We didn't have to shout at each other over any music, so that was a plus. Definitely down to get ratchet here. And drink jalapeno margaritas all night long.
