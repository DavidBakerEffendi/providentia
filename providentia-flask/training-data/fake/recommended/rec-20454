I must say with the slew of Thai restaurants in the vicinity, its hard to decide which one to go to.  Joya, has done a great job distinguishing itself from the rest by offering great food at excellent prices.  I've been there about 10 times and its been great 8 out of 10 so it gets 4 stars.  I would stick to the curries and noodles.  The fish dishes are so-so.  The one other con is that it's too dark, I guess what you can't see can't hurt you.
