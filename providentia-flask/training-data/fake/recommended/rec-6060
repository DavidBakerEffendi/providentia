Love, Love, LOVE this restaurant! You can't go wrong with food or service here.  The atmosphere is great for a date night in the city. I always come here every time I'm in the area and craving Greek food.  The Moussaka is a must try.  Every time I come here, we order a bunch of appetizers and each an entree.  What can I say...everything is good!  I highly recommend this restaurant.
