I pass three other coffee shops to get to this one. This mom & pop shop is focussed on high-quality drinks and food with a Latin flair. The owners are always good for suggestions of other neighborhood places or a chat about a local concert. Head over for an inexpensive hot lunch with a smooth cold brew coffee.
