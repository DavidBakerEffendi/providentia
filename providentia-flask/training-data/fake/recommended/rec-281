Overall: Excellent and would come back Ambiance: casual Service: the waitress was nice and helpful in ordering the food Appetizer Grilled Portuguese Octopus: If you like garlic, you will love this dish! Octopus was very tender, exploding with flavor Entree Ordered the seagrill special that came with char, seabass and a side...all of this was delicous...the seabass was tender, melted in your mouth, great flavor. probably one of the best seabass I ever had. The char was also very good...good texture and flavor...I ordered the garlic mashed potato as the side which was yummy, but big portion and very heavy Dessert Brownie a la mode..brownie was rich, but not too sweet. the vanilla, sea salt ice cream was a nice touch with the brownie.
