I decided on this cold day I needed to experience the warmth of burger deliciousness and convinced a friend to visit Umami burger with me. At 3:00 PM on a Sunday there was still a brief 15-20 wait but we opted to sit at the bar and watch women's speed skating while eating. The restaurant had a nice selection of draught and bottle beers. There were a lot of ales and a surprising amount of citrus based beers. Some were common, (Allagash) while others were a surprise ( Ommengang BPA and Hennepin). Upon looking over the menu I appreciate Umami burger for offering some salads as well as "Un-beef" burgers but those had to wait for another time. We decided to order some truffle fries and get the two burgers with the Umami Icon next to them, the Original and the Truffle. We split our burgers so we could each enjoy both. The fries come with a nice trio of dipping sauces, a herb based one, a garlic aioli and a really nice and spicy one. So the Original was a very juicy patty with a nice mix of flavors. I just wish there were more mushrooms and roasted tomatoes on the one we were served (maybe arrive before 3:00 PM next time). It's interesting because their signature bun kind of has a noticeably sweet taste to it. I may have to try a burger without the bun next time. The Truffle burger is just as tasty but has a more straight forward flavor profile. The sweetness of the bun serves to balance the richness of all the truffle based items. Don't judge me but I waited for the people sitting next to us to leave before I ended up ordering a second burger to try. I ordered the Manly Burger and it was very different from the Original and Truffle burgers. The Manly was very smoky in taste, a little saltier and had a slight mustard flavor as well. The bacon lardons were in chunk form and some of the chunks were dried out and tough to chew. The Manly may not be a good choice to start compared to the other two. I look forward to returning and ordering the turkey based Greenbird.
