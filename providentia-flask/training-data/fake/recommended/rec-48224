We stopped in here on our way back to our hotel from visiting the Liberty Bell. The menu was BIG and it took some time to decide what we wanted! I got a BLT, B got the American sandwich (turkey, ham, bacon and cheese). B wanted potato salad, but they were out, so we both added bags of chips (BBQ for me, sour cream and onion for B). Â Bonus points for bottled AND fountain soda, I love me a good fountain soda! My BLT was great, crispy bacon and not too much mayo. B said his sandwich was good, too, but I think I won the order battle! Both were served with veggie chips (B ate mine, said they were good) and a pickle. The prices were super reasonable in my opinion (my BLT was only $5), but locals who've reviewed here seem to think it's pricey? Maybe Boston is just so expensive it's warped my sense of affordable! Super clean and really friendly staff, too.
