I found this place on Yelp last night and decided to check it out with my gluten/dairy free friend.  The menu, while small, is full of flavor and all 4 rolls we tried were amazing and tasty for both me and my friend.  There was a significant wait for food and the guy taking our order apologized profusely.  It's a tight fit in there so we were pleased to get a seat and be in and out in about 30 minutes total feeling incredibly well fed.  You can't beat the cost, and the design of the space is great.
