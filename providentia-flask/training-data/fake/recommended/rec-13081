I meant to write a review for this place for so long but never got to it because every time I'm about to write it, I come here again. In short, Ramen here is to die for, perfect broth and all, but the wait is so painstakingly long sometimes (especially in the fucking snow in the middle of December). Favorite ramen has to be the tonkotsu based ones, shoyu is okay and all but not as hearty as the pork broth (and hence doesn't hit the spot for artery clogging foods). The pork buns are buttery and and juicy and the perfect way to start off a meal. I love the edamames here because I just love edamames no matter where, I know, what a bamf. The ramen portions are not large, but for a 5 feet tall girl, shit gets filling fast. I never leave without grabbing dessert. My favorite is the green tea ice cream with mascarpone, perfect blend of refreshing and indulgent. The price is nothing to ogle at, but it ain't wallet breaking either. Atmosphere is very warm and cozy and modern, with the waiters screaming occasionally in Japanese to emulate a traditional ramen joint. Very nice spot to nom with friends before becoming wasted for the night.
