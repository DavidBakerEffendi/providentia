4.5 stars Will keep this short since Pepe's is so famous already and has 600+ reviews.  Certainly one of the top thin crust pizzas I've had.  Hearty toppings, thin but not too chewy crust, with the slightly burnt edges.   A medium pizza can easily feed 3 people.   Anyways, line wasn't too bad even on Saturday for lunch, and the prices overall are so reasonable.   Worth a special drive for many hours?  Probably not, it's pizza, there's only so high the ceiling can go.  Somewhere in the area, and worth trying once?  Absolutely.
