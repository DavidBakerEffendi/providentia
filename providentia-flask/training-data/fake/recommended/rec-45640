GOOD LORD!!!!  this  place is GOOD!!!!!  OK calm down!!!!  Deep breaths!!!  alright first of all upon entering this place it is once again a fire hazzard :(  but cozy.  The fries are freshly made and you have the choice of about 20 different sauces to try from. My girlfriend and I ordered the irish curry, wasabi mayo and one thats called the war sauce.  It contains a mixture of onions, peanut satay and frite sauce.   The irish curry was your typical curry.  It was ok but it wasnt a WOW with the fries.  The wasabi mayo on the other hand was great and with a kick it would knock you off your feet.  The war sauce was also great with a peanut oil base and onions it brought the flavor out of the fries.   My favorite was the wasabi mayo but i still didnt try all of them so i dont know which is the best.  The fries are great and are made by pinoy pride and are of high quality.  Crispy and flavorfull.   The prices are good and of course i just wish the sauces were free. Overall very good place. HELL one of the best places to go in NY. GO NOW!!!!!
