With doubt this is a delicious and satisfying restaurant. Although I do not like a lot their pickled vegetables,  I think this a great restaurant . Lat time I had  Portuguese rice, salad, fried, and chicken ribs. It was really yummy.  I could see all dishes  were cooked perfectly.  I would recommend you guys to eat your fries   in there, unless  you wanna lose a crispy original sensation! .  My only complaint is about parking , I  think  the park lot is kinda small.
