ok so i read about this place for months, saw the review on time out ny on demand, heard all my friends talk about the cornication there. so i went on a friday night at about 9pm and waited over an hour outside for this corn. ok...the corn is amazing, but the rest of the menu isn't that tasty. i'd probably come back but only during the afternoon and only for the corn. it's cornicopia baby!
