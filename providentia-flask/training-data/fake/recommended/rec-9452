Great decor.  Great menu.  Over priced.  Dishes are way too big.  I would come back.  In fact we were here for lunch.  Then randomly we were meeting friends for dinner and they chose the same place! We didn't complain. Had chicken and yucca -very juicy chicken.  Half a chicken for lunch with salad and yucca was $22.  Too expensive.  But very good. Also had aji de gallina; big enough to share. It was good.  Chicken could have been more thinly shredded and softer.  I would order it again. Green sauce on the side was delicious but a bit too spicy and I like spice. I ordered on the second occasion arroz con mariscos;  $30, too much money and too much food, only ate half of it.   Dessert was tres leches, so good!   Chilcanos with pisco were good as drinks. They should cut the prices by $5 across the board and make dishes 25
