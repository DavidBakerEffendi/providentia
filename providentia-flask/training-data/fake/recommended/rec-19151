Best place when you're hungry NOW and craving Korean grub!  Hot and usually pretty good buffet, and I guess they're open 24/7 ???  Food's a bit on the greasy side but what can you expect from a 24-hour a day buffet?  That they always have a few different kinds of jeon, and jap chae, on hand earns a bonus point from me.
