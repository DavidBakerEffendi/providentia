This place is seriously awesome. Sure, the Indian guy at the counter didn't really speak English. Sure, it's vegetarian dishes only. But after I was halfway through my lunch, I forgot my usual meat craving. The daal and saag paneer here are both fantastic. I wish I got 2 helpings on the daal, because I could eat it forever. I also had some type of chole mixed with some other vegetables, which wasn't quite as good as the others. I washed it all down with a bottle of mango lassi. The mango lassi isn't as good as freshly made mango lassi, but it was still decent. Plus, I'm a sucker for a mango lassi, so who am I to complain? All in all, a great hole-in-the-wall local Indian joint with fantastic vegetarian fare.
