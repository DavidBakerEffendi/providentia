This is my favorite restaurant.  The food is five-star caliber at neighborhood prices.  The wine list is both broad and deep.  The chef worked at Danielle and Cafe Bouloud and just wanted his own place.  The manager worked at Prime Meats and is super-welcoming.  The staff are all-stars of the industry and just make you feel good to eat there.  The design and decor are aesthetically superlative.  The atmosphere is upbeat and welcoming.  And the last time I was there I saw Michelle Williams and Jake Gyllenhaal on a date!
