I went with some friends for breakfast/lunch today and am so happy that the quality is as fantastic as it ever was. The Apple Pancake, French Toast, Eggs & all the rest of the food got an A+ from everyone! Â  Dimitri certainly has maintained and even improved the quality of service and presentation his parents started back in 1991. Emily was a terrific waitress. No doubt about it, this is one of the smartest and best places to eat within miles.
