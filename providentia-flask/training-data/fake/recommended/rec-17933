This is a great place, probably one of the best sit-in/take-out Chinese restaurants I've been too! I ended up here, because a friend heard about it from another friend, and we wanted to try it out... To start off, the staff was very nice and on top of everything the whole time. You begin with free green tea and wonton chips and duck sauce for the table. The menu has many options, so we started with the steamed vegetable dumplings as an app. and these are the best I ever had. They were huge, doughy and had a "homemade" taste. Next for out entree, we ordered the Chinese with Cashew and Chicken with Chinese Veggies. Both again, very tasty! Also the amount of food that was served was enough to bring home for the following day! You defiantly get your money's worth (even though this place is priced just right). Can wait to go back to try more things! I highly recommend you try, and tell your friends!
