Came here earlier today around 2:30pm with my husband and 4 friends, we were seated immediately. The service was fast and the food was as good as I expected. I've been to the one in Los Angeles, and was a little surprised that the menu was slightly different ( I wanted Bulgogi with glass noodles but it wasn't an option ) but I was not disappointed. My husband and I both ordered Bulgogi Jeongsik lunch special (which was $17 each, and it came with the tofu soup, Bulgogi and numerous sides including the fish) and everything tasted great. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants great food and service.
