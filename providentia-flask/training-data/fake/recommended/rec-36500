The restaurant looked excellent - decor was grand for a smaller restaurant - 5  The place was packed, but there didn't have to wait for very long - 5  The menu was far from being expensive - 5  And the food was very good: Pad Thai - Not comparable to the Pad Thai in Thailand, but it was definitely very very good. Penang Curry Beef - Beef was a bit on the rougher end, but the curry was awesome. I don't typically eat very spicy food, so the mild curry (strong coconut taste) was perfect for my taste buds Spicy Basil Chicken - Again, not spicy, but not overly spicy to drown out the flavors and the taste of basil was basically infused into the chicken.   Food - 4.5 So where's the knock...I went home and found myself drinking tons and tons of water.  There must have been a good amount of MSG in there, but nonetheless...if the food tastes good, I can overlook how they actually flavor it.
