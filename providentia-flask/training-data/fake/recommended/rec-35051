Where do I begin. . . I would normally rate their wonderful food but this place goes way beyond that.  This is a family joint run, with great service.  The kitchen is run by dad and the dining area is run Mama and Aliyah (daughter).  I walked in a few mins late and was instantly greeted by the super sweet and cute Aliyah w in a few seconds I had a menu in hand and mama rubbing my back.  What service.  All in all Meal was great, portions were large, price was reasonable. This is Thai at its finest.
