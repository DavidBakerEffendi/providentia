Hype is real. Food here is amazing. The wait is alright but totally worth it. Best halal food i had. The flavors are amazing. Other halal street vendors can't compare to these guys. And take caution, as the hot sauce is extremely hot. I had to get a lot of white sauce to satisfy the fierce hot sauce. The price and portions are amazing.
