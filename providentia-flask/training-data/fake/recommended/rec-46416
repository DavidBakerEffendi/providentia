I understand I am the minority here but this place is amazing in how it retained its reputation. I see reviews that say this place has its ons and offs. The way I see it, Totto ramen is a genuine copycat of every single menu they serve here. Genuine but not great on any day of the week. Ramens they serve here have imitated taste and "too much" msg. The incredibly salty and overpowering creaminess you taste during and after is the result of it. You'll find yourself craving iced caramel macciato (venti) towards the end of your meal. 30 min wait seems a shorter than avg waiting agony reading the reviews and hearing from friends and colleagues. But this place does not even deserve a 30 minute wait at worst. To their credit, avo tuna was the descent dish of the 5 we tried here. I am an avid ramen fan (korean or japanese) and I am never returning here. To those who compared this place to ippudo, pfft, idk what you were on. Too much msg, maybe?
