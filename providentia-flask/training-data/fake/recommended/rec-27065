Great food, VERY professional / pleasant service, cozy 1880's atmosphere with working fireplace ( in winter, of course), reasonable pricing to portionns ration. Neat casual dinner, business professional, family gathering event all are welcomed. Â What's not to like? Adding to the value, they accept RESTAURANT.COM. This combination is a real winner! GO! You'll be glad you did ...
