I will say I had high expectations heading over to meet a friend who consistently exceeds expecations but this place owned me the moment I walked it. The place was a little empty at 6pm but the bartender James welcomed us with engaging conversation and chatter about a recent story in the post about a bad reviewed property and how that isn't the way to engage with your consumers. Moving on to dinner we had some of the best tasting chicken with mashed potatoes I've had since I was in the south. I'd return in a second and will reccomend constantly .
