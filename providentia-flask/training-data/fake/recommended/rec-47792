I've only had Pepe's pizza once- and this was simply because Modern was closed.  Over the last two weeks I have tried to order take out, only to be told it would be upwards of 2 hours before I could retrieve my pie.  Understandably, the first time I called was around 7:45, but a call at 5:30 still didn't get me a pizza until 8pm???  I got a little annoyed with the woman answering the phone and let her know I wouldn't be calling again.  However, if you're that swamped, I don't think I posed much of a threat!  Ended up picking up a perfectly tasty pie from Est Est Est in 15 minutes. Moral of the story-don't try to order pizza in a pizza town on a Monday when almost every great pizza place is closed.
