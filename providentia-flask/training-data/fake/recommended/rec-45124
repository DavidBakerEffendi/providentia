To be honest, I have no idea how this place is so highly rated. I waited over a half hour now for my food and the coffee is absolutely terrible. There are people who came in after me -like 20 minutes after me- who were served before me. I ordered the creamed chipped beef. I was surprised to see it was not served on the toast. That would be ok, except the toast was heavily buttered. The result is, of course, that the dish becomes to salty from the butter. And that is ignoring the fact that I am now eating cream with butter. The home fries were pretty good, but I wish there were more. I was never offered water. Â The whole experience was just disappointing. There is really no reason for me to come back, not with better options right on Main Street.
