The food and drinks are great and the price you're paying for them is even better. The staff isn't really friendly but I guess you can't really win all of the battles. Most prices are $8 and drinks are $10. The outdoor patio is extremely cute and romantic. I will be coming back to this place and I highly suggest the pomegranate mojito (it's one of the best I've ever had). And they are no longer cash only, they accept everything but Amex.
