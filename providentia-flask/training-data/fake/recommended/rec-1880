Stuck in Philly for a night. First agenda was try a philly cheese sandwich. I've heard of Geno's from travel channel and since that was the only one that popped up on yelp we decided to check it out. Since it was my first philly cheese sandwich in Philly I had nothing to compared to. The sandwich and fries were good. Had to try the cheese wiz and I was a fan. It was a pricey meal though. Next day, walked around downtown and came upon Lou's Philly Cheese Steaks. This beats Geno's! Lou was such a charmer and the food was delicious. Super cheap and super filling!
