My husband and I brought a friends that had stayed over here for brunch one morning when we may have been just a little bit hungover. I had the shame benedict - and I am not ashamed! For me, you could pour hollandaise on just about anything and I'd eat it. Scrapple is also my favorite of all the breakfast meats, so this is the dream. This for brunch, along with the 2 or 3 mimosas I had along with it saved the day for me. My husband got the hangover bowl which was full of polenta, bacon, maple syrup and some other stuff. I tried it, and it was truly overwhelmingly sweet. LIke, way to much maple syrup, not Â enough savory. He was also frequenting the build your own bloody mary bar, a concept which he loved. I hear this place has a good trivia night, so I would go back to try that.
