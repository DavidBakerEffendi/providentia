I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by Ulivo. Having great Italian food next door to us, it's hard to try a new Italian place, but we heard good things about this place. We got reservations relatively easily (I think because of the holiday weekend) and sat down to a lovely atmosphere. Our waitress (can't remember her name, but she had pink hair). Was very nice, attentive, and knowledgeable. For appetizers we ordered the buffalo mozzarella and the prosciutto dish. Both were fantastic, but we preferred the mozzarella. It was extremely fresh and the flavors paired well together. We both ordered pasta for the main meal. He ordered the gnocchi (supposedly some of the best around) and I ordered the special. Mine was the clear winner. It was a rigatoni with a brown butter and sweet corn sauce with chanterelle mushrooms. I could have eaten 3 servings of that. The gnocchi was good as well, but couldn't compare to how fantastic my dish was. For dessert we shared a blueberry cake with a coconut crème. The cake tasted like a blueberry muffin (in a good way!) and I think I could have drank a cup of that coconut crème. Overall we had a very nice meal and it was pretty affordable as well. I think if we had gone for "main" dishes, we would have spent a bit more, but we are pasta people to begin with.
