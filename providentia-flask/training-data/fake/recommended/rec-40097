Went for a work party- my colleagues are a conscientious bunch, so IMO, we are good customers to have.  Bar staff was not that friendly, which I don't understand for a crew that is polite and tips well.   It's a cool place because it is so old, but it takes a bit more than that for me to give more stars. I'll go again, but only if I don't have a say in the matter.
