Not  a huge brunch selection and not super well balanced but the salmon benedict with yuzu hollondaise and the quinoa hash browns were unique and delicious.  nice daytime spot as well as eve.  Good job! Footnote: need more of a diverse, traditional yet interesting brunch selection.  Again, very good but not exceptional!
