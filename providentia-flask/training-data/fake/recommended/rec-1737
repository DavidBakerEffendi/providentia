Have only had the salted caramel budino, which my friend and I grabbed to go.  It was incredibly rich, and very well balanced in terms of salty and sweet.  Intense caramel flavor too.  I don't have much to compare it to, but thought it blew the butterscotch budino at Mario Batali's Pizzeria Mozza out of the water.
