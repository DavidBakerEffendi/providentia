Got here at 10am and it easily became a 1 hour wait. The wait was worth it as the blueberry pancakes were a hit and the warm maple butter, a bigger hit! I actually ran out of it and tried to ask for more. To my dismay, it was a hefty $2 extra for such a small amount. The biggest hitter of them all, though, was the sugar cured bacon! I had no idea what that was going to taste like, and don't get the wrong idea, but I like to think that my tongue is an adventurist, so I had to order it. Usually an anti-baconist, I fell in deep love with their bacon!!! I would go back just to get that, alone! To go, of course... =)
