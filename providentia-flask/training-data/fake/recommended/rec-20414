i will admit it. i am a foodie. and market table fits the bill. again, when i used to work in the WV, i would pass by this place all the time - which i why i held off on eating there for so long. (seeing a place 6:30AM in the morning somewhat loses its splendor.) also, the times i TRIED to make a reservation were impossible - for example, 2:30PM for thanksgiving "dinner." nonetheless, after a perfect day of strolling and shopping in brooklyn and manhattan, we were ready for a nice, leisurely dinner to commemorate the lovely day as well as the long weekend. the restaurant was filled with people but the hostess was able to seat us in the front with no wait. thanks to the smart recos we received from our servers, we ordered calamari and fries to start; pork tenderloin, hanger steak, halibut and risotto for entrees; and bellinis for drinks. all inventive and delicious. the dishes were american classics that had a bit of a twist to them (e.g. the steak had been marinated in sangria, the risotto was prepared with strawberries). no dessert - my friends picked-up some sweet revenge cupcakes beforehand. i wish i could eat like this every day. however, if that were to happen, i'd be as big as a blimp and have to live in my closet since i'd have no money.
