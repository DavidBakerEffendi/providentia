This is a new restaurant and it looks fabulous.  It is rare that the decor of a restaurant  is so special. Even the dishware Is memorable black and red lacquer boxes. The food is excellent,perfectly prepared and presented. The lunch special is also nicely priced. I will be returning to Mint and bringing friends with me.
