We've been here a couple of times.  Recently made the mistake of sitting at the bar on a Saturday night, but that was our mistake.  I love their bone marrow, pig tails, and chicken fried steak.  It is a casual low key environment and they play great music.  The staff are friendly and make a pretty good cocktail. A solid choice for a casual night.
