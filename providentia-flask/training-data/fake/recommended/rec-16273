i came here for dinner and had a great meal.  the ambiance is cool and trendy - surprising for sunnyside.  the complimentary bacon infused popcorn was a great treat.  but make sure not to fill up on it.  1st dish was the crispy berkshire pork trotter.  i was very surprised when the plate came out.  it was almost like a fried pork patty that you just picked off with your fork.  the egg was a bit too runny and did not help the fried pork feel less salty.  2nd dish was a pork belly bun with pate.  this was pretty tasty and the pate wasn't too strong.  3rd dish was the hanger steak.  the steak was very well cooked and had great flavor.  the steak sides were a bit lacking and did not complement the meat well.  4th dish was the long island duck breast.  duck was cooked well, but the frisee was too charred to eat.  overall, i was satisfied with the meal, but i think we could've ordered just 3 dishes bc 4 was just too much.  next time i go, i definitely want to hit up the korean bbq wraps bc other tables had it and it looked good.
