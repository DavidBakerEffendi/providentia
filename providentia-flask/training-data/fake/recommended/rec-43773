Oh, Tia Pol, how I love thee!  The ingredients are always fresh and delicious!  The variety of tapas is perfect for food-lovers who like to try a bit of everything.  I always get the patatas bravas, croquettes, artichoke salad, and blistered peppers with sea salt.  They lamb skewers are also to die for and so is the chorizo.  A friend who I dined with doesn't eat meat and another friend doesn't eat carbs, but there were delicious dishes for all of us at Tia Pol!
