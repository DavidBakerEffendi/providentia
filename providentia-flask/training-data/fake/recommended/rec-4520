The food is mediocre at best, service is spotty and nothing great about the ambience. Been there twice so far and have to conclude it is rather average. Have had the chicken shawarma sandwich, tasted more like lamb. Wouldn't call it good, wouldn't label it bad. Not enough to go back a third time. I think I got the falafel sandwich the last time, felt the same way then as well. Husbi got the Ful Mudammas, the amount of raw garlic in there is off the charts...it burned my tongue!!! We looove baklava, even tried to make it at home, when we got it the last time, I was so disappointed, it tasted old and stale. Have had better
