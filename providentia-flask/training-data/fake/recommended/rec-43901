Love the dinner vibe here!   The decor is cozy and a little romantic.  Also, everyone was very friendly and attentive to our needs. After taking one bite of an item on the snack menu I realized I didn't like it, not because it tasted bad, but because it wasn't what I expected. Without me saying anything the waiter took it away and told me he'd taken it off the bill....talk about great customer service.  The food was good too :). PS my date loved the cauliflower.
