My favorite red sauce Italian in the city (and it's not just because it's around the corner from me).  It's crowded and loud, but in this case, that's a good thing.  The owner picks his ingredients fresh every day.  The end result is love on a plate.  The meatballs are massive.  The sauce is perfect.  And the menu is extensive.  The house red goes down smoothly too.  Make a reservation. Just not on Monday because they're closed.  I suppose they deserve a day off.  Enjoy.
