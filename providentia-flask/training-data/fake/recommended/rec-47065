I haven't been here in about two and a half years but never forgot about it ...which should tell you something! It was one of the best omelet and home fry breakfasts i've ever had. Â The home fries were spiced, cooked perfectly and the decor was retro and very old school coffee shop. I wish I had an excuse to go to Hartford just for Mo's!
