Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had! My mom and I had heard amazing things about the food here so we decided to split two dishes to maximize the experience, and boy am I glad we did! We got the famous blueberry pancakes, which absolutely 100% lived up to the hype as did the heavenly warm maple butter, the Spanish Scramble, which was delicious in every way (we switched out the toast for a biscuit which I would highly suggest as it was one of the best I've ever had!) and a side of sugar-cured bacon, which is also worthy of the buzz. We had about an hour and a half wait, but we used the time to explore the neighborhood and walk down to the river so the time flew by! We got back to Clinton St about 15 minutes before when they said we would have a table and in 14 minutes our name was called! The staff was wonderful and attentive and the atmosphere was cheery and lovely. Our food arrived not long after ordering and we made sure we took time to enjoy every last bite. Anyone looking for a fantastic breakfast experience in New York needs to make Clinton St Baking Company their first stop! It was a highlight of our two-week trip.
