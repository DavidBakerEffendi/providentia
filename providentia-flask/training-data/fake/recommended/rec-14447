1.5 hrs turned into almost 2.5 hrs of waiting, so they gave us some free pork sliders w marinara. Buns were soft and a little bit sweet. Later they started bringing out peanuts for other waiting customers. We were able to snag 3 seats at the bar, we took them so we could finally sit and take our names off the list for the next group. Not sure if this was the best idea--bartender was not a waiter and did not seem happy to have to serve us. For our meal my boyfriend and I shared the hoagie w beef, mushroom, and provolone on wheat bread. The bread was a little burnt which left a bad taste in my mouth, so I tore the worst parts off. It was really cheesy and good aside from the bread. The sandwich came with a nice arugla and apples salad.  We also had the risotto of the day, chanterelle mushrooms and English peas. First bite reminded me up tuna helper cuz of the peas :/ it was ok, but not great. Only had like 3 mushrooms.  Theresa X only ordered a couple of sliders. She gave me half of her pork slider w parmesan cream cuz she felt it was too salty. Pretty good. Overall it was decent. As a visitor to NY, it's cool to go to these types of fad 1 item restaurants and experience them. Plus it wasn't too expensive-$30 for 2 meals and 1 sweet tea (which was disgustingly sweet not a strong brew, skip it). Now I can say I've tried it and there's no need to go back.
