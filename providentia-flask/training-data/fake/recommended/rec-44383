The food is consistently excellent, which is an accomplishment is a town full of discerning foodies. The ambiance is posh, the drinks are interesting and the staff is very professional.  Beware to bring your ID though, especially if you meet the one uber diligent liquor laws enforcer. This waitress declined to serve my grown up looking friend ONE drink (even though we were there for a special occasion).  I realize this is a college town with lots of fake IDs floating around, but it seems illogical to expect people dropping $200 on a dinner to be underage drunkard-wanna-bes.
