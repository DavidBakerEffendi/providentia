The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because I could never afford this for anything other than a special occasion dinner. Besides that, nothing but love for this place!  The interior was cute - check out the cards on the ceiling!  The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive, and when they were out of the first two wines we tried to order the manager came over to personally apologize and recommended another wonderful wine in it's place.  The duck confit was perfectly cooked, I could have eaten it with a spoon!  The roasted beet salad was delicious although I've had better.  And finally the pot du creme and creme brulee were superb. Would definitely recommend if you've got the cash...
