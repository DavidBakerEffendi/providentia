Visited Philly for business and my corworker wanted to go someplace to get her first authentic Philly Cheesesteak.  Thanks to Yelp for helping us find Chickie and Pete's.  Went to the location near the stadium and it was only about 15 min from the airport at lunchtime.   I am sure that it is a neat bar scene when it is gametime.  Pretty dead at 2pm on a weekeday! They brag about the "crab fries" and we just didn't get all the hype.  They were fries that had some crab boil seasoning shook on them.  TOOOOOOOOO  Salty.  But the cheese dip that came with them was amazing! The cheesesteaks here are good, but I don't have much of a base to compare them too.  If trying to eat healthy for the new year, avoid this place.  Absolutely nothing healthy on the entire menu.
