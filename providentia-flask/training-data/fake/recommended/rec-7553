As it turns out I ended up spending more time in this area due to work so I have now been a repeat visitor to Johnny Brendas for beer, shows and food several times, and thought I'd update my previous review.   Both the beer and the musical show selection continue to be mighty good.  The upstairs is where I like to be for shows. Cool architecture,  nice candlelight atmosphere, windows you can peek out of the curtains through between bands and see what's happening on the street, pretty lights going through clouds of incense fog when the band is playing, and the cutest little bar that doesn't get crowded because it's not to sit at or hang out at, it's basically to buy your very good beer and step away.   On the downstairs floor of the show area, there is also a little lounge room with a photo booth to play in and some couches to plotz on, as well as a painting of some unidentified potato-shaped object on the wall. We also had pre-show dinner here in the seated dinner room away from the bar.  Lots of cool booths with colored lights built into the tables, and a couple booths in little bead-curtained niches that looked like an opium den.  The service was awright, especially considering it was jammed with hipsters and very noisy.  The food was OK.  I think I had ribs.  I will probably stick to sandwiches in the future though.   This place is still a long drive from downtown and an even longer drive from west of Philly, where I'm usually coming from, and they could definitely use more and better parking near the Johnny Brenda's block which also has 2 or 3 other restaurants and bars around it now.  Still easier to find a close place here than at the North Star Bar, though.  Despite the long drive and parking hassles, this bar still has the best beer selection of any Philly music venue I've attended, and I'll probably keep dropping by a few times a year.
