The mac & cheese made me want to punch myself in the face so hard that I'd throw up from the pain just so I'd have more room to eat more. Once this location opens up for brunch again - I am in trouble. Not only will I gain weight, but my face will never look the same again after all the bruises and broken bones I give myself. To the person that posted the violations... I appreciate that, but I am going to not read it fully because I can't have anything ruin this for me! I will naively pretend that they have since took care of all those violations...
