I have never had a bad experience at the Omega diner.  They are always good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The bagels there are amazing. My meal of choice is a bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel along with corned beef hash.  If I don't get a breakfast sandwich for breakfast then I get an omlette. The chicken gyros are amazing. The tables aren't on top of each other and there is plenty of room so you don't feel like you're on top of anyone. For an area that doesn't really have a diner around, this is just the thing North Brunswick needs.
