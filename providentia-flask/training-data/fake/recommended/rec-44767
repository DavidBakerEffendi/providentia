I dined here last night with 2 of my brothers and I've never felt so compelled to write a review! Not only was the food amazing but the service was impeccable. When we arrived for our 930 resv our table was running behind, but Theresa the ma√Ætre di accommodated us by having seats waiting at the bar. We started there and then moved to a table eventually, the whole time being waited on by the nicest people. Now for the food, wow. Everything we got was delicious, the soft shell crab was probably my favorite but the meatball sliders were also amazing! For entrees - We all got something different, the halibut, the pork chop, and the lamb, all were delicious and cooked perfectly. I Will definitely be back and will recommend!!
