Milk & Honey opened a few months ago and is owned by the same folks behind Qathra on Cortelyou. This new spot is absolutely beautiful with live edge counters and a "living wall." The atmosphere is really nice and relaxing -- including free WiFi. That said, I don't find the seating very comfortable and there are only a few chairs amongst stools. But on to the important part: excellent coffee (they brew CounterCulture) and decadent pastries. I haven't had a lunch sandwich here but I have tried a number of pastries -- all great -- and the egg sandwich as well as an omelette. All very tasty and reasonable priced. And since it is around the corner from my house, I will be coming more often.
