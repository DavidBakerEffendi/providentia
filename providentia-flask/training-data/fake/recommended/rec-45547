Mo Glo is the best diner in Philadelphia.  Take it from two people who are from the Midwest and are obsessed with diner food.  My husband and I are regulars - we used to live around the corner so one might just assume it was a matter of convenience, but even now that we do not live in Bella Vista, we visit as often as possible.  We've tried the other places (Sabrina's, Honey's, Green Eggs, etc) and, for us, nothing else comes close.  The biscuits are the best I've ever eaten - crunchy on top, moist in the middle and just a tiny bit salty.  I love their pancake specials and am usually lured in - they are thick and fluffy, never greasy or flat.  My husband usually orders some kind of meat and eggs with a biscuit and side salad (the homemade dressing is amazing) but occasionally will branch out for a special such as biscuits and gravy (not to be missed!) Please understand, this place is a diner - it's small.  Don't arrive after 10am on the weekend and expect to be seated quickly.  That being said, even when I've waited in the cold or rain, I've always thought it was worth the wait.
