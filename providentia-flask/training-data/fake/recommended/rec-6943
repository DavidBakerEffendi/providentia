I have ordered a few times from Mannino's, and I have yet to be impressed.  I've tasted their standard pizza, tomato, and margherita pies, and struggled to find any flavor in all three.  It wasn't terrible, and I may be a tad critical.   I would have just expected a little better from a restaurant that pictures pizza pies all over the cover of their menu.  I will definintely try again based on the other reviews here.
