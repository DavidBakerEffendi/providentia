IN SHORT: Doubtlessly one of Princeton's best restaurants, Blue Point serves up some of the freshest fish in town. While reservations are necessary to get into this small space on the weekends, it will always be worth the effort. THE STORY: Blue Point prides itself on printing its menu daily, showcasing the freshest selection of seafood available in Princeton. Each fish entree is prepared exceptionally simply, typically just saut√©ed in a lemon butter sauce and served with a side of vegetables. Don't miss out on their Garlic Smashed Potatoes, a thick, creamy, and slightly chunky starchy addition to any fish. While it's often hard to choose from a list of 20-30 different types of fish, Blue Point helps the undecided by offering a nightly special Mixed Grill, which includes two small servings of bright and balanced fish. On my most recent visit, I was surprised with perfectly cooked Atlantic Salmon and Nova Scotia Halibut, which I desperately wanted to last forever. As a JM Group restaurant, great service is to be expected, and you'll often see servers engaging in comfortable conversation with some regular customers. During Princeton University Restaurant Week though, waiters tend to get a little less amiable, clearly frustrated at the excessive number of undertipping college students. Other than that single isolated week, however, Blue Point Grill is a warm, welcoming, albeit expensive place to share an elegant meal.
