Wall St. has my favorite pizza in New Haven. Forget Pepe's, I want Wall St. It's not just the convenient location or the cheap slice that attracts me. The crust is thin and just crunchy enough and the sauce is not all sweet and weird like most pizza. I almost always go classic with a slice of cheese with pepper. Â It's a nice casual place to grab a slice. Only downside is that they close early.
