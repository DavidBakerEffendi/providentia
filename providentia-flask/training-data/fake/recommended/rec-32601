This place is awesome.  I love the selection they have for breakfast.  Pumpkin waffles and nutella french toast, how can you go wrong with that?! Both were so yummy, although I thoroughly enjoyed my nutella french toast and then some...the rest of my friends enjoyed their plates too along with the fresh yogurt and fruit sides we had. One downside, is that, this place is quite popular, so the wait can be pretty long if you don't go early! So go early! Or wait, which they don't have much of a waiting area either, but at least they serve you coffee there.  This place is cute too! I haven't been here for the lunch or dinner hours, but the breakfast hour here, definitely does it for me, so 4 stars to that!
