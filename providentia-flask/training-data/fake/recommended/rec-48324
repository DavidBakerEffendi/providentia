My boyfriend took me here in December for a nice, romantic dinner.  The restaurant was beautiful, the staff was great, and the food was delicious. HOWEVER, it was so loud we could barely carry on a conversation.  And even though we had a reservation, we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Fortunately there's a tiny little bar next door where we could get a cheap drink while we waited.  The hostess was nice enough to take down our cell number and call us when our table was ready.  I would gladly give Rye more than three stars, but the noise level was really a mood killer for me.
