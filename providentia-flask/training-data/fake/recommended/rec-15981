Solid spot that ending up also being quite affordable for a group of 7. We made reservations awhile ago and were lucky to get one of the booths, so we were seated comfortably. There's not a ton of space here. Service was good, although they did forget to bring one of our dishes, but made up for that and the wait time with a free pitcher of sangria. The skirt steak and pork shoulder specials were the standouts of the meal. As for regular menu items, the shrimp and fried chickpeas were delicious. Good food, easy on the wallet - but definitely a cramped space.
