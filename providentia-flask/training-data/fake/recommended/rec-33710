Jack the Horse Tavern has been nothing but spectacular for us.  We are always treated well, the food is delicious and Tim the Owner/Chef always comes out and talks with his customers.  The wait staff is great - very attentive.  It's definitely not a stuffy place as one reviewer has remarked.  With its wonderful decor like the tin ceilings, fluffy pillows and brick walls, Jack the Horse Tavern has definitely kept the charm of the neighborhood.  As with any restaurant in the beginning kinks have to be worked out.  They take criticism well and are genuinely concerned about their customers' experience.
