I have to give Uva 5 stars. We came to UVA on my birthday, so I was very much hoping for an amazing dinner. Uva did not disappoint. We had made reservations in advance, but the restaurant was still packed (a good sign!), so we made friends with the hostess, and eventually were able to sit at a lounge table in the bar area. Soon enough we were called to our table. Our server was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was so comfortable and welcoming. While we ordered several items, by far my absolute favorite was the Gnocchi di Ricotta. This seriously was the best gnocchi I have *ever had. Highly, highly recommend - and I cannot wait to make a trip back down to the city!
