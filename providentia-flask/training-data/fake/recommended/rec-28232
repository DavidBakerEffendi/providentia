This place is legit.  I can't believe we stumbled upon this small restaurant on our trip to NY.  Tucked away on a corner street surrounded by apartments, was this place.  The decor had a comfort vibe to it, and the servers were really down to earth.  They told us to get the Cuban sandwich and corn.  Those were their 2 famous dishes that people always get.  The Cuban was cooked to perfection, better than Porto's in LA, and the corn was melt in your mouth tasty.  I can't believe the price as well.  I noticed next door was their main restaurant that was a sit down.  We were drunk and wanted something to eat asap so we took the quick route.  I would come back for sure when I go back to NY.  Thanks for being open late!
