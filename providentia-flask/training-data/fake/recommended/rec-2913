VEGAN FRIENDLY.  They know how to scramble a tofu and the red flannel hash is delicious.  There are so many options for those who don't partake in animal product assumption.  I have had the coconut club, which is amazing and I highly recommend it.  I've also had the fried pickles and the suicide rings, which were ok.  The suicide rings were kind of limp and the sauce was too thick to actually dip them in it. Beware, if you ask for beer recommendations they will only suggest the most expensive options, and the most expensive at the Memphis Tap is excessively expensive, imo.
