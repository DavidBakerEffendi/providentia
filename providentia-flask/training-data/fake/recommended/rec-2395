Though I made it a point to walk more than ten blocks to this landmark, deep in the heart of the Italian quarter of the city, it certainly was not worth the walk, or the freezing cold. Geno's has been around for ten decades, and is a philadelphia tradition, and being the tourist I am I had to try the infamous Philly Cheesesteak.   Well, this place is very cut and dry.  You have a choice of cheesesteak with cheese, or without, curly or no curly fries, and a soft drink.  The ribeye, in my humble opinion, was too greasy, tasted very bland (basically it tasted like the day old grease it was fried in - along with the greasy greasy onions) and I had to use the ketchup liberally to choke half of it down. well, i was very hungy, so perhaps that is why i was able to eat more than half. there is no seating inside, so advisably i would not go if it is very cold, or steaming hot outside.  The tables are covered with photographs of celebrities, famous personages that have been past and present patrons of Geno's.  Perhaps it's due to me being used to the southwestern style of  cooking, with a lot of flavor and spice, that I was not quite so taken, or perhaps everybody that lines up around the block to eat here is wrong, and I am the only one that has any tastebuds.
