Delicious, Cheap, Filling and Fast. Easy to get to from the Prudential Arena (Green at McWhorter St) and Ferry Street/Ironbound area. The rotisserie chicken, rice and beans were very, very good for all around $6. Bring your own water if you are on a budget because they will only offer bottled water, not tap. One of the best bargains and eats in Newark for sure.
