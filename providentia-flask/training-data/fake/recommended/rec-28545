I appreciate the ethics of this place. In a lot of ways its right on. But every time Ive come Ive been grossly underwhelmed with the food. Todays breakfast bacon was so overcooked and cold it lost all the amazing deliciousness of the happy pigs it was made from. What a waste! They should put more effort into the taste of the food than marketing. With such great ingredients it shouldn't be hard to make yummy fabulous food.
