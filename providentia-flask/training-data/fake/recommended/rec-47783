Went there last night for a quick shabu fix. -Waited 45 minutes to get a seat - should have read the yelp reviews ahead of time and saw all the recommendations for calling ahead. -When seated we were by the door and there was a constant draft. Also lots of people looming around us which was slightly uncomfortable -Servers were nice, but hard to get there attention because we were in the front corner surrounded by people waiting for a table -Not impressed by their Shabu. Didn't realize until after ordering that if I wanted flavored soup i should have gone with nabe. We cooked our food in boiling hot water that turned into soup that I could have made at home. -Didn't like the sauces, the ponzu was too sour and the other was peanut sauce. I prefer Chinese-style hotpot where you get to add a bunch of stuff to your sauce like garlic and hot sauce -Meat portions were decent, but my BF and I dropped $52 for the prime rib and we still had to order an appetizer and side of pork in order to even feel remotely full. Even then I could have eaten more. - All in all, spent 100$ on a meal that was so-so. That's also super expensive for hot pot in my opinion. I realize i probably should have ordered something else, but this meal wasn't extraordinary for the price I paid. Wouldn't come back, there are plenty of hot pot options around the city (Hakata ton ton cost less and was so much better!)
