I have to preface this with the acknowledgement that I am not a big fan of Mediterranean food. That being said, I can't really make any comparisons between Olea and other local Mediterranean places since I usually stay far away from any place with goat cheese on their menu. I live close by to Olea and have gone to the Brooklyn flea market several times which is right across the street. After seeing the lines outside of this place on weekends my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. This has become our go-to place for brunch. We usually show up around 12 or 1 and end up waiting for 30 minutes or so, but it's worth it. Here's what we get: 1) I always drink their orange juice. I'm not sure if it's fresh squeezed but it certainly tastes like it. Lovely. My gf sometimes gets their mimosas which are good. 2) We split an order of their chocolate croissants ($3.50). These are so delicious: warm, flaky and gooey in the center. I always feel a bit guilty eating them but they're wonderful 3) I'm someone who finds something they like and sticks with it. I almost always get their Savory Parmesan French Toast Topped with poached eggs, peas, scallions, pea shoots and avgolemono sauce ($12). Its a great meal, sauce is rich but not too heavy and mixes well with the egg yolk from the poached egg. The peas are tender and plentiful, your plate has enough green on it to make you feel somewhat healthy. The presentation of this is really great, I feel like I'm eating at a fancy place without having to pay high prices. I've also had their polenta and eggs which is great, as are their homefries. My gf usually gets their lox bagel which she really enjoys. All in all this is a great place. The ambiance inside is wonderful, it has a nice rustic, open feel to it. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch.
