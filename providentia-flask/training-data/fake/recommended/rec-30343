I glanced over the yelp reviews I've written in the past, and I noticed I have a tendency to only write negative reviews.  Since I'm such a Scrooge apparently, I decided to think of a place I'd give 10 STARS to if I could.  Buster's is the FIRST place that popped up in my mind.  Yes, Ebenezer over here LOVES this place.  It's not fancy at all (not great for a date) but it's by far the restaurant with the freshest, healthiest, and most well thought out menu.  It's clear that a true chef works here and pays attention to every detail.  I guarantee anything you order will be fresh and delicious, especially the daily specials.  Also, when I order something for pick-up, they always include fresh cookies or fruit...it's a nice touch.  Buster's should be your neighborhood go-to spot.
