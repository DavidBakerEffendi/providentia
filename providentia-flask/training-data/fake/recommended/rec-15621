THIS PLACE ROCKS MY WORLD In the past 10 days I have been here three times, and that says a lot because I rarely travel to Brooklyn and I live quite far from Champs! The food is so good and the service is amazing! You get so much for such a great price! My friend and I went and each spent $20, we both had sandwiches, salad, french fries, mozzarella sticks, pancakes AND ice cream. The mozzarella sticks and pesto chicken sandwich are my favorites on the menu, the pancakes are some of the best I have ever had. The only thing missing that I didn't spot on the menu is mac and cheese, I imagine it would be perfection from this place. This restaurant is definitely in my top 5 favorite restaurants in NYC! A definite MUST GO
