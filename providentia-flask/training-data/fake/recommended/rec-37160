Had a groupon, and unlike other places they didn't put less effort in to customer service because we had the groupon. Cute worker was amazingly attentive! We had a wine tasting Groupon that came with 4 wines, 4 cheeses, fruit, bread, and chutney. OMG everything tasted amazing. The night we went, there were two musicians practicing . The candles were light. The ambiance is so serene, welcoming, and beautiful. My mom, sister, and I enjoyed this place SO much. When I return home, I will visit this gem on several occassions. Mind you, I don't live close at all, but it's worth the trip. This place is perfect for a date, friends, family, or an individual. SO versatile & inviting! Please support this AMAZING establishment!!!!!!!
