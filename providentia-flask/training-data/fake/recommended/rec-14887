JB's may seem like the birthplace for Philly hipsters, not counting Benjamin F., but it's a wonderful place for everyone. Ol' Ben would be a fixture here if a time portal opened. I've had the full JB's experience: - Ignite Philly (several times) upstairs - from the floor, from the balcony. - Bands aplenty. - Holding down the bar top for several hours on a busy Saturday night. - Lunch with friends/dates, daytime drinking, brunch, etc. in the expansion dining area. And I don't even live in Fishtown or N.Lib. I think one of my favorite attributes about this place is versatility, as you can see from above. In the downstairs area, you can have any light level you want -- Semi-dim in the main bar area, bright window in the back dining area if you want to see your companion's face, or midnight in the garden of good and under the stairs. There's outdoor seating on Girard, people watching by the barrel, awesome sculptured bike parking, and pool tables too. I don't even need to review the food and drink... one of my favorite burgers in town, but I try to get something different each time.
