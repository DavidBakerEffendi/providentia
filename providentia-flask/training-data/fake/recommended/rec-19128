Went go Kefi last night before Shakespeare in the Park.  Excellent Greek food on the Upper West Side / Central Park West.  Had the Crispy Cod and Cypriot Sausage (comes on skewers with pita and Tzatziki - delicious).  Both dishes were excellent!  The cocktails were great too!  Try the Anthos or Angourri.  Desserts, nothing to write home about. We sat downstairs and I really enjoyed the space and atmosphere down there. Cool Mediterranean decor and plenty of seating.
