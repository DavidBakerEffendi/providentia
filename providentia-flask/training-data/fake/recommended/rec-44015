This place is an absolute amazing place. I used to live in Philly and was there on every weekends. It is good for my college budget too. I moved to Michigan and can't seem to find a place that serves good falafel as this. Even some parts of the states, I've travelled , I put this place on the top. This is coming from a very critical person when it comes to food. Keep up the good work!
