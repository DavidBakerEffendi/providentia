I used to have a weekly rehearsal right down the street from here and we would often stop in at Iron Chef House for an after-practice bite. The staff loved us, so much so that certain members of the group got to create new rolls and name them. I didn't attend the evening meals half as much as everyone else though, so I never got to name a roll, but J's Monkey roll is one that lives on in infamy. Shrimp tempura and a spicy sauce were components of it and it was very, very tasty. The fish always seems fresh here and the staff is the best. Very hospitable and always welcoming.
