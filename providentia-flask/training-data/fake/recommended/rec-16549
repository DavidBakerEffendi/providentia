I love ilili and am a frequent customer. It's a huge place so there's never an issue getting a table. It has kind of a nightclub/lounge feel to it so it's not as intimate as most smaller places in the city but it's actually pretty versatile--it's great for groups and can also be a good date spot. I'm in love with the duck schwarma but I do have to add the asterisk that it's not always consistent. Usually it's amazing but sometimes it's not AS good because the duck can be dry. The bone marrow is also delicious and another fav. Definitely get it if you're adventurous and like fatty/decadent things. I think this place is great for brunch. They have an amazing prex fixe deal. $28 for: 1) Coffee or juice 2) Cava, mimosa, or bellini 3) Entre 4) Side It's pretty much a no-brrainer and is hard to find a brunch deal at this caliber for the price. I had the awarma eggs (lamb confit with 3 poached eggs) for brunch today. I thought the lamb was a bit salty and it had a hard texture but maybe that's how confit is supposed to be? I've never had confit before so I don't have a basis for comparison. The eggs are always cooked beautifully, a great texture inside where it's not overly runny but not overcooked. I prefer their eggs benedicts to the awarma. The beets sides are tasty and go really well on top of the salad that comes with the eggs.
