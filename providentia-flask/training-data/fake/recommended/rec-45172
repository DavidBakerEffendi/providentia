Today was a nice enough day to sit outside and enjoy our meal while watching some kind of show on Church Street. We ordered drinks and food pretty quickly and were served within 20 minutes or so. After we received our lunch the waitress seemed to have forgotten about us. We had to flag down a different waitress to get refills on our drinks and when we were finished eating we waited about 20 minutes for our bill. I decided to go inside to ask for the bill and it took another 10 minutes to find the waitress to print our bill. The food was great. The atmosphere and the other servers were great, but our waitress was mia.
