I really enjoyed my brunch here. It was very crowded, so we waited about 45 minutes for our table, but I expected that. This was my first time there and I was very pleased to see so many great options on the menu. I ordered the Monkey French Toast and my friends both got Fritattas. We waited a very long time for our food. I bet we waited close to an hour. It was crowded and the staff was working hard. We were sitting at the bar and I could see how quickly the kitchen staff was moving. Maybe the frittatas just take a long time. But my French toast was great. Our server was very attentive. the only thing that really bothered me was that gross bottle that they put in front of us when we asked for hot sauce. It was a wine bottle without a cap or label. It was all sticky with crap running down the sides. We didn't examine it any further. Â Yeah, I'll go back there.
