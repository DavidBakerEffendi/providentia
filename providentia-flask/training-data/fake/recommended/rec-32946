They need to do something about the cold air that gets into the restaurant.  The extra door is not doing much, if anything.  We were seated by the door, and it got too cold.  Right after we ordered, we asked the waiter if we could move to the booth that freed up by the wall, who needed to ask the hostess.  She came over and said rudely we can't take that booth, we can take the table by the other wall.  With dirty cups and chopsticks still on the table, we waited for it to be clean before moving over.  The hostess came by again and snapped at us.  "Are you going to move or not?!"  I docked one star for her attitude. The food itself was okay.  $5.70 for 8 soup dumplings was reasonable, wish there was more filling.  We also ordered pan fried buns, the Lion Head Meatball and Crispy Duck.  Buns were all suspiciously very uniform looking, as if they were machine made, and the dough tasted tough, like the frozen buns from asian supermarkets.  The Lion Head Meatball was very loosely packed together, and tasted just like the fillings from the soup dumplings.  The Crispy Duck was deep fried, while the taste was okay, it was not crispy.  Meh.
