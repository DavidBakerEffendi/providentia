Went here for breakfast as most places in north jersey aren't very good. Found this place after a dingy car wash I will never go back to. Ordered the pulled pork pancakes which are spicy and sweet and a side of fries with some coffee. The pulled pork was a tad bit too spicy but it was overall good. If the pork wasn't that spicy it would have been a perfect balance of spice and sweetness. Oh an did I mention I couldn't finish it bc it was too much lol that's what I like, the option to stuff yourself or be conservative and pack the rest home. Should've held back on the fries as the pancakes were filling enough.
