Not a bistro at all. It's a totally AWESOME dive bar in Chelsea where the burgers are cheesy, the drinks are ice cold, and the patrons, loud. We adored this place. And it was a welcome respite after the interesting but confusing experience that was Sleep No More. They only have a few things on the menu. But what they have is excellent! Burgers, chicken sandwiches, and fries, OH MY! Nary a dry patty or wilted lettuce in sight. The service is spot-on and the music is classic rock. Happy to have found it!!
