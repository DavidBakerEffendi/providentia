Hands-down the best falafel sandwich I've ever eaten. Everything about the sandwich is great- crispy falafel (I got the green), fresh Israeli salad, creamy hummus, tangy amba (mango chutney). I also got a banana date lime smoothie which was wonderful. The sandwiches are super filling and the price isn't too bad. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!
