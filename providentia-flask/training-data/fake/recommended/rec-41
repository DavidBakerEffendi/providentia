Great but expensive coffee. Their large is only a 16oz for $3. Not much variety with the to-go food. When you walk in, you don't know whether to seat yourself or have a hostess seat you. This is awkward if you don't want waiter service and are coming in for a quick bite or to catch up on some work. English muffins are amazing along with the homemade jam.
