I heard good things about this place through the NY TImes review so I decided to check it out on my walk to Brooklyn from Queens yesterday afternoon. I got there during the brunch shift and wanted variety but I also wanted something light. The deviled eggs were an interesting twist on the party favorite. The chicken soup was delicious, just the right amount of spice with rice and chicken of course. My favorite, however, was the lavender-galangal. Galangal is a milder version of ginger and slightly sweeter. It will especially be good over the summer. They're a new restaurant so they're still getting their barrings straight but the staff was super nice and attentive.
