I paid 19 dollars for the katsu curry meal which was good but not as excellent as I would expect for the price - and a small portion compared to other places. The worst part was that they threw away my food instead of packing it up when I asked them to pack it up at the end. I seriously contemplated changing the tip amount from 20% and completely regret not having changed it.... The service was atrocious, we had to wait 15 mins for the bill and another 15 mins for them to pack my friend's food but not mine... so not worth it even if I love katsu. Also seeing that the Berkshire pig is so rare what a shame that they would throw it out when specifically instructed not to!
