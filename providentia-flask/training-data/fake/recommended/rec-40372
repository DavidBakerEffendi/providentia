2 Entrees, 1 app, 4 beers...$80 dollars. Archaic waitresses and host. Not all that its cracked up to be. Id have been better off going to La Sicilia on Washington Avenue...and the food wasn't even that good. Apparently those that eat here, dont know what good food tastes like. Its in walking distance from my house, that was the only reason i went. Don't waste your time.The menu is a la carte save the Radicchio salad that is served to everyone. Dont let that get past you when you order.
