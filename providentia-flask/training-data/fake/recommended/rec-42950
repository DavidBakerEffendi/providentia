Food made for foodies. They are not afraid to incorporate unusal ingredients. Sometimes you might not like it, but most things are worth a try in my opinion. Some desserts should be served with ice cream. Drinks made for drinkies. Cool vibe and atmosphere. Funky location. Pleasant staff. Sit at the bar and make friends or have a romantic dinner. Artichoke dip is extremely yummy.
