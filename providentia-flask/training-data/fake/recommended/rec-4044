I'm not sure I'd go completely out of my way to make the 13 mile or so trip from Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to Corona Park, Queens just for empanadas, especially considering that there is very limited seating. However, if I'm ever in the Corona Park/Queens area, as I was recently, I certainly would go to Empanadas Caf√© again. Of course, there's always the option of ordering out and eating in the car too! I've had some really bad empanadas in the past, mostly the result of being excessively greasy, overly doughy, and not flavorful, but the empanadas here are scrumptiously appetizing and filling...and very inexpensive. I'll add that from my experience Columbian empanadas are way better than Puerto Rican ones, the latter of which I've tried plenty of. I tried a couple of the ground chicken (complimented nicely with the right amount of cilantro), the Hawaiian (mozzarella and ham), and of course the legendary nutella chocolate banana empanada (truly amazing... make you slobber all over yourself for more). If only this place wasn't so far from my home.
