We love Day by Day for brunch!  My husband and I went here the day after our wedding before leaving on our honeymoon and we've made it an annual tradition.  The staff is great, the menu is wonderful, and they make the best (really, the only) potatoes that I've ever enjoyed with my eggs.  So tasty! The only downside is that I'm not alone in my love, as the wait can be long on the weekend.
