Momofuku is as NYC as it gets.  It's one of those places, you gather a bunch of your friends and family, and decide, "we gonna get our grab on!"  Yessir! The menu is quite simple.  You order the roasted pig, dassit.  It comes with rice, assorted veggies, dipping sauces (all korean), and you begin your eating feast by taking a piece of lettuce, then pile some rice, a piece of the most delicious pork, some kimchee, and a huge dab of the hot dipping sauce.  Open your mouth really wide and eat.  It's so good!   And for the price, I believe it's like $160 or so for the roasted pig, share that among 8 friends, it's one heck of a deal.
