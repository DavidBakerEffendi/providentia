Lovely food, AMAZING cocktails. The Classic Old Fashioned is the best version I've had, period, and others we tried weren't far behind. The kitchen has a sure hand with fish as well as with heavier, meatier dishes, and careful thought seems to go into even the smallest choices. The housemade pickles that frequently pop up as a foil to some of the richer menu items are a delicious example of this attention to detail. The overall feel is similar to Marlow & Sons, but the prices are a bit gentler and the menu choice is wider. And yeah - the drinks are better. NB: I haven't been on a weekend night, so I don't know how the place functions when it's slammed.
