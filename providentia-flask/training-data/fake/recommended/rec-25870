I've been here more times than I'd like to admit, to the point where I know the name of the waiter and our group always gets a free round of shots every time we come in.  I guess it's ironic, because I don't even eat red meat.  I have had their fries though, which taste like bacon.  Also, I don't eat bacon.  Someone remind me why I'm reviewing this again? Food aside, this place is a total dive.  But in a good way.  I always go with a group and get a big corner booth and we have a good time.  The tables are scratched and written all over, but it kind of just adds to the character of the place.  To me, the best part is that they serve McSorley's.  That's enough to satisfy me beyond any warm,  juicy, delicious burger topped with crispy bacon and a toasted bun.  Someone remind me why I'm part vegetarian? For those who can enjoy the burgers here, I'm sure this is great.  But me, I just sit in the corner and get drunk because I have an empty stomach.
