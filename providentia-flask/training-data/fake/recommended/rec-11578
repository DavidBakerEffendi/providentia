Spicy Bloody Mays! Great atmosphere. I stared heading over to Norther Spy as soon as it opened across the street from me. The rest is history. One of my most favorite part of this place, besides the food, would be the inviting atmosphere before you even enter the space. In the summer time, the clematis (I think) crawls from inside creating a sense of Â "I am curious, I need to go there". Once you make your way over, Northern Spy usually has a wait, so do not stray! It is worth it. Bloody Mary's and homage corned beef hash. Two brunch musts.
