Not necessarily a local town pub, but still ok. They have a pretty good beer selection with some rotating taps. The food is average,  burgers, tater tots, etc.   Around 7-8 at night, the place changes into more of a club atmosphere, and caters to the 20-30 crowd. That being said, I'm usually long gone before the douche-factor gets going.   I've experienced some of the same service issues that others face. where the servers don't care.   I've also experienced some issues that if you're not friends with the bartenders, you tend to get a little cold shoulder and ignored. This place is good, because it's convenient and in my town, I don't know if I would make a special drive to come here.   It's also not on the top of my list on places to grab a beer and chill out. I miss O'neill's.....it was really divey, but it was fun!
