The competition for my coffee shop business is fierce in this neighborhood. Since I've moved here, I've been frequenting Black and Brew for my morning joe.  This morning I decided to try B2 (which is a mere one block away). The prices are comparable.  The menu is a bit smaller, though there is a decent selection of sandwiches, treats, and smoothies. Unfortunately, the coffee is not as good as can be found at B2's neighborhood brethren.   It has that naturally sweet undertone that many love about Dunkin Donuts coffee, so if you like DD, you may be a fan.  I prefer my coffee to be a little bit richer, so this doesn't do it for me.   I will be back again to give the  smoothies and sandwiches a try, as there is much more on offer at this spot than just coffee.
