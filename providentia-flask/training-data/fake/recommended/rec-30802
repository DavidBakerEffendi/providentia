So the restaurant decided to pad my bill with extra tip, perhaps thinking it's such a small amount that people won't bother to fight it? Well you're right, I'm not going to call to scream at you for an extra dollar, but you'll definitely be getting reviewed so others will know. It's just plain wrong to take advantage of your customers, no matter how small the amount is.
