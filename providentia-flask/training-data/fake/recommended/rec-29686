This is the only place I will chicken and rice.  I got food poisoning from another one in the Upper West Side once and have sworn off of chicken and rice since.  If you've ever spent 3 days living in your bathroom...you'll understand why.  However, because of the high turnover of food and fast sales, I know the food here hasn't been out all day.  I usually get the combo with rice and it's amazing.  The white sauce really makes the dish, I'm not sure what's in it, I'm sure it's probably high calorie and fat, but if you're considering street food, you're not counting calories.  I like to put on a lot of white sauce.  Use the hot sauce with caution, maybe a dime size to quarter size...it's spicy!  Have your cash ready and know what you want to order.  The line might look long, but it moves fast.  You can get a soda at the separate drink cart.  It's a high calories, probably high fat, but delicious, generous portioned and cheap meal!
