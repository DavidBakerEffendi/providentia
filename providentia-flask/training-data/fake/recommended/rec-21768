Wow. This place is truly delicious and fresh. I've been there twice with my boyfriend and, each time, we have marveled at the unique selection of fish (tilefish, bluefish, etc.) and not just that, but also the creative concoctions upon which they are served. The chef clearly puts one-of-a-kind thought into his masterpieces. Oh, and the spreads served with the bread before dinner (pate, French butter, etc.) -- awesome. Ambience - check! It's adorable and has that cozy B&B feeling. Dessert - we've only had one, but it (bread pudding) was amazing. The service is delightful (except ONE time that I was starving and it seemed like an eternity until the bread arrived), but the pro's definitely outweigh the cons by a long-shot. I will be back over and over again.
