My boyfriend and I dine here at least once a month and have always loved the atmosphere,  food and service.  We just had lunch there today and what a wonderful experience! Food was  phenomenal (as usual), and we had super service,  sat at the bar with Maya as our bartender.  She was so helpful and informative about specials and the menu,  plus her personality was just lovely. She went above and beyond to help us enjoy our dining experience.  We hope to be able to have her as our server again. :)
