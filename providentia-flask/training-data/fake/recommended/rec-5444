The guys behind the counter spent quite a while making our sandwiches, because they were very large and filled with all kinds of stuff. I ordered the Mr. Bloomburga and my friend ordered something with roast beef and swiss cheese and red peppers in it. Both were okay. The flavors were weird combinations. They both seemed like very particular tastes. If you found one on the menu that you liked, I bet you would really, really like it. Quality ingredients abounded. They seemed to have a very large beer and other beverage selection. And they were selling a 64 oz jug of maple syrup for like $30! There's no seating.
