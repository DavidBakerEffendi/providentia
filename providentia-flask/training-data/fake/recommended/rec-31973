Not much to say about this place except, the tacos are delicioso.  For those who don't speak Spanish, that's "delicious"... I usually get two chicken tacos with green sauce.  The green sauce is spicy, at least to me and spicy enough to really get my phrenic nerve all excited. Notwithstanding their hiccup inducing qualities, I still crave these tacos and look forward to eating them again soon.   Oh, the tongue is also good.  Not my personal fave but did try it and friends rave about it.
