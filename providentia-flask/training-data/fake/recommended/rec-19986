***NO RESERVATIONS*** ***Entire party has to be present to be seated*** Probably one of the best, if not the best ramen joints in the NYC area. I try to get something different everything I come here or I get the special that they offer. I came here with a group of friends and was seated right away. You might ask, "how is that possible? I've waited for hours trying to get seated!?" Trick: Do lunch and do lunch early. We got there on a Friday at 11:25 and was seated by 11:30 and the place was already packed with people. The pork buns are yummy so we ordered a full round of buns and I ordered the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen. If I could come here every day, I probably would. You can't go wrong with Ippudo --everything is awesome (:
