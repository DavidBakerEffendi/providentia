If I could hump the nachos here and not be arrested, I just might. By far the best nachos with vegan beef I've had in my life.  Corn, Black beans, jalepenos... nom. The chimichangas - always delicious.  Burritos - huge and filling.  Tofu and smoked seitan fajitas, delectable... However, when it is in season... the roasted corn.  My god.  They cover it in a crema and cheese and it is out f'n standing. I've eaten at both Cantinas dozens of times - this one perhaps more due to it being easier to find parking, it has NEVER failed.  Come hungry, leave gassy. Go Cantina. Oh yeah, the drinks too... also amazing.  Top 5 best phila restaurants - hands down
