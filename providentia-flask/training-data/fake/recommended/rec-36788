Appetizers were great.  I don't eat fish so I abstain from commenting.   The chicken just wasn't that good.  Disappointing. What really pusses me off is that we went with 10 people, drank way too many Bottles of wine and they has the GAUL to charge us to cut a birthday cake   How CHEAP can they be???????
