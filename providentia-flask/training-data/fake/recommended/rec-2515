We ordered 2 steaks, one with wiz and onions, one with american and onions. We go one with provolone and no onions and the other with only wiz. 2 BS slices of meat in each with barely any cheese...Nice job assholes. One or two other people on line.... IT WAS 2AM!! WAKE UP! Cheese fries are good but don't waste your time. They ruined my buzz. Anyone who gives this more than 1 or 2 stars is obviously not from Philly.
