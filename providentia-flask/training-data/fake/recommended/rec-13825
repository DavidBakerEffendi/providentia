Belgian beer bar with a questionable croque monsieur -- the bread not toasty enough, the bechamel too lightly applied -- but spot-on moules frites. Six or so different mussels preps, but it's hard to go wrong with the classic white wine broth. And very good fries, too, which show up in another satisfying take on a classic, steak frites. The meat could be more tender, but it bursts with beefy flavor. A nice low-key option for brunch or dinner. Probability of return within 1 year: 60% (this capsule review is courtesy of my July "short and sweet in the summer" initiative)
