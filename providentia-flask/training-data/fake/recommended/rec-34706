Absolutely DELICIOUS and Addicting! The roti and the meat are freshly made right in front of you. My favorite is the Unda Chicken roll. For vegetarians, I highly recommend the Achar Paneer roll. The prices are also very reasonable ($5 - $6) a roll. One fills me up for lunch...but guys usually go for two. I fell in love with these rolls the first time I had them and I haven't stopped since (I go there about once a week). Warning: The wait during lunch can be long. Try to beat the lunch time if possible. Also, the dining place inside is small. It might be tough to find seating at times.
