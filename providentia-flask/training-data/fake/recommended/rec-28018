Sugar Freak should be named Sugar Freaking Awesome. The only time I have ever been disappointed is when they closed for renovations. However, they are back and I could not be happier. The interior is decorated with antique pieces of furniture and some of the tables are made from old picture frames. Underneath the glass on the tables there are notes left by prior customers ranging from notes about the experience the had to fun whimsical ramblings. The special offerings are strung across the walls from clothes pin to clothes pin, written on brightly colored pieces of paper. Expect to be greeted by a friendly hostess with a big smile. The service is great, I've never had to ask for a refill or wait around to ask for something I need. The atmosphere and food is Cajun Creole inspired. Fittingly they have Abita beer on tap. The first time I went I had the deep fried alligator to start and the fried shrimp po boy. The alligator was delicious. Perfectly fried and seasoned beautifully with just the right amount of spice. I told myself I would only eat half of the po boy but I knew that wasn't going to be the case after just a couple of bites. My friend got the jambalaya. It wasn't as good as jambalaya I have had in New Orleans and was a little dry, but still tasty. I can't wait to go back to try the new brunch offerings like build your own waffle! They will also offer brunch late night on Saturdays! Prefect drunk food (nom nom).
