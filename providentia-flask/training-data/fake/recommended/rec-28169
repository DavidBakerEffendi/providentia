I first came here a few years ago with a group of friends for a birthday. We all loved our food so we try and head back every year like a tradition. I love the escargot, I can;t believe that I would ever say that about a mollusk, but here I am typing those exact words. Buttery, garlicky heaven on a clamp. Yum!
