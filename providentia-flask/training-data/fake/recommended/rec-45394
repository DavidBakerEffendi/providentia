Italian wines. Lots. prices are not exactly cheap for glasses, but the bottles are reasonable. Good nibbles. they serve mostly small plates. The shrimp scampi is bomb, the vegetable mezze plate is also yummy (the pickle their own veggies I think...) and the bruscetta are well-executed. the servers I've had have been solid but not spectacular. Nice space, dark and light at the same time. windows and wood.
