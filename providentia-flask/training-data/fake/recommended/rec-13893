I went late on a Sunday night on a date. The food was great- he had the spicy chicken, I had a special that was mussels in some sort of wine sauce. They were perfectly cooked and seasoned. We split an apple tartine a la mode for desert. The food was great, not too crowded. The server was VERY slow and inattentive, luckily they bring you a bottle of water for the table or else I think it would've been impossible to get refills!
