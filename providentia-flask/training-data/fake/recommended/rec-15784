I could eat the cavatelli el pesto every day and die happy.  I also love the wine by the glass selections.  I always get to try interesting wines when I visit. This restaurant only takes reservations until 7 pm.  After that,  you have to wait for a table.  I like this restaurant so much that I have, on numerous occasions, waited over an hour for a table.  That is a true testament to how much I love the food/wine. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because there isn't really enough room when you are waiting for a table.  You are basically in this huge mass of people waiting for your name to be called.  I wish they would implement a "give us your cell number and we will call you when your table is ready" policy so you can wait somewhere else.   One other thing to note- One time we had to wait a REALLY long time for a table, like an hour and a half, because people had finished eating but were lingering at their table.  The restaurant comped us an appetizer when we eventually sat down.  I appreciated that.  I like it when a restaurant acknowledges (without being asked) that your time is valuable and they appreciate you waiting.
