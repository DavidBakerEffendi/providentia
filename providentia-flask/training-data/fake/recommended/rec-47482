Perfectly simple. Focus is on fresh seafood with no frills. A little bit out of the way, but I think it adds to the charm.  Suggest getting one of the fishes of the day. BYOB, which is an added bonus. Remember, this place is called the Petite Crevette.  Or "Little Shrimp" in the Queen's English.  And it's redundant for a reason...it is freakin tiny.
