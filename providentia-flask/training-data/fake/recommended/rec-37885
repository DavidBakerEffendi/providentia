I can't say enough good things about Sweet and Sara's!  I was lured in by the promise of vegan 'mallows that were better than the animal-filled ones.  They are AMAZING!  They have the most perfect texture and flavor and don't taste like fake chemicals the way traditional ones do. I kept coming back for more because I loved the taste of their products and the customer service.  Seriously, it's fantastic. Everything ships so quickly!  Also,  I recently ordered online and because the owner found cheaper shipping, she refunded some of my money.  Totally unexpected, totally not necessary and totally appreciated.  This is the kind of thing that makes me a loyal customer!  My two favorite things (though I love it all--it's like picking a favorite child!) are the cinnamon pecan marshmallows and the peanut butter s'more.  I stockpile them whenever the grocery store has them and order them when they don't. Thank you SO much for giving me a cruelty-free version of my favorite treat and for being such an amazing company!
