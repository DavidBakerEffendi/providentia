I was a huge fan of Umami Burger in LA and now that Umami has made it to New York City, I could not be happier! The only problem I had with anything was that there weren't very many smooshed potatoes. Sort of a disappointingly small plate. I felt like we needed more food, which never would have happened at Umami Hermosa. Otherwise, this place totally lived up to the hype! I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and smooshed potatoes!
