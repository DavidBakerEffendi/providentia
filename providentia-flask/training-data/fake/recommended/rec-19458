I've been to London Grill a couple of times, and it's been a consistenly pleasant experience for me.  I especially love their fish tacos and burger. The burger comes on an English muffin, which is a pleasant change from the usual bun.  The service had also been good.  Once I went with my dogs to sit outside and our server brought a dog bowl with water in it.  Very thoughtful. I really want to check out their happy hour deal if I can make it sometime!
