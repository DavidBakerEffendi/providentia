I recently ate at Public with a group of 20 in the Wine Room.  We had a really wonderful evening.  I did a lot of research before booking here, and if you have tried to find a fun place with a reasonably priced menu and wine list for a large group, you will know it isn't an easy task in Manhattan. The most appealing thing to me was that they do a four-course menu with choices at every course for $75, and it is French service, not family style.  At every course, the food came out for all twenty guests simultaneously.  This was particularly impressive when the main courses came out--my sea trout was not only tender and perfectly cooked, but the dish itself was creative and well balanced.   We had the Wine Room area to ourselves for the entire evening, for cocktails into dinner.  Our waitress was absolutely delightful--personable, friendly, greeted me by name, knew why we were there, got us drinks in a timely manner.  The evening was seamless. There is one thing you should know before you book the Wine Room--it is separated from the main dining room by a semi-transparent scrim.  I liked this semi-private feel a lot--very festive to me.  But it was loud to the point that it was difficult to talk to those across from me.  This could be partially due to there being another large group in the main dining room.  However, the area was large enough for me to circulate easily around the table between courses, and that offered me a chance to speak to everyone during the meal. Overall, I found this a really festive place to celebrate with a large group of people.
