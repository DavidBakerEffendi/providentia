This place is amazing!! The food was phenomenal - we could have eaten five plates of the nachos, alone! The outdoor seating was lovely. And the people... well... just made our night. Food - Nachos: I already told you. They are delicious. Weird at first, but sooo good! Lobster risotto: buttery and bowl-licking good. Lobster tacos: yeah, I said it. They aren't huge and are pricey ($17) but when split with someone else (one taco and half an entree each), it was pretty good. Duck Mole something: very, very tasty!!! Shrimp quesadilla special: filling and delish! Crepes & churros: both great. The crepes were set on fire... that's always fun.   There was nothing left at the end of the meal and we were all very full but definitely content. Drinks - Alcohol: everyone liked their drinks. I can't remember anyone else's, but I got the ginger margarita and it was delicious. We got both the two hot chocolates and they were each more sinful and yummy than the toher.   People - Sebastian was our waiter. He is a self-declared highly-strung guy with a smile that lit up the night. He was so friendly and seemed like just a genuinely happy guy. He helped me with all of my many questions and never seemed bothered by us at all, even though we had a million requests. Sebastian is the man! Go visit him!! Also... he told us all about his fiancee, which was really sweet. He told us that she doesn't believe he talks about her so, in case she sees this... he really does!!!
