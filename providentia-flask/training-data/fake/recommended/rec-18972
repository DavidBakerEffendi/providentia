This review is more like 4.5 stars. The first thing you notice is how huge the space is. There's a main room, a raised bar area with several tables, a side room, and a semi-private space off the side room. Oh, and there's outdoor seating too. And yet it's still very crowded because the food is fantastic. I went in a group of three and had a 7:30 reservation. (Given how busy the place is, I would recommend making a res -- it isn't one of those places where you have a res and end up waiting half an hour anyway.) Our server was super nice and gave us a few suggestions. We got chicken wings, deviled eggs (addictive), brisket (delicious and a little fattier than other places, if that's your thing), pulled pork, ribs (good portion and really charred on the outside), turkey neck greens, mac & cheese (really good), cornbread, and pork beans (probably my favorite side -- so flavorful i was scraping at the bottom of the bowl). Another great thing about Dino is that it serves pitchers of beer. Convenient and economical! The only downside, and it's not a downside for everyone, is that when it's crowded the place is insanely loud. I wouldn't bring anyone who has trouble hearing, or small children who can't take crowds. But that's it! Anyone else, who loves bbq, will love it.
