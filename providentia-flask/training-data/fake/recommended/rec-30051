Thought I'd give them another try at my sister's urging so I reluctantly agreed.  The place was packed and we had to wait about 40 minutes for our pizza.  We ordered a mushroom and onion pie and when it came to the table it was well done (burnt).  When I made a comment to the waitress she got all snotty and told us that's what we asked for.  We did not!  I would never ask for my pizza to be well done, only a fool would.  The edges of the pizza were actually black.  She then, again with an attitude, told us they'd make us another pizza but we'd have to wait another 40 minutes.  I said "no", because number one:  we did not want to wait, and number 2:  I knew that that the guy making the pizza would slap his "Johnson" on the dough and spit a juicy honker into the sauce.  I asked for my money back and got it.  I left a nickle (for the half drank soda's) and a condom on the table as a tip.  I would never want that waitress to breed!  As far as I am concerned I'd die of starvation before ever coming back to this red neck dump.  We ended up getting a great hoagie at a hoagie shop in Princeton.  I can see by their overall rating of 3.5 that I am not the only one complaining and they ARE NOT the excellent place they once were. And to the clown who said this is not a pizzeria, and is a pizza joint is full of it.  Some of the best pizzas in NJ are to be had in Taverns!
