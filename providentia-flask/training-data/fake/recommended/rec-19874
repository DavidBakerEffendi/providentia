We made reservations for this place because it was a pretty small to moderate sized restaurant. Staff was very friendly. It wasn't too loud at all in the resturant. The lighting and atmosphere was super chill. I started off with the Maple and Bacon Roasted Almonds which were super delicious. For Dinner I had the Duck Meatloaf, which was hella good and I would highly recommend it. For dessert i ha the pecan pie sundae. That was the bomb.com. I reached over and tried my gfs chicken and waffle plate, that was super awesome as well. I would most definately come back to this place. I want to try their brunch menu =)
