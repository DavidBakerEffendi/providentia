Overall this is a great place for drinks, food and dancing.  I really like this place because they do have a DJ and hence the whole dancing scene but you can also sit at one of the booths and chill if you are not into dancing.  Also the drinks are somewhat reasonably priced for an Olde City bar.   I will say six months ago I would have given this place five stars but the music has changed a bit recently.  I tend to not recognize a lot of the songs they are playing.  Also the late night clientelle seems to have changed a bit as well, either that or I am getting older :(  Despite these changes this is still one of my go to places in Olde City.
