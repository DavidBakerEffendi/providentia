Great little place. If you're ever at the woodside LIRR station/61st street 7 train stop. I suggest you stop by. I had the nutella and banana crepe and it was delicious. Its a small quick stop place, one table and a couple of bar seats with a focus menu on crepe but defintely see potential for expansion. But delicious crepe, cute decor, fast service and they cook it right in front of you which I like. they needs to jump on the food truck band wagon and makes these in Manhattan.
