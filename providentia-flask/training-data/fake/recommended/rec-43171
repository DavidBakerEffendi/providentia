Not impressed. Service: I went here for brunch and chose to be seated in the tavern (as opposed to the dining room). Our waitress was very friendly, but I forgot to order drinks with my prix fixe brunch, and she forgot to ask. I figured she would come back later once she realized it was missing -- nope. So when our main dishes came out, after a round of appetizers, which allowed plenty of time to correct this error, I asked the server who brought our dishes out for one mimosa and one bloody mary, the latter of which I gave to someone else. We were surprised when our check showed a $10 charge for the bloody mary, at which point our waitress explained that the 2 drinks included in the brunch are only for the person who ordered the prix fixe. My memory of the menu isn't perfect, but I don't recall it being clear on the menu that this would not be ok, not to mention that she had completely forgotten to ask about the drinks to begin with. She also didn't check in with us at any point until after we had finished our meals, so there was no opportunity for me to order with her or for her to explain this to me. I've done this before at other brunch places, and I've never had a problem. Food: Memorably below average. All dishes came out lukewarm. Crab cakes were way too salty, eggs were well cooked but unseasoned and cold, the steak was way overdone, the bread on the bison burger was soggy, and the fries were crispy on the outside but mealy on the inside. Drinks: Good but overpriced.
