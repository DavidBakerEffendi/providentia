I have nothing bad to say about this place.  We had a girls night out during restaurant week which in the past 10 years it has been less then exciting when dining at local restaurants.  Not this time!  They hit it out of the ball park.  From the service to the food everything was outstanding.  Not to mention they are so accommodating with food restrictions.  I would recommend them to anyone!
