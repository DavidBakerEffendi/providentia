I went here two weeks ago and had the Cuban sandwich. I was so hungry and they forgot my order so I spent extra time waiting, while everyone's food looked really good for what it was. I knew this place was cheap and I wasn't expecting it to be the best, but the sandwich was awful. I have never, ever had anything so terrible and it wasn't like a Cuban sandwich at all. I can't speak to anything else, but do NOT come here for the sandwich. What went wrong: -The pork was way too salty. -The pork was shredded and was the kind of pork you would use for an entree w/ rice, not meant for a sandwich, especially when it's falling out all over the place. -The bread was soggy and not firm like a pressed sandwich should be -I got the tiniest slice of cheese and it maybe covered about a quarter of the sandwich. I couldn't even tell if it was really there. -There was no mustard. Now, I'm not even a fan of mustard, but it is essential for a Cuban sandwich. I'm from Miami where you can buy Cuban sandwiches on any corner and I have never seen or heard of anything like this and they looked at me strange when I asked for mustard, really?!
