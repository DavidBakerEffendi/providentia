Was in town visiting a friend who just had a baby and chose to pick up Kate's to treat her family for dinner.  It was a delightfully easy take out experience and so much more special than the standard pizza, Chinese, etc.   If you can't cook, Kate's is the closest to homemade and frankly, better than my homemade.  The beef tenderloin was perfect and the sides were all very tasty.  I just wish I would have ordered more toffee to take home!
