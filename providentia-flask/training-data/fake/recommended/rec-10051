Went here on an early Sunday evening. We were promptly seated.  Service was slow, it took them about 15 mins to take our order.  We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees which the entrees came out almost immediately after the entrees.  No time to breathe at all. We ordered the Spinach dumplings and Golden Triangle?(Ground shrimp and chicken inside a fried wonton).  Both were decent and i've had better.  Note, there were 2 of us and ONE appetizer is more than enough. For entrees, we ordered the basic.  Myself, the Shrimp Pad Thai, and my wife ordered the Pad See Ew.  The Pad Thai was OK, I was excited about what Yelpers said but I found it slightly disappointing.  It was too tangy, too acidic and not sweet enough.  The noodles were cooked well though. My wife thought that the Pad See Ew was good, very light sauce and tasty.  I also ordered the Thai Iced Tea which was delicious and refreshing. We liked the atmosphere and will return for a pre-going out meal.  It seems more like a trendy lounge with Thai food than a Thai restaurant.
