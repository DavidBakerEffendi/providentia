Adorable Italian food spot tucked in the Far West Village, Piccolo Angelo is not to be missed.  Always bustling with mouth-filled patrons yacking it up, this place delivers time and time again. You'll be greeted by a bread basket replete with garlic bread, and by either: a) the charismatic owner, or b) his chubby, friendly son.  Antipasto, pasta, insalata, zuppa, a wide selection of entrees, extensive wine list, delicious deserts -- it's all good. And you gotta try the meatballs.  Ah.  Huge.  Who doesn't like huge meatballs drenched in tomato sauce & surrounded by linguini?  I only finished the left ball, and took the right one home.  Hey -- I totally forgot I had a doggy bag in my fridge.  Sweet! Hint:  Make a reservation.  Else you may be standing huddled in the entrance for 15-45 minutes, depending on the time.  But well worth the wait.  Trust me. Piccolo Angolo.  You may not remember how to spell it (drives me bonkers!), but luckily an Italian language exam won't stand between you and the porcini tortellini.
