Came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch.  We were one of maybe four tables being served in the restaurant, along with a group with young kids (eck! kids!) My mom and I split the gazpacho, which was rich and delicious- I had an omelette, which I found overly oily, and my mom ordered buckwheat crepes, which were filling and tasty.  Our dessert was delicious, and the restaurant-made sodas were a great supplement to the meal. Though the menu is small and our service took a while, I would absolutely return to experience other items.
