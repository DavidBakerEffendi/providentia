I can't believe I haven't written a review about one of my ultimate favorite restos in the city until now!   What has happened to me? Am I so in love with this place that I want to keep it all to myself? Ah, yep.  That's it. I concede that I do not like waiting for hours to dine at Tia Pol. I don't like it one bit.  But, I do it.  I do it because that squid in ink is worth an hour of waiting in a tiny sliver of a space with my sangria in hand near the front bar.  That Pulpo with paprika is worth continuing to stand even though my feet are in pain from my 4" heels.  That special fish of the day (sometimes Dorado) worth being bumped and pushed and rubbed up against dammit.  It just is. It's all worth that moment in time when the cute little hostess or owner looks at me and says, "Jennifer, you're table is ready." Oooohhhhhh yeeeesssss! Sweet success.
