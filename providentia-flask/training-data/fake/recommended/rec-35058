You only have two choices here: Salad or pizza. That is all you need! The flatbreads are gourmet pizzas that use fresh local ingredients in creative and delicious combinations. The dough is their special recipe and the flatbreads are cooked in a wood fired oven. They offer a large bread for two or individual breads. My cousin and I were hungry and since there are no appetizers we ordered a large and a small. Besides their regular menu they have a salad special, a veggie flatbread special, and a meat flatbread special. We order the meat special and a new Vermont sausage. The special was a pork meat ball, arugula pesto, and balsamic red onion. It a had great balance of sweetness and tartness and the meatball we tasty with great texture. The new Vermont sausage had fresh and local maple fennel pork sausage, sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions, mushrooms, cheeses, and herbs. Caramelized onions make just about anything taste great and the sausage and mushroom addition is a great combo. Be warned! This is not a regular sausage pizza. The bread itself is delicious. It's a thin, but not too thin crust pizza dough. It gets some nice crispiness around the edges and has a slight char on the bottom. It doesn't have the same crispness or char on the bottom that you would get on a Pepe's crust but it hold the ingredients well. The other great thing about this place it that it houses Zero Gravity brewing. The tap list features their excellent beer as well a some brews on cask. If beer isn't your thing they have a full bar to chose from. This place is popular so be prepared to wait if you go at peak hours. On a Friday at around 6:30 were told it would be about 30 minutes, but we were seated in about 15 minutes. If you want to eat outside you will wait longer. Go to the bar while you wait and enjoy one of the great Zero Gravity beers. Even if you have to wait it's worth it!
