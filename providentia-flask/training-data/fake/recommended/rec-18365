I came here with a group of friends on Thanksgiving. We were happily surprised that the bar was open, since most were closed in the city and we had been hanging out a block away at my friends' place. We went upstairs and immediately found a place at the bar to get drinks. The bar was dimly lit, there was a group of people playing pong, the music was great.. overall, a nice atmosphere to unwind on a holiday night. The bartender/manager Jake was friendly and gave us hefty drinks for a good price. I had a vodka soda and my friends got a mix of beers. They had a variety of beers on tap and they were all pleased with the selection. The whole bar was singing along to the music and it was just a great vibe! We will definitely be back!
