I went to the Grocery for my birthday. Sat in the backyard. It was a pleasant little backyard dining they have put together. As I have heard the name of the restaurant so many times, I had some expectations. Pretty good wine selection and nice seasonal appetizers and entrees. Nice service. Although there was nothing that went wrong, the restaurant didn't leave me any special experience either. I will return occasionally since I live in the neighborhood.
