As I was walking towards CCNY (City College), I suddendly bumped into the place. I walked in, and the environment was super low key, quiet and very neat with a friendly staff. Great music choice; nothing crazy, over the top or loud, that you can't establish a good communication with whomever is there with you (like in must places in NYC). But let's cut to the chase, I went with the lunch option of a turkey burger with baked potatoes and I finished it off with a homemade piece of sweet potato pie. I was stunt! The food was done just right with the perfect touch of flavor. Every item placed in my burger, in the potatoes and in the pie was totally fresh and truly organic. The freshness of the food and the cook's hands it's a slamming combo. Some people ask a lot for their buck, but I am only interested on quality not quantity. With this said, I believe the serving size at this location is a nice normal portion that definitely does justice for its price, quality and flavor. Two thumbs up!
