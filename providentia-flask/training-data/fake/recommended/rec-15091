Beautiful interior, almost elegant.  There is a fireplace!   The fast food chopsticks seemed out of place on our white table cloth.  The food was not bad.  Not elegant but not bad.  The service was good. We started with a scallion pancake.  Peking Duck House does a very good scallion pancake.  Crispy, chewy, scalliony and not too oily.   Then we ordered "Three Delight in the Neptune's Nest Sliced chicken, pork and shrimp with Chinese greens, sauteed in our special sauce and served on a crisp bird's nest"  It was ok. The nest (made from deep fried potato - totally rancid tasting but maybe we weren't supposed to try to eat it) held a generous portion of cooked meats, shrimp, a few snow peas and a LOT of bell pepper.  Since when is bell pepper a Chinese green? What about the Chinese greens?   Most disappointing.   We also ordered Moo Shu Shrimp which was very  good.  The sauce, filling and wrappers were dropped off for us to assemble our own.   Fresh tasting fortune cookies with the check.   I added the 4th star because they gave us a little present for New Year!  I agree with Anna M though... the food is just OK.  Not great.  I will go again.  Maybe next time I'll ask for their favorites.  Stay tuned.
