Foods are great, but absolutely one of the worst service I've ever had. I cannot justify 10 pieces of small calamari for 11 bucks. The pho is worth it though, really good and refreshing. The por chop is also pretty nice. I will try the lunch special next time to justify the price, but most likely I will come back only for take out only. Foods - 5 stars Price - 3 stars Service - 1 star
