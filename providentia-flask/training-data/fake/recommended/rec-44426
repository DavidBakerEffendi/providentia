Had a wonderful meal here !! Recommended as a local and affordable restaurant, although 'off the beaten path'. Restaurant was wonderful !!  Our waitress was Tina. She was very attentive and while we were there she took a photo of a couple who were celebrating something.  Very nice ! Food was wonderful, place was wonderful. I highly recommend the restaurant !!
