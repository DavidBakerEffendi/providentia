I give Pat's 3 stars because of their tasty cheesesteaks and I prefer them over their counterparts across the street. BUT, I can't give them anything more because of cleanliness, or lack of it. Man, the place is a dump....trash blowing around everywhere! (see photo) I know it's chilly and windy but send one of the yahoos inside not doing anything to go outside and clean up.
