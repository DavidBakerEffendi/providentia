Really good food. The mixed drinks and cocktails were great and really decently priced. I tried my friends fried pickles and they were pretty good, but not the best I ever had.... Not sure the spicey is what I'm into when eating fried pickles but it definately made it unique! It had a nice overall feel- not to big or small, romantic yellow lighting, wooden benches and tables with candles in glass globes. Ahh, writing this make me want a burger. :-)
