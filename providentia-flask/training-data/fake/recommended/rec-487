As a picky Italian, I'd recommend Pellegrino's as the number 1 spot on Mulberry, here's why: Pros: 1) DELICIOUS pasta - I tried the Fettuccine Alfredo with asparagus and prosciutto and it was so good I couldn't stop eating it despite the gracious serving 2) A free glass of wine is always on the menu for pretty girls! 3) Wine Specials - there are always a few bottles that are on special 4) Good for large groups - you can easily fit a party of 15-20 Cons: Not the best ambiance as far as decorations go PRICEY! Â The Little Italy name means a pasta dish can be close to $25 Because it is in a touristy neighborhood, forget about walking right in for a meal in the warm weather months TIP: MAKE A RESERVATION from May - October Go in the winter when there are no crowds - you'll get the best service
