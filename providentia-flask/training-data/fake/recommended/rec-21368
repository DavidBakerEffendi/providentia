This place is so cool and just hip for all ages! I felt so cool just eating here. It looks like a normal diner, but when you walk in, to your right is the diner, to your left is the club area. Everyday is a different theme. So I went on a Monday and that was Motown Monday! I'm 23 years old and I felt to young to go party with the older crowd but I definitely enjoyed the music and just the energy I felt while eating. Oh yeah and the food and service was great! Highly recommended!
