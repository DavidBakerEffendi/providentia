went there using a voucher deal..$20 for $40 worth of food....atmosphere is a typical bar kind of feel. they dohave a kid's menu..which is good for families.... had the the steaka dn well very well pleased..everything was tender and had just the right amount of seasoning on it. tookn my grandmother with us and as all older southern people, she usually complains about food not being seasoned properly, or cooked right, but even she couldn't find a reason to complain about this place....TRULY AMAZING!!!!!!, lol...... they host a paint night on mondays from 7pm-9pm, so gonna have to go back and try that one Monday...... definitely will be back for dinner and drinks....staff is super nice as well
