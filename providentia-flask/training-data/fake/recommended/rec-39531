The food is delicious! I hate the wait for a table, but it doesn't bother me enough to deduct a star. I've been here twice, once with mom and the bf for New Year's and again with just the bf for an impromptu dinner. Both times we had the mussels and I had a very very spicy Pad Noh Mai, which I adore. The bf ordered the dish with black noddles and said he thoroughly enjoyed it. I've also ordered for delivery at lunchtime and late night dinner at work. Delivery was fast enough. The Thai iced teas are yummy too.
