Really really good. After a grueling day of Christmas NYC crowds, this place was a highlight. Tiny space and it was crowded, but we didn't wait long. White pizza hot out of the oven was amazing, and the boyfriend raved about the margherita pizza. It was warm enough that we ate on the leaning counter out front. Crispy, hot, big slices. And not too expensive -- three slices and one big water bottle for a little over $15.
