Went here as I was craving some authentic soba noodles....was not disappointed at all. I got the broiled eel mini lunch set with cold Â soba noodles. The eel was absolutely delicious and is one of my new obsessions. The soba noodles were comparable to those that I had in Japan! My friend ordered the Raw Tuna and Mountain Yam cold soba- he enjoyed it, the tuna had a slight fishy flavor... The sesame spinach was alright. Awesome ambience, the waiter staff are super friendly, a little Japanese restaurant tucked into the East Village! Also tried the Honey and Wasabi ice cream...not a big fan of wasabi at all but definitely try it if you love wasabi- not too spicy.
