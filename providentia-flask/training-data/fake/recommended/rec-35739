SERVICE:  It took them about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was waiting to be seated, and another 5 minutes for them to finally come to me to ask me "for how many?" Maybe this is just a New York restaurant thing, but they wouldn't seat me until my whole party was present (which was just 1 other person). Even when I let them know that I would order right away, they still would not seat me. They were not very nice about it either. I understand that they were very busy, but just because you're busy does not mean you need to be less than polite to your customers. It just seemed like all the employees were tired, in a bad mood and annoyed. FOOD:  The only noteworthy dish that we tried was the CRQ Forestier (roasted mushrooms, gruyere, herbs de provence). The mushrooms were soaked in the herbs and the gruyere was melted to a perfect gooey-ness. The other dishes we ordered were the nutella crepes (very small and dinky...not worth the money) and the Steamed Eggs (prosciutto or smoked salmon, goat cheese). The steamed eggs dish was honest in its intent but it lacked flavor. AMBIANCE:  This place was packed and crowded. Servers were having a hard time maneuvering around the small cafe. I was practically sitting inside the coat hanger.
