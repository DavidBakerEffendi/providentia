Very average mexican good. Great drinks though. Don't get me wrong this place is a good stand by option in this area, but if you compare it to something like Fonda in Park Slope it's pretty lacking. A lot of the things we tried were a little on the bland side. The atmosphere is nice though, all be it a little dark. Probably a great drinks spot though
