WAYYY overpriced for what it was... the spot is lovely, very romantic and cute, probably better for a glass of wine and an appetizer. but definitely NOT for a dinner... went with a group of friends for an after work dinner and wine.. the food was terribly mediocre, and the entree portions were way too small for the price. ended up leaving hungry and with a big hole in our pocket! totally NOT worth it...
