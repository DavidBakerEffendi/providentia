This archetypal city bar, ideally located in the heart of all things cultural in Center City (mercifully replacing its redundantly conceived and patently awful ancient predecessor Copa Two), is so rightfully well-regarded, that's it's become chief among the regular haunts of many an Elite Yelper and Philadelphia in-crowdster alike. A connoisseur's draft selection, arguably the juiciest burger west of Broad, and of course, boasting the most personality-gifted barkeep in Philly, Jose's is all the things a friendly good-time bar should be, and none it shouldn't. I've been lucky to have been welcomed here for a couple of informal group occasions, during which our saintly tolerant host had almost nothing but encouragement for the inevitably ludicrous progression of our evening. Great crowds at both upstairs and downstairs drink counters, and intimate yet social seating, ensure you'll rub elbows with the city's best out-goers. An amazingly tasty soundtrack of meticulously chosen music favorites and surprises entertainingly fill the rare lull in buzzing conversation. And the true king of beers, the mind-blowingly tasty Bell's Two Hearted, sits atop its regal place on the tap rack, beckoning its loyal subjects to a private audience. For that feel-good glow and good-times smile you start craving on a lonely evening home watching Cheers or Cocktail, strap on your going-out suit and jet to Pistolas with your pals - you will be well received.
