Apps: Spare Ribs wrapped around Sugarcane are fantastic and really something special. Crispy pork belly is cooked to perfection. Chicken skewers are served with delicious sauces that make a seemingly ordinary option extraordinary. Drinks: The Fig-a-tini was ridiculously good, and very refreshing. Not sure how the boys' beers were, as I was not straying from my drink. They seemed perfectly happy though. Entrees: We each ordered a different protein in a different curry broth. The duck was succulent and there were lychees in the broth (an added benefit in my opinion). The beef was tender, not dry. The sea bass was cooked perfectly. Ambiance: Some of my favorite interior decorating in the city. Noise level was just right. Service: We went here before going to see Macbeth and let our server know ahead of time. Everything came out quickly, but never before we'd finished our previous course. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommend.
