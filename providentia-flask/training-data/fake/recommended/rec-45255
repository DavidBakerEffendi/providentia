My friend finally took me here and I must say it is pretty damn solid!  The noodle soup is similar to pho but in my mind the noodles and much better.  I think I like the Vietnamese fixings better however.  The thing that makes this place and its soup stand out is the different kinds of meat you can get in the soup.  We got roasted duck and ox rib...definitely go duck but they were both tasty.
