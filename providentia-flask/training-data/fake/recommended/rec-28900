I have been a couple times now for dinner. I liked it! Prices aren't ridiculously cheap but not outrageous and the food is tasty with fairly large portions. I am no Vietnamese cuisine expert so I couldn't tell you if it was traditional or not, but I definitely thought the food was good and presented well. The atmosphere is nice as it is attractively decorated. I was seated and served fairly quickly even though it was a weekend.
