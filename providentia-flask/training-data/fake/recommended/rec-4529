I don't know enough about Cuban food to rate it versus other Cuban food but I will say this: I enjoyed my food, it was quick service and very good. The waiters were not very knowledgeable providing the wrong description of food on two occasions. One thing I do know, or thought I knew, was that I didn't like flan. How my views have changed. Their flan was awesomely amazing. Get the specialty one with plantains and warm butter rum and whipped cream. Delicious!!
