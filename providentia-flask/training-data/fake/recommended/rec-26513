I have been here several times because of the close proximity to where I live, so this review would be based over the past year and a half of regular visits (monthly).  The service is absolutely lacking MOST of the time.  Expect your server to disappear for 20 minutes after your food is served, and you have to flag one down to get your check and even longer to get your card back if you paid with a credit card.  For example, I recently went in for a drink and appetizers and the entire experience took an hour.  There were only 11 people in the entire place, so I found this to be completely unacceptable.  The bartender was too busy texting away to notice us sitting beer-less and bored in the cantina.   To avoid being completely ignored, opt to sit at the bar (not even the cantina though- you'll still get ignored!)  They also tend to get the orders wrong, (asking for a side of guac and they bring you out the expensive and dauntingly large $8 plate, then tell you that you ordered the wrong way instead of clarifying to begin with) and miss you when your beer is completely empty.  Dos Segundos is best at their busiest hours when they're properly staffed, like Sunday brunch.  I would like to see a secret shopper initiative in this place to keep them in check.  It appears as though their wait staff and bartenders are hired based on their "hipster" appearances and not their actual ability to keep customers happy, which I feel is a general problem with Northern Liberties dining.   I'll keep coming back because I don't feel like walking the extra 2 blocks to El Camino Real when the weather is bad, but it's a cheap cop-out compared to their rivals in Liberties Walk.  The ambient lighting and indie music give the immediate appeal, and the food is good enough, but Cantina Dos Segundos loses serious points with the mediocre service.
