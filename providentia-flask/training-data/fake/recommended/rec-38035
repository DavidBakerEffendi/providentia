Flew out from Arizona for a wedding, and my GF told me about this place. My GF (when she lived in CT, and when she visits) and her parents are frequent diners here.   It is a BYOB place, so we brought two bottles of wine which complemented the sushi well, or it could be the other way around in this case.   The sushi was excellent and fresh.  We got the Spicy Girl, the Dancing Tuna, the Incredible Hulk, the Alaska Roll and a Shrimp Tempura roll.  Also got the seaweed cucumber salad for an app. They brought all of our food out in a Sushi Boat, and we ate every single bit of it!   My mom is Japanese, and a VERY picky eater, but this is definitely a place that I can bring her where she will not be disappointed.
