Okay... Here's my deal with Tom's. PRO - The environment outside and inside is so welcoming. Just by looking at the inside and outside, you know your meal is gonna be good. CON - Long Line PRO - The line moves relatively quickly cause they turn tables faster than any restaurant I've seen AND you get little snacks while you wait (Cookies, little ham steaks) CON - Floor's are pretty dirty - I know they're extremely busy from the moment those doors open till the moment they close, btu someone could go through that dining area with a swiffer at some point. PRO - The Staff is so nice. Our waiter, the manager the people just handing out the cookies in line. Always with a smile. I watched some girl get called over by a table to get them water... in most NYC restaurants you'd visibly see that employee roll their eyes with a "That's not my job" attitude, but this girl was super friendly about it. CON - only two flavors of milk shake (chocolate and vanilla) PRO - So many options for breakfast lunch and dinner. Great menu. OVERALL: Food - 4 out of 5 Drink - 4 out of 5 Environment - 4 out of 5 Staff - 5 out of 5 Price - 3 out of 5 (I always want everything to be cheaper though. That's the JEW in me) Overall Score: 4 out of 5
