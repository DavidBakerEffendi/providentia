tip: Make a reservation! I was in the area and called to see if they had any room for a 5:30 dinner. unfortunately, they were all booked until 9:30 Â so it was only outdoor seating till then. they do have really powerful heaters outside, but they kept on going out...this may be a bit uncomfortable for some people. now onto the food. we asked to split the clam chowder and they were nice enough to split a bowl into two separate bowls. even then it was enough, being very thick and hearty. I ordered the skate wings with garlic mashed potatoes, which was very good. the skate was a bit light on the seasoning but literally melted in your mouth. i also tried the shrimp scampi which was pretty good, but nothing mind blowing. portions are decently sized but not huge. also, BYOB!
