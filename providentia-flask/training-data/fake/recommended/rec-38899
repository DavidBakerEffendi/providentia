What a great place!  We are in Burlington on a mini vacation and asked the car rental guy where to have lunch.  His recommendation did not disappoint!   The pizza burger was YUMMY and the fries are the best we have ever had.  I cannot say the same about the onion rings. Save the calories and just order fries.
