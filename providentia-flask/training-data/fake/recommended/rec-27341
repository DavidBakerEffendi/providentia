This is usually THE place to go if my friends and I have no where else to go in K-town. In a way, it's like a second home in k-town. I do like the new renovation of the place, but it looks less home-y and more "modern". But, most importantly, there's more room for the crowds of people who hoard in here to eat. The Korean workers here (esp. the men) are the most annoying sticklers for checking ID's to make sure you're over 21 if you purchase alcohol. I was at the register and showed my ID. He asked that my friends show their ID's if they are going to drink. Okay.. so you want me to walk over there and get their ID's to show you? Hello.. I'm at the register and you're holding me up, but you seem confused as to what you want me to do. He seemed so persistent to check all of my friend's ID's for some reason. It really annoyed me! I only come here for the convenience and the "decently" priced food. Kimbap is so damn expensive for the amount you get. The ddeokbokki is extremely oily! It's loaded with chili oil. The soups are okay and the cold meals are not good. Other than that, I'd skip it unless you want a quick meal.
