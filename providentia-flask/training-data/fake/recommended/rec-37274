the great thing about this place is that you can sit outside and stare at all the characters for hours. very cozy indoors as well & they serve above average espresso. the food is too simple and boring, actually, and that's the downfall of rustico. paninis with the same repeating ingredients - it gets old after your third time here because even the first time they are just OK. nutella crepes are also OK - as expected, nothing exciting. iced coffees are def way below average, small and overpriced. bruschetta - also just OK. but come on, if that's on your already teeny-tiny menu it better be tasty and craving-inducing not just OK? ya? i mean it's bruschetta, i can make better at home on a whim. all in all, i like to come here for brunch or an evening meal with a friend when we can sit outside and chat for awhile. i come here despite the food, not because of it.
