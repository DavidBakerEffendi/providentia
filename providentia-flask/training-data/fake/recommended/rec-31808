I had the chicken Senegal (Yassa, I think it was called). And my wife had the sea bass. What I love about Ponty's food is that it all tastes so home made. All was fresh and so damn delicious!! The sea bass didn't taste fishy at all, it was so tender, melts in your mouth. Do come here, meet Cece, and enjoy his creations! The bistro's atmosphere is very comfortable and laid back.
