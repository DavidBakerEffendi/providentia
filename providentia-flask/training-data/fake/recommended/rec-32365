Was not impressed.  We have friends that go here on a regular basis but service was poor on a Tuesday night that we went. Server brought half the salads then later brought the others out.  He asked if I wanted pepper on my salad when I had two leaves left in it.  The really strange thing was when we ordered wine.  We ordered a bottle from the menu and it came out in a carafe.  We asked why it was in a carafe and the water said it was a magnum sized bottle so they put it in a carafe for us.  We never saw him open the bottle.  When we asked to see the bottle, he brought out an unopened bottle of a different brand..so I have no idea what we drank. Food was decent.
