Since this place had so many good reviews i decided to give it a shot, but I  was extremely disappointed. We had curry puffs as an appetizer, which were too oily; I've much better elsewhere; my husband ordered Pad Garlic with tofu. Was ok but somewhat bland and not much garlic.  The worst dish however, was mine, "Ants Climbing a Tree'. The description sounded intriguing but what I received did not resemble the description whatsoever. I ended up with a pile of dry, bland, sour tasting noodles with little or none of the ingredients listed in the menu. Bleh! If I had been dining in I would have sent it back, but i had the meal delivered. In fact when I first opened the container i thought they sent me the wrong dish so I called them up and was assured I had the correct order.
