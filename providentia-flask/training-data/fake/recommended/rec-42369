Freemans may have been hyped beyond belief and there was that Bush Twins rumor, but despite all that it's still good food.  The devils-on-horseback (prunes stuffed with stilton cheese wrapped in bacon) were lovely and the mac and cheese was just like someone's grandma made it.  The wine-by-the-glass choices were good and everything is pretty affordable.  Everyone says it's impossible to get a table, but on a Monday at 6:15 the place was empty.  The waitstaff was really friendly and helpful too.
