This place is fantastic!  Finally, something delicious and not-Greek in this neighborhood (not hating on the Greek, I just like variety).  Almost everything at Sweet Afton is local and they infused several of their own liquors.  I've had several dishes here: spicy pickle snack, fried pickles, mac n' cheese and the little sausages in wrapped in dough.  All were absolutely delicious.   The drinks are also worth writing about...spicy cherry margarita (SERIOUS about the "spicy"!!) and sweet tea (w/ honey and lemon I believe, it makes me wish I had a wraparound porch in Savannah to sit and enjoy this one).  Last time I went, I had hot cider with rum-always a win. Like everywhere else, it's annoying when it's packed but if you can get a table or a seat at the bar, it's pretty cozy and comfortable.  The bartenders are really great: friendly, attentive and fast.
