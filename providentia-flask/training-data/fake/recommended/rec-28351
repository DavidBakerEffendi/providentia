I don't write many reviews, but feel I really have to this time, for this was the most amazing place I've probably been to for a birthday dinner/party.   So I hate celebrating my birthday, but a friend suggested we go here since it seems so laid back and informal.  I figured why not, since it's BYOB I can bring and have as many cosmos as I want, and eat mac and cheese at the same time.  I'm also a very big fan of their fine selection of music.  Normally they don't take reservations, but we checked with the owner and he said they would be able to save us a spot for up to 10 people for 8:00 on a Saturday night, perfect.  I have to say I was a little nervous at first because I had only been here once before for a quick bite, but I have to say, the entire experience was fantastic and everyone in my party thought the same thing.  We sat there for about 3 hours making cocktails and ordering everything on the menu to share, and then our server disappeared, the lights went out, and he comes out with a piece of their coffee cake with a candle in the center, and everyone sang happy birthday.  Really made my night.  This is the most chill spot to get your southern food cravings out of the way, and I will definitely recommend the mac and cheese, as I am originally from Alabama, and will gladly testify that they are doing it correctly.   I would also like to mention that the tab for 9 people to eat, and be totally full, was only $110.  Seriously. I promise I will be visiting this fine establishment again and again and again.
