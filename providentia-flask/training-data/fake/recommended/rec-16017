Oh Tinks, I knew people would fall in love as I did :) there was a short wait and my husband and I sat and enjoyed a WONDERFUL dinner! Again I love being greeted with a smile! Started with the dum plumb drink wowwww I want a take home container! We shared the scallops and tacos and fried chicken...I'm still in love with chicken but those tacos were FIRE! It was so hard picking what to order but that's the joy of coming back and discovering the other dishes. Also the place seemed more kitschy and cute, more Alice in wonderland than before...overall I see I am not the only one who likes this place and will make a reservation next time for their brunch! Don't forget me Tinks! I was one of your first fans!!
