I've gone once with my gluten-intolerant and gluten-tolerant friends, and everyone's loved the pastas here. I don't usually like gluten-free foods (forced to settle when dining with my gluten-intolerant friend), but I loved the gluten-free and regular pastas here -- great texture and great taste. I've tried and loved the Wild Mushroom & Ricotta Ravioli (GF), cappelini w/ shrimp scallop and spicy tomato soup (tried the GF pasta with this), cavatelli w/ sausage and broccoli rabe (tried the non-GF, pasta was al dente and delish), and gnocchi w/ short rib ragu (tried the non-GF, sauce was delish and had a kick to it), side of mushrooms (button mushrooms). Tip for the gluten-intolerant: in addition to the special gluten-free menu, they also offer gluten-free pasta replacements for the other pasta dishes as well!!
