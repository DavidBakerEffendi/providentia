Came here twice to buy lunch home. The kimchi fried rice was what I mostly came here for. It was very spicy in my opinion but it was good. The egg free kimchi pancake wasn't good. Ittasted aa if u just stuffed some dough into your mouth when it is not edible. The kimbap was goos. I usually buy kimbap here. It's cheap and my sister loves it. I would come here more often since now I go to school near here.
