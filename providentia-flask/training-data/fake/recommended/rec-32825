This creative Lebanese/Mediterranean flatiron hot spot may have cooled a bit but that just means it is a bit more tolerable in the way noise level and reservations need not be made one month to the day in advance. This was my second Saturday night dining there and it lived up to expectations and our previous dining experience. The host was incredibly friendly and sat us promptly at 8pm when we arrived. Both the rose sangria and the blues, berries & bubbles cocktails were sure winners in the cocktail department. One of the many fun things about this place is the shared menu format. Hot and cold meze and main plates are categorized as vegetarian, fish, meat. We ordered the grilled octopus, tuna belly meze, the hindbeh-beautifully saut√©ed dandelion greens with pine nuts, the brussel sprouts (to die for), and the arugula Lebanese Thyme salad. All perfect...well seasoned, temperature appropriate. The highlight meze is the atayeh and veal bacon Bellini cum sliders...yum is really all I can say. The two main plates we enjoyed were the diver scallops and lobster hommos-both good, and nicely presented. They were both a bit rich particularly after all of the delicious hot and cold meze. The loup de mer and branzino and lamb dishes are still among my favorites. Too full for dessert...but we will be back. Fun vibe, spacious digs, attentive service. Great bar, Nice wine list and creative cocktails. What could be bad?
