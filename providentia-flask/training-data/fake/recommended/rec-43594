Great place! This place was referred to me by a friend so I dragged another one with my to try it out and woohoo! so yummy! the albondigas are deliiiiicious and the sangria is incredible - very tasty, very dangerous. But you must get it. Great atmosphere. Pretty casual attire, but you can definitely dress it up a bit if you want to. Pretty trendy and a great place to go with a group of friends or a date. I didn't really see families unless the kids were older (late teens) and to be honest I love that (sorry!). Really nice staff - quite attentive but also not all up in your face. Definitely go
