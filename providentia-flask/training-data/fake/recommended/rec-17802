Perfect local bar...doesn't get too busy unless it's Sunday football then I would suggest going early... Most of the bartenders are attentive and work fast .... Fun trivia on Wednesday.. plenty of tv's for sports ... Food is average nothing special ....Need bigger bathrooms not accommodating when they have a crowd.. plenty of parking with own lot and huge lot across the street.
