I don't understand why people love this place so much.  My ex always wanted to go but I never felt like the drama is worth it.  The food is consistently good, I make no arguments about that.  I'm just over the perpetual drama coming from the host stand.  They're never accommodating, friendly or even logical.  Tables in the back room are not bad but in the front you're packed in so tight that excessive maneuvering has to happen in order to sit down.   Worst of all is the lack of space by the bar & the front door.  There's literally nowhere for you to even wait for your table.  You're either struck by the door ever 15 seconds or plowed over by waitstaff barreling through the sardine-can restaurant.   Word of advice, if you're early enough to get a table outside, grab it!  If not, move on.  The grief you'll get from trying to sit at a crowded table is definitely not worth it; there are a ton of great restaurants just around the corner.
