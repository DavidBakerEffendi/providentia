Had a beautiful dinner with some old friends here.  The drinks were solid.  For dinner we had the kale salad and the heirloom apples.  Both excellent.  We also had the chicken and the tile fish. Both excellent.  Portions are on the small side but if you get salad or pork sticky rolls to split you'll be good.
