This place has ok sushi, but for the price its too expensive.  Plainly put, they charge a little too much for the quality.  And their specialty rolls are similar to everywhere else.   But I admit, the Mexican roll is exotic & awesome, and they have a good selection of sake & Asian beers.  Definitely worth going but be expecting to shove out 10-20% more than you would to a place of its caliber.  I guess its high priced because its in old city smh
