Very good beef brisket, juicy, tender, and the sauce is very good. my only complaint is that the BBQ is cold. They probably made this a while ago, and it has been siting there, and they just put some warmed sauce over it. Even though I went during lunch hour. It would taste much better if it's still warm.
