The restaurant was small but the service was fast. My friend recommended this Viet restaurant. I tried the food and it was good. I like the shrimp spring roll. It was refreshing. The beef noodle soup hit the spot! Even though their menu was simple. You can't go wrong with a simple menu, great service, and yummy food.
