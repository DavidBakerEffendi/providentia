the artichokes and octopus for apps were amazing.  I had the Fusilli alla Caprese for dinner - very simple, but fantastic - esp combined with the sides (sautéed kale, the brussel sprouts, and the roasted sweet potatoes).  the desert was amazing - we sampled the Baked Meringue, the Tiramisu, and the various gelatos.  And the L'Esotico cocktail by Cyllan and Lorenzo was just amazing!  we had a great evening together!
