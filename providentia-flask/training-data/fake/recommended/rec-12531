Often imitated but never duplicated. Make sure they're the dudes wearing the yellow SWEATERS otherwise they're not the real deal! We tried a different halal cart on the opposite street corner and it just didn't taste the same. The flavor of the rice was off and the consistency of the chicken just wasn't doing it for me. The lines are almost always massively long everytime I've gone. My usual: Chicken over rice. No salad, no white sauce. Pack on the red hot sauce!
