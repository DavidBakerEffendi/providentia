Our standby place in Rittenhouse for four reasons: (1) Tables always seem available without a reservation (I never plan in advance.) (2) Perfect Old Fashion (not to sweet, just enough orange, made with care) (3) My favorite calamari ever (spicy peppers, lightly fried, never chewy, creamy sauce) (4) Solid burger served on a cutting board Plus, the service is top-notch and nothing I've had has ever really disappointed. The market vegetable curry is also a great choice. While it is just vegetables and rice (some tofu might be nice), the sauce is outstanding. Personally, I think that the food is better than Audrey Claire (the sister restaurant). Also, the redesigned space with the black & white dog photos and leather yellow sofas makes you feel classy, not stuffy, the moment you step inside.
