Wow- amazingly cheap and absolutely delicious. Came here for new year's dinner with my boyfriend and we were blown away with the incredible food and amazing service. The lamb was out of the world but I was most blown away with the appetizers. We had grilled feta and incredibly flavorful meatballs. The feta in the greek salad was so fresh- it reminded me of being back on the greek islands for vacation. The place itself looks like you've landed on Mykonos. Lovely, lovely dinner spot on the UWS.
