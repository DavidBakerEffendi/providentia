Came here on a Thursday night with my sister and they said it would be an hour and a half wait, but only ended up waiting for about 40 minutes. We ordered some drinks, the caesar salad, house pickle plate, thin fries, the original burger, and the hatch burger. The burgers were delicious and perfectly cooked. The pickle plate was good, but the pickled spicy green beans were the best. The caesar salad was just ok. The thin fries were delicious and an excellent compliment to the burgers. The wait may seem long, but stick it out - it's definitely worth it!
