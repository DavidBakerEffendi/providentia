Four, count 'em, 4, Indian restaurants within a block of each other on Bloomfield Avenue, and not one of the proprietors can tell me why or even seems concerned. But of the four--Satish Palace, Aroma, Chatni, and Mausaum--Chatni has the best touch with classic Indian dishes like saag and curies. It's also a place that's not afraid to serve truly spicy food if the diner requests it, and that I appreciate a lot.
