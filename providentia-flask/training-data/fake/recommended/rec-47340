I waited for a very long time to try this!! Every time I tried to go when I was in town, the wait was way too long. So this time, a friend made a reservation for 9 of us a month in advance for the pork dinner. It was everything I expected and more. The pork was cooked to perfection. So much juicy flavor & all the side banchan dishes complemented it perfectly. I would like to go back again and order more of the other dishes too.
