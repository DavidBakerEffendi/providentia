okay, I thought I'd write a review because you all were waay too generous in yours. the atmosphere was nice, but nothing to write home about in nyc. the wine was decent, however the calamari was super dry--much less succulent than any cheaper calamari I've had in the past. my friend's pasta dish was good, but it was a tiny portion and overpriced considering that I can make whole wheat pasta with parmesan cheese at home. my lamb dish was the driest, toughest lamb I've ever had. maybe we had bad luck ordering, but I wouldn't risk going back at this point.
