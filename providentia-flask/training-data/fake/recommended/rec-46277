Went to MF last night for the first time and WOW, all I can say is WOW! From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere and ambiance is so warm, rustic, and vintage charm. My bf and I sat outside on the raised sidewalk patio and it was adorable. Now...to the good part.. THE FOOD. Honestly, each dish was better then the next. We got the oysters, spanish octopus/calamari, and chili lobster. If I was in nyc now, i'd go back and get the chili lobster RIGHT NOW! It was AMAZINGGGG. For entrees, the halibut was equally amazing and my bf loved his bass. And lastly, being the s'mores lover that I am, I happily endulged in the s'mores and was not asked to share by my bf (thank goodness bc I wanted every last bit of the s'mores goodness) :p Walking home, my bf and I BOTH agreed, MF was hands down the BEST place we've ever eaten. How the HELL does anyone five this place less then 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!
