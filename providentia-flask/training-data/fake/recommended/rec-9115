Really like the vibe here.  A thank you is followed by an honest you're welcome. Seems too easy right? I think it's little things like this that go unnoticed in the city. Nice chilly harpoon Ipa on tap surrounded by cool peeps.  This is a quiet laid back bar to kick back a few and talk to whomever.
