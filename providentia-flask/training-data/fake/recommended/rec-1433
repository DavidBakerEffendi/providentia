Food was delicious and the service was good.  I went with a party of six. on a Wednesday night, to celebrate one of our colleagues. Everybody liked their food and the waitress was kind and attentive enough.  We all cleaned our plates. The atmosphere is pretty cool too. It's nice to go to a restaurant in a neighborhood where it is easy to find parking. I'm really surprised by some of the other reviews that have slammed this restaurant.
