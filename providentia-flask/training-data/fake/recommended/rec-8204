The market is cute, the food is decent, and the price is reasonable. But the service leaves something to be desired. You go up to the counter and place your order and pay, then go sit down. They bring you your food when it's ready - seems pretty standard? Except they have no way of knowing who ordered what, so the servers just wander around asking random tables if they ordered the item currently being delivered. It doesn't make sense, because there is a stack of numbers beside the cash, but they don't seem to be used, ever. You can take one if you want, but it's in no way attached to your order, so it's really just for show. It's something that could be so easily remedied, but not doing so means longer wait times for customers, and often, cold food. It's a great location, with a beautiful view of the lake, but making this one change could really make a world of difference.
