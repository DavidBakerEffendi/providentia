spotted: new food truck in Midtown East! $7 got me a Merguez Sandwich: juicy lamb sausage and savory roasted veggies on a soft doughy baguette. rather strange texture for a baguette (i hear baguette, i expect crusty), but it was perfect for sopping up all the yummy juices. the finger-lickin' good 'wich came in a plenty satisfying size for my weekday lunch. you know it's a good meal when you cant wait 'til you get home to eat it. i tore through that sucker on the train with abandon and attracted not just a few hungry on-lookers. good luck, chef samir! hope business goes well.
