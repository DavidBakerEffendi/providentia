It's 4 in the morning, you haven't met anyone worthwhile during your night out, and you're with your wingman wondering what to do until your next train home. What better than some $7 fatty chicken and rice with good ol' heart attack in a bottle, also known as "White Sauce" complimented by spicy, hot sauce that many mistake for barbecue sauce (I've done this twice, but only regretted it once). If you don't mind waiting about an hour for "the original" chicken and rice halal cart, be my guest. If you're not really a fan of long lines and don't mind un-originality, I invite you to grab chicken and rice from the "wannabe" halal cart that's one block away with 1/2 or maybe even 1/4 the line. Apparently, the late night "ghetto dog" of LA rivals NYC's original chicken and rice, but since I've yet to visit LA, this place will always have my heart at 4am.
