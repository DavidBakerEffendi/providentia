We split a cheesesteak (w cheese, onions, peppers, and some other stuff) and a thing of fries to eat inside. As we waited, we watched someone cook up an order of Spanish fries and we knew we had to come back to try these - fries with onions and peppers. By the time our own food came, we feasted like we were loading up for the week and barely managed to finish our respectable halves. Totally satisfying, mouthwatering, and I'm almost chewing on the insides of my cheeks just writing this. I totally want some right now!
