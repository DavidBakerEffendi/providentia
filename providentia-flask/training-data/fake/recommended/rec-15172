Wow, spicy sour pork noodles... I think I have a new favorite dish. Spicy, sour, flavor, fresh noodles... Who could ask for more? Can't wait to go back and try some other specialties. Informative bar manager/server, sounds like many exciting things to come and some where I'll spend many an evening. FYI, floor one bar and casual small tables, floor two more formal dining, floor three is/will be private karaoke.
