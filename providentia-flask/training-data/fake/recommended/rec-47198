Let me say off the bat that their MENU LOOKS AMAZING. I love how there's so much variety from burgers to snacks to sandwiches to salads, etc. And BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY? YES, PLEASE. I DON'T NEED ME A HANGOVER TO AGREE TO THAT! KALE CAESAR SALAD--A pretty MEDIOCRE HEFTY SERVING of salad. The CROUTONS were OLD, STALE, AND SOFT. There were NO OTHER TOPPINGS so it made the salad very BORING. Also, I think kale salads are a better complement with vinaigrettes because the caesar dressing made the leaves very DRY TASTING. The KALE also tasted a bit ROUGH AND RAW? Idk, maybe it was just me, but I've had better kale salads in my days. GRITS & EGGS BREAKFAST BOWL--I really like the idea of the breakfast bowl. Slap all your favorite fried, greasy things in a deep and cheap bowl and you'll be good. It's also an option I've never seen other American (Traditional) places do so it's nice to see the menu go off the beaten path. The GRITS were TASTY and WELL SEASONED. The scrambled EGGS were TOO OILY for me and there was nothing special about them besides the fact that my mom cooks them the same way? The SAUSAGE was DELICIOUS but I wished they sliced them a bit thicker! The bowl is small but DECEPTIVELY DEEP so you can definitely SHARE this! The food came very QUICK and the SERVICE was GOOD. Try a LEMONADE on a hot, summer day! So REFRESHING. Ask for the SPECIALS too...they had 3 specials that sounded very dirty south soul food that I wanted to try! Next time, I'm going to try the fried chicken for sure.
