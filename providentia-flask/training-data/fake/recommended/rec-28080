If you're a little tipsy and you get that craving for greasy food at 2am, this is the place to go!! When I was in college and we were just sick of school, we would take a nice walk from Columbus Circle to 53rd Street at 1am, and just eat their delicious food! They are well-known for a reason, I definitely recommend this little cart.
