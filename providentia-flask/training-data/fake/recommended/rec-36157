I left this place in a dumpling coma. We had a sesame pancake with duck, hot n sour soup and about 6 orders of dumplings. My favorite was the pork and green onion soup dumplings. I could have just eaten the slice of pancake by itself! Since it was raining and a bit early, we didn't have to wait in line and we secured a spot on the wall with stools to eat inside. There are bottles with soy, vinegar and sriracha to whip up your own sauce for dunking. It's a small place and if you sit against the wall you're right by the trash can. If it wasn't pouring rain I would have got the food to go. We spent less than 20$ after all that food and 2 drinks. Unreal! Cash only.
