I came here for the first time for brunch last Sunday and it was a delightful experience in every way. Â I sat at the bar, it was a lovely day, I could look out into the street from where I was sitting..appreciating the lovely fall weather. Then I was served the "behind the knees cocktail" which was just perfect. I decided on the eggs orleans since I love eggs benedict..I ordered them without the oysters, and asked for a side of the duck confit. Wow, it was indeed the best version of eggs benedict I have ever tasted. I happen to also love artichokes, and this is the first time I had this dish incorporated them in it. .I was in heaven..The hollandaise was excellent and the side order of duck confit was also the best I ever tasted, and rare to find. This place can be described as understated elegance, comfortable but not stuffy, with a gourmet flair. The staff all work together beautifully. Congrats to you all, and the chef, on this delightful experience
