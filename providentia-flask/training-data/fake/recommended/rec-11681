Yes, you do have to wait but really, what good ramen house ever comes without a wait? If you are a ramenaholic, I know you don't mind waiting.  Immediate gratification pales in comparison to the gratitude your tongue experiences at the first sip of mouthwatering, perfectly brewed tonkotsu broth.  You know what I'm talking about!  It meets my slurp every last drop of broth only to want just a little more test. It was my first time there so I had to get the Classic.  If I am lucky to go again, I may try others but it's so hard to give up a good thing in search of something better. Don't forget to get the shishito peppers. . . .tasty little buggers tossed in oil and salt!  Perfect way to whet the appetite for ramen.
