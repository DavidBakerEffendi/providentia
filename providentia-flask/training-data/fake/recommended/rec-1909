nothing special, my mom ordered from Pats which took about an hour and i ordered from Genos, nothing special between the two, the reviews are very misleading for both restaurants, nothing special with Philly Cheesesteak, i would rather have my NY cheesesteak which is loaded with meet and cheese both Pats and Genos were real oily, low in cheese and low in meet, maybe i just had a bad sandwich you say? i ordered 8 for four people, they were consistent with all 8, real disappointed
