Ok update . Its been a week and I had to go back to Brooklyn for more islands ! Its was a lovelyday to stroll down the street and enjoy the neighboring cherry blossoms ..and stop by to visit my new favorite place out of Manhattan .. This time I was able to try their delicious spianch flavored roti  is gi normous  and is folded over 3 times cuz its so freaken  huge . It had an amazing texture and smell ..   The Calypso shrimp was hearty and thick like potage and reminded me of a much  improved clam chowder. I slurped up all the sauce from the jerk chicken .. And used the roti as an edible utensil ! Finally you must try the bread pudding ! Just a whiff and you'll know why . This thing was huge ! 3 inches thick and 4 across on each side !so that's 4 x 4 x 3 . It had a beautiful rum  flavor very distinct and not too sweet ...  complimented my meal with a happy ending .. I heart this place ! Sighs *
