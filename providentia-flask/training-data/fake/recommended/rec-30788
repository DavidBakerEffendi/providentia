Had some pretty mediocre food there tonight.  Our soup was good, salad was a bit overspiced (had asked for not spicy).  But the pad thai with calamari was not great.  The calamari had NO taste. Then they brought us yellow curry with shrimp when we had ordered it with chicken.  Getting 25% of your order wrong is never a good sign.  We needed to catch a movie, so they quickly made us the chicken curry, but the potatoes were not fully cooked and the chicken was tasteless.
