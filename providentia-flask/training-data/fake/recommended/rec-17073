I salsa'd  into this little slice of Havana with my extended Puerto Rican family 2 abuelas 2 sobrinos mi mamita y los suegros. The owner took care of us like we were family rapidly made room even though it was packed, and sat us within 5-10 min. The ambiance was crazy Caribbean. So don't come to ponder the universe.  This is culinary equivalent of a nascar race loud crazy and fun!   The food was flavorful and plentiful. The prices were reasonable and the staff attentive. Dos thumbs up!
