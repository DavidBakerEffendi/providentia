This is one of my favorite restaurant/bars.  Love this place.  Great selection of scotch and bourbon and the cocktails are very nice and creative.  Also lots of unique imported bottled beer.  I would say the food and atmosphere is Scottish, they serve classics like Shepherd's pie, beef wellington, Scotch egg alongside some random Italian influences and ingredients.  One can find things on the menu like blue crab and prawns on toast, butternut squash risotto with lockerbie and marscapone, burrata salad, a whipped ricotta pot to spread on bread and really great smoked pork chops with the best mac n cheese in the city made with Scottish cheddar and grain mustard.   All in all, everything's done really well.   Very courteous staff and bar service.  It's a bit pricey but not bad.  The clientele is mostly well dressed shirt tucked professionals, Gen X crowd.  Not many young students or kids.  I would gladly pay a little more for it to remain that way.
