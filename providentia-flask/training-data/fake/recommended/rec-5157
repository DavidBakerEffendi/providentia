Most aspects of this place from the food to the outdoor seating to the service deserve 5 stars. A few dishes maybe deserve 4 stars. The one thing I was surprised by was the portions were fairly large so I'd recommend ordering less than you usually would. There are several amuse bouche and bread courses so that adds to the amount of food.
