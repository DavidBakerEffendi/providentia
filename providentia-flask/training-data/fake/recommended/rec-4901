I've been to Memphis Taproom 3 times, so far. I think the food is great, the service is great (knowledgable staff), and the atmosphere rocks! I love visiting bars and restaurants where everyone seems to be in a great mood. Though it's loud, we'll say boisterous, it's welcoming and lively! The food is consistently great. I try something new each time. I remember the first time, I had the pork sandwich, expecting pork bbq, and it wasn't with bbq, but it was still delicious, and hot! I had the chicken fingers dinner with mac and cheese the second time - equally scrumptious. Then, yesterday, I was there for the no-repeat week (beers on tap). I had the Mams's Little Yellow Pill, I think. Very smooth, yet tasty, light-hearted beer. Started with the cheddar soup with a cider touch, and I haven't had soup that great this entire winter season! I fell in love with the battered dill pickles dipped in Horseradish sauce. Loved. Them. My brisket burger was not too big, as some gastropubs seem to do to me (I am small!!), but not too small, either. Just right. I almost cleaned my plate. Go here.
