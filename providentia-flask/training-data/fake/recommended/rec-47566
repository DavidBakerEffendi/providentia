This place was El Bandito, which also had operations in Spring Valley, New York. The former owners realized that it had to compete with the Valley Italian Restaurants of Orange Valley. Well the new owners, must be oblivious to their surroundings. Gone are the good service, the great portions, and friendly atmosphere. The waiters spent more time looking at the NBA game behind the bar rather then tending to their customers. This place went down fast since the new family bought it from the previous owners. I thought, I would bring a visiting Mexican friend over, just to test the food and "IT SUCKED BIG TIME!" according to my friend. I was embarassed and took Â them to a Ironbound Spanish restaurant , because of the guilt :( and shame. Go else where for your Mex-fare, gone are the days of El Bandito. Aaaah dios mio!
