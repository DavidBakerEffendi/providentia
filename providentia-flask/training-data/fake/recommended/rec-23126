Interesting, when you walk in, take a right and go through the doors, this ain't no diner, its a martini bar.  Very elegant and nice.  The place was packed on the diner and martini side, this is always a good sign. I took a client there for lunch on his recommendation.  I started with a great cup on onion soup....  Very tasty and had a sweet flavor.  I then  had a killer southwestern salad.  The chipolte ranch was sweet and spicy.  I ordered shrimp on top, they were eight giant grilled shrimp.   The service was outstanding, the food was excellent.   The bad news - pricey!  My salad was $14+$8(shrimp).  I am not sure that it was a $22 salad.  It was great food, and great on an expense account, but I would probably head somewhere else if it was on my dime.
