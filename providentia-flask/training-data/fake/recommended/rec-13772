I have been going to Clinton Street since they used to have a chess set in the window, encouraging you to linger, so heed me when I tell you know what's good here.  Pancakes (though sometimes undercooked, and a bit overpriced), bacon is great, the Spanish scramble is amazing -- I get it with a biscuit on the side instead of toast (costs extra). A word about the biscuits: you should generally have them heat it up, because it can be dry-ish.  The only exception is when it comes fresh out of their oven... then there are simply no words for its goodness. Red flannel hash is also great ( and wicked expensive).
