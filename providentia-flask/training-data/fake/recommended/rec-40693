I have to give these folks 5 stars as the ambiance, service and food was excellent. I originally yelped the area and found something down the street, but after walking up the street and seeing this area bustling with activity and packed restaurants we were side tracked. Really what did it was as we walked by we saw a large stone bowl full of guacamole and the promise of blood orange margaritas we stopped in our tracks. Glad we did. Our server was attentive and full of suggestions and positive energy. This place was packed and he didn't miss a beat. I had 2 glasses of red sangria, my friend had a blood orange frozen margarita (both were excellent!). We then shared the Oscar de la Hoja guac, an open faced shrimp quesadilla and tortilla soup. All was excellent and with generous portions it was perfect for us two ladies. The bill was about $50 including the libations and we tipped generously as the service was fun and unbeatable. Â  Its obvious this is a favorite with the locals. Great energy, beautiful place and it was a good mixed crowd. Large bar, outdoor seating and pet friendly on the outdoor tables. A must when you are in the city.
