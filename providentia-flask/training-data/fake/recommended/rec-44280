Tucked away in an old house, Chao Chao serves lighter Tawainese fare that's perfect for a first date or night out with the girls. Some things to watch out for: 1) The downstairs wine bar area is where it's at, apparently. Our server didn't offer to seat us there, but my date and I eagerly snagged a two-person table on the first floor, thinking we'd beat the dinner time rush. Sadly, all the patrons who came in after us headed enthusiastically to the floor below, where I imagine live dancers must sprinkle fairy powder into bottomless drinks. There's nothing wrong with the first floor, except perhaps the near-constant consultations between servers and newly arrived guests. You would have a hard time forgetting you're in a restaurant, that's for sure. 2) The menu doesn't strive to be unique. Most courses are classic Tawainese/Chinese dishes, so asking the server for recommendations or to recap crowd favorites can make ordering easier. Our server reassured us that the soup dumpling and eggplants were headline items, so we went with those. I wouldn't hesitate to come here if you're a vegetarian or even a vegan, as many of their most appetizing plates were meat-less and dairy-less (that second condition pretty common for Asian restaurants, where the chefs too are likely a little or a lot lactose intolerant.) 3) Wine with dinner is wholly unnecessary. The food really shines on its own. The wine bar might be good on its own, especially for a group outing, but skip the $8 glass and order another appetizer instead! Service was accommodating but timely, if that makes sense. As in, we got our food when we started flipping our heads around, salivating, and we thought the apps and main courses were very appropriately timed. We will be back!
