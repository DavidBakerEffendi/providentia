Perfect quick lunch! I stopped in for an order of Spaghetti alla Bolognese for my wife and I to split for lunch. Great ambiance, really friendly staff, quick service, and the food was outstanding. Especially liked the fact that the Bolognese didn't contain any pork, which my wife doesn't eat. Getting Bolognese without pork has been hit or miss for us in Dallas, so it's always nice to find somewhere when we're traveling that makes it without pork. Decent prices, especially for where it is, the entree was $17 and was plenty of food for us to split. For being right off of Times Square, this was quite a bargain, in my opinion! Â  I'm not 100% sure that we'll be back on this trip, because our time here is short and we've got a ton of other places we want to visit for a meal, but it's definitely going to be on our list for return visits in the future!
