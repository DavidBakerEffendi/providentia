We ate a lot of meat that day. Don't ask me what most of what it was...all I remember is that there was a lot of it, and it went real fast. Especially with their spicy sauce (they have a full self-serve sauce table). And especially that brisket... such succulence men should never know. I'd suggest eating in vs taking out, as the meat just isn't the same without the temperature and fresh smokiness. There is plenty of seating both upstairs and down, and multiple TVs as well to catch a game one afternoon.
