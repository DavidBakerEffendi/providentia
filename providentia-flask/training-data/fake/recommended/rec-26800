After watching Man V Food, I thought I had to go to Reading Market and try the Roast Pork with Broccoli Rabe at DiNic's. Well, I finally got a chance to go to Philly and had that and their Brisket with Sharp Provolone and Roasted Green Peppers. The RP is pretty good. My first thought was, "It's not BBQ (no spice, no smoke), but only BBQ is BBQ." It's good, but not excellent, not OMG OMG, and not good enough to replace the Cheese Steak as Philly's sandwich. The pork could use a little kick. The broccoli rabe is naturally bitter, so again this sandwich needs a little something something more. The cheese was by far the most flavorful component followed by the dip in Au jus. The biggest disappointment is in the bread. Adam Rich was nice when he said the bread didn't over power the sandwich. If the goal is to get a well balanced taste, goal achieved. But c'mon, a sandwich needs good bread, especially an ITALIAN sandwich, it wants good bread! It's not like they have to travel far to get some (hello? we're in a food market). As for the Brisket, it wasn't as good as the Pork Sandwich. Brisket is definitely average, not too moist, not too dry. (Sometimes average brisket is good, because most places mess it up so badly!) They put a little sauce to give some flavor but again, it's the cheese that saves the day from it being a very average sandwich. I don't know if I'm being too critical, but if you're on Prime Time TV, you gotta be Prime Time and deliver. Don't believe the hype... After 3 years, I've changed my rating to 3 stars from 2. Since then, Adam Richman has named the Roast Pork THE BEST SANDWICH IN AMERICA. You be the judge.
