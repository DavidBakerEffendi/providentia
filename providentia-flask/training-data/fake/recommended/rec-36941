Only a block away from the 6 train stop we emerged from in Soho, Balthazar simply appeared before us like a beacon on the corner, and with our native New Yorker saying she had heard many good things about it, it wasn't too hard to say yes to the idea of lunching there. The decor was so authentically Parisian, not unlike many other French bistros in New York, but it was big too, with beautiful high ceilings, tiled floors, and well-kept banquets, tables, and chairs.  We had to wait at the bar for ten minutes while watching the clock tick down to lunch time at eleven, although they also serve breakfast, which looks as equally delicious as our food was. For lunch we went a little cheaper than our waiter probably would have preferred, only opting for three sandwiches--the lamb sandwich, the chicken club, and the cheeseburger.  Each one was superb, with the burger being my favorite, followed by the lamb sandwich (which had on it a delicious, spicy mayonnaise), and then the chicken club.  My only complaint about the chicken club was that it wasn't salted at all, which made the avocado difficult to discern.  The fries that accompanied were divine, like McDonald's but without the touch of Satan. Our server was, as others have pointed out, a bit on the hungover side, with a raspy voice that hinted at a night of copious cigarette drags, and he couldn't have been more than 25.  Still, he was professional, gracious, and attentive... and cute!  So really, nothing to complain about, and what do I care what our server does with his off time as long as he doesn't puke on me. The wine list is quite extensive as well, and the bar stocked with a wide assortment of great aperitifs, liquors, and beers.  There is an excellent deal on draft beers where a 24oz. Imperial pint costs only $9, a true bargain in lower Manhattan. We left truly pleased, and I would highly recommend this bistro to anyone looking to spend their lunchtime in Soho.  Just perfect!
