After being harassed by an entire troup of d-bags at Eulogoy, I was ready to get the hell out of the area but wanted a drink.  Like NOW.  So we ended up walking in here - the place was welcoming and I loved the name (I will totally buy a wine I know nothign about if I like the label). I liked the atmosphere in here.  Mellow, quiet.  Groups of people just talking quietly and enjoying themselves.  The fireplace smelled great and was a huge boost in the ambience department.  It's a little spot of goodness in an area that otherwise leaves me feeling disappointed. The bartender was great - I can't recall his name (but he was adorable and should totally be my boyfriend.  At least until Ryan Gosling realizes that he wants to marry me).  But I told him what I was in the mood for and he suggested and then made a really good cocktail (a Vesper) that hit the spot.  He also suggested SoutWwark's when I talked about going to Apothecary.  In retrospect, I wish I had taken him up on his suggestion. I didn't eat here but I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the drink (and the bartender - hee).
