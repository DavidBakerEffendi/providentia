Finally we got to try a real good Philly Cheesesteak. a bunch of guys from outta town decided to stop there for a real Philly experience (believe me ordering IS an experience) my Provolone wit was fantastic (that bun is so fresh it makes a world of difference) and do they serve you fast, make sure you're ready and don't slow down the line... size of the sandwich could of been bigger (that is my only complaint) hesitated to cross the street and try Geno's but let just say i was persuated NOT to go!! i'm sure you can get a better bigger cheesesteak somewhere, but this was a legit sandwich in a historic institution!! 4 stars
