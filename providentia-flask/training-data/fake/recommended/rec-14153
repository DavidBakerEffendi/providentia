i make it a moral obligation and a strict principle not to eat lebanese food in nyc. why? because i'm lebanese and i can't help comparing prices and quality to the food back home, which translates into much more expensive for considerably crappier food. plus, i cook most dishes much better myself, thanks to my mom's perseverance with her teaching me lebanese cooking. that being said, ilili is really out of this world! i mean, you won't even find food this good back home. it's like lebanese high cuisine. every dish i've had, from the brussels sprouts to the raw kibbeh, including the grilled lamb kebab, was orgasmic. their drinks are quite fantastic too. the decor is quite lush too. the major downside is that with great cuisine come great prices. this place is fairly expensive (at least for my budget), which keeps me from heading back there. luckily i was invited that night! and it's definitely not my kind of crowd or the type of place that i'd hang out in. but if you can afford it, then by all means, don't miss out on the best lebanese food around. i wish i'd get richer... in the meantime, i'll console myself with mamoun's awesome falafel.
