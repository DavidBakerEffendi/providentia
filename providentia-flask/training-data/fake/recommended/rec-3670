artichoke and pancetta.  breakfast pizzas.  this spot is excellent for either dinner or brunch.  you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  waitstaff can be a bit aloof - one waitress in particular is perfectly burnt out and narcissistic at the same time.  but the food always comes out fast and hot.   a lot more space here than it looks like from the outside, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.
