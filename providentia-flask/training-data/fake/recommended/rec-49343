Do you remember when the Great Wall was the size of a closet in the very back of the grocery store? With the sticky floors and constant smell of oil? I do. But now it has totally changed. But before I talk about that, fyi the good old reliable steam table with a variety of selections is still there. If you don't know what I'm talking about, Great Wall has a medium sized steam table with different chinese classics (mapo tofu, garlic eggplant, steamed fish, fried giant shrimp) as well as sweet and sour tofu. You can pick 2 selections and have it with rice and soup for a very very reasonable amount. Not very hot, but for this price who could complain. Now let's talk about the new. As a previous reviewer mentioned, they have the incredibly cheap sweat bean buns you can get to go (they're def. less than a dollar and delicious). They also have dim sum brunches on the weekend! Waitresses come around with a cart and offer you diff. dim sum selections. You get a little piece of paper and for every plate, they stamp your ticket which is eventually comes out to your bill. I'm a huge fan of their rice noodle beef roll with a squirt of oyster sauce along with the spicy, thinly cut tongue. In short, go there if only for the bean buns and dim sum brunches.
