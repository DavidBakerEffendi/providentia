I randomly discovered Luna last week on my walk back to the office from Herald Square and was thoroughly impressed with both the friendly service and selection of drinks. Since then, I've managed to stop by 4 times for their delicious matcha tea, which is made with soy milk and not too sweet just as I like. The decor is modern and welcoming, a nice detour from the random mix of stores on the block (jewlery and handbag wholesalers from china, halal restaurant, cigar shop and budget hotels). Totally recommend luna 29
