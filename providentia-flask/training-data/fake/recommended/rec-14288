eh. i thought this place was ok. but you know what the say the sequel is just not as good as the original. came here today with a friend of mine...same decor as the original, bench style seating, long row table full of chairs. i came for lunch so it wasn't that busy. tried the toasted nori rice bowl with berkshire pork. it was good. the rice was nice and sticky, just how i like it. the meal was inexpensive. $14 for my rice bowl and a smart water. you can't complain. though the restaurant is located in a very unassuming spot of the east village...13th and 2nd ave. i have no idea what's really over there...i only came there for the restaurant...knowing that it was a david chang spin-off...and i should've abstained and stuck with the original. maybe it was my meal, the lunch menu or the fact that it was a dreary day today...but i see this place only as marginal and would only consider going back if my meal was comp'd.
