Superb coffee!! Almost orgasmic...I had a macchiato so good! Salami sandwich is my favorite but turkey Tacchino is awesome too! The baristas are super nice and hot and have redefined coffee to be more than just a boost of caffeine but something to enjoy anytime of the day!The back patio area is really nice and the music atmosphere is amazing. Restroom is a big plus :)
