I was at Jose's for a late dinner a few months ago, around 9pm on a weeknite, the downstairs eating area was fairly empty, which was nice for a quiet casual dinner. At one point during the dinner, a HERD of mice came running through the dining area. Note that a herd of mice is about 10 mice. Yup, there were literally 10 mice just running around going crazy for crumbs in there. Needless to say I have not been back since this experience, hopefully they have taken care of their mice problem since then, but I'm not going back to risk it.
