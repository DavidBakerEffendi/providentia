Chicken Broth ramen? Don't doubt the taste - it is amazing. I came to Totto Ramen not expecting much, as I've experienced tons of great ramen in LA in Little Tokyo. I ordered the Paitan Ramen, just because I wanted to be able to taste the broth without any extras in it. I took one sip and .. AMAZING. The broth was creamy, rich, and bursting with flavor despite the fact that they use chicken to cook it. There weren't giant fatty oil drops floating around like in most ramen bowls, and the bowl had the perfect amount of saltiness. For the first time I didn't feel like I was giving myself cardiovascular disease from the excess amount of sodium in ramen. The noodles were cooked to the perfect hardness, the nori they gave was generous and fresh, and they gave a plentiful amount of chicken in the soup. Overall I think this place only has lower reviews because the ramen broth is much different than what everyone is used to. But seriously, they make a BOMB bowl of ramen. ..And if anyone needs more convincing - It's healthier! (Or as healthy as ramen can get...)
