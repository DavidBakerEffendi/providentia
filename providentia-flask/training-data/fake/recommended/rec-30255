I work in the area and eat breakfast/lunch or get drinks here probably 4 times a week because it's great!  The servers are always busy but very friendly and most importantly, they remember you.  If you go in for breakfast often, they'll know exactly what you order and how you take your coffee, which is pretty nice for NYC.  I highly recommend the fried egg sandwich for breakfast, fish tacos for lunch, and the cocktails, no matter what time of day, are so so so fantastic!!
