The steak and cheese grinder is pretty good.  I will get that again.  The mofongo is probably the worst in ever had.  Overcooked, too dense and extremely salty, rendering it inedible. The potato ball was OK at best.  The accupuria was one of the better ones I've had outside of Puerto Rico but nothing great.  The rice was cooked well,  but again salty.  The red beans were lacking flavor.  The pork chops were pretty good.  Some things are hit and miss at this place.  I will be back for the steak grinder but that's it.  This place is Dominican food,  maybe it's supposed to be very salty.  I'm used to this food the Puerto Rican way.  Give it a shot maybe it will be your cup of tea.  It has potential and the employees are nice.
