All I can say is CHICKENNNNN, I'm a fan of chicken and this is tasty stuff here. Came with a deal (Gilt). "The Deal": 2 orders of fingers: Bada Bing, fiesta fingers. Â  2 sides: Green salad (for measure) and Purple sweet potato fries 2 slaws: carrot slaw, spicy slaw, and original 2 drinks: water and strawberry juice 1 awesome taste experience The bada bing was huge and delicious. The fiesta was a party in the boca. The salad was clean, not sure if there was a dressing. Purple sweet taters we awesome, little sticky but yummers. Slaws were tasty. Strawberry juice was nice and refreshing. This was shared between myself and my lady and we had remainders. Portions are good and you're getting organic quality stuff. I dig it!
