Had a reservation for seven people at dinner. Promptly seated downstairs and the food was amazing. The roast chicken, paella, and ceviche were all excellent, and service was professional and fast. Was a huge hit with our group. Will definitely be back. Taking one star off because it was so incredibly dim downstairs - would prefer to see my food!
