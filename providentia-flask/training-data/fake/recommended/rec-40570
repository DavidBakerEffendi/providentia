My favorite trendy Mexican in Philly. I've tried all of the guacs, but the classic is always my favorite. During the nice weather, if you're one of the lucky few who can grab a nice table outside, it's like winning the lottery! For now during the winter, I've been sticking with my classics -- sea bass tacos and a Pineapple Canela at one of awesome bar seats. So umptous!! Not to mention great people watching :)
