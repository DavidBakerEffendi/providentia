Weirdly cute name for a dining restaurant but who cares when their Fried Chicken and Waffle combo is to die for. The cocktails are quite refreshing too. Too bad we were stuffed after our meal and couldn't try any desserts but will def go back soon with friends! This place has a very cool/ casual/divey vibe and prices are reasonable as well. Loved it!
