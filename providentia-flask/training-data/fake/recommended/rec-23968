This place is good. I wouldn't say it's great. But it is pretty good. The margaritas are great, however. I tried the seitan bbq, and I had three sides of I think baked beans, potato salad, and coleslaw. The slaw was really tasty and fresh and crunchy. I loved the potato salad, I think there was bacon it in. I do not remember. Also, I must add that I am a pickle HATER. I hate those evil spawn of cucumbers so hard. However, my bf got the pickle chips and made me try them after a few margaritas and they are reallllly good. A+ on the making the pickles more appealing to us haters. I will definitely be back.
