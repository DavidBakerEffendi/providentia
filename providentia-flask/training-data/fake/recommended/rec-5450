Haven't eaten here but as far as a music venue goes, this is one of my favorites.  It's got the right amount of dive-y feel to it.  Love the balcony area - it's my favorite spot to watch from.  The cider isn't cheap ($6) but if I could choke down a Kenzinger then I'd only have to spend half that, which is a good beer deal.  The concerts are well-priced to make this a regular thing for me, which is awesome, and they bring in great people - both well-known (e.g., Mates of State) and less so (Admiral Fallow).  Never had a problem with the sound quality.  Love the photo booth too!
