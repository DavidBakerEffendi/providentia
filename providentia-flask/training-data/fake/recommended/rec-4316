So I finally stopped in to Village Whiskey. It was my birthday and I was super hyped to have what I thought might be the best burger of my life. It was my first visit here and I loved the place based on first impressions. Great beer and whiskey selection and a delicious selection on the menu. It took a little while for the busy bartender to take our drink order, and then again for our food order. He was pretty busy so I'm ok with waiting. I ordered a standard village burger, medium, without the thousand island dressing. I also ordered an order of the duck fat French fries. When the food finally arrived, my bun def had thousand island on it. The bartender noticed and quickly swapped it out. The right ounce burger was thick but barely filled out the bun in terms of circumference. After a couple bites, I realized this burger was well done. I didn't want to send it back cause I had already waited so long. I might have mentioned it to my server/bartender but no one ever asked if everything was ok. It was probably a good burger, but it was a huge let down from what I expected. Thank god I didn't go for the 26 dollar burger. Overall, I really liked the place, but they failed me on the burger which was my main quest. It made the shake shack across the street seem like a viable option.
