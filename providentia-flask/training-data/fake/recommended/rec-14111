Great little place to have a nice dinner. Intimate, quiet setting. No reservations for parties under four, but we went a little early for dinner on a Saturday and didn't have to wait. I had bruschetta and spaghetti and everything was fresh and hot. The spaghetti came with chunks of fresh mozzarella, and the sauce was thick with the perfect amounts of tomato, basil and garlic. The service was wonderful too. Never an empty glass. BEWARE this place is cash only. Thankfully we found this out before ordering because of noise at the table next to us. They ordered $200+ of drinks, entrees and desserts and when the bill arrived realized they had to go to the ATM. I do hope the owners allow credit cards at some point. It's really too bad, because we would have ordered a lot more if that wasn't an issue.
