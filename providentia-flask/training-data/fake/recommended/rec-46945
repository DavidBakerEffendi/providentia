Followed other tips/reviews and ordered the french toast stuffed with cream cheese and bananas...WOW!  The portion size was overwhelming, presentation was impressive, and they were very light, cooked perfectly.  I was dissapointed I was unable to finish them.  Service was very good.  No waiting.  Great find!
