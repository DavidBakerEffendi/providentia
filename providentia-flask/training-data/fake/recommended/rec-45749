Wow!!! I was amazed by the chicken wafco! As I write this review, I am thinking again about how it tastes and just imagining it makes my mouth is water.  I want more!!!  It is similar to the beloved chicken n waffle combo from the south but with a unique, healthier taste because the waffle is light n crispy. I have never had anything like it!! I was very impressed with the overall vibe of the place.  The owners made me feel right at home with the other customers in the restaurant as we all talked about the neighborhood and food and life.  I could tell that Nosh Borough is a labor of love for these people and the quality of the food and the environment of the restaurant clearly reinforced that in my mind.
