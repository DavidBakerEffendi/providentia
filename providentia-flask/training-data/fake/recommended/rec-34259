Very happy to have finally found decent Thai within 45 minutes.   The decor is beaufiful, really never would have thought we were in a resturant inside the Foxmoor Shopping Center.  Bright colors, dark wood and the amazing fountain really add to the authenticity of the place.  The servers were all friendly and very helpful when you had questions regarding a dish.  The owner took the time to come over and talk to us, gave us a little education on the Thai alphabet. For appetizer we ordered the Chicken Satay, after hearing rave reviews about their peanut sauce.  Perfect!  Wanted to pour the peanut sauce on everything.  For my meal I had Penang Curry and the hubs had Pad Prik Khing.  Both were amazing, neither of us left a bite.   Oh, and it's a BYOB, even better!! Can't wait to go back and explore the menu a bit more.  My husband is already craving it again and were were only there two days ago.
