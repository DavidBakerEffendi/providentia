Pros: -Broth and noodles are simply amazing! If all you order is a bowl of noodle soup you will go home so satisfied it will remind you of home comfort and give you a happy belly! -The prices are extremely affordable so get appetizers such as pot stickers and my favorite, the pancake! For a group of 8 of us, with 3 appetizers and 4 bowls of soup, the tab came out to be $7 per person! -The service was fast and as friendly as Asian service can get (eh). -Whenever in Chinatown, you must try this place! Cons: -Cash only
