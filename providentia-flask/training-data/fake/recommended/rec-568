No where in New York can you get a better bowl of ramen. Simply soul-satisfying.  I usually get the Shiromaru Classic.  Have gotten the Akamaru also, while delicious, can get a little too salty for me.   Other favorites: sliced cucumbers with sesame oil - simple and refreshing pork buns - definitely the best i've had grapefruit with sochu - amazed everytime i get it, how refreshing a grapefruit can make sochu Unfortunately, the only bad thing now is the wait time.
