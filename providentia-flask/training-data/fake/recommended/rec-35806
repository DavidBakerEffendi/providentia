Living only 5 minutes away, I come here about once a month. I'd say the food is about a 3, but Tiger's Tale is all about the atmosphere. It's just a good old American bar and grill. You don't come here to eat healthy, but rather to share food and drinks with friends. The bar is quite big with a good deal of seating, but there's little else room to stand if you're not dining. The dining room is big enough for normal crowds, but not really big enough for the crowds that come in Friday through Sunday. Saturday night is karaoke night - be forewarned. They have some great clasics like burgers and NJ shore fries that other people have reviewed. I agree that their pizza leaves a lot to be desired. Their potato bacon soup special is great, and although it sounds weird, I've grown to like their cajun chicken in linguine alfredo - I cannot explain why. My wife and son love their clams, and their basic sandwiches are pretty good. The entrees can get pretty expensive for what you get though. Service can be slow, but it's always by nice people - you get a good slice of community here, seeing Princeton University teachers & students, VP's of places like J&J and Merrill Lynch, and regular workers stopping by for a cocktail. Overall though, you come here for the people and atmosphere of being a town favorite that is finally smoke-free (go NJ!). The food isn't bad and isn't great, but all told it's a fun place to hang out.
