I was excited to try moto but was sadly disappointed. I came with a party of ten, we had reservations. This place only seats 20. One hour wait for our order to be taken. Another hour and a half and finally the food arrived. Only until we told then we were here for 2.5 hours did they offer two free bottles of wine. The food was decent for boxed pasta and small servings. But due to the serving or lack of it and their long waits, they lost ten potential new customers tonight. We all agreed we would never be back.
