Outside security in Terminal B. Quick, tasty, healthy food. I like that they have a variety of proteins to choose from: beef, chicken, and tofu AND 3 different kinds of rice. The only thing I don't understand is why the burrito bowl (no tortilla) is more expensive than a small burrito. Shouldn't it cost less because there is no tortilla??
