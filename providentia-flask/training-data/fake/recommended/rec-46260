ABC Kitchen is one of my favorite places in NYC. The atmosphere, the decor, I love it. The mismatched serveware, the garden table, the use of local ingredients. Everything is white. It is lit beautifully at night. I've been for brunch and dinner, and it has been delicious both times. Scallops, carrot/avocado salad, and chicken salad are all highly recommended. My husband cannot stop talking about the chicken salad. Not cheap, but apparently worth it.
