After coming here for dinner, this place is phenomenal! Lance and his team provided IMPECCABLE service, very courteous and the food was exquisite. I highly recommend the arepitas y the sangrita and the flan. We got the churrasco, which was cooked perfectly and the chicken fried rice with avocado- it was fresh, very tasty and all the flavors BLENDed well. The timing of getting the food was great, not rushed. The ambiance itself is sophisticated, music was good too. The establishment at night is beautiful and you can enjoy the view of Manhattan across the water. Definitely coming back here soon! Highly recommend!!!!!
