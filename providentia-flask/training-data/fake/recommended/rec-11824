I went to the place for Sunday Brunch. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. Food: 5 stars I got savory crepe, Normande, which has a great flavor with great combination of mushroom, chicken, Swiss, cream in white wine sauce. Crepe was organic buckwheat, which is another plus. Their greens came with the dish was fresh and simple but good balance of balsamic vinegar with olive oil. Price was very reasonable given the great execution of dish. Coffee was French press, which was very good. It was also organic bean, which is another plus. Atmosphere: 5 stars It's at home, and small but relaxed and welcoming atmosphere of French bistro. In addition, the place was filled with morning sunlight. Services: 5 stars All staffs were very nice and friendly. Also could sense pride of serving good, honest foods. They were very attentive even the place was almost packed.
