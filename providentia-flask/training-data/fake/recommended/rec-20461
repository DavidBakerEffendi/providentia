Uninspired sushi (it all tastes the same with soggy wrappers), tasteless almost inedible noodle broth, cardboard udon,  weak edamame.  Every year or two, I always forget the mediocrity and go back, only again to be disappointed. Such a shame, because the people who work here are ultra nice, and the shop is quaint.   Folks, if you think this is good Japanese food, I have a bridge nearby to sell you. Easy solution:  walk a few blocks south to Hibino or Ki.
