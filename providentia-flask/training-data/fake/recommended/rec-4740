First thing anyone will notice about shake shack is that there is always a line. I suggest you wait it out because you will not be disappointed. I am an avid Five Guys goer. However Shake Shack offers more of an urban/city feel (the chain did start in NYC) than their competitor. The Burger: Anyone new to shake shack I suggest you start with the shack burger. The patties are soft and tender, cooked to perfection. You'll see the juices flow out of the burger and onto the wrapper that is neatly surrounding the burger. The bun is a soft potato bun that compliments the ingredients well. The Fries: The fries here are just that. Fries. Nothing crazy and by no means comparable to five guys. They do compliment the meal and by all means try them, but I'm not crazy about them. The Shake: The shakes are perfect. Nothing fancy, straight ice cream in a cup ready to go with your burger. They offer different shakes depending on the day, which switches things up a bit. The Beer: YES. Shake Shack has beer. They have a special brew by the Yards brewing company (a Philadelphia brewery) that adds a special touch to their menu. Misc: They offer free water! Seating is kind of tough, depends on the time but they do offer outside seating Overall shake shack is a great alternative to five guys or your favorite burger joint. It is definitely a staple to city burgers and if you're going to see a show at the Helium Comedy club, its located right down the street. Perfect spot before a few laughs. Hope this helped!
