This place was quite cute....we ate outside after it was recommended that we try the "chicken" before we left town.  Had we gone earlier in the night it may have been better.  We ordered the chicken.....which if you have a Sam's Club near you.....pay $5 for the rotisserie verses $16 for a whole chicken....but it was good.  We also ordered a seafood dish.....which if it weren't severely overcooked, would have been delicious.....I'm sure it was sitting under the heat lamp for at least an hour before it got to our table!  The sangria was good....so potent I could not finish it!
