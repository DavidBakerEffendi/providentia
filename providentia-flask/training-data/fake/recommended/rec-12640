omg...i will never go back to tia pol on a weekend night...it took forever to get seated... we ordered: Â fried pigs ears, patatas bravas, fried chick peas, serrano ham, and veal lengua, and squid ink risotto. my favorite of the night was probably the squid ink and rice...it's a very small dish so, if you go in a group you might want to order two...you will be fighting for each spoonful...it's that good... overall, i thought the food was good...and the service was pretty good once we finally got seated... it's a very small restaurant and gets extremely packed...get there early...
