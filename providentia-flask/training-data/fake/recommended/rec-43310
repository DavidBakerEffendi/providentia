Princeton landmark fails with their rude and uneducated Mexican worker's stupidity . As soon as we walked in, Mexican workers  started talking to each other and laughing , we ignored just ordering our food. But it got worse when they call us "hey putos".  Instantly kills the joy of visiting great Princeton university.. This place is a joke!!! When we address their rudeness by saying It wasnt very nice, they continue laughed, shocking other customers including students from Princeton University.  The management should consider this right away, which i doubt if the owner is Mexican, he will probably just jaugh along with them.. So Sad!  lol
