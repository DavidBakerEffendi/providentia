Went here for coffee and lunch, had the Elvis latte which consisted of peanut butter and banana. Latte was big, I also had the turkey Brie sandwich. Nothing outrageous though. Service was very slow that was the only really bad thing. I wouldn't recommend this place to do homework or sit with a laptop, I tried and it didn't really seem like that kind of place. More like a sit down lunch and leave, unless you sat on the couches.
