I really really liked this place! I was afraid a place this new and popular (keep reading about in TimeOutNY) would be hard to get into for a party of five on a Saturday. No issue. Poof! Reservations. Upon our arrival, I was impressed with the ambiance. I would go back just to go to the bar. Great drinks and just nice and open. All the servers were so pleasant! The food was quite delicious. I had the roasted chicken and it didn't really have a sauce - it was just darn tasty through and through. That's a sign of some amazing chicken. When paired with skinny fries, you've got pure deliciousness. The drink I had was made with apples and ginger and was unique and just perfect. Our server was great as well. He was always there, but not annoying, and seemed to giggle everytime he walked away. Don't miss the photo booth downstairs. Be sure to save 3 crisp one dollar bills to take some old timey black and white photos in the booth. Too much fun and you can even be efficient and leave them drying while you make use of the facilities. Genius. Pure genius.
