I can't stop thinking about the ravioli I had here last night! Homemade ravioli with goat cheese and scallion. Everyone's dishes were delicious. My favorite thing is when just a few simple ingredients come together to form such a wonderful eating experience. This is the true essence of Italian cooking...a few simple ingredients. Service was prompt and food came out in a normal amount of time. Portions were on the smaller side for American standards. My only complaint was that the rolls serves before dinner could have been much better quality
