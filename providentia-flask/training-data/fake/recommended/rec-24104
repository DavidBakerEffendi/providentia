I ended up here after the doing the "4th Annual Fried Chicken Run" with the Fishtown Beer Runners.  (Great experience, by the way). When we arrived, the party was in the outdoor section in the back where they had kegs set up and a buffet of fried chicken and random sides (a nice salad with asparagus, potato salad, perciatelli pasta salad).  The food was good, and the beers that they offered in the kegs was nice as well ... they had an IPA and a ginger beer, the latter of which I much preferred. I thought the chicken was pretty good, and the sides were nice and fresh.  The atmosphere in the back seemed pretty chill.  The menu also seemed pretty strange, with a variety of options that I wouldn't expect all at the same bar.
