When a tapas restaurant around the corner refused to serve our groups due to shellfish allergy, we ended up at Umami Burger.  It was great!  The menu is different and thought-provoking.  The food was amazing and the service was fantastic.  The desserts were also really good.  There was a 45 minute wait but it was worth it.
