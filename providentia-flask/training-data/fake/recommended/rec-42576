So I get the pleasure of traveling all over the states for a living and during my time in Bayonne,  NJ, I was told to try this place for Chinese,  and I'm so very glad I did!  This places was both clean and has a friendly staff! The food which is the important piece was Excellent!  Some of the best Chinese food I've had in years!  I ordered their General Tso's with pork fried rice, and an order of Crab Rangoon. All I can say is delish!!! I ate here twice while in town and ordered the same thing both times, and both times it was excellent!  Serving sizes are more than enough and I couldn't finish it all at lunch,  which is pretty standard at most Chinese restaurants, food prep was fast.  The only meh item was their egg rolls. Tasted pretty standard and unoriginal,  though I've yet to find a place to replicate the egg rolls of my youth. Alas I continue my search.  But I highly recommend this place if your looking for some excellent Chinese food with a friendly staff,  clean environment,  and fast service! Emmm Emmm good!!! I'll be back if work ever brings me this way again!
