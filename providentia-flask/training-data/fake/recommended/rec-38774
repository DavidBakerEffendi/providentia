I've been to Mercato three times now.  Since I was going with just one other person, the wait wasn't too bad (20 minutes and we arrived around 7:30-8 each time) The food was very good, service was as well. The first time I went was during the summer and we sat outdoors, which I liked. We ordered the grilled artichoke.  I have never had such an amazing artichoke and talked about it for days afterward. I've ordered its since, and I think the artichokes were out of season because it didn't match the first one, but was still tasty. I have ordered the roasted chicken - it was good, not great. The ambiance inside is classy and the decor modern.  It's a bit crowded if you sit inside, and noisy, but not too bad.  Overall, satisfied!
