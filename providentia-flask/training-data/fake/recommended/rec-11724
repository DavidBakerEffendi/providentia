Simply described, Pates is just a charming little french restaurant that serves a variety of crepes and a barage of French kitsch. The restaurant manages to cover ever square foot of the indoor space with french paraphernalia and kitsch without actually coming off as tacky, which I found highly impressive. Our fig & goat cheese crepe and croque madame were not amazing, but still satisfyingly good. We also ordered the banana flambee crepe and affogato for dessert strictly out of curiosity rather than hunger, and this turned out to be an awful idea because the desserts were both huge and delcious, thereby forcing us to put our Fatty Hats on and eat it all. The main draw to the place is the charming people who serve the food, who embody the pleasantness and French cuteness of the space. Definitely worth trying if you live in area!
