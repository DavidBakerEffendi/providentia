I used to live near Kabob Paradise about 7 years ago and only went there once because I remembered the food to be bland and without a variety of dishes.  Today I found myself in the neighborhood again and decided to stop in.  It was a good decision. The man who attended to me at the counter was very cordial and helpfull.  Not knowing the menu items that well, I asked what he recommended, he said that especially since it's my first time there, he recommends the lamb gyro platter.  It came in two sizes, a lunch portion for $5 and a dinner portion for $8.  I got two for bothmyself and my wife to go, and picked up a container of Jelabi for dessert. The gyro platters were basically everything you would find in a gyro but chopped up and mixed together over rice.  Italso came with a small portion of sweet carrot and raisin "salsa" on the side. The meat was excellently seasoned and mixed well with the other items in the gyro.  The rice was a nice treat as well.  I'm not a big fan of rice, but this gyro came with a seasoned long-grain version that I couldn't stop eating.   The best part is that for $5 I was completely full afterwards.  My wife saved half of her's for tomorrow's lunch! I'll definitely be going back here sometime!
