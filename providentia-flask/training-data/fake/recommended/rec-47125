Almost perfect. The wait (especially on weekends) is kind of intense, but the coffee is great, and the food is amazing. It is mainly a breakfast place, but they do have great dinner food. Try the mussels - they are amazing. For breakfast I recommend going with a friend and splitting the hallah French toast and one of their amazing omelettes; savory and sweet! Side note; many of the waiters are also extremely attractive.
