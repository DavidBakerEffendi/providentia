such a tasty baconcheeseburger i had in this food place cum bar! it must have been the old (looks like it's been in service for over 50 years!!!) machine they have, with all the accumulated gravy, the greasy melted fat, the left-over bits and pieces of burger patties that were grilled in it before.....service, though, needs some improvement. it could have been the time of the day when we got there (around 4pm). Â but i still like the ambiance.
