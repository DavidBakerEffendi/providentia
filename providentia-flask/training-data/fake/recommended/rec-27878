Yeeeuh, this is what I'm talking about. So there are two kinds of Chinese restaurants in NYC: One where they do the wontons in spicy oil, Sichuan/Americanized Chinese, lo mein with all the staples (like Legend and Grand Sichuan) and places that do like two things REALLY well (like Big Wong King and NY Noodle). I went here with a plan. I arrived around 7pm on a Tuesday and was promptly seated. My manfriend and I ordered the combo fried rice, the roast pork, the roast duck, the Chinese broccoli, and the fried beef spicy noodles. DELICIOUS! This meal made me realize that I am NOT A FAN OF DUCK = too much fat/mystery meat/bones. Fuck it. Too much work. However, I never eat pork. I'm Middle Eastern and I never grew up with it, but this shit was AMAZING. Tons of flavor, no gristle or weird meaty parts, super yummy. The fried rice was how it should be: clean, fresh veggies, delicate flavor. The spicy noodles = not spicy. Chinese broccoli = wonderful! Again, not a lot of frills, just light oil and garlic. All the above came out to $40. I will be back. PS. GET A SIDE OF THE CHILI OIL!
