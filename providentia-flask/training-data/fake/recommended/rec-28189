One of the best Japanese restaurants I've eaten at in Manhattan. I went on a recommendation from my hair stylist who is from Japan, and boy was I not disappointed. The friend who came with me spent years in Japan and was also very pleasantly surprised exclaiming "natsukashii!" frequently over the authentic Japanese flavor of the dishes. We ordered the watercress salad, sashimi moriawase and three different types of yakitori - gyu, buta-aspara and oyster mushroom. Everything was delicious and the sashimi was SUPER fresh. Today I became a fan of uni, something I previously wasn't able to appreciate fully. It was just so fresh and melted in my mouth. The service was attentive without being overbearing. What a wonderful meal - I can't wait to come back!
