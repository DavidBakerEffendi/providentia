"Our today's special is grilled whole snapper nice and crispy on the outside delicate and juicy on the inside beautifully laid on a bed of Â sauteed sicilian escarole sprinkled with warm golden raisins accented by just a hint of lemon." I always find myself having a hard time saying "no" to culinary eloquence, in fact I have a hard time saying anything to sound equally intelligent or interesting. "Ok I'll get the whole fish!" Soon the utensils were placed on the table, so was my anticipation. Knowing Market Table's seafood fame, the next 30 minutes of wait went on for 20 years. It felt so long I couldn't focus on the flowchart of my girlfriend's love life. When the food came - What. A. Giant. Fish. I grabbed my knife and fork immediately and started dissecting the generously plated and perfectly browned snapper with the kind of enthusiasm I had for my first biology lab project. The fish alone - yummy. The veges alone - yummy. Fish and vege together - my tongue got confused and a fish bone pierced into my throat and I COULD NOT FIND A CHOKING VICTIM POSTER! Oh my god I'm a chocking victim what am I gonna do. I kept silent out of embarrassment while blocking out the entire conversation and locked myself in the darkness of fear in fighting death, and the rest of my food was consumed as a futile effort to push one tiny fish bone through. Fortunately that all ended after the most exhausting 10 minutes in the bathroom. I came back to my table with tears in my eyes, and a vague memory of a very delicious meal. Good food to die for? Quite close.
