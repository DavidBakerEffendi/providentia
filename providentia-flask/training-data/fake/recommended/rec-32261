If you're a vegan in Philly, you need to know about Sketch!  We moved here last summer, and we wanted to know: where is the best veggie burger?  Where is some great vegan ice cream?  We've been in search of both for months, with lots of disappointment.  The weird ice cream flavors and consistency at Little Baby's really turned us off, and we've had some "homemade veggie burgers" at joints in the city that were seriously weird--mushy, lumpy, ew.   Sketch was a pleasant surprise.  The food is awesome--great vegan black bean burger or seitan sandwich, with vegan long roll--and the service is great.  Our server was sweet and cheerful and attentive.  We got to draw pictures while we ate.  And the VEGAN MILKSHAKES WERE THE BOMB.  They came in regular flavors (chocolate, vanilla, cookies n cream, mint chocolate chip, peanut butter, etc)--with lots of choices.  We will definitely be back.  Awesome.
