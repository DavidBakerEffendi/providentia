I recently ordered catering from Sandra's for a meeting of ~12 people. The food was all delicious. We tried the pulled pork, baked chicken, mac n cheese, green beans, collard greens and sweet tea - YUM! Sandra herself is very professional and friendly. The food was exactly what I ordered and ready on time. She even accommodated my order on a day that the storefront is not open.
