I liked this place. It was cozy inside, with rich dark colors to match the wooden accomodations. Definitely a good date spot, for sure. The food was really good, especially the skirt steak. Also tried the oysters - this place offers a twist on the traditional mignonette, which gave the oysters a more caribbean flair. This was definitely a good thing.
