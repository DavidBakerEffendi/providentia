What a wonderful addition to the Northern Liberties/Fishtown food scene! I'd give it 5 stars except the chicken was just okay for my liking.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken is fresh out of the fryer and interesting, but it didn't excite me.  But keep the doughnuts coming!!! Pros: - Doughnuts are out of this world and FRESH!!! - Place is new and clean - Interesting dry rub and wet sauce on chicken - Parking in both the lot or on the street Cons: - A bit pricey for doughnuts and chicken - Chicken is okay, but not great (who can beat KFC or Churches)
