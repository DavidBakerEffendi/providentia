In terms of the night life, I am going to have to say that it is not great.  This place is very crowed with young bar hoppers and older people who tend to gawk at the younger crowd.   There is a tiny dance floor where people can dance, but again older men tend to stand nearby with an eye on the young girls...not so appealing.
