Regardless of the quality of the foods here, all the staffs are very rude and disappointed. I've been here with my parents and a baby for early dinner the other day. My parents weren't that hungry so we ordered three soft tofu stew and a buckwheat pancake which is almost 20bucks for just the appetizer it self..that is acceptable. But our waitress said, " Including the baby, you should've order four main dishes because you are four!" She even told me in an angry tone. I really wanted to get out of there at that moment perhaps my son was hungry and teased me so I couldn't.....I was so angry and never been to restaurants in the WORLD with that kind of attitude person.....so sad. Couldn't even remember how it tasted like..
