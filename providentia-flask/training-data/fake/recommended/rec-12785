The 1k plus reviews had my interest so finally tried it last night but sadly it didn't live up to the hype. We had the flounder fish buns, flash fried salmon and wasabi shoyu ramen. The flounder fish buns were the best of the three dishes. The buns were cooked to pillowy perfection and the tangy fried flounder complemented them well. The flash fried salmon was a special and basically just tasted like fish sticks. The ramen came but the server forgot the nigamoto the first time and after waiting for a few minutes she brought it separately. Overall the noodles were thin and unsubstantial and the broth just did not pack as much punch as the spicy rich stuff at TOTTO RAMEN.
