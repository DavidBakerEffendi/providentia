We are frequent eaters at the Pond House in Hartford. Â Brunch is outstanding however, lunches have been a tad disappointing w/ SMALL portions ( especially the salads). For the prices $ 15+ for salads, the portions are small. They have also done away with the popcorn served as a condiment at lunch. Over the past year , we have noticed the slimming down of their portions from brunch to lunches .
