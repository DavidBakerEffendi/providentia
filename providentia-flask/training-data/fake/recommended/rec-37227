Every now and again, I like to offer a follow-up to some of the places I frequent, and am happy to report that Salute is still *amazing*. Excellent customer service, accommodating waitstaff and management, as well as great atmosphere, even on the busiest days, and worthwhile happy hour offerings. The Pasta alla  Vodka is also a recommended menu choice, as is the Chocolate Bourbon Crème brûlée.
