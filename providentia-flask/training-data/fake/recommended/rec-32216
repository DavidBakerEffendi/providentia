I ordered a calypso burger here awhile back. Something I make at home often since. The food was good, but as far as accommodating my dairy allergy goes, I had to walk to the corner store and buy a loaf of bread to put my burger on, because they didn't have a dairy-free roll. If they were more allergy friendly, I would definitely go back.
