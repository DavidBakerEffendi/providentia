As frequent diners at Pizzeria Bianco in AZ we came in with high expectations after reading that Lombardi's was Zagat's #1 rated.  In all honesty, Pizzeria crushes this place in virtually every way.  Substantially lighter, flakier and better crust.  Fresher ingredients and infinitely more creative in toppings and varieties of pies.  For good measure, service is also better. Although we thought the pizza was good I can say with no overstatement that I've had a handful better throughout the US.  One guy and two gals opinions.  I don't get it.  Is this really the best NY can offer up?
