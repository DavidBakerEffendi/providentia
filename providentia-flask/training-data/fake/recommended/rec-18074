City Tap offers DELICIOUS food. Seriously. Come for the food, stay for the beer. Amazing selection on both--I'm particularly partial to the shrimp n grits (cried when they left the menu rotation, actually cried) which are creamy, smoky, juicy...perfect. The sweet potato fries and gnocchi are always amazing, too. Dry rub wings were meh, but still better than most places. And the beer selection! Wowza. The people here know their stuff and there's a LOT of stuff on offer. It's a great place to come if you're a regular (but a little pricey for regular patronage) because the bartenders who stay really try to get to know you (shoutout to Cathy!!!!) Altho there's been a lot of bartender turnover since I first started coming here in 2010. I took a star off for the seating on crowded nights--it's extremely hard to get bar seating, although in the summer maybe it'll be better 'cause the outdoor space (I don't want to have to pay for fire pit seating though!) and obviously you can't sit down unless you're going to order food too. Dunno what the solution is, but it's made some Friday nights kind of uncomfortable--though again, not nearly as bad as most CC bars! I love this place.
