I enjoyed my experience here but will say its not somewhere I would go if I was really hungry. I had a delicious drink with ginger beer (can't remember the name) to start. To eat I tried the asparagus soup and scallops. Both of the dishes were flavorful but small. I fell in love with that soup tho -- so creamy and perfectly flavored. Overall a nice date spot with romantic ambiance and small plates made fresh (farm to table).
