I was just walking home when I noticed a new storefront awning. It was called Absolute Thai Restaurant and I love Thai food so I walked in. I told them Ive been living in this neighborhood now for 14 yrs and never noticed this place. They said they just opened 3 days ago. It's a take out only restaurant so without looking at the menu i just asked for my favorite dish which is Pad Khee Mao with mixed seafood. When I opened up the bag I was blown away by the dish it's was chock full of seafood and for the first time i had mussels included as well. Once i tasted it i was impressed as well. It was, as i say, Thai spicy which was fine for me. it was so great that I had to call the take out place and pay my compliments to the chef. I wish this new Thai place all the best and hope they are successful in Spanish Harlem. Welcome to the neighborhood.
