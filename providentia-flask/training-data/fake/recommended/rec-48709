Loved this place! I stopped by on the way home for lunch and it was such a pleasant surprise. The interior is rustic looking with wooden tables and beautiful lighting. The chicken pad thai was delicious-I had the lunch special and it came with lots of food, all for a really great price. I will definitely be back!
