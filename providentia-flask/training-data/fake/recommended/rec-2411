Geno's or Pat's?  Pat's or Geno's?  I guess that is the question.  Well, I'm just visiting from Los Angeles, so I tried both back-to-back within 5 minutes of each other (they are located across the street from each other). I ordered a "Wiz wit" from each one (what's with the stupid ordering system?) and I thought Pat's was the winner.  Geno's wasn't bad, but I liked the steak better at Pat's. BTW, I've had better cheesesteak sandwiches in California.  I think these places are more for the experience, rather than the actual cheesesteak...similar to Pink's in LA.
