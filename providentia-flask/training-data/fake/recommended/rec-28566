I had the weekday brunch. The server recommended the vegan scramble (even though I'm a firm omnivore) it was delicious & the perfect counter to the several Old Fashioned cocktails I indulged in yesterday. The atmosphere is relaxed & I could write my journal without feeling rushed. I'll be back to try the waffles- I had some serious food envy.
