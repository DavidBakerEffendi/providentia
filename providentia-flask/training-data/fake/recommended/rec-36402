Some of the best ramen in New York!   Recommendation: tonkotsu ramen with soft boiled egg!  The rich pork based ramen cooked for hours and the creamy egg yolk are a revelation!   Note: there is often a queue during dinner time, but the wait is certainly worth it.  For those unfamiliar with Japanese restaurant etiquette, do not be alarmed by the staff shouting "irasshaimase" to you upon entering.  This is simply a formal welcome to you.
