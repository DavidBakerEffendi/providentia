Went for lunch on a Tuesday and it was not busy.  It was exactly what I was in the mood for...yummy classic Spanish food. We had the tortilla española, empanadas and ham croquettes. Came with soup called Caldo Gallego and a house salad. All in all a great value.  The decor was modern and simple and reminiscent of Spain.  I'll be back.
