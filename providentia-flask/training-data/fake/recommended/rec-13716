Def. one of my favorite breakfast joints in NYC.  The wait was long on the weekend (about 45 min.) but well worth it after having an empty stomach.  This place fed us well.  I had an omelette and shared a stack of pancakes topped with fruits.  Everything was top notch and once you ordered they were pretty quick.  They also have a good selection of freshly baked pastries if you're a sweet tooth like me.  Definitely recommend this spot to anyone who visits or lives in the big NYC.
