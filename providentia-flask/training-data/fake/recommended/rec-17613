I know what your thinking...a jazz club in NJ, awesome! Do NOT bother. My friend and I went out to enjoy some jazz and good food. We are extremely courteous and well mannered people, but the staff thought otherwise. Let me give you the play by play. Lisa and I sat down ordered our drinks and meals before the entertainment began. We noticed that we were the youngest people there (30s), we had quiet conversation and once the music began we quieted down except for occasionally whispering to try each others food. I couldn't believe the waiter asked us to be quiet during our meal. I understand that the show was being recorded in a nearby range, however we surrounded by 65+ (with hearing aids) who were talking louder than the music itself! Also note we are no jazz club virgins and we know our manners! Why we wouldnt even dare to make a run to the bathroom until the set was over. So after we spent 200 together we tipped the minimum and got out of there ASAP! Thank you for treated us with such disrespect so we never spend a dime in Trumpets again. I'll go out of my way to make the journey to Blue Note or Smalls in NYC for now on.
