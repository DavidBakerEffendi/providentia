What a nice experience!  We went for brunch and tried a couple of things.  The wait was alright -- about 45 minutes to sit.  Was it worth it?  Yes! Nutella French Toast -- Three slices of brioche french toast filled with warm chocolate hazelnut filling, served with caramelized bananas.  -- This was pretty good.  I'm a nutella lover.  I was really hoping to get more nutella with the french toast.  The french toast, without the nutella, was even... a little bitter/sour?  Was really hoping to get more sweetness from this dish. Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs -- Two farm fresh eggs wrapped in smoked salmon on toasted black bread with green goddess dressing. Served with a side salad.  -- Yummo!  This was definitely worth the wait.  I love poached eggs and the salmon was awesome.  Wish that the eggs were a little more runny because in my opinion, the creaminess of the yolk is what brings the salmon and the eggs together. Over all, I would definitely eat at Penelope again.  It's too bad that they dont take reservations.  I really wish they did... because I think that would make things a whole lot easier for the waitstaff, the greeters, and of course, for the lines of people waiting outside of the restaurant on a rainy day (which is what we did).  Either way, hopefully they'll find a more efficient way to work with their customers.
