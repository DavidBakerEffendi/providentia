Had a lovely brunch in this little gem. The food was terrific and well-priced, the ambiance was lovely --- we sat in the heated garden area in back --- and the service was friendly and prompt. Â I had a focaccia stuffed with some kind of farmer's cheese and truffles (off the dinner menu --- I saw it being brought to someone at a nearby table). The complimentary bread they brought us was fresh, moist, and super-tasty, alone or dipped in the flavorful olive oil. I highly recommend this place.
