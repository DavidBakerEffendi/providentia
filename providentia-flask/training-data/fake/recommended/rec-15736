Wow, cannot get enough of this food! So greasy, so bad for you, and so cheap for six bucks! The ones in the white plastic bag are the way to go. The yellow plastic bag one doesn't taste as good, imo. Go to the cart on the southwest corner of the street across from the Hilton and next to the fountain and benches. It may not be the longest line, but it's definitely the best option on this intersection.
