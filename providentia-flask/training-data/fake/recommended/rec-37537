This place was suggested by one of my former colleagues who lives in the area. I asked her for a chill bar with great beer selection. This was dead on! Great location and beer choices! You can easily make friends here. I'm from South NJ and my friends and I don't mind travelling to Philly for this spot! Great spot!
