Worst experience ever, Waiter did not get our order right, then had to wait almost an hour for Â the entrees to even be served. The party next to us was seated after us and left when our food is served. The other party had the same amount of food we ordered and we basically watched our neighbors eat the entire time. The Pad Thai was terrible, Felt like I was eating plastic, and the Rice and beef was over cook. I would never go back there again.
