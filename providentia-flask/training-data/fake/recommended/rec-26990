Hen of the Wood was one of our favorite things about our recent trip to Burlington. we were stumped about where to get dinner while walking around Church Street and after looking on Yelp we finally decided on Hen of the Wood. After walking in we immediately got seats at the bar which was good because it seemed to fill up right after we sat down. The service was phenomenal and our waiter was great at answering questions. Â I had a cocktail that he recommended, including Pimm's and Allagash White with hints of orange - just fantastic. I crave it sometimes, which is a good thing. The atmosphere of this place is amazing too with beautiful wood interior and the perfect lighting for a romantic meal. We ordered some small plates and then each an entree. I would completely recommend of the egg and hen of the wood mushroom on toast. I could eat that every morning for breakfast. The egg is cooked PERFECTLY and the homemade bread smells and tastes of the fire wood oven that they toasted it in. My fiance ordered the hangar steak and I had the rabbit leg. Both great dishes but I read on Yelp that they had a seasonal lamb dish and I need to go back to Burlington to try that dish. I'm sure it's amazing. We also had a small plate of the ham wrapped rabbit loin which I liked but it was the only thing I wasn't in love with. We were too stuffed for dessert but the desserts sounded amazing. Definitely feel free to dig into this menu and break the bank a little. It's totally worth it.
