The service is outstanding, the food even more so. I mean wow. Even the cheese course was fantastic. We had a wonderful time. It's a BYOB by the way. It's a bit expensive if you go all out, but worth every penny. I had the beef rib OMFG it was sooooooo good. The foie gras was outstanding. Started out with a complimentary shot of soup which was super tasty, ended with a sambuca provided gratis by our waiter of which we had 2 and both were attentive and professional, tended to every need without needing any hint at all. Overall a 12 out of 10.
