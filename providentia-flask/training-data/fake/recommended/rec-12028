i like how you've re-decorated the Old Devil Moon space, but if you're going to take over a spot so sacred, make sure you do it 150% PROS: fresh, seasonal ingredients fantastic wine sensational, juicy and delicious chicken way to incorporate fried chicken with poached egg on a sandwich CONS: i am still hungry (even after appetizers and entrees) you served $13 chicken with a slice of lemon and no sides whatsoever; i would have appreciated at least a bit of parsley the waitstaff was disorganized. i stood for 5 minutes until someone asked if i wanted to sit, i had four different waiters, and the "main waitress" was very inattentive and obviously disinterested. the brunch menu piques my interest; however, with such reliable, delicious options right around corner (Westville, Redhead), this Shark just might need another bite to be sure...
