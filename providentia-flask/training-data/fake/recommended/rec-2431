The old traditional way of frying the steaks in whole pieces, a minus i think as u need to chew much more, but its amazing no matter how fast u can say 'cheese wit' means cheese steak with onions, before u take the money out ur steak is already waiting for u. It's a must to visit Geno's across the street with all the lights, i think they have better steaks as they cut them up in small pieces and they blend amazing with the cheese, the 'cheese wit' worx at both.
