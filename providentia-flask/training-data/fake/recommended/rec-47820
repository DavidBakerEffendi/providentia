I absolutely love this restaurant. I consider it a downside that it's inside of the Study hotel, it sort of changes the atmosphere and makes it seem more transient and conference like, but the food is absolutely some of the best in New Haven. It's pricey, but worth it. The Kale Salad is absolutely amazing, with incredible dressing. The cocktails are amazing and the space is beautiful and sleek. They are real seasonal food, so don't expect too many vegetarian options during the winter, but the food is amazing.
