I went here during center city sips for dinner because of the 15% discount of dinner if you order something from the sips menu. Altogether my experience was excellent. I had the mocha madness cocktail which was delicious, like drinking fancy chocolate milk! My boyfriend and I shared the wings as an appetizer, which were hands down some of the most delicious wings I've ever eaten, and I do love me a good BBQ chicken wing! I had the veggie burger (with additional cheese) and my boyfriend had the asparagus crepe. Both were absolutely delicious!! The only thing I have to say negatively about my veggie burger was taht it was wayyyy to big. It fell apart and honestly half the size of it was enough to fit nicely in the bun with everything else, but then again burgers from anywhere are always too big, so at least you cant say I didnt warn you! For dessert we shared the apple streusel thingy, and it was deeeelicious. Our server was super friendly and the staff atmosphere in general was a great one! The decor details were great, even down to our dessert plate which looked like a ceramic piece of graph paper (very unique and humorous!). Altogether my experience was great, just not 5 star worthy because it takes a lot for me to give something 5 stars :)
