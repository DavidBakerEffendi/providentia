I went to Locanda Verde awhile back for brunch, and would have given the place 3 stars - the food was good with an interesting latin twist, but nothing to rave about. Recently went back for lunch, and think this place deserves 4.  The food was excellent - very simple stuff, but really really well done.  If you are a carbivore like me, all of the bread (and there is bread-a-plenty) is very rustic, artisan, whatever buzz word you want to use for delicious.  They give you a foccacia for free - it's actually almost pizza, but you can feel better about eating slabs of it.  I would also recommend the ricotta appetizer - i know it sounds strange to just order ricotta, but it actually comes with some more great bread and is not your average ricotta. Then had the papardelle with ragu sauce for my main course.  Noodles tasted very fresh and the portion was the perfect size. The food plus the great decor and nice crowd earns four stars - would go back again soon!
