I went here once a couple years ago and got a steak with cheese whiz. It came as a few thick slices of steak on a white roll as opposed to finely minced meat. I actually prefer this. The steak was very flavorful and well cooked. They don't have an extensive menu. You come here to get a genuine Philly cheese steak (a.k.a. "steak and cheese" in most other regions). You can choose between a few cheeses (provolone, american, and whiz- I think). Add fried onions if you like. Not much else. Simple and good. And there's outdoor seating. parking is horrible though. I found a spot a couple blocks away around lunchtime midweek.
