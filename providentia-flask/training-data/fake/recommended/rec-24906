This was the worst dinner I have ever eaten in South Philly. Dead flies along the window sill should have been the first clue. The Â veal parmigiana was basically breading parm...more and thicker breading than veal. Sauce was straight from a jar. There is absolutely no reason to go here when there are far better places to go in the area for the same prices.
