Well I did love the Wishing Well.... but I've been there twice in the past week, and meh, I have to admit it's kinda gone downhill.   maybe it's that it's gotten more crowded - game nights the place is packed.  maybe they figure they don't have to try anymore. their menu got bigger - maybe they are overwhelmed in the kitchen.   I don't know what is but I'm just not as in love with this place anymore.  Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad - some of it is downright great (gator tail, chili, fried pickles), but it just seems like maybe they are aren't trying hard enough, or trying to piss me off.   case(s) in point: - not sure why they give out pretzels when you sit down now, but ok i'll take them.  With a hair in the bottom though, no, that is gross - Please give me the right beer when I order it thankyouverymuch. If it is too much to have 3 dogfish heads on tap that you can't tell them apart, you are kind of hopeless - Do not charge me a dollar for salsa to put on my nachos! really?!  The fact that i even have to ask for more salsa kind of reflects badly on your nachos to begin with.  but the fact that you are upcharging me for slightly nasty salsa to begin with, well that just pisses me off.   So, I'm sorry Wishing Well.  I'm not sure I'll be back.  It's not me, it's you.
