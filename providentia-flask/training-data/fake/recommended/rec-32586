Gawd I miss this place.  Try the Hellboy: Pizza with honey?  What??!?! Yes, it works. Atmosphere, creativity, and it's delicious!  There really is nothing more that you need. Also, the owner is very personable and even gave us suggestions on pizza places to try here on the West Coast.  He obviously knows his pizza!   See ya in the Summer Paulie Gee's!
