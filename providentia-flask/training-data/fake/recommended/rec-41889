I have been to Izumi SEVERAL times its just one of those places that whenever we get the opportunity to get out last minute we always just choose Izumi...well if i wrote this review before my last visit it would of absolutely got 5 stars...i will get to why in a second... The food is phenomenal really...SOo Sooo good every time we have ever gone we usually just order all the specialty rolls they usually would give us a deal like $10 off or something well the last time we went with friends apparently they have added to their specialty menu but we still assumed we would get some sort of deal for ordering all of them as well as a couple of appetizers...well we didn't which is our fault for not asking....Anyway every single roll was amazing we also ordered the rock shrimp tempura which was fabulous and a scallop appetizers which was just Ok ....They also have really good dessert! The food is amazing the ambiance is awesome! In the summer they have outdoor seating around the fountain which makes for a great night. The only fault of this restaurant is that they seem to have large turnover in wait staff and their prices are a bit steep however I am sure we will be there very soon because i really love this place:-) NOTE IT IS A BYOB...
