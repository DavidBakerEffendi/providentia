Barcelona is an amazing restaurant for savory tapas and great wine. The choose 6 option is a great deal for two people. I recommend the roasted garlic, the brussel sprouts, and anything with cheese. Try one of their wine flights and stop by at night for DJing and dancing. Service is usually very good.
