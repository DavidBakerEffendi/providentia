Malatesta is amazing. I went this past weekend after not visiting for a year and a half and it was just as good as I remembered. I had the mussels appetizer & ravioli in pink sauce as my entree- both we SO delicious. They only accept cash here but there is an ATM on Christopher st right around the corner so that wasn't a problem. Perfect for a romantic date or catching up with a good friend. I find that small groups get seated faster. I can't wait for my next trip to NYC to visit this cozy West Village spot again!
