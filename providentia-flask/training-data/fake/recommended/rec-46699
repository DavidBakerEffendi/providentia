I've been to both Ola locations lately, the food is superb, the drinks are amazing and staff is very attentive. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is a little on the pricey side for dinner. The good news is they run a groupon ever so often at half off and you can't beat it!! Mojitos are the best and everything from the Campo to Paella was wonderful and fresh. Atmosphere is authentic, quaint and calm. Suggest reservations it gets very busy after 6!
