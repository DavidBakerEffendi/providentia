I finally had a taste of the Umami. First, I think the first element that makes it a decently positive experience is that I didn't have to wait at all - only for the rest of my party to arrive, and then we were seated immediately. This was around 7PM on a weekday. The waitress was really friendly, attentive and helpful, giving us suggestions as 2/3 of us were newbies. For appetizers - fries were enjoyable, nothing amazing. Pickled plate.... I'd say no! I do like pickles but this was just odd... For burger - I opt'd to share the Truffle Burger & the Original Burger with a friend. Both were made well, but I just thought the Original Burger had a bit more flavor. Maybe because it had more toppings... Â Both burgers were tasty enough, not over done, and juicy. I would come back for a good ol' burger, but I wouldn't wait for it.
