Having been to the location in Edison (Edison Noodle House), we came down here while visiting my mom.  The service is great, it's BYO, and it's really clean and pretty nice inside.  The restaurant on a random Wednesday night was packed full with Chinese families, which is always a great sign.   I wanted to try the douban whole fish special, as a lot of the families seemed to be enjoying it, but we decided to hold off for this time and order from the menu.  We got xiaolongbao, of course, and the beef sandwich appetizer, then I had pork & mustard green noodle soup, my mom got some dandan noodles and we shared some eggplant in garlic sauce.  Tons of food but we took some home and some my husband came by to eat as well. The noodle soup was delicious, as was the sauce on the dandan noodles, the eggplant was quite good if sweet and the beef sandwich was great too. I think that personally, I found the xiaolongbao here to be better than Edison, but Edison has handmade noodle soups, so that's better there.  I'd like to try the shengjianbao pork buns here next time, and the specials.  The xiaolongbao, though, took a little while to come but when they did they were really great, and worth the wait. 3 people's worth of food + left overs, paid with cash so got 10% off from the VIP card = under $35 for dinner, really amazingly awesome.  I am sure that we will come here many more times.
