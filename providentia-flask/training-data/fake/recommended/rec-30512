Just went here again and BOOM: the best brunch Downtown. Ordered a Bloody Mary, Chicken Sausage & Eggs, and of course had to dig into the buttery fluffy biscuits they kick off brunch with.  Everything was heaven.  The manager was dressed like Teen Wolf for Halloween, too!  Service was just as good as last time and the hostess checks on you if you're waiting which is nice. Dreaming of chicken sausage...
