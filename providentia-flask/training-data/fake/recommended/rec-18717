Visited the truck today at the Wooster Square Farmer's Market, so it featured local breads, cheeses, and meats. The grilled cheese ($5) was delicious, with sharp mustard and pickles to compliment. The kielbasa was super tasty as well. The guys in the truck were half of the experience, who were having a fabulous time. Will definitely draw me in to the Caseus restaurant at some point! There is also a challenge that accompanies the Truck, which is as follows (via the Caseus email): Create a sandwich, order 10 of them, eat all of them in a row within one hour without vomiting. Now you may name that sandwich, eat it for free, get a Cheese Truck shirt and your picture on our board next to your sandwich. Â  If you don't make it you must pay in full and you get nothing but full of cheese sandwiches. Good luck!
