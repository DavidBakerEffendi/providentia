I love this place.  It was sort of dumb luck that I initially went in on my way out of town for a cup of coffee and saw their menu and realized it wasn't at all what I would've expect from a deli.  I've been hooked ever since I first had the chance to try eating the food there.  If you expect brown gravy and yellow cheese over everything at a Mexican place, this is not for you.  My favorites would include the carnitas tacos, steak sopes, and the chilaquiles.  If mole anything is on special, consider it your lucky day and grab some.  They do not make it often, but I have been known to change my plans to get there for some of it when I see it on special on Facebook.  Also, this place is a great pick for anyone who has to follow a gluten free diet as most of the menu is available to them.  It's a refreshing change from the chain places and I hope people go out and support this small business.
