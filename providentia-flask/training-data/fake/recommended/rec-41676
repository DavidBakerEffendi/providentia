I think the pizza here is overrated -- it's too salty and the crust is too soft for me. I personally like Mr. Dino's pizza better but I recognize that this is New Jersey and everyone has an opinion! Nice service and a lot of classic Italian options in the dining room, and a reliable source of large quantities of basic Italian entrees for eat in or take out. I do like eating here -- I just think that the pizza isn't as great as I tend to hear around town.
