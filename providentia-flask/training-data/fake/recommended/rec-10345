Very disappointing. I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso's chicken, and Hot and Sour soup. The Kung Pao chicken was very bland, and did not have 1/10 of the flavor it should have had. The general Tso's chicken was overcooked, and had more fried elements than chicken. I was hoping the soup would be able to redeem this experience and it too failed to meet expectations. Would try someplace else, and will not be ordering from here again.
