This is one of our favorite pizza places in the city, and we're just thrilled that it opened up.  We've been there several times now, both eaten in and taken out.  I have found that a lot of pizza places in Philadelphia have not mastered the nuances of crust, but the crust of Little Italy's pizza is perfectly thin and crispy while retaining enough doughy-ness to fall ideally between thick/doughy and hard/crunchy.  You can also tell that the cheese is of good quality and not something cheap out of a ten pound plastic bag.  In addition to pizza they do your regular non-pizza pizza joint stuff: stromboli, pasta, hoagies and cheesesteaks.  The stromboli are huge, a really good size for the price, and the hoagies are served on nice traditional sesame seed rolls.  Among our favorites have been the stuffed spinach roll and the cheese steak wrap.  All three stromboli options (Italian, cheesesteak and veggie) have all been delicious. Also, a MUST TRY is the eggplant or eggplant and zucchini pizza, something I never though I'd like but ended up LOVING as has everyone else I've been with who has tried it!
