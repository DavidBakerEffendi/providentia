You can't miss this place. It's the spot with a line down the block no matter what time you show up. My only regret is not eating here sooner. The food was so delicious I came back 4 more times over the next month, nevermind the toll over the tunnel is twice the cost of the combo (6 bucks) and can quite frankly feed 2 but once you try it, you won't share! Stick with as much white sauce as possible and the the red sauce is spicy. There isn't parking. Be warned, this can lead to a massive addiction
