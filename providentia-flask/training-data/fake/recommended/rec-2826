If you would like something fun and easy to do for a change? Go to the Old Canal Inn. There you will eat good comfort food, drink a large variety of Domestic & Imported beers, receive friendly service, and watch live entertainment. On Friday night, January 31st, 2014, catch the return of "Jammin with the Band". Brad and the boys will thoroughly entertain you with their large repertoire of music as they play backup accompliment for songs sung by a variety of patrons. This is great fun to watch and participate in, and provides a chance to express your inner "rock star" self. If your lucky, you may even catch a song sung by Brad's wonderful wife K.T. She is the current "Angel" of this long time establishment. With a beautiful voice, and a sweet personality, she will more than inspire you to give singing "a shot". There is an extensive song list for you to choose from. In addition to the entertainment, there are two full bars, shuffleboard and of course darts. Get over to the Old canal Inn!
