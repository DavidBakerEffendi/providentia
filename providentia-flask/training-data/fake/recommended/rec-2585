This cozy, causal restaurant is localed in the East Village. Nice atmosphere for a causal date, however, I went there with a friend.  I started off my dinner with scallops wrapped in bacon. I was expecting big, succulent scallops, but it turned out to be tiny baby scallops. I did a get a bunch of them though.  For my entree, I had the lamb prepared three ways. It came with three pieces of lamb loin, one braised rib, and lamb sausage. I enjoyed the braised rib the best, however, there was way too much fat on it. Once I removed the fat, there was only one bit left of the meat. I wish I had more. The loin was delicious. The lamb sausage was really unique. I looked like lamb tartarte. It was pretty good.   We also ordered a side order of creamy polenta and hen of the woods mushrooms. The polenta was too creamy and rich, but the mushrooms were perfect.  For dessert, I had the pear and hazelnut crisp with cranberry sorbet. It was delicious! The crunchy hazelnut and oats really was a great combination. It was served warm. I also ordered a side of peanut butter brittle ice cream. I had to just to order it since it sounded so unique. The ice cream was really tasty with tiny bits of candy.   Overall, I thought the food was good. I don't think I would go back though.
