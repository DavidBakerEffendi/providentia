On my recent trip to NY I stumbled upon this pizza place and I was so glad I did. It was so yummy! I was on my way to see a show and needed some quick dinner before I headed to the theatre. I didn't have time for a sit down dinner, so when I saw the pizzeria I thought it was just perfect. I walked into the tiny cramped space (which is my only complaint) and took a look at all the pizza. They had so many to choose from! Seeing how this would be my first NY pizza experience I wanted it to be a good one, so I asked the guys behind the counter what their favorite was. They recommended the Lasagna pizza. I grabbed one of the open spots at the counter and waited just a few minutes for my slice. If I remember correctly there was room for about 4-5 people at the counter, depending on how close you wanted to sit to a stranger. The couple of gals next to me were visiting from Isreal and had some really yummy pasta. They actually offered me a bite to taste since they couldn't finish it all! How nice - so I did, and it was very yummy. My pizza was gigantic...took up the whole plate and more. It was topped with cheesy goodness,, meat and sauce galore. The flavor was wonderful. And although it was topped with lots of goodies, it didn't overwhelm the crust which was cooked just right. It wasn't soggy or anything. The guys behind the counter were great - I think the guy taking orders was named Joe? He was pretty cool, and I told him I would be back. When I went back over a week later I think he recognized me and thanked me for coming again - but who knows if he really did. But either way he was very friendly. My second trip there my mom and I shared a piece of the basil and tomato pizza which was excellent. So, if you don't mind being squished at a counter with strangers, or standing in a cramped little space, I recommend this place for pizza. P.S. You New Yorkers sure beat us Californians when it comes to pizza! I will miss your pizza!!
