I just crossed this restaurant after picking my rental car from Hertz, and want to give it a shot. Being a first timer here and never read any reviews about this place I had no expectation and went in. Had 'Grilled Flat Bread Panini', to be honest it was awesome. The flavor and taste of the food was so good not to mention the care that has been put to pact it. I just loved it and it can not get better. They have quite a choice of desserts & home made sauces (packed) Â and just remained me of the I visited once in Brussels which was quite an authentic place. I highly suggest this place, wonderful food, place and most important amazing service.
