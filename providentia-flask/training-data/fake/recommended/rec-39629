Yuca Bar is fabulously fun and has been as long as I've been going, since 2003. The caipirinha's will knock you on your ass, but in a good way. Always busy on the weekends; the bar area will be packed so you'll have to elbow your way in. The hostess here is a doll (if you're nice to her) and always trying to get people seated quickly. The fish tacos are great (but take note that the fish is fried). You don't get as much guacamole as you'll want, especially if you have 3 or more people. This is a great spot to start your night no matter what season.
