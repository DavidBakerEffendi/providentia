What a treat!  A relaxed atmosphere, everyone seemed comfortable in their skin, not more pretentious than they are.  Our waiter was helpful with suggestions, was nearby if we needed something, but left us along to enjoy, which was very much appreciated. I started with the lepinja sa kajmakom - reminded me of a moister, chewier, flatter english muffin with cream cheese inside and cut into squares. YOU MUST TRY - it's AMAZING.  So is the complimentary bread with red pepper spread.   I also HIGHLY recommend the cabbage salad - it's one of the best I've ever had.  They also had a tomato feta soup on special which is OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious.   They don't accept credit cards - bring cash!
