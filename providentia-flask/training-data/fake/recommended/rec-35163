Been a while, but lunch visit with co-workers. Decided to try the Torishio ramen. Broth -Chicken and portk shio Light clear broth with sheen of oil Very good chicken impact. Noodles - Standard Ippudo affair. Very good and perfectly cooked, Chashu - 2 pieces. Good, but not overly fatty and very thin. Toppings - Minced sweet plum onion. Big Like. Spreading tartness and crunch throughout the noodles. Menma - hard to go wrong, not overly plentiful. Chili flkaes added a spike if heat now and then, good element. Seasoned boiled egg, was soft, runny and flavorful - well executed. The cost of the bowl is Ippudo standard. Not a bargain by any means. $19 with the added egg. A really good bowl of shio. Definitely in the top 3 I've had this year. Not as spicy and kicky as the shio at Jin (which has a slight vegetal taste) and not as much depth or Â salty/ oily or as the version for Ivan. I'd put it at Number 3, but where you'd rank it would be a matter of personal preference. I could easily understand someone ranking it Number 1.
