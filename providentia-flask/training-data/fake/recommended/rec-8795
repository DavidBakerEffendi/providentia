Let me say this place was GREAT, I recommend, to anyone. I must say space is a bit tight you will be seating very close to your neighbor your table will be pulled away to get in Lol. Besides that menu is Good I had the Bone Marrow it was sweet and tangy, marinated with oxtail and beets served with little pieces of toast. first time I loved it!! I also had perogies very small serving is 6 taste. I also tried the Paella it was a bit Â Spicy but Awesome. Atmosphere was dim, loud music very upbeat, after hour crowd open till 4am must try everything else. Loved this place . A Gem in NYC for me
