Erm... Why is this the best pizza in the world? I so wanted to like it, and so did my husband. The pizza we ordered was a Margherita with meatballs. The meatballs were good and the cheese delicious, but other than that... It was expensive, and the pizza wasn't even hot. It felt like it was already done, they threw the meatballs on top of it and heated it a little. The Bruschetta was very good though. That first bite was a glorious moment for my taste buds. Other than that, the servers were uninterested and couldn't care less about us (the customers). I left a $3 tip for a $37 bill and my husband said it was too much. Sorry Lombardi's but it wasn't what I expected.
