Lovely decor Dining Music I liked ( no bass, not loud) Greeted with welcoming smile Awful quality of food. Don't see how they will last. Pad Thai too oily, poor flavor, three broccoli florets (so firm my fork needed force), 3 baby corn and 1 piece box Choy with some tofu. Vegetable salad appetizer: be sure to say dressing on the side as my dish came with more dressing than salad and because  dressing was thick ( corn starch?) it really was not appetizing at all. I left most behind and gently told the woman that I was done but to tell the kitchen ....  And like another reviewer, I too was basically blamed!  I was told to ask for less next time! There will not be a next time.
