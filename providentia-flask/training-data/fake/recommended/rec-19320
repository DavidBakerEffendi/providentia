AMAZING food and drinks!! They have this "dinosaurus bone size" beef short ribs, melt in your mouth kinda dish. And this one open face sandwich-like dish with bread made with their homemade pizza dough. So gooooooood! The only sad thing is they got rid of this yummy cocktail called St Rosemary. :_( BUT the bartender was very nice and he made me a drink with Hendrick's Gin that was yummy yummsters. If I live next door to this place I prolly end up in an AA meeting.
