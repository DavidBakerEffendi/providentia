Considering the price of each dish, I felt it was definitely worth the money spent as each morsel hit my palette. It was getting late on a Tuesday night when my bf and I decided to call to see if they would still seat a table of 2 at 9:45pm. Though they stated they closed at 10:30pm, they said they'd wait for us to cab there. We didn't end up leaving the restaurant until close to 11:15pm. They didn't bother to offer us the dessert menu (haha! gee, I wonder why?) But I was surprise they didn't hurry our meals along either. The feel of the restaurant offered a relaxed ambience in the midst of a quite deserted section of NYC that given night. I was actually taken aback such an elegant restaurant existed amongst the deserted streets when the cab driver told us we've arrived. (if that totally made me sound like a non-local, it's cause I am Californian^^) What we ordered: -hommus (the combination of the texture & taste = yum! ) -garden salad (fresh! & the dressing went perfect with it) -black iron shrimp (a lil bit spicy but it had a nice kick to it) -seared wagyu beef (a bit too salty for me; had to balance with rice) -lamb chops (omg the sauce made this my favorite dish of the night) -chicken shish taouk (the meat was so tender and juicy) -bowl of rice (this was so good! moist, not dry) They also provided warm pitas for us. Bonus dish! I don't even know what it's called but they gave us something to munch on - on the house - while we waited for our food. I would definitely come here again :)
