I love the Good Fork for many reasons. First, their food. It is damn good, without fail. I haven't eaten anything there that I've thought was just okay. It's all really freaking good. Second, it is a beautiful setting. The guy-owner is apparently a carpenter too (some real estate article in the Sunday NYT discussed this) and he made the interior! You can tell. It's funky without shoving it in your face, which is really nice in Brooklyn. Third, it's in Red Hook...which is good and bad: Good because it will never ever become as mobbed as it would if it were located in say, Manhattan, or even on Smith St in nearby Carroll Gardens; bad because unless you live in Red Hook (which I don't) it is kind of a gamble to get a seat, and they really don't have a good place to wait, which is a drag in cold weather. Luckily, there are a few bars located within a few minutes' walk, and they are willing to call you when the table is ready. We celebrated with 6 of our friends here recently - a table for 8 - and they were friendly, flexible, we brought 2 bottles of wine and payed for corkage, as well as purchasing some cocktails and a bottle of wine too. Everyone was totally blissed out - so delicious! so pretty! so fun! The waitress was even fun too. I forget her name, but she was great. Go there! Now! You'll love it.
