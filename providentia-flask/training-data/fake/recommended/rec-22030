We read the Yelp Reviews... and noticed that the worst reviews were most recent. It was for the 4th of July and we wanted to see the fireworks, so all (4) agreed... "Just try it. Could be some Yelpers with different taste than ours..." Our mistake! Pros: Location to water (& Fireworks) Cons: Service was clearly seasonal - meaning undereducated about what to do and lacked any experience Food DOES NOT EQUAL PRICE POINTS - remotely For the holiday, they had two seatings (7 & 9). We showed up early because we did not want to hit "traffic" due to the holiday... The young lady guarding their private lot would not let us in because we were earlier than our reservation.. understood, EXCEPT the lot was only 50% full. She also had some attitude, which turned us off to start off the expensive meal.
