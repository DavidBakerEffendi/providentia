What a great find.  We aren't from the area but wanted a nice local place before the a Ref Bulle game.  As an aside, we parked in front and had only a half mile walk to the arena, so saved on traffic and parking fees! That was unknown at booking.  Great service. Wonderful owner. Way overly surprised.  We all loved our dishes. They had an amazing seafood stuffed calamari special. Wow!! My shrimp scampi was perfect with only a little butter.  Great drinks.  Will be our go to pre-game place!!
