Maybe it's my fault. I had outsize expectations for a lobster roll from Red Hook, Brooklyn thinking it would be comparable to something I've eaten in Maine or Connecticut ( I mean the roll I got was called the Connecticut), but it just wasn't. The bun had way too much butter on it turning the bread into goop, the lobster was limp and flavorless. The best part of my meal was the chips and soda. I won't be back.
