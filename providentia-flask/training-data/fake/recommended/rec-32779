I've been to Bartaco a couple of times, both not during peak hours - so I can't really speak to wait times or server issues (no wait either time, and our waiters were nice and responsive). My friends and I really enjoyed their meat and shrimp tacos; the pork belly is a standout, the duck is cooked and seasoned nicely (although there's nothing else on the taco, so it's a bit boring), and the lamb barbacoa has a great flavor and kick. The chicken and fish tacos are less tasty, but not bad. Also, the grilled corn side is a standout. My biggest complaint is the drink prices. I understand that it's West Hartford but the food prices are so much lower relative to the drink prices that they seem inflated. I could understand paying double digits at neighbor/rich relative Barcelona, but not here. Regardless, it's worth it for the food.
