Put aside of what you expect from a normal cheese burger expect about the juiciness and how comforting it is. The flavors here just play of each other. There is sweetness and just a bit of heat. The crunch from the bread and the freshness from their greens just add layers of flavor to the party. The juices from the burger will soak through and you will want to lick your fingers clean. There is a reason almost every single person has a burger in front of them.
