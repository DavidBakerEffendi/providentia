I tried Ishkabibbles for the first time last week following the winter classic Jims was closed and I was craving a cheese steak.  I went with a few friends 3 cheese steaks came to just under 30 dollars a little steep but that's fine as long as its good.  My cheese steak was so overcooked I could really only detect texture, there was zero flavor to the meat.  I ended up going back a few nights ago to try the chicken cheese steak hoagie which was even worse.  Within the first 2 bites of this sandwich I pulled out a pretty sizable piece of hard tendon out of my mouth on the third bite the same thing even a bigger piece of tendon and that's when I totally lost my appetite.  At 10 bucks a sandwich do me a favor and trim the chicken up a little better you might waste a little more chicken but you can afford it you're charging people 10 dollars a sandwich and I know the owners aren't putting any money into the shop itself it's a total s@&* hole.  Long story short stick to the fries they were great but the sandwiches were terrible.
