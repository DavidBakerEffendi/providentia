I honestly can't believe a place like this exists. My fianc√© literally gagged on his food tonight. We're convinced they adhere to the concept of "sustainable" by actually serving their neighbors garbage. I don't know where all the 5 star reviews are coming from. There was nothing fresh about this place. The rice was old and the fish smelled like it had been left rotting under the boardwalk. In opposition to most of the other one star reviews, the service was probably the only good part of our experience. Service was quick and waitress was friendly. We're not masochists though, so we politely paid our bill and ordered pizza across the street.
