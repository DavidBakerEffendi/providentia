A sentimental favorite -- the real deal in Cocina Criolla.  The weekly Puerto Rican turkey dinner (Saturday afternoons) is a singular offering. Mofongo always available;  really good on demand tostones with freshly prepared chopped garlic.  Often they have their bespoke hot sauce which is complex and vibrant.
