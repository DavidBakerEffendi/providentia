Great food and great service. From our arrival we were greeted by a super friendly host, and while we weren't seated until our 3rd person arrived (the restaurant was empty) we eventually got to sit down. The food has small portions for sharing but all was really good. The tilapia tacos, braised beefs minis, croquettes and empanadas were all amazing. They also have a fun drink menu. Were were then treated to a complimentary dessert wine after our meal. Definitely will be back there!
