I came to Cuba on a Saturday afternoon it was like 4pm. We didn't make any reservations, but I guess the place gets busy because another couple told us they came here all the time but before 7pm is the best time to come. Any way the hostess was nice gave us a table but told us that by 7:30 she needed the table back which kind of sucks because you feel timed while your eating and socializing. But I guess it was fine since we didn't make any reservations. We ordered the tamale to share.. The arroz con pollo and my boyfriend ordered the ceviche. Let me tell you I'm a fat a** lol I need a good amount of food on my plate. I felt the portions were quite small maybe it's just me though you know since I'm a big eater. My bf ceviche was so small we were hungry after we left since we were timed we didn't order anything else. I had the mojito since the waiter recommended it was good had enough alcohol. The food itself was delicious but I would of liked to have more! Overall we had a good experience at Cuba, just make sure to make reservations!
