five spice duck burger original burger truffle fries margarita peached high decibel atmosphere, placed our names for 20 minute wait. after 30, went back to the hostess to tell her we'll just eat at the bar, she looked as if she forgot we were even on the list. been to the los feliz location many times before always with initial amazement then later downfall. ordered the duck burger as it is only offered at this location. the first bite was pretty good, then the rich flavors and weird mixes (peach apple chutney tasted just like applesauce) became overwhelming with the palate. it was then i remembered why i never had the desire to come here.
