Indian restaurant without any real Indians in this city. Interesting. Only Indian restaurant I've been to where I didn't have to order naan and rice separately which sort of felt good. I just ordered my entree and it all came out on one plate. Â I got the Paneer Tika which was surprisingly good. Customer service could of used a bit more servicing. Also sort of a small place so make a reservation if you plan on making it a night out.
