Mood Cafe could be the bench mark for quality service in the food industry. Never before have I been greeted so warmly and had so much time spent in finding the perfect meal for everyone in our party. This alone is worthy of the rating, and yet the food is equally amazing. Hands down the best lassi's I've ever had, and the chaat was so uplifting and thoughtful. Mood Cafe goes above and beyond every expectation a person could have.
