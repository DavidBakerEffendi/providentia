I'm hesitant to give this place such a good review because I want this place all to myself and those I love, but I'll share the blessing in Brooklyn which is Lot 2. The menu is artfully made, the service is spot on and the atmosphere is friendly and warm - the perfect place for a well-made burger and finished with some berry buckle. Thank you Lot 2 for showing the neighborhood what good food is. What a nice place to eat looks like and how foodies and nonfoodies alike can get a delicious meal. I (we) will be back!
