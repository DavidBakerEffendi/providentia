I really love the bread at Cafe V. I had a hoagie there once with prosciutto, mozzarella, roasted peppers, oil, and the BEST bread ever! It was soft and sweet...perfect with the roasted peppers. And Victoria, the owner, is my favorite! She always has something to smile about! And the place is beautiful! Very cool and welcoming! Perfect place to relax with a hot cup or coffee or tea and get some work done.
