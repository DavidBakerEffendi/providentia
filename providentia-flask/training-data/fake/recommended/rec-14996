Yeah, I gotta go five stars here.  I can't find a thing wrong with the dining experience my girl and I had at Talula's.  Wonderful atmosphere as we walked through the outdoor garden seating, had a relaxing drink at the stylish bar and were then seated in the very comfortable dining room.  Many happy diners surrounded us as we experienced the best service the city has to offer.  Our waiter was right on time with everything and he was a pleasure to deal with.  The food was excellent and very tasty.  The roasted vegetables were fresh and delicious and I would highly recommend the Halibut Rockefeller.  When you're checking Philly restaurants of your list, you win some and you lose some.  Talula's was a big win!  Just a great experience.
