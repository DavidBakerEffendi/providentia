Service and food alone will not justify this 4-star rating, but the experience of cooking your own steak on the hot plate will do. Â The steak is mediocre, it's not the best, but you know what you're getting into for a $20 steak dinner. The staff is friendly and checked up on my table frequently. On the other hand, the restaurant is a bit out of style and not as hygienic as I wanted it to be. I had wine with my meal, it was ok, but the only problem was that the glass had water spot and seemed like it wasn't thoroughly cleaned enough. I would rate this restaurant would be 3 stars if it wasn't for the hot plate experience.
