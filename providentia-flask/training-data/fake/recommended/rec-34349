Went here while in town for work based on Yelp reviews. Maybe it was a fluke, but I thought it was pretty meh. Chicken chow fun was fine, the noodles were too thick and the sauce bland. The rangoons were good but the dipping sauce was too sweet without any tang. It seemed like pretty mediocre food for $14 for one person.
