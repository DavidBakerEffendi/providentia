Was here on a Friday night (my 4th time this year) and it was crowded but i did make reservations and got seated outdoors. Bottom line this place is never disappoints and is perfect place for a romantic 2nd or 3rd date. There are many good wine bar/restaurants in this hood but this is my fave! Try to get a seat outdoors in the back, even if it means arriving around 7:30. The wine list is great and the menu is perfect if you want to share apps or small dishes, the meatballs are great and the waiters do not rush you out. Â One thing i noticed is that even when it gets crowded, it does not get too noisy.
