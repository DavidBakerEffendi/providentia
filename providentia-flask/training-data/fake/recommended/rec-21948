5 stars for this place. I work very close by and this is my go to when I'm not feeling fast foods. My favorite is a toasted cream cheese and jelly bagel. The bagels are warm, not over toasted, they give a good amount of cream cheese and the bagels are big. They have a good drink and bakery selection also. The muffins in the front are really good. I've also had there tuna salad on a roll for lunch. It's delicious, fresh tuna with chips and a fresh pickle on the side. Good service all the time. But be aware sometimes their hours aren't as stated.
