Get ready for a wishy woshy review that shouldn't help you make any decisions whatsoever. I reluctantly went  back on Sunday.  The food was much better because we stuck to a pizza, three pastas, and the vegetable antipasta.  These were all simple dishes done well. While I like the pizzas at the other trendy pizzarias around town better, I did enjoy the one we ordered with the golden raisins.   The food was good.  The service was amazing from our server and the sommelier spend a nice amout of time with us.  I think my expectations of the place are so low, they could only go up from here.  I previously rated them a 1, they are now a 3.  I like the rustic decor more than the taste of the food.
