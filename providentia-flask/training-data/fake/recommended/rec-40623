Went here last Saturday with 3 other ladies.  We ALL really enjoyed this place.  I had a very different impression when I entered the trendy spot in Hell's Kitchen.  The service was great, the food was great and it was way more affordable than I all the aforementioned trendy features foretold.  Drinks, apps, and dinner entrees for 4 and we only spent about $110 TOTAL!  I left with a very full stomach and in complete shock.  I will be going back.
