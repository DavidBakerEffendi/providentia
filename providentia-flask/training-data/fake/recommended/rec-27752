Excellent place, but really clear your entire night if you're going.  We had a solid 3 hours for a four person dinner.  Menu was incredibly interesting and detailed on the menu.  Wait staff was extremely knowledgeable on each item.  Menu changes with the seasons so it's regularly being updated.  Portions are somewhere between appetizer and entree.  I went 4 courses, 3 are probably enough for anyone.  Only thing that keeps it from a fifth star was it was  pricey.  All-in it was $225 for a couple, and that's without liquor.  Parties of 5 have an auto 20% tip, Parties of 7 is 25%.
