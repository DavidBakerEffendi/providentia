Whoa Whoa... Hold on, filet meat in the Lomo Saltado?!??  Having visited Peru, and consistently geeking out on Peruvian food in LA, I eagerly headed to Pio Pio (seeing they had 710 reviews and all)... Here's the dealio, start with a pisco sour (or 3), then switch to the Sangria pitcher for dinner!  Order the ceviche to start, then the Lomo Saltado (duh) and the Aji De Gallina, perfect one-two punch!  If you're craving more fish, the sea bass dish is also unreal, but try to get after the Aji and Lomo if it's your first time, can't go wrong!
