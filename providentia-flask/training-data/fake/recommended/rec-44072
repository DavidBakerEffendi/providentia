I have tried a different dish every time I've gone here, and they are all delicious.  The tea leaf salad is a very interesting combination of flavors!  The portions are very generous, and while the waitstaff is a little hit-or-miss in terms of service, the food is so good that I just don't care (also doesn't hurt that the wine is cheap).  I have gone in there with a large party before and they were very accommodating.  You should definitely try this restaurant!!!
