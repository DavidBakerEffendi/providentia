Street food at it's best!  Out of all the food I conquered while visiting NYC, this halal cart offered some of the tastiest and cheapest food I ate the whole trip. The chicken is good, but I definitely prefer the lamb.  Mix it up with flavorful rice, lettuce, plenty of white sauce, a drizzle of hot sauce, and a side of pita, and you've got the most amazing pile of goodness you'll ever get off the street!  After inhaling just about everything, I instantly had one of the most intense food comas ever.  Totally worth it though. Oh boy... salivation and self-induced hunger are suddenly taking over... I better stop soon.  Let me just say this... If you're on a trip to Manhattan, don't you dare leave the city without stopping by.
