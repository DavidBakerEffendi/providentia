Loved this place! My boyfriend's mother was in town last night and spotted So Crepe on our way home. We went in shortly before they closed (didn't realize at the time) ordered 8 different crepes and they were all fantastic. The service was wonderful- Everything came out very quickly and everyone was incredibly nice. I'm very excited for my next visit.
