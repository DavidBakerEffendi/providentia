What a great find, thanks yelp! True farm to table and delicious.  Started with the pate, topped with honeycomb-nice touch.  The short ribs where amazing as was the kale mashed potatoes.  The sides were a little over thought: $7 for one ear of corn so covered in parmesan it was hard to eat, yet everything else was so good I'll let it slide. Service was excellent and the staff so nice and knowledgeable about the menu and where the food came from. Not really a spot for kids but they totally accommodated my well behaved 8 year old when I promised I wouldn't take up the table for long. (It was my suggestion as they are small and I know turnover is important to a new establishment like this) We ended up joining friends later at the bar and getting to talk to the staff who were awesome. My new favorite spot in NYC.
