Stephen Starr does it again with this neighborhood gem.  Decent draft selection and cheap eats enable this beer garden to be an ideal first or second date scene.  Attracts a more mature crowd (not younger 20s).  Although the place is energetic and a bit loud it still allows one to continue a conversation. A+!
