Two words: GREAT SANDWICHES. I visited Village Whiskey for dinner on a Wednesday night. I was surprised that it wasn't too busy, which is great because it is on the smaller side. The decor is super cute and everything looks rustic but modern at the same time. They also serve great craft beers, and some fancy whiskey that I tried to stay away from, LOL. I ordered the Cheese Puffs for an appetizer, and they were sooo scrumptious, I could've eaten 5 orders. then I had the veggie burger with guacamole and truffled mushrooms. It was by far the best veggie burger I had in my life. Next time (when I'm not dieting) I will totally try the Foie Gras burger! The prices are reasonable (my IPA was $6, and my burger $8). Service was a bit slow, but nothing alarming. And also, I don't know if they have happy hour (which in my opinion, EVERY bar should have). If they do have it, it's not advertised anywhere, which is lame. I will return for more cheese puffs and sandwiches, LOL.
