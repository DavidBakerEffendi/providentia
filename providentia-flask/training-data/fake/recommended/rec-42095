I drove all the way here from crown heights with my fellow foodie friend (shes from flatbush) and we shared, lobster bisque, Â calamari (she had gelatinous yuck $3.00 oysters), 2 craft beers and we shared the lobster roll dinner. All under a pretty fly outdoor sitting for $67.00 bucks! Good food, good company. ..fin check it out, we'll be back for happy hour!
