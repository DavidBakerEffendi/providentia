These guys are still pretty good and I can say that I have been going here for about 10 years now. They are basically the McDonalds of Halal Cart food in the city. They have however traded up a bit of taste for speed and cashflow. Still $5 for a mixed platter, $6 with Pita or soda The major down side recently has been...in order to speed up the process the food is no longer made to order...they precook the food (there is a lot of turn over so no worries on the freshness) and then dump it into plastic containers. C'mon guys...someone is going to get the bottom of the barrel one day and it is not going to be pretty. Also the use of plastic containers Â to store the precooked food turned me off a bit. The chicken used to come in chunks now has been reduced to hash or pulled chicken at best. and the lamb is almost ground up before they have chopped it too fine. I think this is what give Sammy's in Queens the leg up on the halal guys.
