italian? quick pizza. fast service. hilarious man behind the counter rushing my friend to place his order. slices for $2.50. my friend got the steak and he said it was awesome. the cooks hated him cause he placed his order past 2am but it was all a funny scene to watch. ahhh pizza, bringing people together all over the world!
