My review is based on a dining experience and not a bar/club experience.  To start, I really like what they have done with the place since taking it over from Playwright/Wicked Wolf. It's a lot more open, less divey/dingy and you don't feel like you are in a cave. They also added some pool tables between the front and back rooms which are fun. The vodka room upstairs is pretty cool too. They do have a lot of beers on tap, and many of them are local and regional which is a nice touch. Onto the food, which is what caused my experience here to be just eh. We all got a bunch of things to share and it was all very hit or miss. The pesto chicken sandwich did not seem to have any pesto on it.  If it did, I neither tasted it nor saw it. The fries that came with the sandwich were soggy and unappetizing. We ordered another side of fries about an hour later and they were delicious and fresh so not sure why the inconsistency.  Our salad was also really good, but it's hard to screw up some cranberries and walnuts on top of some lettuce. I'd say this place is good if you are looking for some cheap mediocre bar food or to maybe check out a game on the TVs but don't come here expecting a culinary masterpiece.
