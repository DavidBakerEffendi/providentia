Excellent authentic, homemade style Italian food. We've eaten here and will definitely go back for dinner soon. However, I was more inclined to take time to post a review after having gotten some catering trays from Maria and her father the chef. We had a death in the family and needed some good comfort food for relatives coming back to the house between services. La Riviera is typically closed on Mondays (the day we needed the order), but happened to be hosting a special gluten-free dinner that evening. Maria was so kind and accommodating, that they were happy to take my order and prepare it in the afternoon in a separate area away from any early prep for their special ingredient dinner service. They went out of their way to cook for us and to have it ready exactly when we needed it. They could not have been nicer if they tried. Now, the main reason my review matters to you... MOST of the family visiting us in Clifton was here from BROOKLYN, and they all raved about the food! If an Italian family born and raised in Brooklyn NYC can be that impressed with La Riviera's food, then I'd be sold on going for dinner, even if I wasn't there to hear it myself. Â Thanks Maria, we'll be in for dinner soon!
