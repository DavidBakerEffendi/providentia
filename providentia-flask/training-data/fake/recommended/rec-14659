This was my absolute best dining experience in New York and it was lunch! If you get the opportunity to have a leisurely lunch, this restaurant cannot be beat. It was $36 for a beautiful, delicious, six course meal. The Â mushroom flan is a must. My husband got it and I wanted to steal it from him. I got the skate, which was delicious, but that mushroom flan with crab meat is out of this world good. The meal ended with the most delicious chocolate dessert ever! Ever! They have an extraordinary wine list (least expensive bottles are around $65, so beware) and the service is outstanding. The ambiance is also incredible, unlike other New York restaurants where you are cramped, Bouley is spacious and comfortable. I can't wait to go back!
