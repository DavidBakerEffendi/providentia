EAT HERE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. We were in New York and it was a Tuesday night around midnight. We were looking for a place to eat that was not pizza or hot dogs and that we could have a decent night and enjoy the atmosphere. What we hit was the mother load. The ambiance was cozy, dark and inviting. The food was amazing. Home made past at 1 am!! The gnocchi we got for the table as an appetizer and was def the best I have ever had. Being a restaurant owner myself, I judge on everything and I have to say the staff was perfect and there seemed to be a manager/owner who thanked us when we walked out and those are the little things that are so so very important. Great job UVA. We will be back!
