This place has really good burritos and the ingredients are very fresh. I also like the fact that they are always showing football--or soccer for you Americans! But the place has horrible customer service. I mean horrible. They act like you are doing them a favor by ordering food! how could these people stay in business? do they get any training or do they think rudeness is IN? Anyways the help is killing this business.
