Went there around 11:30 on our way back to NYC, so I'm not sure if my experience there was due to the fact that the kitchen would be closing soon.   Gave it 2 starts for  these reasons 1) Hostesses were too busy having a convo with themselves to notice me.   Had to cut them off to be seated. 2 This place was RIDICULOUSLY loud especially when they do the "hbd" gig.  The worst place to bring a date; but fine for the  gf/bf .   3) Ordered the roasted pork with the yucca fries. It took less than 8min to come out, and was cold... Really regretting not sending it back. I believe it was an order that was sent back by another table. Oh, and our water glasses looked like they were used.   Disgusting! 4) Tables were so battered. Maybe there's a cuban connection with the tables so they don't want to chuck them, but they need lots of TLC In any case never going back. Nope, sorry Gary. - that was our very pleasant sever : )
