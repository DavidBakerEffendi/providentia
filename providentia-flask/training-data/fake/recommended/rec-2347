The crust is perfect for those of us who like a very thin, crispy crust.  Oddly, Table 87 does not have a pepperoni topping, but offers soppressata.  The sausage is not crumbled, but sliced length wise.  Moving beyond these oddities, the margherita slice is delicious.  You can eat in or take out and they even sell slices.  Really nice gentlemen take your order.  This pie is a lot like Grimaldi's and Lucali's; nothing like Sottocasa.  $38 for two pies.
