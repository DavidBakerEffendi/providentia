Food was good, at best, however, service brought it down. Bacon donuts are AMAZING!!!  Everything else needs improvement. Scallops came with nuts on them, which it stated on the menu but failed to notice and one of us has a nut allergy.  We apologized for having missed the fact that there were nuts listed but we could not eat them and were immediately scolded by some grease ball with a ponytail for not telling our server.  Then, we were scolded by our server after we apologized to her for OUR mistake in not noticing.  Now, this has happened a couple of times here or there, our fault, their fault, whatever but when it has been our error, we ALWAYS add the cost of the dish to the tip.  Now, when we got the new order, they were completely under-cooked...still translucent in the center.  Didn't bother to say anything so just took them home knowing we could finish cooking them here. Can't deal with the whole, this is Brooklyn, bitch, and I can barely breathe because my Comme des Garcon skinny jeans are, seriously, WAY too tight because they were on sale at Barneys, didn't have my exact size so had to buy a whole size down and I've only had a rice cake and half a pack of cigarettes ALL day....go f*ck yourself. Never returning...
