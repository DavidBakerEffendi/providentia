I went for dinner on a weeknight without reservations and was seated almost immediately. It was relatively good service and the food was quick and delicious! I had the Room Service Pad Thai, which comes wrapped in an egg white omelette and the thin glass noodles were different from the American-influenced pad thais you would get in most Thai places. The decor is also worth mentioning. The dimly lit interior was complemented by mirrors on the ceilings and walls, so that the cozy space felt bigger than it actually was. There was also a huge chandelier that was encased in glass in the middle of the restaurant as well. Great place for a date or a quick bite to eat with friends.
