Food was phenomenal.  We did the tasting menu and I loved that we could get a little of a lot of different options at a reasonable price with reasonable portions.  The scallop appetizer was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  It was perfect.  The rabbit pasta was very good but the gnocchi my companions ordered was better.  The stuffed trout was absolutely delicious - I wouldn't change a thing!  Finally dessert - we each got something different and the chocolate flourless torte was the best.  They are BYOB and cash only - but there is a spirits store across the street and an ATM on the premises.  Oh yes, the homemade bread served at the start is also very tasty with a salted crust and served with a smooth hummus.  Our waitress was a bit flighty but overall very friendly and eager to please.  She was attentive and overall service was excellent.  Atmosphere is the one area where the restaurant could improve.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't much to see.  But if you appreciate the food - this is the place to go!
