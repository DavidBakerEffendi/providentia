I was actually in the area after shopping at Fairway market and paying another visit to BAKED. I had no idea that this even existed! It was all Mr. Husband's idea to come here. At first glance, it isn't the most impressive looking place, it's kinda a hole in the wall and there's no dining area. We walked in, took a glance at the place then looked at the menu which was hanging from the ceitling above the cash register. I decided on the lobster roll maine style. I didn't eat it there, I took it to go. Once home, I dug in! I bow to you red hook lobster pound. This has got to be the best tasting lobster roll I've had. The bread was toasted to the right amount of crunchiness.The amount of mayo was just right, it wasn't overkill like some places and the lobster meat was seasoned perfectly. They definitely were not cheap with the meat cause I got chunks and chunks of lobster meat with every bite. AND it was just the perfect size for me! I finished the entire thing! im coming back!! please have my roll ready!
