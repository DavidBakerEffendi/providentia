Great place for lunch. Decor is so cute (unusual for Hell's Kitchen), and the lunch special is cheap. Food isnt the best thai that i've had, but its good. The only thing that pisses me off about this place is that the food takes a while to come out, and the servers aren't very attentive. But def try it if you're in the area.
