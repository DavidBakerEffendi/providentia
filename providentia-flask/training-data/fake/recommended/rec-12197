My friend and I realized we were hungry right as we were standing in front of Meltkraft, so naturally we ordered the Brielle grilled cheese and split it. And yes, it was the best grilled cheese I've ever had. Â I expected more cranberry chutney and was disapointed at first - until I had my first bite. Everything just flowed together so nicely. The one negative was the potato chips --- wayy too salty. I'll be back!
