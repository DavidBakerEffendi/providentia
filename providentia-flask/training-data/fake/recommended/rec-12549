Ive read on numerous websites that this place has the best pancakes in nyc. I have to admit I was not disappointed. The only downside was the 45 min wait for a table for two and it is a very small space so it was very crowded. Plus side the staff was very friendly and helping. Would definitely come back here again earlier on a weekday.
