I came here twice during my short stay in Burlington, once to the restaurant and once to the bar downstairs. The first trip involved 5 people and dinner. Despite the crowd we were given a pager and a seat at the bar. Our table was ready relatively quickly and the service was great. I had a veggie dish of corn cakes and kale and salad with beets and goat cheese. Both were fantastic!!!! The best bite of the night came from the couple of mussels I knicked from my son's plate. These babies were PEI and huge!!! I will definitely return to the Farmhouse the next time I'm in Burlington.
