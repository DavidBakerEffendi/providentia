Pros: Staff was very friendly and attentive , BYOB is a plus. Outdoor seating is a nice option. Food arrived very quickly. Cons: The chicken taco salad - it arrived in a very deep bowl that made it difficult to get a mix of the ingredients. First few bites were all shredded cheese until I got to the rest of the course. Chicken was a bit dry and unimpressive. Â Ended up dumping the ingredients into a take out container and eating the bowl separately. Overall the place was average.
