Great dogs on delicious rolls firm enough to stand up to the toppings.  The Texas Hold'em had the right balance of bacon, cheese, BBQ sauce and hot sauce for a satisfying meal to the end.  Bronx bomber with onions, mustard and onions very flavorful but could have used less toppings as it fell apart towards the end and I just ate the dog.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Nice addition to South Street.  I'll be back for sure.
