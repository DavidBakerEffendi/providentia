Very spotty service. The food was too sweet for thai and had odd tasting meat. I went here cause i heard good things but man i was wrong. Drinks came out way after the meals. The papaya salad was small and toooo sweet. I had noodle soup and it had a minerally taste which was unbearable. Good luck..
