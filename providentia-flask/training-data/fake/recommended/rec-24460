My date and I had arrived here on a rainy Friday evening.  The hostesses were amiable (I had my reservations as I've read in other reviews that the Friday night gal was a bit standoffish).  We waited about 15 mins. or so past our reservation time to be seated but enjoyed a cocktail by the bar.  The bartender was attentive and friendly even though the tiny bar area was full.  The cocktail menu wasn't extensive yet it was thoughtful and the drinks were delicious.  The wine list was also well composed with a decent selection of wines by the glass.  The food was cooked well, although my grilled octopus was slightly overcooked towards the tip of the tentacle.  Great date spot and guaranteed to impress.
