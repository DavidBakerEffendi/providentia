I usually write semi-informative, semi-serious reviews, but for Honest Tom's, I need to express my most basic, loving emotions. Pre-burrito: Mmmm burrito. During burrito eating: Mmm burrito nom nom nom nom. Post-burrito: :( more burrito? Seriously, check this place out. Everything is good, price tag should not deter you from at least a one time experience.
