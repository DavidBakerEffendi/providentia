My wife ordered some food to take out at this restaurant.  When presented with the bill the prices were different from the menu prices.  When brought to the attention of the person who took the order, he said there is a new menu with different prices.  He refused to honor the prices on the original menu.  And was far from being accommodating especially when the difference in price did not amount to a significant amount.  This guy was rude and argumentative.  Also on a prior occasion we ordered food and it was extremely salty.  I think their explanation was that the cook accidentally poured the salt from a box and too much came out! Even if you do not have high blood pressure this is not the place to eat! Also, it is apparent that the people who run this place do not believe that customer satisfaction is a priority.  It is not a friendly atmosphere and I would guess that they are going to go out of business at the rate they are going! As for the other positive reviews, my guess is either they work there or are related to the owner.
