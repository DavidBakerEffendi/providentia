A friend and I went there this evening.  I went past it a couple of weeks ago and have been wanting to give it a try.  As has been commented on in previous posts, the decor  is pretty uninspiring but who cares?  We went for the food and it was very good.  I've eaten in quite a few Middle Eastern restaurants and our meal was as good as I've had anywhere.  In fact, better than some fancier places.  A very nice meal and reasonably priced as well, at least from a customer's perspective.  We had the hummus, fattoush, and shared a chicken kabob platter, all of it very tasty and plentiful.  More than we could eat.  The service was fine perhaps because we were the only diners for close to three hours.  That is the sad thing.  If more people do not start patronizing the place, it will have to fold and that would be a loss.  We will definitely be going back as long as we can.  It's easy to get to so make the trip from wherever and give it a visit.  We don't think your taste buds will be disappointed.
