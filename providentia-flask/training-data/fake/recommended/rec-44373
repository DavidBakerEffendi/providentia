There is something very special about this place.  It's in the details.  The pasta was perfectly al dente, in a way I have not experienced outside of Italy.  Real Napoli pizza too: the thin flaky crust, dreamy cheese and touch of truffle.  We loved the kale salad: pickled eggs were a nice touch.  Great wine selection: we tried 3 whites and kept changing our minds about which was best.  The design and decor are also warm and imaginative, down to the wallpaper in the bathroom: fascinating.  And the staff was super-engaging and thoughtful.  I get bored easily with restaurants and rarely go to the same place twice, but there are so many nuances to this place I may just become a regular!
