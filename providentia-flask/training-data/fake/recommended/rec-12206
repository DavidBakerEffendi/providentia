This place was a huge disappointment. When you read the menu online, it sounds incredible. But the service was awful--we were ignored for most of the night, our food took forever, and they forgot one of our rolls and then brought it out after they brought the check. Who wants to keep eating at that point? Making things even worse, we saw people who came in after us get very attentive, fast service, and it wasn't clear why they were getting such great treatment. The food itself wasn't great either. The few traditional dishes that we tried were good (one roll and one tofu appetizer), but the nontraditional rolls just weren't that good. Cheese in sushi is a little weird! Overall, this wasn't that great, especially for the price. If the service was better and the food was less expensive, we might've liked it better.
