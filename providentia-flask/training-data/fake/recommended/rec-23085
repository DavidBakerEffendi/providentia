Ok for starters got there on a Saturday evening, early,round 4:30, was not crowded. The homemade chips were great and not filling as a mini appetizer should be. Â I ordered a starter of French onion soup, was awesome. Wifey got the chili, again delicious. For our entrees wifey ordered the steak tacos with a black bean and corn side. The steak was yummy but oddly cold. I had the fish and chips. The batter was spot on. Perfectly crispy, not greasy. As a dessert I had the fried oreos. I have to say they give you 7 or 8 oreos soo after dinner you might have to share. The only problem we had was the steak cubes for the tacos were cold and the chili was luke warm. Service was great, wine was tasty!! Also I might add as we were leaving the patrons were packing in.
