If you're from Staten Island and have had the privilege of watching this place transform from the little restaurant that could (Against Da Grill), into a now more refined "Craft House", you know that this place truly encompasses the "Mom & Pop" inspirational energy. The menu has gone from amazing (ADG), to wow (Craft House). The beer menu is off the charts. By far, the best selection of ales, IPA (tap and bottles), lager, import and domestic beers I've ever experienced. The ambiance is that of a lower east side style bar, but with the right twist of swagger. If you happen to eat here, don't be afraid to try anything. The short and simple menu, I believe, affords a more crafted and refined approach to each dish. The fish and chips taste better than Louisiana could ever hope to out do, the battered jumbo shrimp is to die for. Recently I tried their corn dip appetizer and was really shocked at their level creativity. I won't spoil it anymore...you'll simply just have to stop by and see for yourself. Oh...and if you can't decide on a side, do yourself a favor and order the baked Macaroni, topped with fresh bacon. It's served in an aluminum deep dish...you'll thank me later.
