Was here a couple weeks back on a Thursday night to meet up with some friends and had a blast! Those $5 tinis everyone is talking about really are AWESOME. I had two and was DONE for the night ;) Â I dig the dimly lit space and different seating options too. My only complaint would be that there music was kind of whack - just some mind-numbing beat all night.
