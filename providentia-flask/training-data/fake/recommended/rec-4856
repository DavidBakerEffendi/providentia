Mood Cafe is exactly as everyone here describes and is equally wonderful. It's a one-man operation, so not the place to go if you're in a hurry. It's a bit of a spectacle in itself to watch the chaat coming together - a little dance behind the counter to assemble all of the various ingredients. We got a punjabi chaat and the crazy chaat - couldn't really tell the difference between the two, but it didn't matter a bit because it was really good. Also, the fig lassi was completely and totally off the hook - this could quickly become and obsession. Good, good, damn good food, and not at all expensive. Just try it. Now.
