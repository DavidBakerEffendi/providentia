I've been a fan of Perilla since my first visit 3 years ago but i just went back on Saturday and wanted to say, it still doesn't disappoint! We went cause of a blackboard eats deal with 30% off. It definitely made the deal even sweeter! Everything we had was delicious but the Farro risotto is AMAZING!
