Definitely the best burritos in the immediate area. Ingredients are fresh, Tapatio is on the table and you can order beer.  I would definitely recommended El Fuego over nearby Santa Fe burrito or El Azteca.   For merely comparison reasons, consider El Fuego to be a slightly better, more local version of Chipotle....with better music.
