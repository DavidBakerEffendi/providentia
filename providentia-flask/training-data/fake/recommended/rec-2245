This is definitely a tourist stop must if your going/passing through Philadelphia. I got the vibe that they don't like tourists so I would advise to order like a local. To get the standard cheese steak you must say, "Give me one Whiz with" Basically it consists of Italian bread, Grade D meat, Cheese Whiz and grilled onions. Its tasty but next time I think I'm going across the street to Pat's Cheese Steaks, I've heard they are better.
