If I were to sit here and type of a review of everything I have eaten at this place, I would be here until tomorrow and it would take you forever to scroll down the page.  To keep it short and simple, everything is delicious.  I recommend the chefs tasting.  They provide two options, $55 and $70/75 (can't remember which one) but I recommend doing the $70 chef tasting.  With this, you can sample the most expensive items on the menu, and if you had just ordered 9 of the most expensive dishes, it would run you about $200, so it's really a good deal! For the average person, Tinto is a special occasion restaurant.  Once a year won't break your wallet but will leave you excited for next year.  Perfect date place.  Maybe not perfect for a first date, as it might be awkward debating which items to order and share as you don't know the other's food preference.  Also not a place to bring someone who is a picky eater - not good for kids.  Also, make a reservation. But, I love this place.  It's one of my favorite places in Philly and I will continue going every year!
