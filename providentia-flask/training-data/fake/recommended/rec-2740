This spot is super cute. I love the darkness, the wooden tables, the narrow dining rooms, and the long bar. It's situated on a quiet corner in Greenpoint, and was easily missed by me if it weren't for one of my dining party having been there before. I was with a relatively larger group of 7 of my favorite people in the world-the perfect set up for a great meal. We were seated in the back dining room, next to the kitchen. Perhaps if we weren't immediately next to the kitchen it wouldn't have been so smoky, but my first complaint was that the restaurant had no circulation and was smoky the whole meal. It's one of those places you leave a smell like for the rest of the night/the next morning when you wake up. Our waitress informed us that there were no specials this evening, and took our drink orders. Most of us got something off their cocktail list, all of which were really good. The champagne cocktail was surprisingly not too sweet. One of my friends recommended the burger, but a) I don't eat beef, and b) I can't order a burger at a place like this! That being said, there were three burgers ordered and the plates were all cleaned. The gnocchi was what I ordered and I, too finished it. Really awesome flavors and large pillowy potato gnocchi. I liked that the pastas all came in appetizer portions, as well. I honestly don't eat/order pasta as a main dish frequently and this is a great option. Complaint number two had to do with extreme slow service. It was fortunate that I was there with a fabulous group and we just laughed and enjoyed each others company while waiting, but even then I noticed that there was a huge delay in service. Not sure what was happening with that, but after reading a couple other reviews, it seems to be a common theme.
