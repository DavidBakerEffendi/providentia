What a waste! Was excited about going here Â as they showed up in a list of gluten free restaurants however NONE of their meat patties are marked gluten free!!! Not even the grilled chicken! What's the point of carrying GF buns and marking gluten free on the menu when there is clearly no intention of truly catering to gluten free diners? The only GF burger is also vegan. What's the point of going to a burger joint and not being able to get a burger??? This whole gluten free "effort" is FRAUDULENT!
