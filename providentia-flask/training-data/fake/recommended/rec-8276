When I moved to New Haven from the Southwest, I was told that there is no good (authentic) Mexican food in Connecticut. And then I found Mezcal, which rivals some of the food I've had in Mexico. The shrimp al ajillo is amazing! And the Juana Gallo is a fantastic drink. The service is always wonderful. There's sometimes a wait, but the wait is worth it!
