Medium rare skirt was rare (moooo!) even though I ordered medium-rare; with a group so sampled a bunch of sides - sweet potato gratin (very good), brussel sprouts (good), cauliflower (good, recommend), kale (terrible, zero flavor).  Deserts were terrible, do not waster your time or money. The cocktail list, however, was pretty darn good.  Had the old fashioned special which was made with a bacon infused rye and that made for a memorable cocktail. Place is okay, would not go out of my way to return.
