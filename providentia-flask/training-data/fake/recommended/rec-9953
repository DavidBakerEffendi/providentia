Something is going on here. This used to be my favorite place, as you can see from my prior review. Last month, I got really sick. I backtracked my day prior to getting sick and the only thing I ate was food from here, for dinner. I didn't think much of it, I thought maybe it had to be something else or what not, only because I've ate here so many times. I just didn't want to believe it was possible. Fast forward to last week, I ate dinner here. The very next day, I was sick. I should've learned my lesson but now I know. I don't know if they changed cooks, or just changed the way they keep the food warm, but I will NO longer be coming back.. Very sad.
