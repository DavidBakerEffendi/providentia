Mariella recently opened on 6th ave, and I hope it sticks around. The space is very nice and you can feel the owner really puts his heart and soul in it. First off, my girlfriend and I came in during this oppressive heat wave and I wish they had the a/c up higher... Not the end of the world since there were only 2 tables of people at the time. My girlfriend and I split the speck and egg pasta as a first course (gluten free for $1 more as she has celiac), and it was great. The pasta was cooked very well, something most restaurants don't achieve, and the dish was rich and flavorful without heavy cream or cheese. I could have eaten a whole plate as my entree. For main courses I got a boneless beef short rib and my girlfriend got pan-fried trout. The short rib was cooked well but I didn't like it as much as the pasta. My girlfriend enjoyed the trout dish, especially the crispy skin. Seems like a very family-centric place so far, there were 3 or 4 strollers in the restaurant by the time we left. Â I'm pretty sure the owner was waiting on us, he told us when he moved to the city from Italy he didn't see many of the dishes he was familiar with in Italian restaurants here and now he's able to showcase them. I appreciated the small, focused menu, each item with an interesting zucchini sauce here or burrata cheese there. Especially when it's not so hot, I look forward to going again and taking advantage of their outdoor space.
