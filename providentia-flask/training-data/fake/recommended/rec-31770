I walked in here early on a weekend evening with a group of four.  There were two high tops available and one regular table available, but the latter was overrun by another larger group sitting next to it and was not an option for us.  The two high tops were next to each other, so my group pushed them together.  We were brashly informed that it was against the restaurant policy to do so, even though we were not blocking any aisles and would have been, in fact, freeing up central floor space for wait staff to maneuver.  We were not given any logic behind the decision, but the bartender was insistent.  As one member of my party was expecting and we could not wait for a proper table to free up, we were forced to leave, and the restaurant lost the sale.  It is a shame, because I had been so looking forward to trying their great draft selection and sampling their food upon others' recommendations, but instead now, they have lost a customer due to poor customer service--which seems to be a recurring theme on other Yelp reviews.  What a shame, but perhaps I have been saved an overall negative experience by only scratching the surface of the staff's personality.
