We are no strangers to fine dining.  We've explored many of the options in central jersey, and other than a few shining stars, we are usually left feeling "meh".   Rat's is certainly a shining star.  The staff was exceptional and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  From the amuse bouche to the petit fours, each bite was well crafted.  I had requested a romantic table, and we were seated in a more private nook of the restaurant.  The drinks were creative, our entrees (mussells fritte and the filet) were both soooo good.  And the popovers!  Oh those popovers.  I will dream about them.  I'd return JUST for the popovers.  I can't imagine why anyone would give this place a less than stellar review.  Most surprisingly, compared to other restaurants we visit for special occasions in Princeton, this meal was a steal!  We will most certainly be going back.
