This is one of my favorite places to go whether it is a large group or just my wife and I.  The pizza is always great and they typically have great specials using locally grown ingredients.  The salads are simple, yet tasty especially with goat or blue cheese.  I would also highly recommend apple pie for desert if you enjoy that.  My wife goes there mostly for that.  They also have a great beer selection.  It includes micro breweries from the New England area and a large selection of their own beers, which are great.  The lines do tend to get long, so I'd recommend getting there early to grab a seat or plan on waiting a while if you need to get in later.  They won't seat you without your entire party, but either way the wait is well worth it.  This is a great place to bring kids as well.  It is loud, but not typically so loud that it's annoying or hard to have conversations.
