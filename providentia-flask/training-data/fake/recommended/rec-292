I wandered into Nai several years ago for the first time. I have been there now a total Of 5 times. Service is always friendly, if a little frazzled. Wine choices favor Spanish ( no surprise). This and sangria makes me happy. But the piece de resistance is the live flamenco on Thurs an Sat. Book at least a week ahead, they have become super popular. Again, no surprise. Food is a volition pricey for portion size, but always fresh and tasty.
