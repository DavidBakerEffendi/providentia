I eat Thai food a lot and just recently discovered this place. It has a very chic ambience unlike most Thai restaurants that are quite basic. The drinks are good, the service is excellent. Being a vegetarian, don't see lot of options on their menu but whatever they have is pretty good. They have a community style large table which is fun. Would have given 5 stars if it had more veggie options.
