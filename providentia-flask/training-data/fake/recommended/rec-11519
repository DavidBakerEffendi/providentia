The owner or GM graciously invited my bf and I in on Saturday evening as he saw us perusing the menu in the window. We were only looking to grab a drink prior to meeting friends so we decided to try it out. The review is only for two beers, about $8.5 each and both of which were very good. Beer and wine menu is reasonably priced and offers some unique items. Decor is wonderfully done and staff is very polite. It's a place to come a little more dressed up, though they were nice to is in our jeans and winter coats. One fairly large negative is I noticed we were charged $14 for two waters. $7 for a glass of water even in nyc is a bit haughty and unnecessary. For a whole bottle of sparkling water, sure charge me $7 at a nice restaurant. But for a glass? Plainly out, it just felt like a trick and bothered me. That aside, we will likely come back to give the food a shot as the management was nice and we like to support the local UWS openings of nice/hip establishments...the only tip would be: don't drive customers away with hidden or unnecessary prices.
