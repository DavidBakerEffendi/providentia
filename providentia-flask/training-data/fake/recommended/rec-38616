Went their for a work outing.  They have a great bar, but the food is really sub-par.  I had a dessert crepe and it was soggy and terrible by crepe standards.  If you stick to the bar, you will probably go away happy (or at least drunk enough not to care). The ladies room has the tiniest sink I've ever seen in my life.  It's like a doll's sink.  Not really a factor in my review, but I thought it was weird.
