This place is great! I've only been here once, and only ordered 2 sandwiches so far, but the experience was great. I got a bacon Riser sandwich and also the Italian Hero. Like some of the other reviews mention that it does take a while to get the sandwiches made, there is a good reason for that. Peeking around the counter, you see that as the orders come in, the ingredients are cut fresh and hasn't been laying around for a few hours. The bacon Riser was the first to be consumed because it was a hot sandwich while the Italian Hero was a cold sandwich and boy was it good. It was bacon, egg, cheese, and a hash brown. This is genius. The Italian Hero I didn't get a chance to eat later in the day but even when cold, it was delish, plenty of meat and fresh veggies. Overall, I think that this is a nice little shop where I would stop by many many more times if I had the opportunity. This will be the first place I come back to next time I'm in VT.
