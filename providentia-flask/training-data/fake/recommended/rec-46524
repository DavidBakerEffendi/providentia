Came in here on a Sunday to try the 3 course prix fixe dinner meal ($39) with a friend. I love the atmosphere. It was nice and cozy. The decor was good. The food were wonderful. My meal: 1st course - Sweet Potato Ravioli, Black Truffle Pasta, Dayboat Maine Lobster Emulsion, 2nd course - Citrus Scented Stonington, CT Sea Scallops, Pickled Jalapeno, Blood Orange Reduction, Celery Root, 3rd course - Caramelized Banana Souffle, Milk Chocolate-Peanut Butter Sauce. All of them were good in there own way. Service wise it needs improvement. Wait was long between each course and I felt ignored by the waiter/waitress.
