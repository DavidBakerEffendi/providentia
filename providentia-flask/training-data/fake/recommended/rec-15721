Get the pappardelle - to die for. Thick homemade pasta noodles in a tangy, creamy red sauce with veal. Skip the fettucine with zucchini, squash and shrimp - not too flavorful. Other pros - The meal comes with fresh bread with plenty of olive oil, they have a good wine selection, the waitress and seating hostess are pleasant, and the restaurant was packed with a young crowd. Cons - No reservations for parties with fewer than 5 people, so prepare to wait at the crowded bar.
