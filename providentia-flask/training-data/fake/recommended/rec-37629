As a New Yorker and a former waitress for Freeman's, this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to waste time to write a review.  After ordering three appetizers and three cocktails, we found ourselves still waiting for our initial orders after an hour.  When we asked what the status of our food was, we were received with some the most shameful "customer service" I have ever witnessed: instead of apologizing for the delay and letting us know our food was on the way and offering us a complimentary drink, the  owner actually screamed at our table in front of other customers, told us we were "in his world" and in a derogatory fashion told us he sensed a "Long Island tension" (nobody present was from LI, and I was embarrassed to even be told this with the purpose of being offended) . I am so ashamed to have been treated like this that  I write this in hopes of warning others to not waste their time, let alone money, on an establishment with such little interest in running a professional and friendly business.
