Awesomeness.  I was in Philly for the weekend, and wanted to see what all the cheese-steak-fuss was about.  Without my handy dandy Yelpers to help me out, I asked some random stranger.  yikes!  The randomness of the stranger seemed dangerous at first, but then she convinced us that we hadn't actually been to Philadelphia if we hadn't had a steak sandwich at Sonny's. She was right. It was amazing.  It was so good I brought half home (to DC) for my brother-in-law.  He called in the middle of the night to say it was the best sandwich he'd ever had, and my sister (who is a vegetarian) even loved it.  Now I don't have another cheese steak to compare it to which is why it only gets 4 stars - maybe there is a better cheese steak out there?  I don't know, if there is, I haven't had it. And yes - have the whiz....
