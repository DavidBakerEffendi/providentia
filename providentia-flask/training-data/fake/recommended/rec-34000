Any of my friends can tell you that I absolutely LOVE this place.  The carne enchilada taco is amazing, as are their 3 platos (basically they give you the fixings to make your own tacos).  Plus, with margaritas on tap (yes, you read that correctly) how can you go wrong?  My husband and I go here more often than I'd like to admit and always get a slew of tacos and a pitcher of margs.  The bill generally comes out to about $50 for 7 tacos and about 6 margs (that's about how many come in a pitcher).  The only downside is that the wait is usually at least 20 mins if you go after 5:30p.  However, Crown Inn just opened up the block from Chavelas... so you can now enjoy a cocktail or beer in there while you wait!   Anyway, you've seriously got to try it.  Everyone that I've ever brought here has loved it.
