Lovely experience! I went to La Grainne with some friends and I had a wonderful breakfast. We had to wait for about 15 min for a table and it was worth it. I had a nutella and banana crepe and my husband had a goat cheese crepe. They were both very good, but I think mine was even better than his. The coffee was good and the price was reasonable. The place is small and intimate. Being a sunny day, it was bright and cosy. Because it was kind of early in the morning, it wasn't so busy. Overall, a great experience! Can't wait to go back!
