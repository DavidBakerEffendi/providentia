This restaurant deserves five stars for the whole package. First the decor is super cool and funky. The drinks were amazing. Although a little on the expensive side, I had the Tashan which was their signature drink with smashed blueberries. It was sweet but not too sweet. All of our food was amazing. The salad appetizer (i dont remember the name) I think its the bomb bell was delicious. It sounded weird but we decided to do it based on our servers recommendation and he was 100% correct. That next to the spinach appetizer were my too favorite. Everything was perfectly spiced and good size portions. Finally I see a lot of complaints about service but our waiter Mark was the best possible. He was so attentive and had great recommendations. I cannot wait to go back!
