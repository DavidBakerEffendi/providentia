I truly felt the authentic Cuban experience here - even though I've never been to Cuba! From the moment we walked in, we greeted by two friendly hostesses, served by an energetic waiter who knew his menu backwards and forwards, and who you could tell loved working there. He recommended an amazing assortment of tapas - Goat Cheese Fritters, Salt Cod Fritters, and the Queso Frito - Ugh. SO GOOD. The Cuban beef hash wasn't that good; but, I got over it as soon as the succulent, tender and well-flavored Lechon Asado was brought over and sealed the deal. It was a roasted pork and garlic shredded piece of heaven served with white rice and black beans. Classic Cuban. And, did I mention the music was happening? Yeah. It was happening. I was having such a good time, my date and I turned around and started conversation with the table next to us - who were also having a blast! As far as restaurants go - it was a total package deal. Authentic ambiance. Great Service. Amazing Food. Word of advice. Make Reservations ahead of time. The place was PACKED on a Thursday night. I heard Saturday wait times are brutal.
