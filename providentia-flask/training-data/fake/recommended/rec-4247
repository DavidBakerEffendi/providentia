I always do take out or delivery. They do have a high minimum to deliver to newark but its ok. I usually order the combo which bring ur choice of meat, choice of rice an eggroll, dumplings, a soup or can of soda. I think the price is fair for the amount of food. I have to say I only eat eggrolls from this place. They are very fresh and taste amazing. Their pork fried rices is also very delicious.
