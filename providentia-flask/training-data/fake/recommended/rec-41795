So many tacos to choose from. Each one that I got tasted good. Beware: once you eat one taco, you won't want to stop. I figured it was cheap enough so I didn't stop....and then I realized I spent all my money. Anyway, the margaritas were ok, they use freshly squeezed juice, so that was a plus. I didn't think they were strong enough but my friend reminded me that I have a high tolerance. Either way, I'm sure I'll be back. Thanks, Gueros!
