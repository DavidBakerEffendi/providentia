I went here for a Sunday afternoon birthday party in the downstairs private room. The portions were both small and inconsistent. The kid's meal had 12 pieces of macaroni, all of the adult options left you less than satiated. Everybody got the food at different times with varying portions. The older balding man was rude and you had to hunt him down to order your food. The service was a disgrace. They were all incredibly rude as if it was a bother to ask anything of them. The only exception was the girl who poured the wine, who was efficient in her job. Definitely not worth the price for both the quality of service and of the food that was received. Overall, I would never recommend this establishment to a friend, let alone have an event here.
