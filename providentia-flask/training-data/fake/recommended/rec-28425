Gotta love sweet afton. One of the few bars in astoria that's not a greek cafe or a old man dive irish bar, not that I don't like old man irish dive bars. Walked in the first time and thought to myself "oooh, so here's where all the out of towners go to get trashed". Decent selection of beer. Food is fantastic, go for the mac and cheese and bacon. Go for the fried pickles. Avoid the pigs in blanket, they're a rip off. Good crowd, ok prices, great fuckin food. Gets one star off because the bartender didn't know what i meant when i asked for a well whiskey. Lots of twinks in this place.
