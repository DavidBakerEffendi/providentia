This place, without a doubt, has the best cheese steak I've ever tasted.   I have family here and only visit Philadelphia once every 2 years, but every time I visit, I ask that I be taken here to get a cheese steak. The sandwich always comes loaded with meat.  I get mine with onion, mushroom and american cheese.  I know a lot of people in line and family members get it with provolone.  Either way, the cheese steak here is just delicious. I have been to Pat's and it just doesn't compare.  Drive out here, ignore the chemical plant across the street and just face dive into the best cheese steak you can get.
