This is a beautiful space - bright, airy, and spare, with a nice garden.  The service was good and the presentation beautiful.  They have an extensive wine list, although there are no local or American wines on it.  The ingredients are fresh.  However, for the price point - four glasses of wine, two appetizers and two entrees was $120 - the food should be better.  The Ensalada De Remolacha was tasty, but the way it was prepared and presented made it hard to eat without being messy.  The blue cheese flavor was lacking from the potato whip in the Paletitas De Pollo - it was just starchy.  My rack of lamb was good, especially the mint sauce, but it was a bit too fatty and the "farmstead cheese and green apple gremolata" was frankly tasteless.  A pleasant dining experience but there are much better restaurants in Park Slope.
