Just went here for a friend's birthday. For large parties, they offer a prix-fixe, which is usually a good deal. I was excited to try an assortment of the menu options, as they all sound really good and unique. This Prix-Fixe is GROSSLY overpriced (at 35 dollars a head plus tax and tip), and the amount of food you receive is SEVERELY inadequate. Since they serve regular menu items, you can see how much each dish is costing. For 20 people, they offered up 5 orders of their $14 pad thai (which is about 2 forkfuls per person), 20 chicken wings (an average 7 dollar order comes with 6), 8 spring rolls, and 4 skillets of massaman sweet potato/pumpkin, with 1 scoop of rice per skillet. Every time a dish came out, we all lunged for it, and before the bowl was even empty, a server hurried over and took it away. SO, in addition to being underfed, there were perfectly good scraps going straight into the garbage can whenever we turned our heads! For dessert, they placed small saucer sized plates of unripened kiwi (with the pith still on them!) and orange slices, and a small bowl of melted chocolate to dip them into. They also gave us 4 lychee pot-de-creme, which for 20 people averaged about one spoonful per person. And then the bill came. With drinks (I had one beer, others had 1-2 cocktails), it was $1070. $53 dollars per person! Had I ordered off the regular menu, I would have gotten my own bowl of pad thai ($14), 6 chicken wings ($7), and would have skipped the pumpkin and the dessert alltogether, as they were not particularly tasty. Add one beer ($7) and I am at $28 bucks for SIGNIFICANTLY more food (and possibly next-day leftovers!). I don't understand where all my money went, and why. Any restaurant that serves a prix-fixe that costs the diner more than normal, should be examined. I will surely not be going back.
