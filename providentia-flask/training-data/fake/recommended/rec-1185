The noodles were fresh and tasty. The noodle broth was particularly good...very clean and non-greasy. I loved the smell of the cilantro in the soup. The steamed dumplings were a little disappointing. They tasted like they came from a frozen package, similar to the ones you find in Korean supermarkets. But I would definitely go back the next time I'm in the area. The noodles alone were worth it.
