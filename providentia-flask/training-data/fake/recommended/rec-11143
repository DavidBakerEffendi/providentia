Came here a little while ago, so I probably will miss some of the details of my meal.  We started with a few pizza appetizers.  The one that stuck out in my mind was the parma - the pizza with prosciutto.  I got the roast pig special, which was quite excellent.  I was also a big fan of bucanti.  I felt a little disappointed by the desserts - our table got the mocha semifreddo and the strawberry torta.  I felt these desserts were more about presentation than the actual taste of the desserts.  It left me a little confused.  Seating is also kind of weird here.  For a group of 5, they added a random chair to the end of the table and we were seated right near the door just inside the atrium.  But otherwise, great meal and will go back.
