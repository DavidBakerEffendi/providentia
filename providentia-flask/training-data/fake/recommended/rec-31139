Stopped in for ice cream take out last night, as I have done periodically over the past 15 years, although havent gone in a while . Was pleasantly surprised at the service I recieved, Yound ladies at counter very polite & courteous, Manager Ceasar very helpful, and friendly, surprisingly knew the special touches we like (no marshmello sauce, extra peanut butter etc) the ice cream was fresh & made right. Restaurant clean & bathrooms in order. We also love to come after nine for half price appetizers.
