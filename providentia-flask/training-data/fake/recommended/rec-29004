Went w/ kids(7&9) after a concert on Sat afternoon. Loved smell and deco. But food was pretty bad, considering the price. Kids had chiken nugget and sliders. Adults had sandwich and salad. Just like some comments you should never order anything else than desert there. I had to send back my salad because I couldn't pick out wilted greens anymore. Tips were all brown and a lot of mush things in. Ewww....crouton on the salad were old and little saucer holding dressing had a big chip. I didn't try the sandwich but my husband said it's just average. Portions were on the smaller size. Kids had a desert that you can dip in cholate but too much mashmallow instead chocolate in it so only ate 1/3. Over all, it was not worth $65 for lunch. You can bring your date, but after dinner somewhere, only for desert.
