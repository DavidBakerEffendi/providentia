I originally wanted Indonesian food, but came across this restaurant on Yelp, so my friends and I decided to try it out.. Found the place to be great! Food was very good, especially the Indian mee goreng, and the roti chanai! Very well-priced too! Service was great! They were very attentive and always made sure they thanked us for stopping by. Oh, this place is cash only! So bring cash! But, just in case, there is a couple of ATM's two blocks away...
