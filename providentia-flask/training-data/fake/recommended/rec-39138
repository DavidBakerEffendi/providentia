I love the atmosphere in here! My kinda music!  It was insanely packed... it was a Saturday night... so I expected it.  We weren't even planning on paying The Odeon a visit, but since the hotel we were staying at didn't even have their restaurant open, we were forced to look for dinner elsewhere. We weren't dressed up as much as some others - it was wet, windy, and I just didn't give a damn.  We were seated 20 minutes later and we were sitting literally 3 inches away from the next table.  The host had to move the table for me to squeeze in and I'm not that huge!  (I'm not huge at all, btw!  Haha.)  The bf chose their hanger steak and I chose their braised flat iron steak. The bread that they brought out was quite hard, but we got out food shortly after... OMG.  It was AMAZING.  We both licked our plate clean and soon forgot about our soaking clothes that we were sitting in.  Their warm apple galette?  Foodgasmic.  It was paired with cinnamon ice cream + salted caramel. I will DEFINITELY come back the next time I'm in NY. :)  Thanks, Odeon!
