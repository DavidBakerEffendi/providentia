Umami burger is the one of the best burgers I've ever had in NYC.  It's not a perfect 5 stars though and here's why: 1.  I ordered the truffle burger, medium rare.  It WAS cooked to perfection.  One thing I noticed about all the burgers my friends and I had though-- if you don't eat it fast enough, the juices soggy up your burger bun fairly quick making for a messy experience.  Perhaps the meat should have rested?   2.  The portion size is a little smaller than expected.  Always willing to pay more moola for quality, but one burger and half an order of fries and I was still hungry?  Don't do that to me :'( Otherwise, great experience.  Service was good and no wait for a table at 6:15 on a Thursday.
