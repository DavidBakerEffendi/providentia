Meh. The food tasted ok, the service was horrible, there was some crappy 80's movie on, it was too loud, the food was too oily, it took 40 minutes to get 3 tacos, snd the portions were miniscule, oh And it's overpriced. Also the menu is pretty lame especially considering they make a point of saying they don't hve burritos, and they're proud of it... As if the burrito is some kind of abomination in terms of Mexican food. Taco carts are much better, faster, and cheaper.
