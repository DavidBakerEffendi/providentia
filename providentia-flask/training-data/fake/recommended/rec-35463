I have to rave about this place, it's really been a life saver when I felt I was left with the bleak alternative of Subway...or get on rt 3/17 for the usual mediocre chain fare.  They have super fresh everything, chicken salads, tuna salads, cucumber salads, and even pasta dishes.  It's not a restaurant, so I have a higher tolerance for service and atmosphere, but the people there really know what they are doing and handle every sandwich or salad with the TLC it deserves.  The line can be a bit long sometimes, but that's just a testament to how delicious the food is!
