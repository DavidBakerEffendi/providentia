If chicken and lamb on rice with white sauce and hot sauce was healthy for you.  I'd eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Only reason I don't eat this for lunch every day is I work far from it and I am a little scared what that hot sauce does to your stomach. otherwise.  I don't think any other halaal cart can stand up against this place.
