Good, real Brazilian food. We had feijoada (bean stew) with all the fixings, a picanha (sirloin top cap) steak, and Brazilian-style fried chicken. All were excellent, as were the sides. The fried yucca was so good we had to get another order. The staff - Brazilian husband and Portuguese wife team - were very nice if a wincy bit slow. The place isn't huge and they did seem to do a lot of carry out business. I usually hit the same couple of places when we go to the Ironbound and I am very glad we tried a new place. Go on Saturday when they have the feijoada.
