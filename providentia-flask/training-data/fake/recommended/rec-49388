Empanada Mama is oh, so good It's my favorite place in my neighborhood It's the perfect place to go if a friend wants to seeya For some yuca and guac and a pitcher of sangria I love this place, I really do tout it So I went home and Yelped and wrote a poem about it. I wish my mama was the empanada mama.  As much as I do love my nice Jewish mother, for some reason shabbat dinner just doesn't hold a shabbat candle to a spicy chicken arepa and a pitcher of sangria at this joint.  While the space is can be a bit cramped, it's delicious, reasonable, and extremely fun.  We actually ended up sharing appetizers with the table next to us.  I love you mom, but I'll meet you for some empanadas on Friday night.
