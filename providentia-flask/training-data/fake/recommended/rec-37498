Came here with my husband on a Monday night. The food was average, nothing special. We've had Mediterranean food before and this isn't anything to brag about. Had the mussels and clams app and that was a little bland.  I had he chicken kebab, they give one skewer, for the price I expected more chicken. It was tender. The white sauce was delicious as well as the rice.  Husband had the beef and lamb gyro and it wasn't all that great. I don't think we will be returning.
