It's a hole in the wall place. But a ton of great food for cheap to reasonable prices. Had a chicken burrito made the way I wanted. Better then chipotle. The chips are not my style, Mexican style. I prefer tostitos though. Guac was good. Overall good experience and great people. They have a huge breakfast burrito for 4.95, equivalent to chipotles size. For price, amount of food and quality greats place. Place could be updated and cleaner, but not saying it's dirty at all.
