Bouley in my opinion is excellent. From the smell of the apples in the entrance vestibule, which sets your mouth to watering, to the nicely decorated restaurant it is all about the diners pleasure. I read the Yelp reviews before going so I was a bit worried about how the meal would go. I think many of the criticisms are wrong. Most French restaurants give small servings. Most good NYC restaurants are pricey. However even here I think Bouley sets itself apart. I had the Tasting menu, a six course dinner, for $95. While this may seem expensive there are dozens of places in NYC more expensive and of lesser quality.      One interesting note is that for a French restaurant there is no heavy saucing. The meals are lighter and asian inspired. The meal for me started with the Porcini Flan a mixture of Dungeoness crab, truffle which was fantastic. Next came the organic Connecticut farm egg. I usually find this type of naming pretentious and usually a let down. More marketing and less food orientated. This was fantastic. I love eggs and this one was cooked perfectly and the coconut-garlic foam it was served in was very tasty. If I had a cook they would make this every day for breakfast. The next course, Loster was fine. Not overcooked with a light tasty sauce.   Next came duck which was very good. The accompanyment was ok, I don't remember what is was. Next was supposed to be cocnut soup but instead sorbet was served. No reason for the switch was given but the sorbet was good. The pear dessert was excellent. I am not a dessert person and I ate the whole thing.    The service was excellent and the waiter did a very good job of helping people in the party who had dietary restrictions. The wine added to the main entry was excellent.    I think the best rating for Bouley would be 4.5 but since we have to pick whole stars 5 is warranted since they did an excellent job in service, food and customer care.
