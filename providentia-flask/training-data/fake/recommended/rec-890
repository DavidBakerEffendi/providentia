Mediocre...I hate to say it.  I tried out both Pats & Genos.  Both were ok....im giving Pats one more star than Genos.  The steak had no chewy fat which was great.  The sandwich still lacked flavor. ..I had it with provalone and onions...also thought they could have used more cheese. I wouldn't come back again...but it was fun comparing the two legendary steak places.
