I really like this place! The food is fresh, they have a lot of options on their menu, it's cheap, and the owners are so friendly! They always remember me and are pleasant. The food isn't complicated or gourmet, but it has great flavor. Their house dressing is really delicious and they homemake it - yum! Casual, fast, friendly, couldn't ask for better!
