Great Place!! My sister and I enjoyed turkey burgers from Sabrina's two years ago and once about a nine months ago.  We are on Christmas break and was searching for breakfast spots.  Lord and be hold...Yelpers led us back to the place we enjoyed such great turkey burgers.  Go...Go fast!! Treat yourself to stuffed french toast.  Our other two dishes were great as well, eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and turkey bacon friatta. Enjoy Yelpers!!
