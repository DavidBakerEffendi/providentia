I've had two very different experiences for the fare at Basta. The first time I went there, approximately two years ago, I had their hand made pappardelle with a homemade ragu - it was absolutely delectable. This time, I went last month, and ordered their scallops - it is pretty difficult to make scallops not taste delicious, so they were standard. However, everything else about the dish was mediocre. My dining partner ordered Â the "Italian dinner", which was a hodgepodge of pasta, sausage, meatballs, eggplant, "homemade" pasta sauce. The pasta sauce tasted like they dumped a can of san marzano chopped tomatoes into the bowl - it lacked any complexity or depth, which was a trend with the meatballs and eggplant. They were busy as always, but service was wonderful on both accounts. Considering the many Italian options available in New Haven, Basta does not stand out.
