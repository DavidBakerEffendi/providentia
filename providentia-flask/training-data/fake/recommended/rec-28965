The food here is about three stars, but the service is definitely ONE. It takes away from an otherwise decent ramen place. The first time I came here, the waiters actually forgot about my table. We were seated, given menus by the host, and then completely forgotten about. No water. Nobody coming by the table. Just... sitting there waiting for fifteen, twenty minutes until the HOST spotted us and came by to get our orders. After that, we just waited some more until we grabbed a passing busboy to give us water. When we eventually got our food, the waiter just plunked down the dishes and kept walking, not even asking to make sure it was actually our order -- which, btw, mine wasn't. But at that point we were so hungry we just ate what came. The food was pretty good; broth was flavorful and the noodles good and chewy. But the way we were treated took all the enjoyment out of eating it! Nobody came by even after that to check if our food was okay or anything. After we ate, we decided not to wait for our non-existent waiter to come and get our check, so we just went straight to the host to pay. I tried to explain my food wasn't what I ordered and so I didn't want to pay for the add-ons that I didn't receive. He told me he didn't know how to take things off the check, so could I please just pay the amount and he'd give me more change back? Ramen Bar, please get your business together. You could be good, but instead you're just aggravating.
