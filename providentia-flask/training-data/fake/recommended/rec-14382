This review is for aperitivo, which happens on weekdays from 5-7pm, and uh, it rules! Why? Well, after you order yourself a nice ice-cold Peroni or two, you'll quickly realize. Pizzas, pizzas and pastas start flying out of the kitchen and are plopped down next to you for your enjoyment. When it disappears, (gets devoured), it's quickly replaced by another until either, A: they're tired of making them or, B: you've had a nice snack and are satisfied but not full. Please keep in mind, this is not a full meal or a free meal. This is a "thank you" for spending money on drinks at their bar so keep walking if you're just trying to score a handout with nothing to give - fair is fair.
