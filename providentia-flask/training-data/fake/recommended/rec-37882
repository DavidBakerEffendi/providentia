This weeks travel for convention season takes me to Philadelphia for the first time. Tired from the plane ride I needed pizza to heal me. The front desk gave me two options, Zavino's being one of them. Trusty Yelp did the rest. Stephen, Carlo, Harvey and I enjoyed the Baby Jesus app~ highly recommended, and three pizzas. The Margareta came out first. A solid pie and very enjoyable. Not the best I've had but would order again if I was in a group and sharing. The 2nd pie was the Joey (I think it was the little Joey but you get the idea) and it was the star of the show. Must have must order even if you are not a big sausage fan (keep it clean people). The last pizza (forgot the name) had a kind of spicy pepperoni and I liked it as well as the Joey (but my dining mates preferred the Joey). Next time I am in town I will seek Zavino out again!
