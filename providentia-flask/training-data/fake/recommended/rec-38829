Yum... but I'd recommend baking your sandwich-- heat it up for best results! Small cheese shop, easy to miss. Nowhere to sit, but good if you want to grab and go. Ordered one of the veggie sandwiches (I'm a veggie fan!) and was hoping for mozzarella cheese, but they gave me havarti instead. I guess I should have specified - not entirely their fault! The cheese seemed to have a bit too much sodium, but that seems to be the case with a lot of other cheeses sold in supermarkets. Sandwich could have been better served hot, though they did not offer the option of heating/toasting the sandwich. So I took it home and microwaved it..... next time I'll probably try baking it. A little on the pricey side, in my opinion....but it's New York.
