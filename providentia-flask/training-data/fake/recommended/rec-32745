Food is good but for "tapas style" is lacks presentation. All the food comes out very spread out so could wait around 20 minutes between receiving your mini plates. There also isn't much versatility in the menu. The hostess stand was disorganized. AND the menu you was on regular computer paper folded -_- like how tacky
