Chicken and rice. At 4 am, scoping out a spot next to the fountain so it can be eaten then and there.  Red sauce or white.  Doesn't matter as long as it's so burn your mouth spicy hot even I need a little water.    I do wonder if it would be as tasty in the middle of the day.  One of these days I'll have to find out, though typically that chicken and rice craving is directly connected to a need to soak up alcohol.  Haven't had a hangover yet after a late night meal there so if it works don't fix it.
