I was shopping in SoHo and was craving a burger. Ruby's came up within walking distance and had some great reviews, so I decided to check it out. Thank you, Yelpers. This place simply rocks. It's a cozy storefront restaurant with a few tables. The staff is warm, friendly, hilarious, and just awesome people. Both my friend and I got the Bronte burger ($13). It's the darn juiciest burger I have ever had. No, like really. Juicy, well cooked, juicy. It's served with focaccia or sour dough, I don't know what, but some kind of bread that's soft and complements the juiciness of the burger well. They add a sweet chili sauce which brings a super unique flavor to the burger. I enjoyed every last bite. The burgers are served with salad - no fries here! I'll be back to Ruby's many a times from now. They had a banana bread served with passionfruit butter ($4) that I am dying to come back and try. Gem of a spot. Owned by some cool Aussies, and it was funny...the day I was there, it seemed everyone eating in the restaurant was Aussie too, except myself. Cool vibe.
