okay this isn't origami...really it's not that complicated.... it's coffee.... so i'm not going to do a great big swoon over the product...yes, they do make a nice cuppa and the edgy aesthetics will keep an undercover adult a.d.d. sufferer entertained for hours...the service is super plus plus....the employees are mostly on the yummy side...as a lesbian in constant search of community this is a great place to do some good will hunting...don't get me wrong, the crowd is mostly hetero but the vibe is lesbian friendly...
