I give it points for a VERY veggie friendly menu. Beer list was very good too. We went in when NO ONE else was there for lunch. The bar tender was a cliched hipster chick who was rather unpleasant and not the least bit helpful ( I don't need a new BFF but you don't need to act like you're too cool to offer me even semi-civilized service. I'm sorry my presence annoys you, maybe you shouldn't be in the service industry?) Given the awesome vegetarian menu we'll probably try it again sometime but if the service is typically like that forget it. Descent people be ware.
