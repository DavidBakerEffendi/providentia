I would be leaving 5 stars, but the prices are a bit insane. $3 for a cup of coffee... Starbucks prices in a restaurant?  However insane that sounds, this is some of the best coffee I've had in New York... and the waiter kept it coming.  My cup was NEVER empty :) I had the blueberry pancakes, my girlfriend had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Bennie, both were incredibly delicious!  Some of the best breakfast I've ever had in NYC. The service was INCREDIBLE.  The food took a little while to come out (the table next to us arrived after we got there and got their food first), however, the quality of the food and service made up for the mistake in the kitchen.   $50 for breakfast for two with tax and tip is insane... but, for one of the best breakfasts in NYC, it is worth it for a special occasion.
