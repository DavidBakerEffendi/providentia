This review is based solely on the bo ssam (aka pork shoulder) tasting menu, which I've had on two separate occasions and remains one of my favorite dining experiences to this day. The ambiance is as cool as it gets, and I love the "do it yourself" nature of this meal. Between the oysters, bibb lettuce, kimchi, pork and the amazing variety of sauces, the possibilities are endless! I also recommend getting a few pork buns as an app. They're some of the best in the city.
