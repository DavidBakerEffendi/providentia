Why does anyone bother eating or ordering from here?  A thousand places to eat in NYC and for some reason I find this disgusting place packed on the regular during Lunch hour or Breakfast.  The guys that make the bagels, burgers, sandwiches are complete idiots.  God forbid you ask them to toast your freaking bagel they will stare at you like you have 2 heads.  I just highly recommend to eat else where smh
