Also had high hopes for char given the look of their menu and me being a huge fan of southern food.  The service was great and we had a few creative appetizers.  The entrees were small and unimpressive (burger and chicken).  The creme brulee was good. Wouldn't return for dinner.  the brunch looks really good, would prefer to try that next time.
