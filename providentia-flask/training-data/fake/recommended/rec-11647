Cool place. Very college-y. It feels like a franchise place... I think it kind of is, no? Anyway, great wood fired pizza though! We had a large slice, half of revolution and half of new vermont sausage. When we got it, it was sliced not in your typical pizza slice but instead more like rectangles random slices, that was neat. To my taste at least, I think the revolution was similar to the new veromont sausage (without the sausage, hah). They were good, but I wouldn't say they were the best pizza ever. We also ordered a salad from their specials board, the bacon tasted like maple candy, yum and vermont blue cheese, double yum. Their beer was O-K... nothing exceptional... think my bf brews better than theirs! Other than that, this review is really for the service of this place. Our waitress was so friendly and checks in with us all the time even though the place was packed. She even up-sold us on dessert! We got the apple crisp w/ vanilla ice cream, triple yum!
