We were in town for a wedding and stopped in for breakfast, and met Earl. We mentioned that we had some problems trying to find new accommodations for the night on short notice,  and within minutes, Earl had called a friend who is a local hotel manager and got us a great room at a discounted rate. His recommendation to stop by Citizens Cider was also stellar, and we had a great time there. The food at Handy's was tasty and affordable,  but the exceptionally friendly service is what we'll return for. Thank you,  Earl! You made our day!
