Got the vegetarian sandwich and it was better than most that I have tried.  It even beats the ones in San Jose and that's the mother land of Vietnamese sandwiches. I especially like this one because the tofu is not deep fried. The tofu is pan fried and chunky whereas most places make it seem like you're eating fried shredded tofu.  The bread is also good and they give you tons of veggies.  The sandwich could have used a little bit more soy sauce though.
