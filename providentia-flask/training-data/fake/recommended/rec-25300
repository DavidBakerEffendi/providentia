Great tasting food in a quaint place that does remind me of my time in London! Â Went for brunch today, but was here a year ago and still remember the delicious meal I had then - the best ever succulent brick chicken! Today's meal was challah french toast topped with pumpkin whipped cream. The flavor was A-mazing! Surely the 235th wonder of the world. Oh, and my waiter Joe was superb!
