This was definitely a cute spot.  We went with a group of 8 for a Halloween/Birthday dinner.  They take reservations, but were accommodating and forgiving that my husband and I were stuck in traffic and running late, so they sat the other 6 folks and everyone ordered appetizers while they waited for us.  The staff won my respect INSTANTLY for that!  So many places refuse to seat the party unless everyone is accounted for.  The staff was so very friendly - I think that was my favorite part.  I felt welcome and really enjoyed the ambience.  The decor was mostly brick and subdued lighting, which would make it nice for a date. The food was very good.  I wouldn't say it was the best Japanese food I've ever had, but it was fresh and they offered great choices.  I have a generally weak stomach, but I left there feeling great that night and the next day, so the food was certainly clean and fresh.  I had a spicy maki combination.  My husband had the sushi/sashimi combo.  I also had a white tuna appetizer that was thinly sliced and in a delicate sauce.  This place is BYOB, so we were able to bring our own wine, which was nice.  The corking fee was about $10 a bottle.  I really hate corking fees, but they gave offer the first bottle with no fee, so that made it a little better. If you are looking for clean and respectable Japanese cuisine at fair prices with a nice subdued ambience, Zest is a very good choice.
