I want to like this place and want to come back again, but I won't. I won't come back unless a friend had a special occasion and requested that we all have dinner there. Quote time was 45 min. We waited over 1.5 hours. No one came by to let us know what was going on. When we inquired about the wait time, they said another 15 min or so. I'm usually fine waiting if I knew what I was getting myself into. This is the not reason why I wouldn't come back. The reason is because the manager Â lead us to believe that we'll be taken care of and that did not happen. I am not at all demanding. I don't expect anything. But, I don't like to be lead on once again. Twice in one night from the same establishment. The tripe chili was good. I ate the whole thing. The spicy chicken wings, not too much. A bit soggy for me. Bone marrow had good flavor. The pig tails were like buffalo ribs. That's the closest way of describing it. The food is quite decent, hence the 3 stars instead of 2. sorry man, good food alone doesn't make the experience great.
