We were a little hesitant to eat here last night because of the wait and debated leaving but decided to stay and I'm definitely glad we did.  We started off with the Angry Shrimp which someone else had recommended.  Although you only get 4 shrimp for $12 the shrimp were very delicious.  We got the Chilean sea bass and the crab stuffed scallops.  The sea bass was flaky and tasted like butter, excellent.  I tried the scallops as well and they were awesome.  The salad was average but it comes with the meal so no biggy.  The garlic mashed that came with my bass was also average, not really much garlic flavor and no skins which I personally prefer.  Overall the place is awesome and I'll definitely be going back
