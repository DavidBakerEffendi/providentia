Oh my word is this place pretentious. I understand that the trend right now is to give customers endlessly customizable options, but it gets pretty ferocious here. I appreciate having choices, but the vibe here always makes me feel like I'm on the picky, demanding side of a very unequal relationship. I'd feel better about the high prices if it seemed like their workers were better taken care of. The plus side is that their salads are fresh and have good variety of items (proteins, crunchy toppings, veggies, etc). NOT just your usual salad bar. The minus is that hoo boy is it pricey. The stir frys are meh. Also, my repeated experience is that regardless of whether you ask for "light" dressing (on a salad or noodle dish), it will come drenched.
