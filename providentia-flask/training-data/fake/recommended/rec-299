I really liked the food here -- we got the spicy calamari, the rice balls, the veal parmesan & veal piccata. It was all really delicious!! We left full and happy. The only downside to this place is, like a lot of NYC restaurants, the seating is way too tight and cramped. I actually felt bad for the waiters because they had to squeeze behind people to take orders and bring food to tables. A busboy carrying our food accidentally hit the girl sitting behind my boyfriend in the head with a platter, and we saw all of our food fall to the ground as we sat watching. Totally not his fault, the chairs were just way too close together. This was also a few months ago so maybe they fixed the table set up.
