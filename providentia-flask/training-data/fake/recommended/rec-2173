Went here with a large group and we had a spectacular experience. This Japanese BYO is a great idea and very well executed. We got the "one of every maki on the menu" special for $70 as a group appetizer, a nice selection of sushi and sashimi and three more non-fish entrees, shared all of it among a group of 8, and it came to something like $40 a head including tax and tip! Add in the cool atmosphere, the great East Passyunk location, and the fun friendly service and this is a no-brainer for 5 stars.
