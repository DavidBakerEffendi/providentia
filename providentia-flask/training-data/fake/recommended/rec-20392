I have very mixed feelings about this place. Went here for Saturday Breakfast/Brunch at 10:30am. They do not take reservations which I assumed would be ok because we got there so early. 4 out of our 6 person party was there and they refused to seat us until we all arrived. So we huddled in the foyer in the freezing cold. Â I understand if only 2 of us were here but 4? Luckily were able to snag the last big table when our entire party arrived. Our server was super sweet and even accommodated a special request I made for her to bring out cupcakes I brought at the end of the meal. The coffee was great and my dad said his bloody mary was the best he ever had. We ordered and waited over an HOUR for our food. Now, I understand all of their ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade, etc.; but this is BREAKFAST. How long does it take to make french toast and veggie omelets? Yes, it's a small restaurant but they have the biggest kitchen I have ever seen in a Brooklyn restaurant and they had plenty of manpower in there. The food was really good, especially the grits and my omelet, but not worth the wait. When people come for breakfast they are HUNGRY they have not yet eaten and making them wait to sit even though there were open tables and wait over an hour for their food - plain old mean.
