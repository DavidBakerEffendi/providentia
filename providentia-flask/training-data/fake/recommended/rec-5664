I went along on a Monday night and sat at the bar. Food - good. The lamb flat bread was surprisingly good with just the right thickness, lamb, and cheese. The kufta was not authentic at all, but it was good enough. What wins here are the cocktails. Really good. Cocktails are an often overlooked yet important part of any meal. The staff here appears to recognize that. From martini to traditional old fashioned, spot on. I'll go again - because it's not too crowded that you can't sit at the bar (on a Monday night), the food is good, and the cocktails are amazing.
