I worked late one night this week and was heading home hungry at about midnight. Not many options at that time. I remember this new sandwich shop had open and gave it a try. This place is the Â smallest sandwich shop ever. I walked in the place was crowded there were 7 people in the place including the staff. I look at the menu and order the Fat Dat (the name of the chef who made it) I was treat well and also was introduce Elven the other owner was relaxing because it was his birthday. I was given a sample of their appetizers to taste and all were very good. I got my sandwich to go and it really hit the spot. I will return on another of my nights working late to try some more of the menu. Good Luck Fat House
