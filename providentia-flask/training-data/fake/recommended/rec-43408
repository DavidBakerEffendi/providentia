In a town where there's a dearth of really good ethnic eats, it's nice to have a decent sushi place around.  NJ is great b/c of the BYOB... and this place is no exception.  Note, however, that you can ONLY bring 1 bottle per couple (was it me that caused them to institute this policy?  I hope not!) If you have some good sake, offer it to Mr Ajeihi... even better, he is a sochu fan, so let him partake should you have a bottle.  Since I live in NYC, it's no problem getting artisinal sake... so I bring some down when visiting friends in town and we head out to Ajeihi and eat/drink up.  I think Mr Ajeihi (dunno if its his real name) appreciates the token gesture on my part (and the good quality sake/sochu, which you can't get anywhere in Jersey... how sad!) Note-- this is Princeton, not Manhattan, so don't expect Yasuda quality-- It's more like Yama quality, which is A+++ for NJ!
