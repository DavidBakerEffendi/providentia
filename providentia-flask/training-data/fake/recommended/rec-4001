Little Bite as I like to call it is my favorite sandwich spot in the NoHo hood. If you are lucky to hang with Ami the owner, have him make you a sandwich with nutella and bananas and a cup of coffee. I swear their coffee is better than Dean & Delucas and given to you with much less attitude. Â Their little corner is the best spot in the city for people watching and celebrity glimpses. Be sure to chat up Yariv and have him teach you slang Hebrew(kooz ganuv)
