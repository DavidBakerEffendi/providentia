Went here for a quick Italian meal and was pleasantly surprised. It was very close by to Wells Fargo Center. The caprese was delicious and highly recommended. It was not listed on the menu but we saw them serving to the large party and asked if we could order it. They were very accommodating. The fish special that myself and my hubby ordered was good. His salmon was a but more flavorful than mine because it was crusted with olive mixture. Our friends chicken with pancetta in phyllo dough was fantastic. It was a good size serving. Overall it was a great ambience of little Italy and we had a great dinner. Would definitely come back here again.
