The food here is beyond delicious.  I live in Chicago (which I feel is up there with the best of the best restaurants in this country) and so when I was in New York last week wanted to treat my mom to an upscale and highly rated restaurant (not to mention, I'm a bit of a Food Network nerd).  Anyway, Marc Forgione's Tribeca spot did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is a chic, neighborhood joint w/ upscale vibe (but not at all pretentious), service was very good, and the food was just delicious.  We had the Kampachi to start, which honestly melts in your mouth. I had the Black Bass (light, very good) and my mom had the Halibut, which was richer and very tasty.  We had the pistachio cheesecake for desert which was very different.  Although the prices are a little expensive, even for New York standards, I'd say you get what you pay for.  I'd definitely recommend it.
