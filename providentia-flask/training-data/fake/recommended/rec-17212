Went there today and it was a packed house. We were to hungry and tired to wait for a table so we ate at the bar. They were only offering brunch menu which was a tad bit disappointing because I wanted something off the dinner menu. The bartender was awesome and really knew he stuff!  My wife ordered the wine with calamansi honey which she loved and I ordered San Miguel. The food was great!  I had topsilog with fried milk fish and wifey had torta talong which was a bit soggy but still good. We are definitely going back and recommending this place to friends.
