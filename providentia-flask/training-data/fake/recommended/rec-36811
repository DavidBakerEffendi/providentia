I really want to give Vin et Fleurs five stars but feel that since my only experience was an hour of drinking wine, I must return for the full lunch or dinner experience. This little gem is truly a treat. Tres francois, which i certainly appreciate. Popped in on a Sunday afternoon with a girlfriend to catch up and have a glass of rose after walking by earlier in the day. Nice staff, good selection of fairly priced food and wine and just a generally convivial and lovely atmosphere. There isn't much fodder here but Vin et Fleurs really does present a location for just about any occassion. Date? absolutely. Catch up with a friend? certainly. I would even come back just for a cheese plate and glass of wine for an hour or so of relaxation and people watching. Vin et Fleurs almost feels like an oasis away from the bustle of the surrounding neighborhood --- a sweet, breezy spot in the summer and i would assume a cozy, romantic one in the fall and winter.
