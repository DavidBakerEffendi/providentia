Both of my stars for the place go to our awesome server Kevin!  He was gracious and apologetic with every problem thrown at him (and there were many!).   My other comments are in line with all of the other complaints on here, so I am not going to be repetitive.   I don't know who is managing this place, but c'mon when you're that big you can't just be flying by the seat of your pants... which is what it seems like there.   That being said, I will return later this summer when the various logistical problems have (hopefully) been cleaned up.  ...and to hang out with Kevin again!
