I went to Little Fish for the Sunday prix fixe dinner and was impressed, but not overly so.  The meal was as follows: - mixed green salad with shaved asparagus and maracona almonds - corn chowder with shrimp, andouille sausage, and potato dumplings - salmon served with pork belly, avocado puree, and runny scrambled eggs - sea bass with eggplant and zuchini - chocolate cake with chocolate chip ice cream The salad was good, but not spectacular, perhaps because it wasn't a very exciting or inventive combination.  The corn chowder was my favorite, although the dumplings were slightly more dense than the dish could handle.  I liked the salmon a lot, and even got over the runny scrambled egg thing because the combination of colors on the plate was so pretty and the flavors were well balanced.  The sea bass was cooked very well, but I found the eggplant (a puree and diced eggplant) to be overwhelming.  The cake was really horrible--- totally dry and inedible, although the ice cream was good. Overall, these people know how to cook fish, and I'd go back (and take people back) on that basis.  BUT, and this is a big but, I will never go back on a hot day.  The kitchen is in the restaurant behind a counter and from what I can tell, the air conditioning doesn't really work.  I would guess that the temperature was topping 85 while I was in there, and that sort of heat, leading to such discomfort, makes it very hard to enjoy a meal.
