After reading all the reviews, I was so excited to try it. During my lunch break, I walked over to grab some sweet goodness that everyone raved about. Brought it back to my desk, rubbed my hands together and opened it up to find a strand of hair in it..whomp whomp!! Needless to say, I wont be going back or trying any of the tofu desserts.
