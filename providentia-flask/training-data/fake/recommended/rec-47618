Odd place. Sometimes the coffee is great other times so-so. What they have in the pastry case seems to depend on the position of Saturn in the sky. The Opera pastry is very good, the baguettes are the best in the area and the quiche are tasty. At most two of these three will be available at any time. The place is small but comfy. Service is friendly but can be slow. Sunday mornings, when the weather is nice, one can sit out at one of the outside tables. update 8/2012: The pastries are still the best in the area and the quiche are still tasty. However, the selection is still unpredictable as is the quality of the coffee. Three stars may be a bit harsh and since I go about once every two weeks I've moved to four.
