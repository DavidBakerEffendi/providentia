Went on a Friday night and had a great experience. We had the rigatoni alla vodka and the breaded sea bass, both of which were amazing. We started with the grilled calamari in tomato sauce which was awful- definitely skip it. Service was great otherwise, even though the two tops are very close to each other. Not that big a surprise for a tiny restaurant.
