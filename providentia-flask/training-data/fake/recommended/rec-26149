Best Italian restaurant in Bayonne!!   My husband and I have been here a few times and every time we go, we are more and more impressed!!!  The staff, the ambiance and most importantly, the food is awesome!!  You have the sweetest older gentleman greeting you when you ask for a table and he will do everything he can to accommodate you.  We waited 15 minutes for a table for 2 and he apologized even though we didn't have a reservation.   I've seen brick oven pizza being made at the bar.  I've never had it but it looks amazing and I've heard it's delicious. My favorite there is the lobster ravioli...huge chunks of real lobster inside with creamy vodka sauce!! They can even accommodate you if there's an Italian dish you'd want that's not on the menu.  It can get pretty crowded but you're never really waiting too long. If you have a party of 5 or more, they'd require a reservation, otherwise you're fine.  For a wonderful Italian cuisine, this place is a must try!!!
