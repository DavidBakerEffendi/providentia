Here are the good things about them: The owner and the owner's wife are super nice. They offer a small plate of side on the house when you are looking at the menu. Â Their food is more delicate than other Chinese food options in town and have more Taiwanese options. (I am Taiwanese). The flavor is also pretty good for the one I've tried. The bad things are: The English speaking (American?) waiters and waitress still need more training. They were not very attentive and didn't give us our menus for a while. And my fiance and I were just drinking water and looking around And wondering when they'll finally bring us the menu. The food is more pricy, the portion isn't as much as other Chinese place. No matter what, it's nice to have this addition in town and I'll go back when I have some Taiwanese food craving.
