This review will only cover the cheesecake, as we went there for dessert.  However, our experience was outstanding!   First, the cheesecake itself:  My No. 1 Original and my wife's Devil's Food cheesecake were both great, although the Devil's Food was soooooo rich, it was almost impossible to finish!   The service was EXCELLENT.  Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, courteous, and  fast.  Watching the rest of the staff work was also a pleasure, as they were all remarkably efficient and friendly.   Based on our experience, we would definitely return and probably WILL return at the soonest available opportunity!
