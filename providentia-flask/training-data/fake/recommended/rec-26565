You absolutely can't deny that their food is great.  Their corned beef was probably the best I have ever had.  Great pickles too.  However, it is very expensive, slow, and watch out when you try to use the yelp coupon, you'd think you asked them for the keys to the front door.  They were running around looking for a manager to see if we could have a free cookie.  Overall food is great but a little to expensive for a deli and a little slow.  Would definitely go back but not an every day place for me.
