Made the trip from CT primarily to taste the legends and make the comparison of the two proverbial giants of the Philly Cheesesteak scene, Geno's and Pat's. Did the classic 'Whiz Wit' at each and while neither was anything that absolutely blew me away in taste alone, I won't be driving past without stopping anytime soon. Nothing anyone else hasn't said or doesn't know, but busy, and 'heres-your-change-and-your-sandwich-see-ya' very quick service. No problem here as the food is the star. In the end, both worthy of the hype but no doubt there's still something better out there. No true discernable taste difference between the two, although the texture of the meat might make a difference to some if comparing the two. From the standalone perspective: great bread, meat good and tender but limited in taste, and Whiz is Whiz. Â The combination works well and IMO that is why they're here. It'd be a regular stop if I lived anywhere close by.
