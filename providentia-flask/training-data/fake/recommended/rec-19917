Went here for special occasion on saturday. Some of the prior posters noted it's a bit cramped. They were right ! As long as you dont mind the tables being right on top of one another then it's fine. The food itself was superb. No weak dish crossed our plates and the hosts were continually walking the floor to ensure everything was in check. Bottle of Pinot we chose was particularly good I must say. Overall I'd say definitely try it as the food and service are excellent but be mindful the space is a bit tight.
