I would give this place a 3/5. Let's start with the positives: - Convenient location - BYOB - Liquor store located a few stores down - Half priced sushi all day - The specialty roles aren't too shabby Now the negatives: - The sushi here is not fresh. I repeat. The sushi here is not fresh! - I think the biggest issue I have with this place is the staff. Sometimes I think I would be better off serving myself. I drink a lot of water when I eat and I cannot tell you how many times the server passed by our table without offering a refill and this is practically every time I'm here. It's gotten to the point where I twirl my ice around and slurp the little water I have left in my cup to catch their attention. I mean.. It used to be a lot worse. It has gotten slightly better. - The decor. This place looks like it's falling apart! From the cushioned seats that have puncture holes, to the dingy, cracked tiled floors. Not to mention that the booths are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. Ashiya, I think it's time for a renovation! Overall, price is good, decent sushi, and BYOB is a plus. Just please, work on your staff and decor. It's a real turn off.
