I never usually write a review, but when I do I mean it. I came here last weekend with boyfriend in tow for a special weekend and happened upon this place. It's quaint and cozy with a lot of room and very friendly service. Every now and again they would always check up on us to make sure we were being attended to just right. I ordered the Skirt steak and Eggs skillet and even now I really wish I lived closer. It was super juicy and it was just perfection when dipped in egg yoke. We definitely will be planning a return trip here.
