I know Amanda Freitag can do better than this, and I mean both the front and the back of the house. Brunch today was an exercise in being ignored. A waiter came to take our orders, and a server dropped them off. In between, not a soul visited our table. No salt and pepper at the table, no condiments, and no offer of any---even if we had wanted one, the young, hipster servers do not even look in your direction or heed a gentle call---their eyes are fixed upward and ahead, and they ignore you as if you carried a plague. My house "smoky" Bloody Mary was all chipotle and black peppercorns, and did not betray a hint of vodka, tomato, or Worcestershire. The salad that accompanied my fried fish sandwich was tasteless, despite flecks of chive. The overpriced kale and fennel Caesar (misspelled on the menu) was underdressed, underflavored and obscenely expensive for .50 cents worth of ingredients. 1. Train your staff to be attentive, to stop by, to refill a water glass, or to bring a check. 20 minutes after we finished our meal, and five minutes after I flagged down a hostess, the check finally came. 2. See if your guests are satisfied, or act as if you're at least interested. 3. When you drop off a check, remember to pick it up. Ten minutes after we received our check, for which we had to practically beg, no one picked up our credit card, so we just counted out cash and left. 4. Don't charge upwards of $12 for three ounces of kale, a shaving of fennel, a boxed crouton which is stale, and a shpritz of lame Caesar dressing. The fish was fine, by the way.
