Stopped by for brunch after the Color Run and sat outside on the street. The bar got super crowded in the first hour they were open but the dining room area didn't look too packed. The $20 brunch special (all you can drink mimosas/bloody marys and a breakfast plate) cannot be beat! The mimosas are delicious and the omelets are amazing. Â  The service was a little erratic but I didn't expect personalized service on a busy Sunday morning. Can't wait to come out and give them a try for lunch or dinner, but I'll definitely be back for brunch.
