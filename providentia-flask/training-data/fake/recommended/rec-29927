I would give 3 1/2 star if I can do so on the scale. The service was good but the food was ok. We came here because it got cold and we were craving for hotpot. But this place is crowded on a Saturday night. We got there around 7:30 and waiting for an hour and a a half for our table. The restaurant allows you to put the name down and call them in 45 minutes to see if the table is ready so you don't have to wait there the whole entire time. My friend and I each got a shabu entree, prime ribeye ($27) and regular ribeye ($25), they are both really good. Entree comes with vegetable, meat, rice, salad, and ice cream for dessert. I would recommend this place but I don't think it's worth the 1 1/2 hour wait.
