Dinner on a Wednesday night for three, we left completely stuffed and satisfied. We started our night with a pitcher of Sangria. Got a ceviche for our appetizer, which we devoured. Then it came... the lomo saltado and the matador combo. Oh my... the portions were very generous. We couldn't finish everything. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful. The lomo saltado was unforgettable.
