Num Pang, you are genius. The Coconut Tiger Shrimp Bahn Mi is a sandwich I will think about, crave, obsess over, for weeks. No joke. I can't express enough how sad I am that Num Pang is in NY not SF. Why was it THAT good? The bread was nicely crispy yet soft, the shrimp was bursting with flavor, and pickled vegetables were sweet and crispy. So often at other Vietnamese/Cambodian sandwich joints the bread overwhelms the flavor or the pickled veggies overpower the meat. But this sandwich was absolutely perfectly balanced. I ALMOST want to subtract a star because the sandwiches are pretty small for the price (I ended up needing a snack soon after eating it), but they're so good that even the small size can't knock off a star. BTW - if you don't want to order it to go, they have seating upstairs, it's just a bit hidden. Step inside and you'll see the circular stairs.
