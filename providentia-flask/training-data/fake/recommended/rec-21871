The food was fabulous, the wait was not. I got the African sandwich, which was quite delicious, peanut sauce and all. They've lost a star from me because the 30-60 minutes turned into a cold sandwich 85 minutes after ordering. Despite the wait, the sandwhich was bursting with flavor. I'm quite pleased with the food and will definitely go to the shop next time. I want to know what a fresh sandwich is like because even cold, it was a great lunch.
