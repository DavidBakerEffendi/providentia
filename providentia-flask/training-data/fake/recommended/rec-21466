The biscuit (singular) and gravy is really good---probably a good hangover helper, although I wasn't hung over. The crunchy, substantial biscuit is as it should be and holds up well to the thick, unctuous (and I mean that in the best possible way) gravy, which could do with a little cayenne like my mammaw made it. I hadn't been here since the top shelf held cake stands displaying giant chocolate cakes (that is, yellow cake with chocolate frosting [a southerner definitely dwells here]), and I am now old enough to be everyone else's mother, but still the place is lively and groovy and cool.
