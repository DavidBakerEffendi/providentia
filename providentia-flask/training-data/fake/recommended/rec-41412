Audrey Claire has found a gimmick.  Simplicity.  Simple wooden tables (or iron ones outside), plain white walls, dim track lighting, white cotton tees or tank tops on the wait staff.  Walking by on summer and fall evenings, I was always intrigued by the place near Rittenhouse Square -- it is always packed and a roar of conversation pours out from the windows or door. However, I was somewhat disappointed with how this plays out in the dining experience.  In the dim, loud, small single room that has no sound dampening material, it can be difficult to carry on a conversation.  When that fails, the plain walls offer no stimulation.  However, we got a spot in a corner so that we could bring a baby, there was no problem accommodating him, and we joked that at least no one would be bothered if the baby cried, it was so loud, so we were glad to go to a fairly  nice restaurant where it was ok to bring an infant. For appetizer, I had Mediterranean olives, which were good but nothing to write home about -- you can get similar quality from the olive bar at Whole Foods or several other grocery stores and there was no special treatment or presentation.  For entree, I had penne arrabiata, which was also ok but not great.  The penne was too soft -- way past al dente -- and while the dish was peppery enough, there was not much complexity in the flavors.  Nothing I couldn't make myself at home.  The dessert was another matter.  The warm chocolate cake was warm, a bit creamy inside, and altogether delicious from the first bite to the last. The service was good and friendly, so I will probably make another attempt and give a light recommendation, but prospective diners should go in knowing how the "simple" theme shapes the whole dining experience.
