It's a tiny little gem. About $20/entree... Frikkin delish. They had quite a few specials for the evening and I chose to start with one of the salad specials. It was definitely large enough to share with another person because they also bring out bread and oil. I had the lobster ravioli and was pleased that the pasta was al dente and there was enough lobster inside that I actually had to chew. Really good. A bit oily but very flavorful. My date had the eggplant & ricotta penne. Again perfectly cooked pasta. Great flavor. We both had leftovers so I'd say portion size is adequate for even a big eater. Service was terrific (and easy on the eyes). They leave you be and allow you to enjoy your meal, wine, and company. Can't wait to take some friends and try more dishes. Larger groups will likely need reservations as this place is small.
