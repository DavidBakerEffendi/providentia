Honeygrow: healthy quick service dining at its finest!  One day while passing time before a train ride, I ran into a family friend who could not stop raving about how amazing this place was, so I decided to check it out.  Don't let the crowds deter you--putting in your food order is quick and hassle-free as it is entered via touch screen so you can customize your stir-fry, salad or Honeybar (fruit salad topped with your choice of honey as well as other toppings--granola, nuts, chocolate chips, shredded coconut, etc.) just the way you want it!  Plenty of seating available and a free phone-charging tower available for your convenience....what more could you want?
