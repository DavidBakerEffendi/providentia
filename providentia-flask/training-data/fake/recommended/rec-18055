My boyfriend and I just moved to East Falls and decided to check this place out, and it is fantastic.   The food was amazing and all prepared fresh.  My boyfriend got the Chicken and Waffles and I got the Berry Waffles.  I was a little hesitant to order the berry waffles because this is usually just berries from a can and heated up and tossed on top of the waffle, but I shouldn't have worried the berry compote had clearly been made from fresh berries and was amazing, tart and just a  little sweet. We will absolutely be coming back to try different things.
