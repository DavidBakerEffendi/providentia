OMgoodness this place is soooo teeny! It's literally the space of your dining room. It looks like a family run restaurant and you have to be warm and cozy with your neighbors because you have to sit awfully close to them! This place gets really crowded at lunch and it can only hold so many people. I finally got this bronte burger that everyone was buzzing about and boy was it good! It's basically a burger in a sandwich style but the sauce and everything was deliciousss! My friend got the chicken salad and that was good too but it was a very simple salad that you could've gotten somewhere else. If you're gonna wait in line and be squished with all these people.. make it worth your time and order the bronte!
