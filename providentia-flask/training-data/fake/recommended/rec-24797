I have never had anything here I don't like!! Food is fantastic. However, once I had the enchiladas (almost two years ago) they're ALL I ORDER.  Ive had them with shrimp, chicken, steak, and chili.  (All on separate occasions of course.) The enchiladas with texas chili is my fav and its served with a fried dippy egg on top.  AMAZE.   The guac is also awesome. And endless chips and salsa for $1.00 per person is pretty rad. In the summer I usually get their pitchers of sangria (for two of us) and at $30- its a great deal. Staff is always super laid back, friendly, and attentive.   LOVE the outside seating. Cant wait for the weather to get warmer to go back and eat enchiladas outside aaaalllllllllll day. DELISH!
