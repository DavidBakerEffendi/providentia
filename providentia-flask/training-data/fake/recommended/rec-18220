Walked in to a great experience!! Friendly to no end. Even was well educated on the beef they source for the burgers. The bacon jam alone makes this a place to go to. I hope the vision of this place can pan out,would love to have one up in my area so I don't have to go far for one great burger. The decor is simple and practical, not a lot of seating but just enough. Keep it up!!
