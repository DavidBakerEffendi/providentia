Having tried all the restaurants around Prudential Center my friend and I decided to give Mr. Adams a try before the game.  We sat in the dining room as the bar was very crowded with people watching March Madness.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail and the salad bar.  My friend got the Angus Burger.  A lot of the items on the salad bar did not seem fresh.  The lettuce was very wilted, majority of the cheeses had very hard sections around the edges and the cured meats were very dry.  This is most likely because they were not wrapped properly and were old.  My shrimp were large and the cocktail sauce was very flavorful with some good spice to it.  My friends burger came out looking a very odd color.  It seemed as if the burger had been boiled then thrown on the grill for a minute or so to give it the grill marks.  I am not saying that is what they did but it sure looked that way.  My friend had said it definitely did not taste like an Angus burger or even a regular burger for that matter.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  With so many great steakhouses in the Iron Bound I don't think we will be returning here.
