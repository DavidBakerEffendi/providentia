I've gotten lunch here and was pretty happy with it, but I was especially excited to try their breakfast menu.  I left extra early for work so I could stop on my way in, only to find that they didn't open until 11AM!  It's my own fault for not checking the hours before I went, but seriously... Why have a breakfast menu at all if you're not going to be open at breakfast time?
