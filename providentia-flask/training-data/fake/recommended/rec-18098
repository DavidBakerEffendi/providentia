I recently moved from the Pacific NW - land of amazing, amazing Mexican food. Sadly, I haven't found many options for Mexican out here and certainly nothing authentic. However, this is a pretty good little find. My only complaint - as other reviewers have mentioned, the price of the food is a little high for the quantity of taco you get. Because of this, I may or may not come back. But, the tacos were great none-the-less.
