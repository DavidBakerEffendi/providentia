This place used to be a whole lot better in service.  Those female staff are so bitchy in the morning.  Good grief...I'm afraid to ask for more coffee.  No one greets u or walk u to a table.  No one brings the menu until five minutes sitting at a booth, a waitress asks have we been helped when clearly she saw that no one came over to sit us or provided menus.  The breakfast food is still decent thank goodness.
