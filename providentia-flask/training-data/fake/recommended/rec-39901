Today was the third time I've been to Yuca, but the second in the last two weeks, so my experience here is rather narrow.  One thing I know for sure: the Huevos Rancheros hit the spot every single time.  For $12.95 for brunch, it is a pretty decent value given that they'll give you all the coffee or fresh squeezed OJ you could want.   I'm hesitant to give it 4 stars because I don't want to over-rate the place when, in a month I could be over it (as is often the case).  Also, when I went in today, I got seated at a spot that was so loud that I couldn't hear my girlfriend across the table.  When I requested a table on the other side of the bar where only one table was seated, the hostess looked at me liked I had two heads.   I can't hold a hostess' confusion against the restaurant, though.  Just be warned that it can get a little loud.
