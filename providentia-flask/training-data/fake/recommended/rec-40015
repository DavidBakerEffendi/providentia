I was really excited to try this place while visiting Philly for the first time. Yelp has seldom misled me, and the solid 4 stars combined with an intriguing menu convinced me to stop in for a solitary dinner (yay, business travel). Unfortunately, the service was so awful that I didn't even get to sample the (delicious-sounding) food and left angry and disappointed. I came in around 5:30 by myself for an early dinner and was sat at a small table in the front corner of the bar. The server came to take my order right away, and the restaurant/bar was half empty, which I thought boded well for me. I ordered a pint of cider, which was also delivered very quickly. Too quickly for me to have thoroughly perused the creative menu and have settled upon one of the many delectable options on offer, so I told the server that I'd order food in a couple of minutes. She nodded and walked away... never to return. Approximately fifteen minutes after I sat down, a veritable mob of Santas descended upon the bar and all of the servers turned into bartenders. At that point, I had finally decided on food, and was waiting for my server to come back and take my order. And so I waited, and waited, and waited while everyone ran around behind the bar to serve the Santas. All of the tables had been abandoned. I tried to catch the server's eye, and sat there for another fifteen minutes, totaling to a half hour of waiting for my order to be taken, and an empty pint glass, and still no one came. At that point I realized that I wasn't going to get food after all, cashed out at the bar and left. I don't know if the place was understaffed that day, but it was a Saturday night and the staff should have been prepared to manage a crowd without sacrificing service. National Mechanics has a great menu and awesome decor, and seems like a great place to hang out. Unfortunately, I didn't get to experience any of that.
