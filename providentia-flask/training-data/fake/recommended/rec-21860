Let me tell you about two perfectly brined, juicy, tender chicken breasts. Let me tell you that they are on two thick pieces of fried buttered bread. Ham and cheese are also invited to this party, though they know they're not the star. Likewise with the delectable, stone ground mustard. And then, just when you think it can't get any more hedonistic, a perfectly cooked over-easy egg with a dash of salt and pepper. This, friends, is the Ella Fitzgerald at Hamiltons. This, friends, is the best sandwich in Brooklyn.
