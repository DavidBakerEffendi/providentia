I am a ramen addict and ippudo definitely fuels my addiction. The ramen here is amazing from the broth to the noodles to the toppings. I usually get the Karaka miso ramen which is flawless. But I've tried the other choices and they are all delicious. When you come here you must get the pork belly buns. Don't questions me just do it! If there's a long wait grab a beer and order some of these buns at the bar as a pre-meal teaser. You can thank me later. So why only 4 stars? The hostesses here permanently have prickly sticks up their buttholes. Some customer service would be nice. You are not doing us a favor by putting our name on the list, we are doing the restaurant a favor by bringing in our business. Also, I wish the ramen came with more toppings instead of having to order them as add ons.
