The food is marvelous. Both savory and sweet crepes that are very rich and filling. My favorite desert crepe is strawberry, banana, Nutella. Excellent soups. A nice choice of large salads. Savory crepes are served with a small salad next to them on the plate. Soup is served with a large hunk of bread. Smoothies appear to be made from milk and frozen fruit. They are thinner rather than thicker which I like since they can easily be drunk through a straw. The restaurant is very small, can get noisy, and the service can be slow if the staff are overly busy. If the place is crowded I often just get whatever I wanted as take-out. I also order and pay at the counter as that speeds things up.
