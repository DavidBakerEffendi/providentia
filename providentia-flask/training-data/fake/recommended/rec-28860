We went today for Restaurant Week and had a great dining experience. Our server was very polite and prompt. I ordered the Mojitos and it was good. I later ordered a cappuccino and it was perfectly made! I ordered the Ceviche de Pescado for appetizer and it took me back to my vacations in Miami! For entree I had the Ropa Vieja for my entree. My only critique is I wish the portions were a little bigger. I am not sure if the portions were smaller since it was Restaurant Week or Lunch? The coconut custard (Tembleque de Coco) was very yummy and a perfect little end to our meal. I've always had great experiences with Garces' restaurants, but I think for the price, the portions could stand to be bigger! Will come again for dinner next time.
