This place was disappointing. It was very hyped up, but I ordered the Crab Meat Pad Thai and it was repulsive. The smell was unappetizing, and it tasted even worse. I recommend that the recipe for this dish changes (perhaps making it a more authentic Pad Thai dish would be more appealing). The waitstaff was very nice and amicable, but the bartenders had poor attitudes. I will not go back to this place again.
