4.5 stars. Perhaps we had a better experience because we ate here during "blizzard Nemo" and many others with reservations chose to stay home. So, the restaurant was pretty empty. Regardless, we experienced warm and friendly service and our food came out in a timely manner. First of all, the atmosphere in this place is great. Very romantic, but fun for a group as well. Love the variety of lighting in here - including a wall of candles. And it may seem weird to say this, but their bathrooms were gorgeous (and stocked with complimentary bars of soap to take home - adorable). The food was delicious. I had the duck and it was SOOO good. I would only have been happier if they had given me twice as much (the portions are conservative - you want to order an appetizer). Everything on my plate was amazing and went so well together. This was a great dining experience - I want to go back!
