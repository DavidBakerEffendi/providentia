What an amazing find. Stumbled into little Italy with family and was looking for a decent lunch without all of the NYC fuss. This place delivered in spades. Such friendly service by the family who owns the restaurant. The food was fresh, piping hot, and every single bite was delicious from beginning to end. I couldn't believe how much food we got for a $12.95 lunch special. All-in-all unbelievable! Give this place a try!
