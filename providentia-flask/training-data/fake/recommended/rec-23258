As a  local, I appreciate the great job of transforming that corner of the neighborhood, it  looks great. Warm and inviting inside too, and the waitstaff was top notch. Unfortunately, that's where it ended. Wasn't  a menu that I was interested in so since I am a burgerphile I tried the chef's "signature"burger. OK, so it's "just a burger", but any burger over $15 should be better than "just a burger."  It was supposed to be med/rare, instead I received 2 dry pucks precariously balanced on top of each other with a slice of cheese, on a hard English muffin. Who puts a burger on a muffin? All this south Philly bread at our doorstep and you guys use English muffins? When you try to bite into it, the pucks slide across each other, I just wanted "a" burger I could sink my teeth into,  2 patties are just stupid. No garnishes, no nuthin, meat was dry and tasteless. I don't usually order fries, but they came with it, soggy. I set it aside after only 2 bites which totally upset the waitress, maire d, chef and owner.(maybe they thought I didn't want to pay for it, but I did). The beer selection looked interesting, but my  date seemed to have been a bit shortchanged on a Jameson, little stingy with the alcohol. It's a shame, but I'm sticking to the old neighborhood hangouts.
