Came here last night  for a semi-business meeting.  I actually had to meet with Shannon who is the owner of the bar.  Shannon is such a  nice and down to earth bartender! There is public parking behind this bar and we were lucky to find a spot.  FYI...it's free after 7pm.  Just Jake's is a pretty large restaurant.  They have a nice outdoor seating area, as well as plenty of space inside.  I couldn't help but notice all the tv's in this bar, especially since I was in a hurry to come inside and watch the Devils vs. Flyers game. We made it in time for happy hour and Shannon made sure to let us know all the great specials they had going on.  After ordering a blue moon, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with ranch dressing.  I must say that the wrap was really good!!! Just Jake's has trivia on Tuesday night's at 8pm...my friends and I participated in the trivia game and I soon realized that I suck at trivia =(  The questions were pretty hard and there were some people at the bar that take this game very very seriously! Overall, I had an awesome time here (and not just because the Devils won).  When I am in the area, I shall be stopping by once again. Also, they have PINK LEMONADE MARGARITAS!!!! =)
