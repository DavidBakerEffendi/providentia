Food : We tried the margarita pizza here and it was amazing. Especially the cheese. There was something soo fresh about the cheese. I would give them a 4/5 on that. Service: Â This is what was upsetting . We had to wait 30 minutes outside the restaurant. Once inside, we had to wait for another 40 minites for our pizza to arrive. We just ordered one large margarita pizza and i belive our server completely forgot about it. I think they should upgrade their service.
