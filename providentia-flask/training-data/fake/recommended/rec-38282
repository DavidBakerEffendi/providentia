pretty good standard french bistro faire while still retaining authenticity.  we came here for dinner and was definitely worth the wait.  the atmosphere is quite cramped, but once you're settled in, it's very comfy and homey and unpretentious. we got escargot, french onion soup, some goat cheese/crostini appetizer..... wish we got the moules frites though, because all the tables around us ordered them and they all looked amazing.  make sure to have the massive french macaroon dessert!!! it's heaven.
