Your search for decent asian food in the area is over, this is some bomb ass thai food. If you read any negative reviews it's probably because they didn't have any ketchup or they ordered fried chicken or something narrow minded. And man up, order it spicy (an ample amount of spice reduces the amount of fat you body absorbs)
