Always wonderful...this is in a way a second office for me, since I work across the street. Lunches are reasonable and always very tasty. And dinners are suitable for special occasion, but also for everyday dining when you don't feel like cooking. The Bistro Menu (weekdays only, I believe) is wonderful, especially for those light weeknight dinners. They feature some quality NJ wines, but allow you to BYO - best of both worlds. Recently had the hanger steak with Asian vegetables and a potato pancake - fab-O. I also love the roasted Griggstown chicken breast with Spaetzes (not sure if they still have it on the menu tho). But basically, have never been disappointed with a meal there. Mario, owner, is a wonderful person and has also done a lot for the community. Heartily recommend!
