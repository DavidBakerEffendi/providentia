I ordered the sushi with some noodles with a friend last summer. I didn't particularly care for the sushi because it tasted a bit too warm. Raw fish in warm temperature? Yuck. I've had a ton of sushi in my life, so I can tell whether the fish is warm or whether it's from the rice. As for the noodle, it was okay. I wish their chow fun noodle (or something like looked like it) had more flavor. Plus, it was a bit cold.
