So my friend says, "Hey you like Indian Food?" I say, "I've never had it before." My friend punches me in the face for being uncultured and I wake up at Mood Cafe. Honestly, if I wasn't there with friends, I would've walked out. It was clean and nice, but seeing a bunch Chex Mix and random things in canisters behind the counter...I had my doubts about the food. Then I saw someone's order and really thought my friend had developed a drug habit. Then she told me to just talk to Hassan (the owner?), who apparently is the most popular person on Yelp. He explained right off the bat that a chaat is random as hell. The ingredients don't really sound like they go well together and when you see it, it will look very strange. But he promised I'd like it or give me my money back. With that kind of guarantee, I could see why people like him. Since it was his dime, I went ahead and got a lassie too. The chicken chaat, although it didn't look very appealing, was pretty good. I can't tell you for the life of me what it tasted it like. It was sweet, salty, savory, spicy, mild, cold, lukewarm, creamy and crunchy all at the same time...just like Hassan said. Every bite tasted different than the preceding. The mixed berry lassie is basically a yogurt based smoothie and it worked well to quell the heat from the chaat. Not only did I finish everything, I gave him a tip.
