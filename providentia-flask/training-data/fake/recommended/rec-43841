I mostly go here for happy hour which is great! 5 dollar margaritas (amazing) and 2 and 3 dollar tacos. My favorite taco is the fish taco. The ambiance is also engaging. I constantly find myself looking around at the dressed up skeleton by the bar. The only thing missing is outdoor seating which is a very small miss.
