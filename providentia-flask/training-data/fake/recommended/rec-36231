So I have no idea why I haven't been here before! I must have passed it hundreds of times it being so close to NYU. I finally did walk in last week. This place has a great vibe! Casual, trendy and not too crowded. You walk up to the counter to place your order. I got the avocado arugula sandwich and a cappuccino. So first off the coffee was AMAZING! Light and foamy yet strong one of the best cappuccinos I've had. They bring you the good when it's ready, which you know right away is freshly made and with the best ingredients. The portions are a good size which I loved. The staff is super sweet and patient. I will be back to try their brunch and get my coffee fix.
