YUM. Awesome place. Went on a Friday night around 8:30, and only waited about 20 minutes (maybe?) for a table. Got wine at the counter, which was full but not PACKED. Once we sat down service was fine - server got there, gave us the specials and we decided on a few plates with a little guidance. Food came out SO fast and in a nice clip and was all really really tasty. Literally not one thing I wasn't in love with. We did the croquettes with jamon, the grilled peppers, a steak special, a scallop special and patatas bravas. This was TONS of food for two, but the specials were a lot bigger than the regular tapas. Scene was good - def lively but not so cramped you couldn't get comfortable, a tad older, loud and having fun but not so loud you couldn't have a convo. All in all solid pick, would def go again.
