I don't know where to start with this.  I guess I was so hyped up about the reputation and seeing this place on triple D that I let the fact that it is a diner escape me.  We had chicken matzo ball soup which was very good but that is where it ended.  Everything from the burger to the meatloaf was like most other diners I have visited in Jersey,  Pastries were good and they had a nice selection.  Service was top notch but even so I left feeling.....eh.  A least I can say I tried it...........(I didn't like it though)
