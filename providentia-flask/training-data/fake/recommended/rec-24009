I always walk/ride by this place and last week I decided to stop in.  I ordered the chicken tacos and they were pretty good.  Certainly not the best I have had but better then Qdoba or Baja Fresh. The service was friendly  and the restaurant was really clean.  It was a quiet day so it was nice to sit in the front window and people watch.  Next time I'll try the burritos for sure.
