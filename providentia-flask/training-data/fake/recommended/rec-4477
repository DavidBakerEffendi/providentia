Over the years I've grown skeptic over chinese food with many Asiatic people bringing over their home lands dietary customs I never want to be someone who can say I've eaten rat. BUT OMG I LOVE Amins. Always fresh deliciously seasoned chicken. Never bad. I suggest to anyone. I don't eat anything but halal now.
