Great atmosphere & cute place. Delicious food although the portion small (probably because big places don't fit on the tables) for the price you pay, and for 4 people, you end up ordering 7-8 plates to get full. I really enjoyed the fried chicken they had as the special. Â Cocktails were disappointing, so I took 1 star out.
