Ugh, I love love little owl.  It is so quaint and just an all around pleasant place to dine.  It's small and special, there are about 8 tables inside, which  gives off somewhat of a romantic vibe.   Every ingredient is organic and fresh from the tea to the blackberries in my brunch cocktail to the syrup on my whole wheat pancakes.  The service was fast and friendly.  Go ASAP!
