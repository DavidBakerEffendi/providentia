The menu was interesting if you like appetizers but the flavor was bland. I have visited on 2 occasions and Â avoid the downstairs (noisy, cramped, cafeteria like). The upstairs area is nice but the seating (we had a booth) is kind of shabby. My experience is similar to others, the people who work here must hate their job because they are terrible. We ended up being helped by a person that said this was not his area but thank goodness he was working upstairs or we would not have had any service (refills, desert order, the check, etc.) because our waitress kept disappearing into the back.
