We ordered the Kamayan feast for 10 pax. For about $51 per pax, there was fish, curry meat, ribs, prawns, sausages, vegs and very fragrant coconut rice. In all, the food was nicely prepared although a tad salty. Definitely more than enough to go around and we ended up having to pack food home of course. With two pitchers of sangria, we ended up paying about $80 per pax which I felt was a little too pricey for the kind of food we were having. I believe its a good one time experience but will not do it again as it would be more economical to order alar carte and sometimes too much food in front of you just spoils the appetite.
