My family and I were excited to find a German caf√© while on vacation in New York. We waited in line for 45 minutes to get seated - waste of time and money. The food was below average. The prices were high. Portions were small. The waitstaff was rather snooty. Being Polish and very fond of German food, I had much higher expectations for a place like this.
