DO NOT COME HERE. Oops.  Sorry. Gotta behave like a lady. DO NOT COME HERE. Oh my bad again, it's just I love this plac... DO NOT EVER COME HERE. Alright, I will tell ya like it is. I just LUV LUV LUV this place.  I didn't even wanna write some review for this place.  I just wanted this place to be my top secret in BK. But I can't be so greedy.  Good things have to be shared by good people, right? Try their salmon dish and fried oyster.  And don't come back again.  I won't be so happy when this place is getting known and packed.
