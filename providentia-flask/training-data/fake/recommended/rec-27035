Always enjoy coming here for cocktails and food at the bar. Flatbread (pizza) of the day is always good and the tacos are delicious. Bartenders are always on the money and we always enjoy eating at the bar for this reason. We have sat at a table for dinner many times and always enjoyed it as well. Decor is beautiful. Great place to meet friends for drinks as well if you are over 30, since the crowd is usually 30+. We attended at private birthday party here in the space on the second floor and it was fabulous. Food was delicious and service and space was perfect for a small party. Â One of our favorite go to places.
