Started visiting Olivier's when they first opened last summer to grab iced coffee and fresh croissants. Since then we have moved onto dining for brunch. The food is amazing and authentic. And during the warmer months there's some options for outdoor seating and then open the windows in the front for an open air experience. I'm excited to hit up their oyster happy hour soon! Heads up to bring cash (or Amex only).
