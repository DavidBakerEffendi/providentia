Made the drive down to Hamden Saturday nite after reading all the great reviews and so glad we did. After driving by the restaurant twice (there is no sign and the GPS said it was on the opposite side of the street) we finally made it into this cozy little tapas bar. All tables were full so we decided to eat at the bar. While mulling over the menu we both had a Mojito. While not the best I ever had, it was decent. We then switched to wine and began a great nite of tapas. Pimientos del Piquillo -Wood roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with Valencian salad, saffron aïoli. Calamares a la Plancha - Grilled baby squid, tomato, mango, onion, pepper and shallots vinaigrette. Croquetas de Bacalao - Cod fish croquettes served with aïoli. Patatas Bravas - Fried spiced potatoes. Arroz de Setas - Bomba rice with wild mushroom, and vegetables. From the first plate to the last, each dish was nicely prepared and had great flavor. Favorite of the nite was the Arroz de Setas. It was prepared like a Wild Mushroom risotto and was amazing. The hints of black truffle gave this dish such a rustic, full bodied flavor. A great way to finish the nite. Service at the bar was great and we look forward to our next visit.
