Decided to try it out based on all the glowing Yelp reviews.  We were a little leery about the visual and the location, but once you find a place to park, all the rest fades away.  Very cool, trendy place with a creative menu.  Really wanted to try the tasting menu (because we've never done that), but the server wisely dissuaded us because we were with our 2 young kids. and he explained that  it would have taken close to 2 hours. There is no way they would have sat that long. We really appreciated his honesty.  I settled on the cheese and meat platter (the La Tur was AMAZING) and Garganelli pasta.  Each selection was explained in detail by the extremely knowledgeable waiter.  My husband tried the chicken wings and the caprese salad and the boys had some wood fired pizza.  All of the food was delicious!  I hope we are in the area again because it is a great date night restaurant and we want to try that tasting.
