Everyone brags about her brunch, and rightfully so, but I am here to tell you that her dinner is worth a visit. My wife and I dined there last night with another couple and it was good times all around. We started off with mussels in red sauce and hummus and both were very good. I had way more mussels than hummus and that's because they were so good. For my entree, I had the pork tenderloin which was wrapped in goodness disguised as pancetta and mustard. I had a choice of sweet or garlic mashed potatoes and I chose sweet. And I chose well. The steam veggies we also excellent. We BYO'd wine and had great convo with the great meals. (Yes, everyone enjoyed their meals too.) Â And in the end, the bill was $42/ per couple - not bad huh? (Oh yeah, our server was great too. She was prompt and courteous.) All-in-all a tremendous night. So there you have it. She, the lovely Sabrina, is just as good at night as she is midday. Go enjoy!
