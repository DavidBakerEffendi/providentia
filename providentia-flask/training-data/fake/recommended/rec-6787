Really good place & cozy atmosphere, although a bit tight, but what can you do. Loved the food, service & atmosphere. Only 2 "negative" comments/suggestions: Â I had to add salt to everything, however, better to have to ADD salt then have it too salty. Secondly, they need to put some hooks on the wall or a coat rack as there was no place to put your coat if you weren't at one of the larger tables. Originally we were at a high top table for two & since we sat on stools, you couldn't hang your coat on the back of your chair. Other than that, we THOROUGHLY ENJOYED ourselves. Not just the food, but we ended up moving to a regular table & sat next to the most wonderful people whom we ended up chatting with the entire time. Kudos to The Brooklyn Beet Company for feeding us well & bringing people together.
