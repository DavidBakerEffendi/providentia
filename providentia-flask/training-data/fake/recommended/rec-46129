I've been to the Mill many times over the last 10 years, but my last two visits were very disappointing.  On both occasions the staff were surly and rude and had a bad attitude.  On my most recent visit with my elderly parents we were met with a rude bartender and a waitress with an attitude.  We got up and walked out.  The food is pretty good at the Mill, but who cares if you're greeted by nasty, rude staff!
