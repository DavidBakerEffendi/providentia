Talluto's is the store in the Italian market where you can get great, fresh, handmade pasta... that should be enough to get you here, to be honest. Fresh pasta is the the thing I most remember from my trip to Italy, and you can get close to it right here in the Italian market. I bought some sweet potato gnocchi, as well as the scallion sauce that they recommended with it. I also bought some of their handcut pappardelle (you can choose a long pasta and they will hand cut it for you - how cool is that?!). The pappardelle was really, really good - really had that fresh taste to it. The gnocchi was pretty good too, but honestly wasn't much better than other gnocchi I've cooked at home from a package. Overall, I definitely recommend poking your head in here when you visit the Italian market. Even if it's just for the idea of fresh pasta!
