Good lord, this place. Look, here's what this place has: - Iced coffee on tap It's the Japanese pour-over stuff, which that's one of the two methods for cold brewing coffee that coffee snobs like to talk about; either is better than making hot coffee and putting it in the fridge, and why are you even reading this? Couldn't you have stopped at "Iced coffee on tap"? Yes, you could have. This is instantly the best iced coffee in Windsor Terrace. That coffee guy is really nice, by the way. Just a pleasant gentleman. - Lights made of Zildjian cymbals Also, over the bar, cowbell lights. Oh shut up, it's cool. Don't bang on them. The art on the wall is also very cool. - Food, both brunch and dinner, also really nicely executed. So this place is terrific and I'm wicked psyched they're here.
