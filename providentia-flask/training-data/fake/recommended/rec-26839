Absolutely amazing pizza. My new all-time favorite in fact! This crust at its finest, delicious sauce, and cooked to perfection. The white clam pie is out of this world. The sausage and onion was also outrageous, next trip I need to try the margharita (or however you spell it) pie. I usually eat 2-3 slices, but here I can easily go for like 5-6! The calamari app was pretty much tops in my book as well. Went with the fam both times i've been and had a great time...sit at the bar/bar tables as there have been families with kids all over the main seating area. Can't wait to get back here...
