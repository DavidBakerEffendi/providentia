The service was great and so is the restaurant. I was not impressed with the food. I ordered the Fry-up - two eggs (poached, scrambled or fried) on sourdough toast with slow roast tomatoes and buttered mushrooms. The toast was burnt and the portion was small. Two other people on my table also had burnt toast. I do recommend the Coconut pancakes with fresh ricotta, mango salad and ginger-lime syrup.
