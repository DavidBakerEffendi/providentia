The restaurant may seem very unclean, but the pho is just awesome! Never have I had such a wonderful pho. I have tried pho75, pho boston, and other pho restaurants I cannot remember the names, and so far this is the best one. I don't care if I have to wait for an hour for it (which you don't have to), the pho and the spring rolls are worth every penny!
