We came here through the suggestions of everyone on Yelp. What the hell were you all thinking? We thought these guys had something up their sleeve that would make these sandwiches exceptional. Honestly, we could have gotten something as good as what we got from Subway or Jimmie Johns, yet we payed twice as much for a mediocre sandwich. The sandwiches were something I could have thrown together in a minute on a whim. For a place that prides itself for having great meat sandwiches, there was a serious lack of meat on mine. The staff was also quite rude; we felt like we were inconveniencing them which is the worst feeling if you're a paying customer. If you like hot food and want to test your limits, you can try the fire steak. As people with high spice tolerance, we found level of spice offputting, almost something that you would want to test with your friends to see who can fight back tears the longest. We had to remove the chili just to stomach the sandwich. If you're looking at sandwich places in the area, there are 5 other places worth your money.
