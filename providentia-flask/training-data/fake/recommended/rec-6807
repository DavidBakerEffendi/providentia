My grandma spilled her hot coffee and when we told the waitress, she didn't do anything. We asked for water and ice to put on the burn and it took her minutes to get it for us. The restaurant is TINY; it shouldn't have taken more than a minute. The burn blistered and she has scabs all over her arm now. This was on top of below average food and terrible service in general. It took the waitress 10 minutes to even bring us menus and all of my food was overcooked.
