Sticky-sweet ooey-gooey cuteness. Can Penelope BE any more adorable? Probably not, and it grates on my nerves.  Its tables are filled with girls and a dotted with a few men they dragged along. The decor is country antique Anthropology chic.  Not exactly my taste, but certain to please most girly-girls.   The food is slightly overpriced for what it is -- wholesome comfort food.  I adored the BBLT (double bacon), but I found the macaroni and cheese so thick and tangy, it tasted vaguely of mayonnaise. Penelope is a good destination for girls.  Bring your friends, bring your mom, bring your girlfriend.  Just don't bring a straight man unless you plan on castrating said victim.
