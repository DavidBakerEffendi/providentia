As a native of South Louisiana, I can say that the Khyber has THE BEST cajun & creole food I've ever had outside of my homeland. Their gumbo is dark and delicious, the fried okra is amazingly light and airy, the poboys with their shredded lettuce, mayo, pickles & tomato are identical to any you'd get in New Orleans. And yesterday, they started serving brunch. Their praline bacon? It's better than Elizabeth's (the New Orleans restaurant that invented the dish). The grillades were so tender you can cut them with your fork which is as it should be. The brunch drink selection is inventive and delicious. If you find yourself longing for New Orleans, the Khyber can fill that void with the most authentic Louisiana cuisine in Philadelphia, and probably the region.
