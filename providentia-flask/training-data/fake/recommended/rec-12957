Came for restaurant week. Water refills on point the whole course. Attentive staff and management. Now the food.. I enjoyed the hummus but honestly can't get the hummus from Zahav in Philly off my palette, hard to beat. La La loved the moussaka (eggplant puree) and braised beef. The steak tartar also tasted very good but purely because of the texture I would probably not order again (I know..) The ilili candy bar was magnificent and I loved the way the pistachio was a part of it. I had an alcoholic drink with blueberry in its name. With blueberry stoli vodka. It was extremely strong but personally did not enjoy it. Also though I understand it was restaurant week and there are many reservations, the staff and mamagement made it too obvious how they were rushing to have us out for the next table from beginning to end. My friend said "Damn are they trying to get us out?" Hope to be back during a regular week to try the bean sprouts sometime (as my friends yelled at me for not trying it when I went), and perhaps to take our time enjoying the night out.
