I'm a bit new to New York Style pizza. My heart is still in it for Chicago. This is a great place to go; just walk from Manhattan, over the Brooklyn Bridge, then stop for a pizza. You'll likely have to wait in line. Though; don't worry. They move pretty fast. They'll usually let people in blocks of 4-8 people every ~5/10 minutes. Â It will be a bit crowded inside. The food, was so good. The pizza sauce has a slightly tangy flavor too it. It really tastes like they use fresh tomatos and ingredients. The mozzarella.. I'm not a cheese lover.. but it as so good. Now as for the basil. It comes with a few here and there. Get extra. I'm not a basil person; but the basil complements the sauce so well. Perfect!! We're getting extra basil next time. The pepperoni was crispy.. crispy spicy pepperoni. Can you beat that? It's thick.. and flavorful too. OMG.. so good. This is definately my top New York Style pizza place. :)
