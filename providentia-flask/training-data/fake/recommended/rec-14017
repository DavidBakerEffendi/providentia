lovely tiny little place.  great food.  i am pescatarian but they had plenty of very tasty options including a tuna and anchovie thing that was delicious as well as white asparagus which was very tasty.  great dessert too.  very good wine, so good i dont remember what it was.  we sat at the bar, since there were no tables but it was quite nice anyway.
