This place was absolutely amazing! The service was incredible, our food came out quickly, and the waitress gave great recommendations. I'm a big Asian food person, so I've been to my fair share of Thai restaurants. This place is by far the best I've ever been to! The panang curry was incredible, so flavorful with just the right amount of spice. And the beef and vegetables in it were as equally as delicious! I also got the Thai crepe dumplings. So different than anything I've ever had, and they were amazing! Overall this place blew me away and I'll definitely be back!
