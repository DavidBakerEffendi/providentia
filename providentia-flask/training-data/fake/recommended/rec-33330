Extremely rude and unfriendly service. Right at the start, the person that answers the phone to take your reservation sounds like he is royalty. His tone suggests you're wasting his time and he has better things to do than answer your query about possible wait time to be seated. I can only imagine how much worse the treatment will get if you actually go to this place to eat. Staying far away!
