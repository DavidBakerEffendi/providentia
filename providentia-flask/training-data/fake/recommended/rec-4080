Another charming, homespun, cash-only, Italian restaurant in Manhattan? Yes please. Bianca is, as someone wisely noted, very similiar in feel to "Celeste" on the Upper West side: a warm and bustling room, and a menu that feels utterly authentic. The service was attentive and I found the atmosphere to be very New York Romantic: not quiet or subdued, by any means, but nevertheless filled with happily chattering little couples holding hands over their respective votive candles.   The food was good, but I'm sorry to say not quite as good as I was hoping.  I give Bianca major points for authenticity and presenting dishes that are not so commonly found on NYC italian tables, but the flavors were a little boring for my tastes. We had the grilled radicchio with prosciutto and shaved parm to start, good, but the flavor of the Radicchio was pretty overpowering. Next we split a pasta and a secondo. We had Gramigna (sort of the true italian version of the noodle in hamburger helper) with red pepper and sausage, which I found to be, again, inoffensive, but not super tasty. We also got fennel sausage and beans, which was simple but direct, and tasty. Wine was good, apple cake good, coffee good. I loved the atmosphere and the menu so much at this place that I'm going to come back and try it again, I want to be able to give it more stars,  maybe next time I'll try the highly recommended lasagna ?
