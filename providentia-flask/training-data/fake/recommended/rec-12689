I'm a fan of pancakes and this place has one of the best pancakes I've ever had. We came in early afternoon so there was no line waiting. We got the blueberry and banana pancakes. The pancakes were super fluffy and the maple butter was very delicious. The portion was also quite big so one order is enough for two girls. They also serve harney and sons tea here. The service was okay, they gave us another bill after we already paid so pay attention to that.
