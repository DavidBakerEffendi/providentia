I've passed this place many times.  I was curious, but the name and decor didn't speak to me, so I didn't bother to do much more than look at the menu and keep walking each time.  Then a friend came to town and said she would love ceviche.  As we headed toward Coco Roco, we passed Surfish and noticed the garden, which stopped us in our tracks. Feeling the Peruvian vibe, we went for it, and were surprised at the offerings. Holy ceviche...delicious, tender, and unexpected, though a bit too sour for my taste (and I'm told I sucked on lemons as a girl), but really memorable.  Then the paella, but not before the sangria.  Both were winners also.  I won't bother going into detail except to say that the dishes were very pleasant, subtle but lovely tasting, and beautifully presented.  The paella was "wet" and not overly cooked, and had a heavier balance of saffron, which I prefer.  The fish serving was generous for a single entree. Overall, the restaurant is a very nice spot for Park Slope (a great date or friends night out venue), and their chef is going to be on Chopped (Bravo) in the middle of July.  So if all that together is not an indication of goodness and potential, well then, who really knows.
