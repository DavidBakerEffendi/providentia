This place is great for german beer lovers! They have a bunch of different sizes you can order by, as well as great microbrew options. The servers/bartenders are very friendly and are willing to make suggestions and point you towards your beer of choice. I went on a Saturday night, and surprisingly it wasn't crowded, most likely because it's a bit out of the way. The staff also put on the woodburning fireplace when it got chilly...great ambiance. The food is stellar for what it is. They have decent veggie options (I'm a veggie). Would def recommend the Brussel sprouts and the Pierogis.
