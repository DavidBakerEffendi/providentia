I have mixed feelings about this bar. The food is always great, and honestly if I'm going out with the intent to eat (as opposed to environment/drink specials) then I tend to choose this spot. The drinks are average priced, and the bartenders are either great or not so much. The place has a pretty nice feel to it, and plenty of outside seating. I don't think I've ever seen this place packed which to me is nice. Â But what gets me is the music. I've considered leaving earlier than I wanted to a number of times because I just couldn't stand the music. So every time I've been there I've popped in for a quick bite and a couple beers, and split.
