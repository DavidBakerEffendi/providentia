Good wine list for sure.  Maybe a little pricey and it would be nice if the vintage they pour is the same as the menu.  A little detail, but apparently many restaurants suffer from this affliction.  Of course the waiter or bartender has the standard answer that you should be on the look out for.  "Must be typo on the wine list".  That is all well and good.. but don't pour me this "Sxxt" because I didn't ask for a vintage that is a couple years off from the list (especially when you are charging $20/glass).   Sorry for the rant.  Anyway.. I actually like this place.  Good place to catch a drink at the bar get a nice appetizer plate (this was very good... combination of cured meats and fantastic cheeses).  I'm a sucker for that type of food.  I did not have dinner, so I can't comment but I had a good time an will definitely return.
