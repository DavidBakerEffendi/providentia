Great neighborhood pasta and pizza in 10 minutes or less. I stay at the Paramount Hotel next door once a month when I travel to NY for business and always enjoy take out from here. It's true. You can't fit more than 6-7 people inside but so worth the try. I've had almost everything on the menu. Best Alfredo sauce on anything and tomato- basil pizza. The garlic knots are addictive and even better is the breakfast. Everything from french toast to omelets and egg sandwiches. Just be ready to eat and walk. It's become a NY staple for me and highly recommend trying it. The owner will call you "bella" for it.
