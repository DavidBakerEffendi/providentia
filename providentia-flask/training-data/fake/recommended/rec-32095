Fabulous meal.  We started with fries, oysters, and the pretzel bites.  All were delicious--especially the french fries which were crispy and served with mayo and ketchup! As a group of 4 we ordered the pigs head(which was a special) and 2 of the maple fried chickens.  The pig head was very tastey and  not nearly the mess you imagine after ordering a pigs head.  The chicken lived up to the hype.  Overall the restaurant is beautiful, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was perfect for a week night out.
