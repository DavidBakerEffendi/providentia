While the standard corned beef Reuben here is great, the Pastrami Reuben is second to none.  Piled high with meat, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing, it is grilled to perfection and served with a pickle spear.  Not cheap at just over $11 with a drink, but quality has a price. The potato knishes are also enormous and outstanding. Well worth the visit to Reading Terminal Market.
