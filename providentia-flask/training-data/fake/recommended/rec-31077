This place is amazing and very unique.  Even though my wife is from the Philippines, I don't really know that much about flip food.  But I really do enjoy it.  At family gatherings I normally just eat stuff without asking questions and I can't pronounce anything. everything we had was excellent- ESPECIALLY THE BONE MARROW SOUP! - my wife decided we should order a side of kalamansi to toss in the soup and the flavor was amazing.  The beef was tender and the broth was so good I literally tipped the bowl up in the air to drink what was left.   The drinks were really great too. I had something with mango and spicy pepper in it that was awesome.   Can't have a Philippino feast without a good dose of halo halo.  If I had one complaint it would be that the ice they used for the halo halo was not properly shaved.  But still, 5 star place in my book! PS.  peeked at all the dishes on everyone else's tables and they all looked just as good as ours.   Also, I think I can make the longanisa burger at home.  I'm gonna try it soon.
