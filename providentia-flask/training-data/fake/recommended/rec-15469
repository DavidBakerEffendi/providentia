Not a cheap place.  However, the cocktails I had were very good.  Portion sizes were good as well.  This review is being left for one reason.  Chicken livers sauteed in a pomegrante-butter recd by the waiter.  Really surprised me, in a good way.  It was the absolutely last thing I expected to order and may have been the highlight of the night.
