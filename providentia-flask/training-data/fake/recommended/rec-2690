Awful service. Rudest server I've had... I understand having 1 server for 6 two tops but we shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes for a breadbasket. The food was just okay and it was pitch black in there. Probably won't ever return... No idea why everyone raves abt this place. Much better options in Philly.
