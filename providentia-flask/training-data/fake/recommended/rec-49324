I've only been to the new Rudy's a few times, usually soley on the suggestions of others. I'm a purist: I preferred the dive bar ambiance that is now a thing of the past at the new location. Maybe that's what I find confusing: the new place doesn't seem to have that much substance or soul to me. I find the seating areas awkward and the decor to be haphazard. I haven't tried the food. I had some shots of vodka here once that were horrible in comparison to the vodka I had just consumed at Elm Bar. I went to trivia night once also and that was fun, though I think my team managed to come in dead last, though that's not Rudy's fault, rather the stupidity and/or drunkeness of myself and my teammates. The beer selection is the main standout, and in my opinion, the only reason to come to Rudy's. I have had a few good porters and stouts on tap, and those are my thing when it comes to beer. Recently I had a winter ale, Six Point I believe, that was on special for $4 a pint, and it was really great. I had two actually. It's not a bad place to meet friends. It's middle of the road between classy and trashy, though I think it is still confused in it's identity which makes me not really love the place. I'd rather have a more extreme reaction to it. Will I be back? Yes, but only for an occasional beer or two. I don't prefer it enough to consider becoming a regular there.
