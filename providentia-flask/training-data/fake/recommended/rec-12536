If it wasnt for yelp im not sure I would ever eat at a Halal cart. Theres literally one on every street you walk on. This one was definitely crowded and you can tell that they prepare a bunch of meat, plates, bread to make the line grow so people know that they are the popular one. Myself and 2 of my girlfriends SHARED 1 combo plate: half gyro half chicken over rice. comes with lettuce and bread. ($6) We made sure to put the hot sauce and white sauce all over. BAD IDEA....... I got SO SICK from the hot sauce. was it the hot sauce or the food? Im not sure but I was IN SO MUCH PAIN. WATCH OUT FOR THE HOT SAUCE BECAUSE IT IS FREAKIN HOT!! so hot it ruined the rest of my day :( Dont think ill ever go back to a Halal cart. I want to barf everytime i walk by one.
