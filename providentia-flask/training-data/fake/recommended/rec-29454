Hand drawn noodles!!!! HAND DRAWN! I saw a No Reservations thing about china, and how there this was a dying art.  The thought that I might not be able to try some hand drawn noodles sort of hurt my heart, but apparently they make hand drawn noodles here. I tried the roast duck with wonton noodle soup.  While I wasn't blown away with the roast duck or the wonton, the broth and the noodles were very good.  Next time, I'll probably try the beef brisket, but back to the star of the dish, the noodles. The noodles were a great consistency, and I will definitely be back and try some of the other noodle dishes.  The price is great too.
