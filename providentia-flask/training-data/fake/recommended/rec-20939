Best craft brew in town, their beer draws on a wide range of styles from simple lagers (helles, kolch, etc.) to the big, complex ales (old ales, double/tripels).   The breads are great for when you just need something to go with the beer (dancing heart is a simple, asiago/sesame seed/olive oil affair, like an oily, crispy cracker), or if you are hungry (the specials are like a full meal on top of a pizza crust).   The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the crowd is better than the snooty Church St. goers/annoying college kids scene that can be found elsewhere in town. The secret is getting their bloody marys on the weekends.  Only available for an hour or so from when they open at 11.  Amazing.
