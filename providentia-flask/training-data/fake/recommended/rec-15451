I am not a bar person at all - but Jeffrey's is different! I tend to think that bars are great for beer lovers (which I am not) and have terrible food. But to my surprise, Jeffrey's provided me with a pretty good experience and completely exceeded my expectations on their food and drinks! My friend and I shared the Truffle Popcorn, Tuscan Kale Salad, and Red Beet Deviled Eggs. I wasn't sure what all the hype was with the Truffle Popcorn, but I do admit that it grows on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tuscan Kale Salad and Red Beet Deviled Eggs - so much so that we ordered seconds! As for my non-beer drink, I had the Strawberry Jalapeno Lemonade, which I would recommend for those who love spicy, fruity cocktails! As for the venue itself, it was decently filled for a Monday night but not to the point of overcrowding. There's a good number of TVs tuned to different sporting events so this also wouldn't be a bad place to catch a game. Service was pretty good - nothing to complain about. I'd definitely go back to this bar and bring along a group of friends (and again, that's a pretty big deal since I'm not that into bars. ^_~)
