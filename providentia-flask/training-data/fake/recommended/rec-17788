Very sub-par Italian take-out.  I was disappointed because I had heard so many good things.  Maybe i should have stuck with pizza.  I ordered a stuffed rigatoni in vodka sauce.  I was told it was stuffed with mozzarella when in reality its stuffed with ricotta.  The vodka sauce was good, but the peas were super mushy.   I also ordered the eggplant parm, whose sauce was super salty.  maybe that was the counteract the side order of ziti with really bland sauce.  Even though its a side dish, you should make sure sauce tastes like something.   I would try the pizza again, but nothing else.
