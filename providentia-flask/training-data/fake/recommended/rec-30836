This review is solely for their grocery/market items. This place is stocked with so many goodies, that it ALMOST made Whole Foods look bad. They had freshly made ravioli/pastas in their fridge/case section.. yum. Too bad I was visiting because I would have LOVED to try those at home. Their dry pasta/sauce aisle was so impressive that it almost left me speechless. We spent 30 mins perusing the aisles before deciding on a couple of options to bring back to Tucson. Everything looked good here... fresh fish, breads, snacks.. ugh I wish I lived in New York just so I could stop in sometimes and occasionally give my wallet a mini heart attack.
