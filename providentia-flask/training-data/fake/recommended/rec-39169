I miss the days when I lived 3 blocks from Song! My dinner usually consisted of Tofu Tod with plum dipping sauce and the Massaman Curry with Chicken.  Yum! The entrees are big and so cheap for New York ($6-8, and if you have a small stomach like me, that means you will have enough leftovers for 2 more meals.  Every time I cook Thai food, I think about how it would be cheaper to go to Song! The loud music sometimes bothers me, what with screaming at your friends just to have a conversation.  The service is quick, but arrive early on weekend nights, or you will be waiting!
