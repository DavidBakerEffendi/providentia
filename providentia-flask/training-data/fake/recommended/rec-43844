Given that my wife is a vegetarian I find myself sampling a wide range of vegetarian options of regular food. My wife who is generally very very forgiving of vegan/vegetarian meat alternatives felt that the veg hot dog here missed the mark. I guess it was that hot dog was a little mushy and lacked flavor. Maybe she's just used to your standard supermarket soy dogs. That said, the pommes frites / french fries here are out of this world. The potatoes are fresh, handcut and because the deep fat fryers are positioned right behind the register you see them cooked in front of you. Â  This brings me to Hot Diggity's signature dish, the Surf and Turf Dog. It kills me that I can only get this in Philly since everything else I can find a suitable substitute here in NY. The surf and turf dog is a hot dog, wrapped in a what they call a fish cake, and then rolled in potato hash and fried. The result described from the inside out is a perfectly juicy flavorful hot dog, a layer of moist dough that doesn't really taste like fish much at all, and a crust of hot crunchy potato crumbles nestled in a fresh bun. Extremely unique yes and also extremely good eating.
