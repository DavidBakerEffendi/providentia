Even though it's oh so much more special (basil flown in from Israel, $24 price per pie) then the pizza I had growing up in North Jersey it really, really reminds me of it - which is a good thing. I love that there's not a lot of options, you're going to pizza or calzone (period), because that's what they do well.  It's soda or sparkling water if you don't bring your own bottle of wine or beer, which they very kindly accommodate. The bathroom is so cute and is everything I'd want in my cottage home away from the city.  This is a great place for a date, nice when your mom is visiting from out of town, or of course, with a friend. Just keep in mind that it is a pizza place and service, although quick, is casual. My 'hood pairings - wine from Smith and Vine and wait for your table by having a drink at Bar Great Harry.
