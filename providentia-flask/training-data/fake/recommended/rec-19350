Ever since the first time I had Shake Shack (at the original shack, back when there was no other location), I have been in love with a burger.  The burger was juicy, just enough grease, and flavorful.  Enough cheese, well-seasoned meat, and great potato bun.  I admit to being slightly picky about french fries, but their fries were perfectly crispy on the outside, while nice and mealy on the inside.  In sum, I had found the perfect burger and fries. Shake Shack continues to have the perfect burger and fries, at least for me.  It may not be the best burger on earth.  Apparently there is some sort of debate between Five Guys, In N Out, and Shake Shack over who has a better burger (hint: the answer cannot be Five Guys).  I get that people may not personally consider Shake Shack the best burger on earth, but for the price, the quality won't get much better.  I personally love the Shack Stack - fried mushroom burger with a regular burger.  The fried mushroom is like a dream. I have my reservations about its extremely fast expansion all over the globe.  However, I have been to Shake Shack in NYC, Philly, Miami, and DC, and it has held up every single time.  I am certainly thankful that it now exists in my adopted city of Philadelphia.  I wish this location had some more seating, but I will still take it being here with minimal seating than not having it here at all.   I strongly recommend this place, but with the caveats that if you're a grease-hater (read: un-American), or plan to go for a run afterwards, you might not like it.
