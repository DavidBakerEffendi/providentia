I've been to BR a few times over the past 3 years. It's definitely designed to give the impression of being an exclusive and stylish little joint. Every time I went there was on a weekend, and the place was packed. I remember going at 1am and having to come back at 2am or later for seating. Reservations can only be made for bigger tables, so if you're going on a date be ready for no seating. The space in the restaurant is extremely tiny, quite possibly smaller than some takeout places. The ambiance is definitely very chic and posh. Service is very attentive and quite fast for the amount of customers. Although they do have quite a large staff of waiters, all seemingly well versed in etiquette. I noticed the entire staff including manager and bartender are all male. It gets very hard for them to move around the place without knocking into a table or chair though. There's an extremely low romantic lighting, which is cozy and beautiful but at the same time truly hard to see. There are about 10 or more small tables lining the walls of the room,a couple in the middle, and a small bar near the front. But everything is literally squeezed next to each other so your personal space is often shared with strangers. The wine is impeccable, great place to chill, if we could smoke too it would be perfect. The food however is the downfall of this place. There's not that many choices, and some very boring dishes, including burger and fries. Most of the food that come are quite expensive for their portion, bad presentation, generically made, and extremely bland. I've had microwaved food that were tastier. But luckily I usually go to restaurants just to drink and chat with friends so I find ambiance to be more important than the food. So if you want a nice little place to drink and enjoy dessert and conversation it's perfect. But definitely not a place to pig out at.
