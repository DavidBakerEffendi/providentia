So the appetizer was half way decent. But then comes my entree. I ordered a taco bowl salad thing. It was super bland so I thought "hey oil and vinegar makes any salad better" so I ask for some. Oil and Vinegar hits the table and I look at the oil and the bottle is a bit dirty but I thought hey I'll just wipe it off what ever. But then I take a good look at my vinegar...guess what chilling in there? I'll give you a minute....BUGS!!!!!! Little dead bug bodies chilling in my vinegar. So disgusting!!!! I'll never forget there little bodies floating around...I have so say I felt bad for them floating there like that. But I felt worse about the fact that I was for real just fed BUGS!!!! Thank god I never followed through to eat the salad because if I would have noticed after I would have been livid. They should have comp'd the whole meal but nope. I paid for my drink and appetizer. Yuckkk!!! I wont be going here ever again or suggesting this place ever again
