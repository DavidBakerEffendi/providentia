Good for vegetarians and vegans alike.  There are always options, usually in season and sustainably grown or harvested.   The seitan bahn mi sandwich is very good.  Sometimes the salads miss the mark for me, too much of this or not enough of that.  But overall a great place to meet friends, grab a coffee or do lunch.
