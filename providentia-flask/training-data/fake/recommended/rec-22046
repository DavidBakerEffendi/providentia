My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Brooklyn, maybe even Manhattan. First let me start with the pastas- always homemade and absolutely amazing. My go to is the Cavatelli with Oxtail Ragu, but all our great. The service is always on point here (big deal in my book) always very attentive, friendly and warm. They play old school hip hop most of the time, which adds to the laid back neighborhood vibe. Big pours of wine. I highly recommend the Polenta, superb!. Shout out to the Sunday Supper that they just started doing as well. $35 for four courses. Cant beat that.
