Meh. Very disappointing experience. I had this place bookmarked for a while, and when I found myself downtown yesterday, I decided to give it a go. Between my bf and I we ordered 4 things: 1. Fried Calamari- This was decent. The marinara was too sweet for my taste, but it was okay. Nothing special. Beware that their calamari only comes in rings- none of those tiny and wonderful little legs. 2. Butternut Squash Soup- This was one of their specials, and probably the best thing we had all night. It was a little bit sweet, but still very delicious. As a twist, they added in swiss cheese which turned out to be a delicious pairing. 3. Ravioli Pellegrino- This was my bf's entree. It was pretty disgusting. The ravioli may be alright, but the sauce tasted like melted butter. If you can imagine a giant stick of butter melted in a pan with a touch of cream, this was probably it. My bf took a bite and sat back because it was basically inedible. 4. Pappardelle- Another special of the night. It was made with ground beef and a cognac cream sauce. This was the most disappointing dish of the night. When the waiter first brought out the plate, it looked like dog food. I was immediately turned off. Essentially, I was staring at a giant plate of pasta with chunks of ground beef. And I mean random, chopped up chunks. I lost my appetite just looking at it. The pasta was fresh, but undercooked. And the mushroom cognac sauce was meh. Definitely nothing special. The best part? Our check came out to $75.99 without tip. A hefty price to pay for a not so stellar meal. Maybe I came on a bad night. Maybe their usual cooks were sick. Maybe my dishes were a fluke, or maybe this place is just too hyped up to be real.
