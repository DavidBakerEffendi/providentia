I've been to Penelope's about 5 times now, and tried several of their dishes, and I can confirm, their food is consistently DELICIOUS. I selected 4 stars because I am their #1 fan (as the 4 stars is described), but in actuality they deserve 10 stars. First, I must tell you about the ambience. It reminds me of a cozy country kitchen - seriously, the water is served in these mason milk jars. While we are on the subject of water, the seltzer water is complimentary. ALWAYS great music playing, makes you want to jump in the kitchen and grab a wooden spoon to sing along kind of music. The staff is very friendly (and their adorable baby pics are on the dessert menu) The food...O.M.G. Â  The grilled cheese with artichokes, tomatoes, and pesto (this is the bidness folks, you don't know jack til you had this sandwich) The curry chicken salad....YES LAWD... The apple chicken sausage...WELLLLLL now! Chicken Meatballs on a plate of arugula..okay this one was a slight miss, the plate is filled with arugula it looked like the garden of eden. But hey, if you are a die hard arugula fan, you'll love this one. Last but not least.. the Chocolate cupcake with mocha frosting...you must try for your self. It is so good, words can't even describe the pleasure I felt, I almost ate the paper. I only wished I lived or worked near this place, because I'd practically live there.
