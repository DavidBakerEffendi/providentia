The best part is the atmosphere, I've only been here at night so my review is base on that, very chilled, nice decor, and located in a decent part of town, great for dates and to hangout with friends. The food is also decent although the portions are kinda small and the price is kinda high for such small portion and average tasting food. The menus selection is rather limited to, at least at night. Over all a decent level place, great place for first dates for me, it has a bit of class yet not snobby and stuck up.
