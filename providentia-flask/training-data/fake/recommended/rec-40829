If you are a Sri Lankan, you must check this place out! I travel from Queens till Staten Island by subway just to have lunch at this restaurant. It takes me nearly two hours to get here just for lunch but it is WORTH it! As soon as you enter, you get greeted by friendly smiles. The owner is a very helpful and always answers questions with a smile. A husband and wife runs the place so you can taste the passion and love they put into their food. Ordered a Chicken Fried Rice and Devilled Chicken. Some may not be able to wait for 10 to 20 minutes for a dish, but that is what you call when it freshly cooked! Everything is cooked when ordered and not precooked like many other joints. The Chicken Fried Rice was like the way it is made back in Sri Lanka but without all the MSG of course and the Devilled Chicken is packed with boned chicken, a range of spices and vegetables just like home. The spicy food always goes down well with Elephant House Ginger Beer and MD Fruit drinks which they serve in their restaurant!
