I would give it zero stars if possible. I went to the restaurant on Mother's Day 2014 really hoping it would be a good experience. Was I wrong! When the party I was in of four arrived we had reservations and they immediately sat us. 20 minutes later our waitress  finally came over to our table. I would say at this time the restaurant was a 1/3 full and it was like that the entire time. The waitress was nice and took our order. 25 minutes later the drinks came and 15 minutes after, the bread came. The appetizers then arrived. The salad and appetizer bourbon jumbo shrimp were the best part and they weren't that good. Although we asked for dressing on the side and we got the salad was drenched in it.1 hour later our entrees came. My party ordered 2 seafood capellini, 1 mushroom ravioli, and 1 vodka penne. The seafood capellini had clams that we're unopened and lobster tails that were chewy and rubber like and tasted frozen. The mushroom ravioli was very good, but the vodka penne was too saucy. 1 hour later they take our plates and we say we wanted dessert. 25 minutes later we get our dessert menus and they said it's on the house because of the wait. We order and 10 minutes later the waitress says they don't have one of the desserts. 30 minutes later the desserts come delivered by a bus boy who said he didn't know which dessert was which, with the dessert she said they didn't have. Someone in the party ordered coffee and asked we're it was and the man said he would personally make it for her. 30 minutes later we left with no coffee. 1. Poor service   2. Overpriced food 3. Poor service Did I say poor service?!?!?
