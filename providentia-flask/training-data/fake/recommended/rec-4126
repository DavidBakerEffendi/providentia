WARNING DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY. Ordered delivery and it took 75 min to be delivered. They had said it would take about 45 minutes, so after 60 min I was concerned (and starving). I called to check in and was told the delivery guy would be there shortly. Another 10 minutes went by and I couldn't take it anymore! Finally after calling again, the delivery personnel reached out to me via cell and told me he was lost...... My room mate and I are not only in the same town, but within a 2 mile (or less) distance from the restaurant! If you had gotten lost, WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL AND ASK FOR DIRECTIONS? We got our food and it was, needless to say, room temperature. I always thought when you were hungry everything was supposed to taste better, but this food was WAY TOO SALTY (and i LOVEEEEE salty food). I gave it 2 stars because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that it would have tasted better if it was hot and fresh. Also.. just as an FYI - no one even offered to reduce the price of the meal for us. I had no problem paying the full price, but the offer would have given me a reason to give this place a second chance.
