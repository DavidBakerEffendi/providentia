I am absolutely enthusiastic about a cute coffee shop finally opening up in this space! The space is decent, its not too loud of overrun like other coffee shops in the area, and the staff is extremely nice and helpful! I am only giving it three stars, however, because it definitely has room for improvement. I understand that they just opened and are still working through their identity, but I think they could do a little more than just meals or coffee. I am a huge tea drinker and am unimpressed with their tea list. A good sweet non-caffeine tea is usually my favorite, and all of theirs fall short. They could use a few fun flavors like ginger, lemon, vanilla rooibos, etc. I also they should expand on their "snack" section too. I am not sure if this is something they want to do, however, if they want to be a weekday coffee shop, offering some little snacks like fruit, granola bars, nuts, perhaps even health smoothies could really go a long way for the student who doesn't want a full meal, but just a little something to hold them over. All that being said, their breakfasts are absolutely amazing and their coffee and espresso selections great. What they do, they do well, they could just benefit from a little growth.
