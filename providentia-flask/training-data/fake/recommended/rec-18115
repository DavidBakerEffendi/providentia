Let me start this out by saying I didn't really intend on going here ever, because I am not a fan of Bobby Flay. This place opened after I'd already moved across the company, and last week was the first time I was able to try it. I loved the restaurant's ordering style (order, pay, get food brought to you), and the wait for the food wasn't long at all. I had an "LA burger" which had guacamole relish and chedder cheese. I thought it was fabulous (oh, they also ask you how you want your burger cooked when you order, so points for that, too). The fries were pleasantly salty with an interesting sauce to dip them in. Friend and I split a black and white shake which was probably one of the best milkshakes I've ever had. I wish I had an opportunity to go back and try different burgers! Next to Steak N Shake and In N Out, this is one of the best burger chains I've ever been to.
