Discovered this place while visiting my mom in the nearby rehab center. I ordered a E6 Spring mix, Granny Smith apples, sundries cranberries, walnuts and balsamic fig glaze and the P16 smoked salmon w/ goat cheese, red onion, avocado and truffle oil also an iced coffee for take out/to go. Well, I was all excited and besides the fact I was hungry so I rushed back to the rehab center to enjoy this meal. Now to my disappointment I see that I have no utensils to eat my salad but better yet I have the wrong salad. I whip out the menu to figure out what they gave me and it's the E7 baby spinach, grape tomatoes, red onions, black olives and cucumber. So does this even come near to what I ordered? I know I speak English very well because I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and I do have that famous accent to boot!!!  So I decided I'm not walking back in this heat but I can always relax and give a review in nice cool AC.  Anyway, about the food....the panini was tasty and it's big enough for 2 people and as for the salad I'm bringing it to hubby to munch on. Will I go back??? Up in the air for now.
