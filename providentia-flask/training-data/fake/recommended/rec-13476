Went here on a Wednesday since it is at least a 90 minute wait on the weekend.  Ordered scrambled eggs with hash browns, ham steak and a biscuit with the housemade raspberry jam. Everything was excellent.  Even scrambled eggs taste better here.  Agree that biscuits and jam are a must order as are the hash browns.  My friend got blueberry pancakes which were also delicious.   While I would probably never go here on a weekend because I don't wait more than 30 minutes for food on principal, I can't hate on a place for being popular so 5 stars it is.
