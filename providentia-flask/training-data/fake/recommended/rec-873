You might not even notice this place walking by because it's under a weird underpass for a hotel and next to a bus company.   Delicious soup dumplings (you don't necessarily have to bite them open to cool just give them a few minutes and let them sit in some vinegar on your spoon), and make sure you order vegetables as well.   I always get carried away here and order so much but it is all so good!
