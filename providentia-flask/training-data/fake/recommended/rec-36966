My favorite place in New York to grab lunch. I am in love with their Diablo chicken sandwich with roasted peppers. Oh god, I miss Manhattan right now. The portion is so large I usually have enough to take home for later. The margaritas are tasty, sitting at the bar staring at the gorgeous bartender is entertaining, and it's less crowded midday than when it gets packed at night. But even then, it's totally worth the wait. The only downside is when I was there there was no air-conditioning-a big no no in the summertime.
