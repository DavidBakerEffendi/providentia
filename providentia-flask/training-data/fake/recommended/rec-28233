Did Wednesday brunch here.  French toast was burned and bland.  Home fries were good.  Parfait would have been great without the honey.  It detracted from the flavor of the fruit and yogurt.   Service was present.  Restaurant design is strange.  Feels unwieldy.   This was an OK breakfast spot that we tried because of yelp.  There are better breakfasts out there.
