After walking by on several occasions, my girlfriend and I decided to pop in for an impromptu date night. Although the food was decent, what really stood out was the portion size. An entire chicken? An entire chicken with an entire side plate of french fries and a salad comprised of an entire sliced up avocado and a tomato?? That that was just one entree. I ordered one of that night's specials, the skirt steak. It was...huge. Two enormous slabs of beef on top of a large pile of spaghetti noodles with a sort of pesto sauce. All I could think was that Peruvians are used to feeding the entire village. The food itself was a bit bland for our taste, but the green sauce everyone raves about is worthy of the accolades. We were putting it on everything. I would have ladled it like soup if I could have. The service was great and, considering that we had enough left over for literally 3 more meals, the prices were extremely reasonable. I can see why it's a good destination for family gatherings/large parties.
