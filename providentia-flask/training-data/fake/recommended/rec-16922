Super crowded an loud so be prepared. I went in December so outdoor seating wasn't an option but I can't wait to go back in the summer. No liquor license but BYOB.  Sangria?? yes please.  The food was Great especially the Tapas. the vibe was fun and outgoing and although the place was packed the service was not bad. Perfect for girls night out. I'll be back
