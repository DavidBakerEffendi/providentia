My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp when we came in for a weekend visit.  It had great reviews, so I was not surprised to find that it was super busy for a Sunday brunch.  I thought the overall ambience was very nice, but the food did not live up to all of the hype.  The portions were definitely large, but the taste was not the out-of-this-world experience I'd been hoping for.  I ordered an omelette and was disappointed to discover that the mushrooms were not fresh, but clearly the rubbery canned kind. I'd probably go again if I was in town, but not sure it's worth the half-hour wait you're guaranteed on a Sunday morning.
