I go to pacifico all the time whenever I have friends in town visiting from college or whenever my family goes out to eat on the weekends.  Not only are the staff at Pacifico are all really friendly,  but the food is honestly delicious.  Although the menu is a little pricey, the food and experience is well worth the money.   The guacamole is a must have to start a meal off- it is mixed right in front of you and is always fresh.  The duck quesedilla is to die for and the shrimp & scallops with lobster & crab ravioli is unreal.  The mojito is also very good.  The only thing that I did not LOVE from the menu was the cesar salad. Being a cesar salad fanatic, the dressing is perfect in terms of cesar dressing goes for me (creamy and not too fishy), but  the manchengo cheese they put on top completely overwhelms the parmesean cheese and the cesear dressing.   If you or a friend have trouble walking up stairs, be sure to reserve a table downstairs in advance.  The stairs going up to the second floor of the restaurant are a killer and there is no elevator.
