We hit up Pommes Frites on Halloween night after the parade and before hitting the bars. Someone wrote that this is the best tipsy food, and I strongly concur. I am a little person (5'3", 106 lbs.), but I was starving and a bit tipsy and was able to finish a Double for $7.25 (you CAN'T call this overpriced; it's way filling). It's always heaven at Pommes Frites. I recommend the Parmesan Peppercorn, Mango Chutney, Rosemary Garlic Mayo, and Pomegranate Teriyaki sauces. The shop is run by some very nice Filipino guys. I chatted them up in Filipino and they gave me a sauce for free :D Salamat! The line was long, but it goes by quickly. Hit up Pommes Frites and you'll always leave happy :) Pros: -delicious FRESH fries and good sauces -nice and fast service -the line goes quickly -pretty large portions -free samples Cons: -cramped seating inside -no drinks on tap...just have to buy bottled drinks :T
