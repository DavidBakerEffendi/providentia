Oh Williamsburg... first dude I saw coming in here had a beard that was down to the middle of his chest. Came here for drinks the other night and had a really nice time. The space is really beautiful with dark wood throughout. It has a kind of a speakeasy vibe, which I love, but it was kind of annoying to just grab a drink here as it is definitely more of a restaurant than a bar. It might be fun to come at like 11:30 or something for a drink after the kitchen has closed, but if you just want a drink, grab a seat at the bar as opposed to a table. The drinks were really nice, though $9 as the cheapest glass of wine on the menu is a little nuts for Williamsburg. I'd definitely come back either late for a drink or for dinner.
