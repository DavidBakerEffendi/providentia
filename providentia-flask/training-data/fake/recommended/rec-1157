MY FAVORITE IN PHILLY "This was my favorite cheesesteak of the trip (see all listed below). Yes, it was greasy.. THAT'S THE POINT. I got the whiz with onions and it was fantastic. The thing I liked best about Pat's was that they put the whiz ON TOP. All of the others I had they put the whiz on the bun and then add the meat. WIth the cheese on the top, it sinks in all of the meat and you get some in every bite.. ooey cheesey-meaty goodness. We must have lucked out because we got a table and only 4 people in line in front of us on a Sunday at noon (November). My Favorite Cheesesteaks in order: 1. Pat's 2. Jim's Steaks 3. Geno's 4. Campo's
