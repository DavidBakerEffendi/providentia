I came here with a friend for brunch. The food was pretty good (I recommend the pulled pork benedict). One of our two servers was attentive and pleasant, the other was indifferent. The back patio needs more shade, though they did bring out an extra umbrella to help mitigate the heat. Overall, I was expecting a little more from the food and the atmosphere. And a drink special in Williamsburg wouldn't hurt...
