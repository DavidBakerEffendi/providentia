The food bursts with flavor, and the service is excellent. This restaurant is best for more formal affairs like business meetings and small celebrations. The dining rooms are relatively quiet but still well lit and not necessarily romantic. I would have given this restaurant a fifth star if it had served some more "fresh" flavors. The majority of the dishes are rich, so the meal would benefit from having more variation. The portions are quite generous.
