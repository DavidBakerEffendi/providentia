This is my absolute favorite sushi restaurant in PA. It's quaint, clean, and the fish is fresh. The sushi chefs and waitstaff are super nice. The square sushi is really fun, but my favorite thing to order is the sushi/sashimi combo. You get an awesome variety of fish and they take the time to explain to you which pieces you're getting. I also ordered a spicy scallop handroll. It was on the expensive side since the scallop was live. And I do mean live -- literally still twitching. It doesn't get more fresh than that. The best thing they have is the white tuna. Do not go here with out trying the white tuna - sushi, sashimi, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that it's what makes life worth living.
