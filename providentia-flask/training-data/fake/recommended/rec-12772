Really delicious food, and I loved the setting.  This was probably helped by the fact that right before we walked in the sun was setting through the buildings and it was beautiful!  My parents, cousin, and I came here for dinner, and it was pretty crowded for a random weekday at 6.  Everything was very tasty, but a little bit overpriced especially for the very small portions! We got: - Blue Crab Crostini ($10) - very yummy, but expensive - Marinated Beet Salad ($14) - I love beets and will pretty much get beet salad every time I see it on the menu.  This was really good, but it feels wrong to pay $14 for a small plate full of beets...but it was still really good! - Crispy Fried Artichokes ($16) - not what I expected..coming from California, artichokes are readily available, I was thinking this would be little fried artichoke hearts or something.  But they were little fried halves of artichokes.  Probably not something I would order again since the yummiest part of the artichoke was so tiny. - Squid Ink Pasta Alla Chitarra ($22) - such a small dish for how much it is.  This was interesting as well - we were expecting the squid ink pasta where the sauce is made of squid ink.  But the sauce wasn't the ink we thought it would be...the ink was incorporated into the noodles, and then the sauce was just some chili and seafood and tomatoes (I think?).  Still yummy though, just not the black inkiness we were looking forward to. We also got their fish special of the day and their pasta special.  Very yummy!  Just be prepared to either be a little bit hungry or to leave with a lighter wallet.
