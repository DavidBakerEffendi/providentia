The pork bun was unbelievably delicious. When the bun sat on the plate, it looked sort of blend. But after a bite, I was very impressed - the pork belly was tender and had a nice aroma. We also had soft shelled crab and octopus. All were very good. The only drawback was the price which was on the expensive side.
