Frank Pepe's is legendary in Connecticut and well beyond.   Our "spiritual son" was received into our church last Sunday and all the relatives, who are Italian, wanted to go to Pepes.  What fantastic thin crust pizza.  I had the bacon topping, which is the best bacon I've ever had on a pizza.   Nancy our server was the highlight of the day - she had some of the best one liners I've heard in a long time.  And she did not charge for he entertainment to boot, although she said the charge was buried in the bill!  She had the last line and everyone was having a blast, even the customers in the tables around us.  Great pizza, great atmosphere and terrific veteran waitress.  To the manager, treat Nancy with kid gloves - she is a gem.  PS. and don't forget its Nancy with a Y!!!
