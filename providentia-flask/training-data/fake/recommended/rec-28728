I found Hu Kitchen after Tim Ferriss mentioned it on Twitter. I've been an on again off again follower of the Paleo Diet since reading Robb Wolfe's The Paleo Solution and Tim Ferriss' 4-Hour Body. One of the biggest challenges following any low-carb diet, i.e., Caveman, Paleo or Slow-Carb, even in New York City is finding restaurants where they serve Paleo-friendly foods. I'm so grateful that Jordan Brown decided to change that and created Hu Kitchen for people who want and enjoy delicious *and* healthy food. I literally felt better every time I've had a meal there. I was very fortunate to met Jordan and hear his philosophy about food. The one word that came to mind was "quality" after eating there and that is what you will get when you dine at Hu Kitchen. The combination of delicious cuisine, convenient location, and friendly staff and Â makes this one of my instant favorite spots in the city that I will be frequenting very often. (One of the very helpful staff actually created an impromptu gift basket of assorted collections of Hu Kitchen's Sweet Treats for my friend for his birthday after I mentioned it to her!) Quality FTW!
