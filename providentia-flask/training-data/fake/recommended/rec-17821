This place is ehhh. I would like to give it 2 & 1/2 stars. The food is okay. Not great. I wasn't impressed. The dessert is the reason why it received 3 stars. They have a lot of fruit, pastries, ice cream and I really like the sugared donuts (biscuits) they're very good. I've eaten here twice and I felt the same way both times. I'm not begging to return.
