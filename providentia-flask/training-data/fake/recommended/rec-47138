I am still gagging thinking about the brunch I had here the other day. And it wasn't "just my dish" because my sister also said her food was not good. Before I go on, I must note that our waitress was very pleasant, attentive and sweet. Here's a breakdown: I ordered the "baked eggs" which was explained to be baked eggs in a tomato and hollandaise sauce with spinach which also came with grilled bread. I was thinking "hmm, sounds like shakshuka, yum!" Wrong. The entire thing was basically like eggs Benedict soup. The grilled bread was stuffed underneath the eggs so it had become entirely soaked in the mushy, soupy mass which was hiding underneath the eggs. Once the eggs broke, the soupiness continued and I literally could not eat it, I was so disgusted. My stomach is literally churning just thinking about it. The other issue I had was basically nothing on the menu was vegetarian, although they were able to adjust accordingly. Sorry, EV, it just wasn't good!! Maybe add some texture to the baked eggs, or keep the bread on the outside? Not sure.
