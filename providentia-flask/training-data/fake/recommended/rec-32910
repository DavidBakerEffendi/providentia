I was really excited to finally try the sushi-burrito, but was quite disappointed. First, I was confused that typical sushi was not on the main menu- like tuna, salmon, white fish, etc. Veggies and chicken were the main ingredients, while tuna was only available as it was on special. Pros -novelty -you can say you've had a sushi burrito Cons -fairly expensive -on the small size in portion -wasn't entirely impressed with the flavor -extremely limited seating
