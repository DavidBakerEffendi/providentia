My favorite restaurant by far. The quality ingredients and expert chefs at Hen in the Wood have created some of the best meals I have ever eaten. Also the waitstaff are polite and efficient. I would recommend sitting at the food bar to get an interactive view of your meal being prepared, it makes for a great show. 5 Stars!
