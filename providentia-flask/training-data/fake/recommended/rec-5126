Pizza here is ridiculously good, especially the artichoke and pancetta. Bibb salad was great as well. Service was mediocre and not very attentive, and the last time we went, she accidentally charged our card for a different table's tab. Best pizza in the area, though, and we'll definitely be back, although maybe for take out instead.
