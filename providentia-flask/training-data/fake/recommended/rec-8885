What can I say but purely phenomenal! I went with a small group of friends on a Saturday night so naturally the place was very busy. They estimated a 1.5 hr wait but we got seated in half an hour. We all got the fried chicken since we heard all the stellar reviews and let me just say it was FANTASTIC!! The chicken was crispy, full of flavor and very moist. I could eat it over and over again. It is a definite must if in the downtown area!
