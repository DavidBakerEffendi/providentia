I have been a regular at this latin restaurant for the last 3 years. The tapas are consistently good. The mojito is top notch. Its very busy on weekends, I prefer to go on weekdays. They have a tapas special on tuesday which is a great deal. Its a little on the expensive side but like I said the food is high quality!!
