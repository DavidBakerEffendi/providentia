Finally made it to Il Bambino! I don't know HOW it took me so long, but I promise you, Astoria, I'm planning on making up for lost time. Like a lot of the restaurants here (I'm discovering), Il Bambino is small, intimate and unpretentious. The dining room only has a handful of tables (in plain sight of a fluorescent meat counter and coffee bar), but with the candles and dim lighting it's elegant enough to meet up for a date or with relatives from out of town. The menu is here is simple: salads and small plate "tapas" appetizers, paninis, and crostini. It took us approximately 1,000+ hours* to make a decision because EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS. Everything, everything everything. And surprise! Everything IS delicious! We ordered the String Bean small plate to share (baby string beans with toasted bread, shaved parmesan and truffle vinaigrette), I got the Prosciutto Panini (with fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, olives and rosemary aioli) and my friend chose the Mushroom Panini (with fontina, truffle spread, "dirty chips," and caramelized onions). Without going into FULL dish-description-mode, everything we tried was great. 600+ Yelp reviews aren't wrong: Il Bambino takes simple, high-quality ingredients and smashes them together into plates of awesomeness. And the prices (for food and wine) are totally reasonable. Definitely going to be one of my new neighborhood staples! *Delicious food tends to make me exaggerate. CONSTANTLY.
