After ten years in Vermont, we'd despaired of finding real NYC style slices and pies anywhere in northern Mew England. To stumble on Ziggy's one hungry afternoon was a total treat! So much so that we're heading back there for for dinner after we had the slice this afternoon! Add that to a well selected variety of craft beers, pool tables, and really nice ambience; we've got a new favorite hangout! Instant postscript: just finishing a whole pie and I have one thing to add: keep your pizza order simple and fundamental, 'hand-tossed'=New York, and the on tap beers are great complements. We're regulars to be and happy about it!
