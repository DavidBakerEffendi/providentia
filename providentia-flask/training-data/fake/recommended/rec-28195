Dos Toros; you just got yourself a new ambassador. After two visits and a minor review on Yelp I was kindly messaged by the owner that he wants everything just to be great, and that he would also convey the message to the kitchen staff. I came back and my third visit was a blast; I can truly say they just make delicious burritos. The friendly and vibrant atmosphere only make you want to come back more than any other burrito place in town. I'm truly sorry that I had a 3-star review waiting for almost a month on their Yelp-account. Keep up the good work! C.
