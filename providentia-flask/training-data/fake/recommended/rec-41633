God I miss living on Juniper and Dickinson!  I miss a solid pepper and egg hoagie delivered the afternoon after a hard nights drinking!  Always had a great experience eating at the Cafe and loved how the Pizzeria and Cafe's menus were never the same and what a great host Frank was/is. Don't believe the doubters or the people that think they know better cause they need to stick to Bucca di Beppo.  You really can't get a better experience then this anywhere!
