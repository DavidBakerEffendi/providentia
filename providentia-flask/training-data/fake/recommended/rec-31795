We have completely stopped coming here for 2 years now. We banned this place! My husband was 29 years old at the time and I was 28 and we came on a Saturday night after the Phillies game. The bartender refused service and kicked us out because he thought that my husband's license was fake. We were already in there that morning with 2 of our friends for brunch, drinking bloody marys! We live around the corner and brought back our passports but the bartender said "so what?" He still refused to serve us. It was beyond embarrassing! My husband and I are locals to Old City and we used to come here once a week for over a year. We used to bring business by taking our visitors here on weekends and recommended to other locals and tourists. We also work in Old City. I've written a letter to the owner and included a photocopy of a PA license descriptions from a license/ID manual. The bartenders need a general knowledge first of ID's. We've been coming here for a year!!!! Helloooooo!!! Get to know your local customers! If we were under age, why would we come to a restaurant ambience in Old City? I'd go to a club on a Saturday night. We will NEVER go back! We will give our business to other bars whose bartenders will not insult us.
