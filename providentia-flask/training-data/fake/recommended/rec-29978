Went out for an anniversary dinner and decided to go with Rats since it hosted part of our wedding festivities. We started the meal with a relatively new item on the menu the lobster crepes. The crepes texture was very very smooth and delicate and the carrot ginger sauce was simply delicious. The only down side was that the lobster pieces were shredded removing both texture and lobster taste form the dish. Had the lamb duo (special for that night) for dinner and my wife had to the pork collard. Â Both were virtually and maybe even surprisingly flawless given the number of components that they included. Both were well seasoned and well-prepared with the lamb being perfectly cooked to medium rare wild the pork was fork tender and the orzo bed provided a nice back drop. We finished the evening with a glass if the Mucato dA'asti and their home made cinnamon doughnuts. - one word fantastic.
