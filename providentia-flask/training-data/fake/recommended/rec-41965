My wife and I are obsessed with barbeque since the Smoked Joint in Philly closed many years ago. This place is the best that we've found since then. Cooked completely by smoking using oak brought up from Texas. We got the ribs and both varieties of brisket, regular and lean. The meat is tender and delicious with just the right amount of peppery bark.  Same for the ribs which were fall-off-the-bone tender.  Comes with pickles and onions with various sides nightly. As my wife is not too keen on German potato salad we got only the red cabbage slaw, which was great.  This was a fabulous meal and there were ample leftovers, enough to take back home and treat ourselves and friends the next day. A word about desert...we got a slice of the apple custard pie.  One pet peeve is soggy crust...NOT TO WORRY...this pie was baked fresh that day and the crust crunchy and the filling perfectly cooked.  It is a short crust made right there. This is a BYOB place and there is your choice of beer or wine within a short walk.  Easy to get to as right under the Williamsburg Bridge. All in all a fabulous meal.  We will be sure to return there next time we're visiting the city.
