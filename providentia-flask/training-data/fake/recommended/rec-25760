This has been my favorite little Italian place since I moved to NYC. Has remained consistently good and well priced for me over the last seven years. Lobster Cannelloni & Linguini con Polpette are "go-tos". Both are worth getting and bringing leftovers home. Â Also kudos to you if you can finish the two softball sized meatballs that are cooked to perfection.
