For a place that calls itself a tequila bar, c.o. Jones has remarkably disappointing tequila drinks. They're very weak, and very expensive; I've had stronger and more cost-effective tequila-based cocktails at most other New Haven drinking holes: I'd recommend 116 Crown or Geronimo's over this place. However. The name is hilarious. So props for that.
