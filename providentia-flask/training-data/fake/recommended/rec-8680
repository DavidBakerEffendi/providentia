So I've had this place on my list of places to visit for awhile. I guess I bought all the hype. I finally found myself in the area and dropped by. I had one ripper and a birch beer. The hot dog was tasty, but it could be that i was hungry. It wasn't exactly crispy on the outside -- it was more chewy, a little like jerky, but still good. I see from reading the reviews that it might have been chewy because they make these things ahead of time. I liked the relish. The environment is a little weird. It's a huge old brick building right on the highway. There's an old-time diner-like counter on one side, facing the highway, and a dark, semi-windowless bar on the other side. It felt very white working class... sad-looking 50-ish men and women at the counter. One of the places I consulted before my visit was roadfood, and a reviewer there complains about racist treatment. I was a little wary of that too, but I don't think it's a race thing. They had several minority workers, and not backroom folks, and not of the undocumented alien kind. It did feel a little insular though -- and that's probably part of their "unchanged since 1928" schtick. The bigger warning is, even one of these things, a deep-fried hot dog, is a gut bomb. I ate it in the late afternoon and wasn't that hungry for dinner, but found myself famished at midnight. I finally realized it was probably the number this thing did on my stomach. I couldn't believe some of the customers were ordering two or three at a time!
