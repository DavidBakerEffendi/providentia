Absolutely delicious! I've been here three times so far, and the food is fantastic every time. My goal had been to try everything on the menu :) The plates are very sharable, and are geared towards two/three people eating. The portions in each dish allow for mixing and matching to your palate's content; we shared 8 dishes for two, with a bottle of wine. All prices are very fair, each dish is explained when served (they each have something interesting to offer) and all are well balanced. The restaurant is very small, but it's well played. The experience is intimate and cozy, and highly recommended. This is one of the places I love bringing people who visit NYC to, because it shows another side of the city's offerings... If this is your first time, you must try the watermelon appetizer, the wasabi pizza, the pork buns and the truffle laced ice cream! Sooooooo good :)
