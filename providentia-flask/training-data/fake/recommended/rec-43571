I've organized 5 group dinners here over several years and I've never been disappointed. There's a prix fix menu of $40 per person for groups of 6 or more but well worth it. The dishes include the patatas, croquettes, dates con beicon and sometimes the carne a la plancha. Last time I was there, I was pregnant and the service was amazing. The waiter/ waitresses were accommodating to any and all restrictions and advising me what was raw and what wasn't, which is hard service to find at a tapas place. We also had a guest that came in late but the waiter moved a table to accommodate them but they didn't end up eating. I even admit that's probably annoying for a busy establishment but the staff never gave us a dirty look or complained and since this was a group dinner, tip was already included so they weren't working for extra tip. All in all, great food, great service.
