I straight up love this place. In fact (and this is a big call) it may be my favorite restaurant in New York. The food is consistently impressive (and wonderfully accommodating of vegetarians). Genuinely interesting uses of spice and mouth-watering combinations of flavor. I would loosely describe it as "Indian fusion tapas" (if that's not too clumsy a neologism) but mostly you just want to know whether it's tasty. It's damn tasty.
