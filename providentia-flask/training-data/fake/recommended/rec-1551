Came to this restaurant with a fellow classmate. I told her that I liked Thai food and she recommended that this was the best Thai place that she has ever had. Â I ordered the mango salad to begin which was very good. I decided on the spicy noodles. The portions are a very good size. I was not even able to finish all I just asked it to be wrapped up for work the next day. Service was quick the food came at a reasonable time. All in all it was a good experience I will definitely come back!!!
