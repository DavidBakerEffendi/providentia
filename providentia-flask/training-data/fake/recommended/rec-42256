This review will ONLY rate the Food. For reviews sake let's consider this to be a less expensive place and let's say the wait staff is good. The burgers, albeit tiny, were STUPENDOUS!!! I had the two8two burger Medium Rare, It was FANTASTIC! Had to order a second round. Did not try fries or anything else, this place is, after all, a burger joint so I just went there for a burger. I tried the spicy Bloody Mary with bacon salt and it was good as well (SPICY) Will go there again! Don't make this a dinner date, eating takes less than 30 minutes
