Oh yeah! This place rules. My buddy lives on the block and we dip in here constantly. Sometimes I visit him just as an excuse to pull him down for an ice cold mug of Sapporo. But the food is the real star at this non-descript spot. The Nanban is amazing and the chicken is always good. This falls into the catagory of spots I crave. Also, the service is the friendliest, most helpful of any place you'll find in Manhattan. You guys know I'm a stickler for service and the team here does not dissappoint, they care about your experience. Now I can't wait for them to open up the middle section with some reggae on wax (you'll know what I'm talking about once you eat there). Get in here and get what you deserve.
