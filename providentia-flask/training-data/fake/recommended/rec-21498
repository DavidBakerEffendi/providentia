One of the good things about having friends and family in 2 places is that I get 2 birthday celebrations! Sweeeet. So, my second birthday dinner was this past weekend at Blue Point Grill with my family. First of all, MAKE SURE YOU CALL AHEAD on a Saturday night. When we walked in, the wait for people who hadn't called was an hour and a half!!! Therefore... CALL AHEAD! Anyway, by reading other Yelp reviews, I knew that the place was BYOB, so my family and I brought along 2 bottles of wine. Started off with some oysters from Maine, was actually able to see the guy shucking them from where I was sitting! The oysters were delicious, and were served with lemon, cocktail sauce and some other kind of tangy sauce (not really sure what was in it, but it was really delicious). My brother ordered the buffalo calamari, which he greatly enjoyed. As my main entree I went for one of the specials from the mixed grill, which was some Barramundi and some Canadian Lake Trout. It was served with capers on top and with sides of garlic mashed potatoes and cole slaw. The fish was cooked to perfection, tender and delicious!!! I truly enjoyed every bite, especially the Barramundi which I've never tried before. Yum yum..... A quick comment on the atmosphere and I'll be done, I swear! Simple decor, nice and classy, yet not super fancy. Another great Princeton restaurant... how could I not have known about this place until now? (And now I'm 300 miles away!)
