Yikes! It's getting COLD here in New York, so it's time for some tasty hot soup! For convenience and selection, it's tough to beat The Soup Spot, a not-much-to-look-at place with a lots-to-look-at menu. Need a choice dilemma? Check THIS out: Atlantic Seafood Chowder, Hungarian Mushroom, Split Pea with Ham, Pumpkin Bisque, Vegetarian Butternut Squash, Cream of Broccoli, Jambalaya, and on and on... (Come to think of it, I should hit the supermarket for some Campbell's Chunkies. Mmmm mmmm good, baby.)
