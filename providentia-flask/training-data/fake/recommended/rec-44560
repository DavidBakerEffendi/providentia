I came here for Sunday brunch with my girlfriend on the weekend of July 4th and it was packed with a solid 45 minute wait.  There's not much of a waiting area other than the narrow walkway to the hostess and two small benches outside. However, the hostess takes down your number and texts you when your table is ready. How convenient. The establishment is pretty tiny, and along with a light blue and brown colorway, I guess it has a cute ambiance.  The water is served in their self-themed jar and the utensils are wrapped in a napkin with a sticker of their signature flower. See? Cute. Since it was my first time here, I obviously ordered the Nutella French Toast and my girlfriend had the Crab Cake Benedict. Both were quite tasty as well as the Summer Rosé Mimosa and White Beach Bellini. Overall, it was a grade A brunch and I would recommend it to others.  Just make sure to bring your patience along with your appetite!
