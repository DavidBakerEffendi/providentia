This is my first time writing a review. I felt compelled because the place was literally empty on a Sunday night at ~8:00. It WAS Oscar night so one wouldn't expect it to be hopping but many of the surrounding restaurants seemed to have at least a few people. I guess it's known primarily as a brunch spot but, judging from last night's meal, that is a shame. The meal was one of the best I've had in a long time. Â I ordered striped bass with a caper-potato puree and (tomato?) broth that was just about perfect. Capers and fish are a perfect match and the chef certainly found the precise amount of caper to complement the bass. My friend ordered the vegetarian plate which, apparently, changes every time you order it. The server told us she didn't even know what it would be when my friend ordered it. It turned out to be a bunch of roasted vegetables, smoked pistachios, sauteed Brussels sprouts, heirloom tomatoes, and a lentil-shiitake soup. My friend and I shared our meals with each other so I tried them all except the tomatoes (not a fan of tomatoes) and, apart from the pistachios being perhaps a bit too smoky, everything was great. The Brussels sprouts, specifically, were transcendent. I seriously cannot get them off my mind almost 24 hours later. For dessert, we had a savory cheesecake that was definitely interesting but didn't really blow me away. Then again, it may have just been a victim of the mind-blowing meal that immediately preceded it. Very few desserts I've ever had would not have been overshadowed by that meal. And, the cherry on top was that it's BYOB. We had an amazing meal and a decent bottle of wine for a shockingly low price. The service was good. I.e. our server was very nice and attentive but I can't really evaluate it considering we were literally the only people there so only a shockingly bad server would've been anything but attentive. So, yeah, Oscars or no Oscars, this place definitely did not deserve to be completely deserted on a Sunday night.
