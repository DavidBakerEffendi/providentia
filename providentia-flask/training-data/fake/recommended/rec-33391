We just moved to the area and decided to walk around to discover the local restaurants and bars. We stumbled by Olea and just the cozy atmosphere caught my eye. We decided to try it out for dinner on Sat night and can I just say WOW! The food just blew me away, we got the bacon wrapped dates (so yum), some homemade tzatziki, and I had the pork chop which I can honestly say was the best pork chop I've had to date. They brined the pork and serve it with this amazing homemade olive and vinegar coleslaw. For desert we got this creamy dolce de leche gelato with a shot of espresso over it. Plus the staff couldn't of been sweeter. This place was Amazing! I highly recommend anyone try it!! We'll definitely be back again.
