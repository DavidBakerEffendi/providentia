I grew up right nearby, so when I was visiting CT I had to stop by: the quality was as good as I remembered it, and they had even added on a dining room so I didn't have to go eat the piping hot, fresh seafood in my car.  This is primarily a fish market, and they do most of the business not on the retail side but business to business: at the same time, this volume of trade allows them to keep product moving, so you should feel confident that you are getting some good fish if you are shopping at their retail counter.  However, the portion of City that I was enjoying this day was their prepared food (mostly fried seafood with fries).  I got the soft shell crab lunchbox, which came with two large soft shell crabs plus fries for $11: pretty much unbeatable in my book, especially when the crabs were perfectly cooked, nice and tender with a very light breading that didn't even come close to overwhelming the seafood.  From past memories the whole belly clams are really good too...
