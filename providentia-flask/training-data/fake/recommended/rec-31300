THIS PLACE IS THE TOPS ...in a wrong way. The lunch options seem to be fine, especially the bibimbap which could easily be shared between two people, as long as at least one of them is a woman. But as for the barbecue dinner. It TOPS the list of the WORST KOREAN BARBECUE RESTAURANTS IN NEW YORK CITY. I went for barbecue dinner at this place due to someone else's decision, not mine. And I should have known something was wrong as soon as we went to the basement level for the barbecue dinner. Aside from a few customers having bowl dishes, there was NOBODY down there. So we sat down as the only table (out of 3) having barbecue, and it stayed that way through the time we left, a couple of hours later. The bottom line here is, the texture of the meat is downright STRANGE. It tasted somehow artificial, oddly lacking juice and almost seemed like it melted in my mouth before I ever had a chance to chew it. HUH? "Melt in your mouth? Isn't that a GOOD thing?" you say? Well, yes, when you are talking about M&Ms, not beef! Lack of customer turnover for barbecue could only mean one thing - they are "processing" their meat in some ways so that they last longer, waiting for days and days in the fridge for customers. And whatever it is they are doing to the meat is making its texture GROSS. It was an unpleasant experience to say the least. And now I realize not every Korean is an expert at Korean barbecue, as the guy who brought me there (an FOB from Korea) swore that it's "great barbecue" as I stared at him in astonishment. TWO STARS rather than ONE only because the lunch options on the ground level are OK.
