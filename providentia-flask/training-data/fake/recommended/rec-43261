A guy took me here on a date after I mentioned that I had heard how fabulous it was and that I wanted to try it. It was mid day, mid week when we went so the line wasn't that long...maybe about 15-20 minutes. Time went by quickly thanks to good conversation and gorgeous weather. Once inside, we ordered our pie almost right away (pepperoni and garlic) and it came out relatively soon after that. Now I know I'm giving 4 stars but that's because it's pizza. I've never eaten pizza that was less than 4 stars because it's fucking pizza. Pizza is always good. That being said, yes, this was very good pizza but it wasn't excellent pizza. The pizza place in my town is just as good and there's no wait. I'd probably come back again but only because it's pizza and I fucking love pizza. Whether it's Grimaldi's or Ellio's, I love pizza. I am glad, however, that I finally got to experience this place. I'd say the wait was pretty much worth it.
