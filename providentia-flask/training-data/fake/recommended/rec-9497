I've been to a few Peruvian restaurants now and this is by far the best. Every single thing we had here was incredible. We started with the shrimp and avocado appetizer and it was so unique; unlike anything I've ever had and filled with flavor. My fianc√© had aji de gallina which is one of our favorite traditional Peruvian dishes and it was out of this world. I had the lomo saltado. It was so flavorful. I can't wait to go again to see what the rest of the items taste like because I doubt we just happened to hit the jackpot!
