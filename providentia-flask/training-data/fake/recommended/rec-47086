Move over mimosa! Beer is crashing in on brunch at Hawthornes. Occupying the corner spot on 11th & Fitz, the bright and open cafe offers your standard brunch fare.  I missed the specials on the blackboards above the register but I'll be sure to check that out next time. The cafe receives extra kudos for its beverage selection.  Aside from the various craft brews sold, they also offer a french press for one.  The coffee snob in me couldn't resist. It was a pleasant treat for today's frigid morning.
