Ahhhh cantina... The land of delicious food and drink, and the worst service philadelphia has to offer. South Philly 'attitude' is expected at some Places... But this place is ridiculous. We waited 20 minutes to be seated, not that busy, and the hostess rudely asks 'if she can help us.' We obviously reply table for two and say we've been waiting in an averagely filled restaurant for 20 minutes. Her response was some horribly rude excuse about speaking to her manager. Once again delicious food here, but the wait staff and front of the house management (or pure LACK thereof) certainly leaves room to be desired.
