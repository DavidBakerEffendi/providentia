I am so happy I read all these reviews and went to this place! I was craaaaving really good wings and had to find the best place around. Went with a couple of friends. This is why I would give this place four stars - it is really very small. Not many tables in the front and the rest of it is all bar area. We were able to get the last table available - but if we didnt - we wouldn't have been able to sit as the other tables were there longer than we were. If you want fries - do not pass up the fries with mozz and gravy. All six of us agreed it was probably the best gravy we've tasted on disco fries in a long time. As far as the wings - hands down best I've had in the area. They were crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside - perrrrrfection! I love hot food and I got medium buffalo and it was the perfect heat (mixed it with teriyaki - sounds weird but I used to do it as a kid and it was incredible!) Absolutely took care of my wing craving and will be back again - hopefully during happy hour and get the garlic wings.
