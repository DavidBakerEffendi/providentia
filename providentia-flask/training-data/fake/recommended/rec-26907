I first went here for Valentine's Day many years ago.  She's gone, but I still go to Bistro Les Amis regularly.  Very friendly service, I've never felt rushed.  A lot of good food but some of my favorites would be the duck over wild rice, the gnocchi, the salad with the warm goat cheese and best dessert by far is the blueberry crumble.  Lunch is also quite solid.  Nice spot, unpretentious spot in SoHo/W Village area.
