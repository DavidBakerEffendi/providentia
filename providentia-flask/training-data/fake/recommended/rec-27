This review is just for a brunch special I had at Memphis Taproom - waffles topped with peanut butter, bacon, bananas and maple syrup. I had this a while ago so I can only hope they still offer it, or maybe have added it to the permanent menu. I don't think I can accurately convey the experience in words, but it touched on every taste bud in one giant flavor explosion of sweet and salty. I found the combination of flavors pretty unique and though it looked like it might be overkill, it worked perfectly. Can't wait to go back and pray they are still offering this dish.
