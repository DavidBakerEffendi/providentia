What the heck's wrong with you!? You just used a flamethrower on my sushi!!!! *Bites into sushi* Oooh la la you just used a flamethrower on my sushi~ The October special is reallly good. I forgot if there was a name for it: Black Rice, Roasted Kabocha Squash, Avocado & Baby Arugula, Charred Carrot, Mint & Lemon Zest Topping (Charred LIVE). Topped with Roasted Harissa- Pumpkin Seed Pur√©e. Spicy Mang is pretty good too. It's like a little journey eating Spicy Mang. There you put a piece in your mouth. You're chewing chewing. There's the spicy veggies, avacado, cucumber, black rice, and all of a sudden in the pile of spiciness there's a little mango there to refresh you with a hint of sweetness. Voila now there's a spicy sweet sensation going on in your mouth.
