This review is biased, but I think we can all deal with that. I'm only giving this an average rating because I wasn't particularly turned on with the place at all during my (unfortunately brief) visit. The place is small, it's hard to read the menu (is it because the menu is all artsy and "original" or is it because it's just simply confusing?), and it seems like the type of place that's always crowded (yes, it was crowded when I visited). However, it seems like a hip place to be when you're drinking coffee. A medium is two bucks, and it's a pretty large medium. Throw in the soy milk at no extra charge and that's definitely a plus. There's local art on the walls, the entryway is covered in announcements for events, concerts, band websites, et cetera, which is better than nothing. Also seems like the food menu is pretty good, though the counter was completely full and the tables were pretty full too when I stopped in today (a Sunday) around noon. Maybe a visit on an off hour will be good so I can give this place a second chance? Oh, as Kristin M. said, the staff is great. They were friendly and kept on top of things despite the huge line and all the kids who couldn't keep their mouths closed when chomping down on their baguettes and omelets.
