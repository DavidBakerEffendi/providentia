The food was great!! They make this spicy square that is to die for..i ate over $30 in food why I was there vodka slice was awesome breadcrumb square had good flavor very hard to find pesto slice was so fresh and melted in your mouth..the rice balls are worst then a drug..lol will be back at least 3-4 times a week work not to far from them..prices are good to!! People are real friendly that work there.
