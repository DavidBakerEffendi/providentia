Pat's is another one of those places where you absolutely HAVE to stop by at when you're in the area...I love cheesesteaks and when I had the opportunity to be in philly and try an authentic philly cheesesteak, of course this was on the top of my list. Â  Also, having Geno's on my list and getting one of their cheesesteaks as well - I did a side by side of the two and really, I don't know if I can tell the difference because they both tasted great. . .can anybody tell me what makes them so different and if you were to do a blind taste test..would you really be able to tell which one is which?!?
