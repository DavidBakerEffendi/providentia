Delicious!!! Could not get any better! I loved every single bite of this stuff, and could literally eat it, every day-- for the rest of my life. The breaded chicken pizza was insane! almost like a chicken parmigiana, in pizza form. so light and airy and blasting with flavor! The white ricotta cheese pizza with broccoli also hit the spot, but I fell in love with the chicken so it didn't compare in my book. The cannoli was okay. I've had better cannoli in Brooklyn, but this one wasn't bad, it just wasn't insanely good. If you're in Times Square, you neeeeed to come to Patzeriz! Trust me, you'll regret not stopping by.
