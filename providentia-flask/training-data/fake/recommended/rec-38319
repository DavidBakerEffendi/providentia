It was a cold and rainy evening in Burlington, VT.  Hungry and chilled, we stopped in to Sweetwater for dinner.  High point of the day!  We started with Poutine, crispy fries slathered in melted cheese curds then absolutely covered in truffle gravy.  I immediately warmed.  It's like a northeast soul food that pleased me to the depths of my soul.  For dinner I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Another trendies choice.  Sweetwater is a great place for a slow and utterly enjoyable evening meal.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.
