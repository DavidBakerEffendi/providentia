I usually do not care for chain restaurants...corporate places...but I was pleasantly surprised to have a top notch dinner at this big but still cosy atmosphere restaurant.  I would definately go back.  I was here in 2007.  The place was packed so I opted to eat at the bar rather than wait...great service...easy parking...
