This is one of my favorite places in the East Village. The food and the drinks are very good, and they have one of the best happy hours in the city. The happy hour menu includes very reasonably priced food dishes and a couple of tasty margaritas. Beyond happy hour, they make the best Tortilla Soup and the Chile Relleno de Espinacas is one of the best Mexican entrees I've ever had. They use fresh ingredients in their food and their drinks, and the chef has obviously put a great deal of thought and care into his dishes and his drinks. Everything I've had here has been very good. I dine here two-three times per month and I plan on returning whenever I can. As an added bonus, the staff are professional and friendly, some of the nicest people working in a restaurant that I've encountered. I know this sounds like one of those fake reviews, but it is not. I genuinely enjoy this place and would miss it terribly if it was gone.
