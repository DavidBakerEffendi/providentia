I've only been here once for brunch, and I only had one thing, but it was awesome.  I went on a Saturday morning right when they opened at 11, and had the fried chicken and waffles eggs benedict.  I don't want to talk about how many calories were in this dish, but I do want to talk about the perfectly fried chicken, tasty waffle, silky poached egg, and the spicy creole hollandaise.  My party of three all agreed that it was amazing, and one of our favorite brunch dishes.
