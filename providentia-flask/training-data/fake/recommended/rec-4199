I think overall this place is pretty good, although the servers try to give off a "sassy" vibe even though you can tell they are pretty nice-maybe just stick to "nice." I do not recommend the cider, maybe the day I came someone had botched the batch but it had so much ginger it burned my throat. Â Comfy spot, good selections, I'd go back.
