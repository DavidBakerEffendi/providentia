Very good joint in Hartford. Not fancy, simple place where you don't feel rushed. Good selection of meat and the buffet is not bad: rice, salads,stews, Ox tail,... The beef ribs weren't cooked and was chewy the 1st time I had it, but was better the 2nd time. Don't be turn off by the way this restaurant charges. (they charge by the plate weight). Actually it is very reasonable! we were 3 good eaters, each one had of us, had 3 big full plates and soft drinks for only $86. I'll definitely go back to Brazil Grill on my next trip to Hartford Area.
