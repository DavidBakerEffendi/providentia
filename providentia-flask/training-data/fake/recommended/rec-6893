This place gets major props for the funny bartenders who made our night extra fun.  I wish they would offer the ricotta cheese dish with just the cheese - I'm a much bigger fan of the free bread offered than the bread that came with the cheese.  I think I'm going through a major carb phase because the past few supposedly great restaurants I've been to, I found myself enjoying the bread way more than the dishes I'm paying for. I like the kale salad a lot, despite it being doused in way too much cheese, and my pasta - the chitarra with red shrimp was pretty good.  They definitely skimped on the shrimp though, which is kind of embarrassing I think for such a nice establishment. The rabbit was too lightly seasoned and not very exciting. Great bathrooms - large, with a sitting area and three stalls. I can't say how much I appreciate restaurants that actually take care to make sure all their facilities are comfortably pleasant for their customers.
