The Halal Cart, or as I was introduced to it, Platters, is a New York City right of passage. Newcomers to the city cannot say that they've been properly baptized until they've stood in line, wasted, at 4AM for the lamb on rice or pita sandwiches.   Like most masterpieces, it's simplicity is the crux.  Lamb, chicken, or beef, rice, and lettuce.  Add white/hot sauce and you are good to go. Beware of their HOT SAUCE.  It should be a controlled substance.  I'd say only Mamoun's hot sauce rivals this hell in a bottle.
