We had the chef's 4 course for dinner here this past Friday.  The food was exceptional, the flavors were spot on, and the service was excellent (our bag and purse each had their own individual "seats" instead of being relegated to the floor).  Cocktails were very good as well.  We particularly enjoyed the pace and portions of the dining experience.  The only downside is that the atmosphere was a little stuffy/pretentious, and the crowd was mixed -- so that leant itself to a bit of a bizarre ambience all told.
