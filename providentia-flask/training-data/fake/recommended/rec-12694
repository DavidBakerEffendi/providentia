Chicken and waffles just makes sense in my head. I'm always excited to order at a restaurant, and almost always disappointed. Clinton St. Baking company has made all of my chicken and waffle dreams come true. The fried chicken was moist and soft- and the waffle was perfect. There were so many delicious tastes in this meal. I'd come back once a week if I could just to have this meal. Finally, don't miss the orange juice- it's amazing. Pro tip: head to the coffee shop across the street while you're waiting for a table- the guys in there are super nice and you can sit at the window and watch the city go by.
