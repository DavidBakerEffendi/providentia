I have to lower my ratings. A couple days ago, I called in an order of chicken cheddar bacon wrap to be picked up and went in 30 mins later just to find out that the food is not ready, over the phone they had said 15 mins. I was tired and didn't want to argue, so I waited another 10 mins. Then, I started to suspect that my food is actually in the bag that has been sitting on the counter all along, the girl just didn't realize it (I order here very often so I know what should be inside the sheer bag) I asked the girl if she's sure the bag sitting over there isn't mine. She said just give the kitchen a minute she will check on it, then GET THIS, she waited until there were a couple of ppl standing between my line of vision and the bag, to take the bag off the counter and gave it to me. She apologized for the kitchen taking long. My food was cold, and the fries were soggy. I saw no one came out from the kitchen. There's no way the kitchen JUST grilled it. Â  I think I'm being gentle giving them 2 stars.
