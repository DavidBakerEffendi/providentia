WOW!  Tried this place last night.  GREAT addition to the neighborhood, especially when you're looking for something besides fancy Italian and take-out Chinese.  Authentic Japanese preparation (the scent of the sushi rice as you walk in is a key indicator, along with the pristine cleanliness) of incredibly fresh sushi.  Service was super friendly and welcoming! Will be making this a regular stop.
