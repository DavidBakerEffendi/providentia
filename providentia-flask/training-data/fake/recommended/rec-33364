Decided to go to Brunch because I had poached eggs craving on a Saturday morning. Chose Olea because I was going to be in the Fort Green area the rest of the afternoon, and it had good ratings. ... did I have poached eggs? No. but it was a million times better than whatever poached eggs my imagination was craving for! we ordered the green eggs with lamb and the salmon with goat cheese, and at the first bite I knew I had just made the best decision of my entire week :-D Â  i am not a fan of mimosa, unless its really good mimosa. i had the mango mimosa and it also exceeded my expectations. so yeahh, it's delicious!
