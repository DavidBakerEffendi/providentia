One of my all-time favorite places in Park Slope, Juventino (named after the owner/chef) has an all-day lunch/brunch menu which has afforded me the majority of my meals there, although I have managed a few dinners. The daytime menu is divided into breakfast-y items and more lunch-y fare, all of it creative, locavore cuisine with a Mexican bent to some of the dishes. Favorite dishes include the luscious French omelette, served with a couple of slices of Scratchbread toast and greens, the egg sandwich on brioche, the pork belly with scalloped potatoes, and the lengua y papas, which uses grass fed beef tongue. French press coffee is well-prepared and delicious with a choice of Stumptown or Intelligentsia, and the home-made juices are excellent as well.
