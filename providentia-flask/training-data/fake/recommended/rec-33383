Yummy Cuban food at diner prices! You can get two eggs with yucca fries and toast for six bucks. They have corn empanadas and arepas, making Coppelia a great choice for the gluten free set. I also can't wait to try the blue cornmeal pancakes. My arepa was crispy on the outside, and came as two mini sandwiches, which is different from the pocket style at Caracas. The chicken was a bit too saucy for me, so I wish they had a few different arepa options. I checked in on my phone and got a free iced tea! This is not an area with a lot of affordable but good options. Definitely a new favorite in the neighborhood. And the waiters' shirts say: Winning 24/7. Indeed.
