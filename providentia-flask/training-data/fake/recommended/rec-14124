I normally shy away from Williamsburg for Sunday brunch, but based on a tip "no hipsters each brunch before noon" we arrived at Rye at 11 am for brunchies. Bottom line: YUM. We started with their homemade "donuts" (more like donut holes). Crispy on the outside, tender and spicy on the inside, I wish we'd saved these for dessert. They were served with a side of whip cream, which I thought didn't add anything, but... *shrug*. We also had a duck rillette. Kind of a duck pate, and some "sourdough." I say "sourdough" because sorry, as much as we might try, proper sourdough cannot be made outside of San Francisco. But the rillette was quite tasty as well. For my entree, I tried the Meatloaf Sandwich I'd heard so many raves about. And it was worth it. A combination of duck, veal, and beef, it was rich and delicious. I am STILL FULL 8 hours later it was so good. One thing: too much bread. The meatloaf PLUS the giant roll is too much. It would be excellent as an open-face sandwich or heck, ALONE on a plate, with some fried onions on top. It is seriously solid enough to stand alone. While some have complained about the service, ours was great. The waitress was attentive, and our water and coffee were constantly being topped off. The decor is very turn of the century (whether it's real or just made to look that way I'm not sure...) with tin ceilings, old wood floors, old silver used everywhere (mismatched cutlery, old coffee urns, and the check plate). All in all we were very pleased with our brunch. We lingered till around 12:30 pm, when all the hipsters started trickling in.
