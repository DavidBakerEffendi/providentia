Great comfort food with a little bit more flare than how your grandma made it, excellent, fast service, comfy atmosphere, strong drinks, great location... What more could you ask for? We had the pierogies for an appetizer (growing up in my big Polish family, I can tell you these are some real deal pierogies, not your Mrs.T variety!), the chicken and waffles (waffles were slightly sweet and nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, chicken was perfectly crispy and not greasy), the potato pancakes (love the applesauce!) and the buttered peas. I could have done without the chicken gravy and would have preferred to have some honey, and the buttered peas were a little too close to frozen peas out of a bag for me, but these are minor complaints in an overall fantastic, delicious meal. Oh and for dessert I highly recommend the key lime pie with caramel sauce and passion fruit salsa. You won't be disappointed! And in case you were wondering, they have a Bellini of the day (served all day!), a margarita of the day and a sangria of the day on top of a nice speciality cocktail, local brew and wine list. Do yourself a favor and come here- you won't be disappointed!
