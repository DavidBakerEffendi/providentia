I live near Sabrina's and have had the food many times.  The food is a 5/5 stars, always.  But, today, Sabrina's is a 5/5 for customer service.  As a new mother, it is hard to find too many places that accomodate strollers.  My son is not quite able to hold his body up yet to sit in a high chair, so, alas, I must use the stroller.  The hostess  did everything in her power to find us a comfortable place for myself, my friend and our two strollers carrying our infant sons.  Not once did she or any other staff member make us feel that we were a nuisance, but went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcome and were comfortable.  Sabrina's is tight quarters, but they proved that they will do their best to accomodate.
