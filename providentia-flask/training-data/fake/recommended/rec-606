Sunday brunch at this place is legit. I had the Ham Benedict which comes with a side of mashed potatoes (quite honestly the BEST mashed potatoes I've had in my life). The decor was really cute however the service could have been better. My friend's and I waited really long to have our orders taken..otherwise I would've given this spot 5 stars.
