Absolutely fantastic food! The place is a little hard to get to if you don't live in the neighborhood, but everything on the menu looked worth ordering; I'll definitely be back soon to try more! I had the Scotch Egg and Meatloaf Sandwich, both of which were unique and delicious.  The sandwich is huge; you could definitely get one appetizer and one sandwich to share with a girlfriend.  Prices were reasonable (on the high side of reasonable). The food on other tables looked equally delicious, and the service was as-expected (normal speed and niceness).  Great drink menu, cool ambiance.  The food menu is not huge, and is pretty protein-centric (lots of meat and eggs).   My only real complaint is the silverware - it was old fashioned silver, and every time I took a bite I could taste the metal flavor on my tongue.  I found myself taking awkward bites to try to avoid having the metal touch my tongue.  But, my friend didn't have the same problem, so maybe it was just that fork or just me.
