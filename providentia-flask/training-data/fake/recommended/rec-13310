So, for the first view days after our arrival at our Clinton Street apartment, my sister and I (well maybe just me) thought that all the people standing in line in on the opposite side of the street were waiting for a bus. Or a cab. Or something. Turns out the line was for Clinton St Baking Co, and when we finally made it in there, I know why. A little buzzed and thus totally ravenous after attending our first baseball game, we demolished in the most unladylike fashion -sincere apologies to anyone who was in our vicinity - about 6 peanut butter brownies, white peach bellinis, and a shared sugar bacon burger before we undid our jean buttons and rolled home approximately 20kgs heavier, but so very, very happy.
