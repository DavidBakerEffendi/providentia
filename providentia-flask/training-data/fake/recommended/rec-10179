This is the 3rd Pio Pio restaurant that I have visited, and out of the 3, this one is the best only because there is so much space. This Pio Pio is bigger than the one on Amsterdam and MUCH MUCH bigger than the one on East 34th. Not only is this Pio Pio bigger, but the decor is more modern and stylish than the other 2 franchises. Â The other ones, especially the 34th street one, attempt to give the ambiance of restaurants that you may find in Mexico or any other Latin American country. If you like that kind of atmosphere, then go for those other restaurants. The problem with the other two, though, is that they are too small. In other words, if you are bringing a large party, don't be surprised if you end up having cramped seating arrangements or you have to wait a bit for a table. On the other hand, THIS Pio Pio location is MUCH spacier with plenty of room for large parties. Besides the differences in space and decor, all 3 Pio pious offer much of the same foods-the chicken, the tasty green sauce, and let's not forget the sangria :) [The 34th street location offers less food because it is a very small franchise, though] As I had mentioned in the first paragraph, if you have a large group of people with you, Pio Pio 8 is your best bet in terms of space. Plenty of tables large and small. The bar area is expansive. The ONLY thing that I disliked about this Pio Pio was that it was KIND of hard to find the restroom. I went to the back and passed by the doors to the bathrooms because they are the same colors as the surrounding walls, so when someone opens one of the doors, it looks like someone is coming out of a wall instead of an actual room. But I digress. All and all, this particular restaurant is definitely worth visiting :)
