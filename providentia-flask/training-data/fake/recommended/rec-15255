Was super excited to get this exclusive invite to the famous Rao's.  There are so many reviews that you can read that will let you know there is no menu,  they do not take reservations and plan to leave by rolling out!  I will purely grade the food.  I do not like seafood salad in general, but must admit it was mighty fresh and tasty.  The baked clams had this amazing crust on top that was memorable.  The fried mozerella was just okay, wish they served more sauce with it, or offered more. The pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe was incredible.  I mean capital Terriffic, a must have.  The pene and meatballs were okay.  The meatballs were not my preference of consistency, very very fine-the only way I could compare the consistency is to matzah.  THE PORK. Oh, sweet lord, the Pork with sweet peppers was spectacular...over the moon spectacular.  We also got the lemon chicken which was actually kind of dry:( although the skin was crisp and delicious.  Got the asparagus which were heavy in garlic, and nothing special.  The dessert was several selections of ice creams, and really cool flavors but I am a sucker for cheesecake which was a ten.  I mean melt in your mouth, totally delectable, never forget the moment we met, TEN!  Coffee was strong and pretty awesome.  I felt the experience was great, the service was good, the food was delicious.
