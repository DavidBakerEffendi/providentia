Mmm.... while this place is on the pricey side ($230 with tip for 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, 5 alcoholic beverages and 3 non alcoholic beverages) - the food is so delicious!! Blue cheese ravioli... pork belly....local cheese plate....sriracha calamari....all prepared perfectly and plated beautifully. For a fancy dinner, I would definitely recommend this place. Beyond tasty and the service was great too.
