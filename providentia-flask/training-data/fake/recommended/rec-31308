Went on a lunch date and my first impression was how cool the decor looked. When we actually sat down to order, I felt like the prices were a bit steep for Chinese food. Even though they brought the food out very quickly, I still wasn't all that impressed. The food was good but it wasn't anything special. I got the shrimp Thai basil and my date had drunken noodles with chicken. Our bill was $30 but I'm sure that this place is no better than my local china wok where I can buy way more for the same price! Staff is friendly and the service was good.
