Yum! One of the better meals I've had in a while. I had dinner tonight at Extra Virgin with five girlfriends and everyone loved what they got. I usually try to order something more exciting than chicken when I go out, because I figure that is easy enough to make at home - but I made an exception for the mushroom crusted virgin chicken on sweet pea risotto and it was definitely worth it. Highly recommended! We were too full for dessert, but the menu looked great too . . .
