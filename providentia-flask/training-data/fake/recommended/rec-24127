Took my boyfriend there for his birthday Â because he loves indian food and this place did not disappiont. Nice ambiance and food was great. The butter chicken very tender and the sauce is so silky. The peanut butter cake is a rich and just melt in your mouth. Try the spicy kakori kabob!! Can't wait to go back.
