The real draw to this wine bar is the nice outdoor seating area on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.  The restaurant is situated in the middle of a quiet block on 52nd St between 10th and 11th Ave and it was really nice to sit outside on a nice evening.  We got there at 6:45 on a Friday evening and most outside tables were full but still a few available. We tried a variety of appetizers and a couple of main courses and thought the appetizers were tastier than the mains.  Of course, there's a large selection of wines by the glass and bottle.  One thing to watch for is when we naively accepted the waitresses' recommendations for a glass of red wine and it turned out to be an eyepopping $17/glass.  Yowza!
