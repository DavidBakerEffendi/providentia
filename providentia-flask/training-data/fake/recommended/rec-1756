Recent visit for Fujianese noodle soup was a better experience for one waitress was attained who speaks minimal Cantonese backed by minimal English oral skills.  The noodle soup was filling of gargantuan bowls for my party of two which foots the bill totaling $12.00.  It were not greasy nor heavily concentrated to spike one's cholesterol level.  Tables are filthy but it is a hole in the wall with the door heavily inscribes all profanity writings by permanent markers and stickers mirroring a dive bar. Service is still mediocre and it appears majority patrons are non-Asian for the non-Asian's so-called "must-go-to" dining spot.  I prefer Cantonese cuisine.
