Went there with my gf last week; I dropped $80 plus tip for 2 tiny entrees and 1 main dish. It's a nice restaurant, only it's it can't call itself a Lebanease restaurant at all!! It doesn't represent Middle Eastern food. Plus it's waaaay overpriced for it's portion sizes. Food doesn't taste bad though. So if you don't mind spending too much for little food but nice atmosphere then yeah sure....otherwise, u're better off going to the Turkish restaurant called Ali Baba!
