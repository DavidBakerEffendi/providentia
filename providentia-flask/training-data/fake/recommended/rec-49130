Busy and Noisy. They don't update their menu here on yelp so forget everything you see. The waiter was surly, not engaging at all and almost rude. He didn't pay attention to what he was doing gave the wrong plates to the wrong people.   The food was a mixed bag.  I had an interesting fish that seemed to be fried in the same oil as they fried the chicken in, for it tasted like fried chicken which was the special that night. The salad was interesting.  The sweet corn spaghetti  was very good, the corn was fresh and the pasta was al dente.  My partner had the pork crips which was a pork shank fried,( I guess they like fried foods) and his arugula salad was quite good. We had two very small and expensive cocktails but this is New York and that is to be expected. We also had cream of spinach which seemed like spinach and cream, no other spices not even salt or pepper, the most boring creamed spinach I have ever tasted. Look the small star rating is because of the service and the bad food. We stopped here because the sign outside said that someone on yelp said it was the best dinner he had ever had, not so for us. I have had far better prepared food for far less prices even in New York!
