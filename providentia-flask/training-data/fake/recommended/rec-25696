These are some of the best dogs I've ever had.  The buns are perfect and the dog snaps when you bite into it.  Because of that you can't go wrong with any of the selections on the menu.  The windy city is a classic Chicago dog and is done to perfection.  I also enjoy the Saigon fusion, which is a play on banh mi.  The big kahuna sounds out there, but it works.  The Cincinnati skyline (a coney) is flawless. Go with a few a friends and try out a bunch of the dogs.
