I work around the area and my colleagues mentioned this restaurant had good food and was very inexpensive for a decent amount of food. So I decided to stop by and check it out for myself.... Appearance wise it is very elegant and everything from tables, chairs and cups are in tact although I'm not sure why the hostess is placed in the outside area where it is freezing cold where she was literally wearing a coat (that is torture! Especially in New York winter weather) I originally placed my order for take out because I was on my lunch and I planned to take it back to my job and eat it there boy was that a mistake! I only ordered a small appetizer (salchipapa) because I never have a huge appetite and because I thought it would be easy to cook and get out quickly the hostess reassured I would get my food quickly because it was so small but that was untrue because it took me 25 mins to get my food and at that point I just asked for it to be considered a stay in because I already wasted half of my lunch by just waiting. So what did I learn here? Umm, to call in advance for pick up or take out! Overall the food was good but then again it's just French fries and small bits of hotdogs. The bar area is pretty decent with many options to drink.
