I like this place so much that I actually gave my real e-mail to their e-mail distribution list. It's that serious. Whiskey, bourbon, and rye are all new to me, and I'm trying to drink more of it and develop my palette. This is definitely a great place to start. With over 150 American whiskeys, you can ask the bartender where to begin! In addition to the tasty poison, they have a lovely brunch, which I'm a huge fan of. I recommend the blueberry pancakes with sage/pork sausage - divine. I also tried the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit but paired with the potato cake I found it too heavy and a bit difficult to finish in one sitting. Overall, great place to catch up with friends, or chill. I highly recommend if you're in the area.
