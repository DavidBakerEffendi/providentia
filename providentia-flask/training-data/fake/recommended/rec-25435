As an overall restaurant I would say it is okay.  They do some things very well, service is a hit or miss thing, but the sad part is that their BBQ is just average (too dry and bland). A solid option, but without great BBQ I just find it average.  I am from Texas and have had BBQ all over, so I have a pretty high bar, so while others may really like their BBQ it just does not wow me.
