First the positive: the food here was great. Tapas truly one notch about the standard. But the negative: the place is a chaotic mess. The space is narrow, with chairs always getting bumped. The waiter spilled two glasses of wine on our table. I don't blame him -- he was very apologetic -- because the space is too constricted. They kept on bringing us food we didn't order (good?) and forgetting stuff we did order. The hosts and waiters are sweet, so it's really about how this restaurant is organized.
