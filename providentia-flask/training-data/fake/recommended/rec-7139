Ok, I just have to say I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the staff here was incredibly snotty... and although you may think I'm one of those Yelp complainers, I am rarely bothered by the usual restaurant faux pas. REALLY. Anyways, we had a 7pm reservation on a Wednesday, we were on time & upon arrival they told us we needed to be out of there by 9pm for another reservation coming. Um, hi, how about a WELCOME, nice to have ya? I'm not even a Southerner, people, but come on, have some more hospitality than that. We sat and had a few drinks.. I had a really interesting beet juice cocktail with jalapeno tequila, then switched to a less intense mezcal cocktail. We ordered the beet salad & the butter clams, which were both fantastic. The beets were yellow & red and tasted very fresh while the butter clams came in a ramekin warm with a buttery broth and soaking with fluffy gnocchi. A nice crostini came along with it to sop up the broth. We shared our entrees - the arctic char & the hanger steak with a side of eggplant ratatouille. Both were fantastic but I honestly can't remember details b/c by then I was supporting a nice buzz. At this point, they were already trying to take our plates from under us and I had to tell the waitstaff twice that we we not finished yet. It was 8:30 pm at this point. So annoying. For dessert, we shared the honeycrisp apple tarte tatin. The meal didn't last until 9pm so thankfully we didn't overstay our welcome for whoever had that important 9pm reservation.. The horror!
