Note: this review is on the Bo Ssam only. Eight of us got together to tackle a Bo Ssam - a pre-ordered, $180 delicacy that had been a much discussed topic among us over the preceding few weeks. I, who rarely ate pork, was the most reluctant to try...but looking back, I think I was just scared of the idea of eating a PIG BUTT. FOOD: * The meal was incredibly appetizing. One by one, came out four different sauces (including kimchi puree and scallion sauce), sea salt, a dozen raw oysters, a bowl of lettuce, and finally - an enormous piece of pork. The meat was crusty on the outside (and a little too salty), but warm and juicy inside. The whole thing was well flavored. Wrapped in lettuce, along with dabs of sweet sauce, kimchi and scallion sauce (which tasted like avocado), it was entirely delectable. * Go easy on the kimchi puree and the other sauces, as they are overly salty and can dominate the taste... * Excellent fresh oysters! * Unfortunately, they do not serve hot drinks. Therefore, no hot tea. This was painful, at least for me, who by rule drink hot tea with every single meal. AMBIANCE: Very nice, with dark wood and minimal decor. Narrow space, but not too cramped. SERVICE: Questionable... There were several moments when we exchanged puzzled glances with each other. SUM: What an experience! We'd love to try the other dishes next time.
