I've been to Beco a handful of times because of the food and keep coming because of the food, but almost every time the service is sub par. I'm not sure if the waitresses are new or if they just don't care, but it normally takes around 15 minutes just for the waitress to come take your order, and then another 15 minutes just to bring back the drinks. So I'll keep coming back for the food, but unfortunately getting reminded every time about the bad service.
