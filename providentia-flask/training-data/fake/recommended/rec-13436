We got a gift certificate from groupon, living social, something i forget....it offered us a tasting of appetizers and various wine pairings. The duck banh mi was excellent - doesn't taste like the traditional banh mi but still well balanced, good bread, and nice meat inside it. Got the salt cod croquettes - warm, flavorful and crispy. Beet salad was surprisingly good - didn't recognize half the things in it but my bf liked it even though he isn't a fan of sweet and savory mixed together. The wine that they paired with the meal was fine - nothing stellar. My bf liked the wine more since some of them were a little spicy and bold. Service was also good. She took the time to tell us about the menu, certain food items and immediately changed the beef option to duck banh mi since my bf doesn't eat beef. Overall, an excellent meal!!! Downfalls? Location is far far west (but doesn't hurt me too much because I live at 43rd and 10th) and the prices are preeeetttyyyy prettyyyy steep without the certificate for the amount of food.
