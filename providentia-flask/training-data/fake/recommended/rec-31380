I must say our family and friends go to Brazi's often and have never had the issues Langdon complains about. My husband goes once a month with friends for a ~get together~ and checking with him, he has never had the tip added to the check. The food is consistantly delicious which is why we return all the time. I have never had pizza there and never will. Although, Brazi's serves pizza I have seldom seen people eat it in the dining area. I know they do a lot of pizza take out. Actually, I can't say if it is on par with Sally's as there are too many pizza places at least as good if not better than Sally's. I don't go to Sally's because it too much of a hassel with too many people and lack of parking which Brazi's has in abundance. Some dishes are fav's and some are not quite as good as gram's but better than other restaurants which has us returning. I has something for everyone when in a larger party say of 6-8 people..even the fussy people find something. Â I understand this sounds like a luke warm review but I get tired of having to justify my opinion of a place. It is clean, friendly, has good service and good food at a reasonable price. They never try to push you out and turn the table over. There is not much more a person could want. We like it and will continue to return to Brazi's. I am sure Langdon did post the photo of the receipt considering he seems observant and right to the point however, I can not find it in the photo section. Frankly, I don't mind the 20% added but I fully understand another point of view.
