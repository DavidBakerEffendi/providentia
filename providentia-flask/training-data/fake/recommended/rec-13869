Very interesting on the rating this place gets... but it's just a late night cheap pre Â made food place.. so I guess it works for some people. It's a great place to hang out, buy beer and have them open it for you to drink there. Hot or cold food pre made for you to grab and eat. Definitely a late night drunk stop food or more drinks type of place. Can't say it's top notch Korean food, but it's decent enough if you've been drinking or just want a grab and go type deal.
