Went here based on fellow Yelpers and was not dissapointed. We arrived for late breakfast on monday, so didn't have to wait for a table. The service was great and the food fabulous. My friend ordered this huge french toast tower that had some sweet cream cheese filling with bananas and syrup. It was fabulous. I read that the lines here can be really long on the weekends, so if busy, spend some time wandering the Italian market.
