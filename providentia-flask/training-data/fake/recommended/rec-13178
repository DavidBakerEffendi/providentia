There are just so many non authentic Japanese restaurants in NY (I am Japanese)  but I LOVE this place.  Service is good, their hand-made soba is really good. Tempura is cooked great too. very light:) I am impressed that they even serve Sobayu. P.S. Their broth is tokyo version of borth, not Osaka/Kyoto. So it's a little too salty for people from Osaka/Kyoto area.
