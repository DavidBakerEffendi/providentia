Had an early dinner here with 2 of my gfs and I have to say, it didn't live up to my expectations. I liked the comfortable and casual vibe, and the food was decent, but it just lacked punch. And in a neighborhood with so many great choices, this would just not stand out in my memory. We had the duck meatballs, lobster tagliatelle, hangar steak and cod. Plus a couple glasses of wine, espresso, sticky toffee pudding. While the duck meatballs were very good, i'm not sure I'd return just on their behalf.
