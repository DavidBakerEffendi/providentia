Overpriced and lackluster. Came here for Sunday lunch and they already ran out some of the items on their menu. It took awhile for things to get to our table and overall I just wasn't that impressed. If I'm going to be paying the prices that Casa Mono charges for tapas, I would expect a bigger wow factor.
