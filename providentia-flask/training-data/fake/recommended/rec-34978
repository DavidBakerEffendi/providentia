I have ordered a to go more than twice in the past month and the rates charged at the counter didn't match what the website says. Everytime i had to correct the guy giving out my order and yet it was more than what i saw on the menu. I ordered a green Â curry with tofu and was asked to pay $12 with tax against the menu price of $10. This happened both the times and no one offered to clarify my point. Please make sure you check your bill properly before paying.
