Being from California, I'm used to ridiculous amounts of opportunities to eat all sorts of Asian food, so Vermont is quite a bit more restrictive in options.  This place is very DIY and crowded.  The food was tasty BUT was disappointingly small in portion size.  I ordered the weekly bento box dinner, which happened to feature sukiyaki beef.  I couldn't fault the cooking or the seasoning, but it was MUCH more onions than beef.  Not cool!  It's the goal of my boyfriend and I to try all of the ethnic restaurants in our new hometown.  We're not impressed and aren't likely to return.  Oh well.  BTW, the new name of the eatery is "Sushido".
