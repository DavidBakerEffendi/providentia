The owner was nice enough to reach out and offer a free meal to make up for my previous experience. Definitely appreciated the effort. But then the delivery guy gets to the door. Rings the buzzer. I rush down from the 4th floor and he hands me my food. I say thanks and get ready to run back up the stairs. He then says "did you forget something". I said "what" and he said "never mind". After I ask him again, he says "did you forget the tip?" WOW! I usually leave a tip electronically when I order online. I never have cash. But since this was a replacement meal, I completely forgot. I just so happened to have a few dollars today so I offered to run up and get it but he chuckles and says he needs to leave. Afterwards, I realize just how fuckin awkward and rude that was. I didn't really need the attitude especially when a tip isn't required. Come on Gueros, your "customer service" just gets better and better :( I texted the owner and he said he would look into it. These employees are too ridiculous for me.
