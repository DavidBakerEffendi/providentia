I had just generally a really fail experience here today.  Will not be going back, ever if I can help it. I came in and ordered a sandwich.  It took 20 minutes for them to make.  I was hungry.  This was not a busy restaurant -- there were maybe 3 people there tops.  To the guy's credit, he did apologize that he stood and talked for 15 minutes instead of seeing to it that my sandwich was made.  Whatever.  The sandwich was kind of an odd temperature -- the bread and cheese were warm and toasted, but the veggies inside were still cold, just out of the fridge I guess. Later, I ordered an iced bancha tea.  It was very good, however, they have a $5 limit on using credit cards (which is fine), but I had only a 20 and got 17 dollars back in 1's.  Now I have a wad of cash that does not fit into my wallet.  Thanks. The water from the pitcher was kinda disgustingly room-temperature too.  Most places put a bit of ice in for this reason.  Should have purchased bottled water. At some point, they had me stand on my chair to reach up above their giant TV screen and push the play button for a DVD.  They claimed the remote was broken, but there was another chair, even closer to the DVD player, that was free to stand on.  Yet they suggested I do it? And finally, this takes the cake: the wi-fi did not work.  From what I understand this is a temporary situation.  However, not having wifi available at a cafe is pretty unacceptable these days.  I go there to get work done and nibble on something.  I am currently sitting in a different cafe a few blocks away with completely functioning wi-fi.  Is wi-fi really so hard?  They claimed it'd be back tomorrow.  Tomorrow is too late, and at this point I don't really trust them anyway. The iced tea also took way too long.  I know how long green tea takes to steep, it is not 5+ minutes. Oh and there was zero AC, which is fine because I am comfy in warm temperatures, but I can see that a lot of people would be uncomfortable there on a summer day.
