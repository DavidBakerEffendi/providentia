For those who know me know that Farmerbrown's is my go to place for fried chicken. HOWEVER, when in NY I can't help but to cheat on the mister and stop by the Redhead for their fried chicken! It is ridiculously delicious...even better than Farmerbrown's (but don't tell him I said that). The portion, though small, comes with 2 pieces of perfectly cooked chicken--light and crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, a healthy helping of spinach salad, and really yummy cornbread. FYI: Do not order the peanut brittle - apparently it doesn't come with the brittle. It's just peanuts and bacon bits. PS: Thank you Mr. Bartender who hooked us up with fried chicken after 10pm when the kitchen was already closed!
