Absolutely LOVE this place! Stopped in for a bottle of wine mid-week around 7pm. They have happy hour from 5-7pm, $2 off all wine and beer, and when we decided to go with a bottle they were kind enough to take $8 off. Â Not only is the inside of the restaurant lovely but the backyard is one of the best I've seen; very intimate, loads of greenery, lit candles, wooden chairs and tables. The only real downsides: cash only and mosquitoes! We definitely got eaten up in the backyard but it was totally worth it to be there on a warm summer night with a delicious bottle of wine and live music drifting out from inside. Didn't get to try any of the food but would definitely consider going back for dinner. Highly recommend.
