Delicious ramen. Despite being a little pricey, you feel like you are sucked into a different dimension with the decor: ramen counter top, bushido knife beer handle, calligraphy, and various arts. Definitely worth trying if you haven't. Recommend the akamaru ramen as the shiromaru was more on the bland side.
