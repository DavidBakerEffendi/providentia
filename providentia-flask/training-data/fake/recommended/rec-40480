We've eaten here a number of times before. In the past year, I found the food not as good as it had once been.  We returned this evening to see if it was any better.  I was very pleased with what we found.  Dinner began with the salad bar.  The spring greens and romaine were fresh.  For our entrees, I had salmon in caper sauce and my wife had a Delmonico steak with shrimp.  Both were excellent.  The accompanying cauliflower was cooked gently and was perhaps some of the best I've ever had.  I ordered rice to accompany my salmon and it was perfectly cooked.  For dessert, we shared orange cake topped with vanilla ice cream which was served in a goblet.  The wait staff was right in describing this as a 'cremesicle' -- sweet, tasty, and satisfying.  Service was excellent.  Judging by the number of diners, this restaurant is an undiscovered treasure.
