On my second trip to New York I did not make the mistake again of not knowing where to get a good meal. My first trip here was anxiety filled when it came time to decide where I will spend my money that night. I came with a list from a friend who grew up in the city and this place did not let down. For an appetizer I had the Fritto Misto, a seafood combination plate deep friend. A refreshing change was the deep fried lemon and lime slices thrown into the dish. A clever way to add bite to a dish I thought. I went with my mother and her appetizer was a Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Salad, should have gone for that one! My main course was the Prosciutto wrapped Pork Tenderloin. I know, a lot of pork. But I am a pork lover. It was a bit saltier than I would have liked, but I attribute that to the prosciutto and not the seasoning. Overall, I rate it a 4 solely on the fact that they cut the pork loin before serving it to me, a no no in my book (keep those flavors in so they spill freshly onto my plate). Good, young atmosphere w/ full wine menu. Get there before 8 on a weekend.
