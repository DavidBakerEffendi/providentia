I wandered into this Zizi for lunch with a friend.  We ordered 7 items between us off the dinner menu and the lunch specific menu. This place is something of a little miracle.  Every item was not only delicious and quite expertly prepared but there was a complexity of flavor profiles and textures that rivals some of the best restaurants in which i've eaten, yet the prices are quite affordable and the atmosphere is homey and hip. There is a pan-Meditteranean vibe to the food, with the technique of a great Florentine restaurant and flavors of the the Middle East and Morocco.  Eat anything here but make sure you try the pumpkin.
