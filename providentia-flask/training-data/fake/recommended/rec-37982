I ordered lard nar it was alright but my wife order this seafood chrispy noodle and it was very salty. They exchanged it for us and gave us something new, they seemed to just add water. And now it had no taste, throw some garlic in there or something. Everything seems to be sauce from a bottle. It was over priced. I rather go to thai chef.
