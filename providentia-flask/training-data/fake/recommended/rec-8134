The Greek Salad is very fresh and a great choice to share as an appetizer or as an side. I've had the Mixed Grilled and Kefta Kabob. The Mixed Grill highlights all of Alyan's best meats. The Kefta Kabob is probably my favorite though. I enjoy the lamb probably more than the chicken items. The mint tea is also very refreshing on a hot day. And if you want to save a bit you can order a pitcher of tea!
