I went to Taquitoria this past Wed. and ordered 5 classic pork taquitos for $8. The taquitos were very fresh and the filling was delicious. Customer service was excellent. It seems the owner takes great pride in his product, which is always refreshing. I can see these taquitos being a huge hit for the Super Bowl. Not only are they tasty and easy to eat, but they're affordable. I will definitely be back to Taquitoria!
