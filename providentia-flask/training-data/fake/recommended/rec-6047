After 6 years out of NYC, I truly missed the amazing eating establishments.. "Pylos" being my favourite of the bunch I had to visit for dinner ASAP ...I have to tell you, the few things that I tried were delicious as ever if not better!!! The atmosphere was vibrant, the place along with it's delicious food and beautiful design is definitely in a league of its own. Whenever in New York, I will always visit "Pylos" for its great food and atmosphere.
