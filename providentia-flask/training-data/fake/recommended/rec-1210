A.Maz.Ing.  This place is a MUST go-to in Philadelphia.  The food is unbelievable and unique.  I feel a lot of Philadelphians are foodies and this place will still surprise you.  The BOGO on Sundays is the greatest thing.  Bring beer, bring friends and stuff yourself.  And if you can't finish they let you take it home.  Fabu!  Please go to Bufad you will not regret it!
