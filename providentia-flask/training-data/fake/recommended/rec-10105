Absolutely the WORST restaurant i've ever been to. We were seated right away on a Saturday night , so that should have been my red flag to run away. The meal was decent, a little pricey but ok. Halfway through our appetizers & prior to the Main course the bartender & customer get into a shouting match for about 30 minutes! Cursing each other, being loud & obnoxious. We tell the manager who replies with Bon apetit.... Never going back, if I wanted to eat with people acting like jerkoffs I would have went to a bar or a mall food court. Avoid at all costs.
