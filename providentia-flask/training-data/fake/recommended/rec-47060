Amazing. Mouth watering. The roast pork, sharp provlone, and greens was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. If youre lucky enough to get a seat at this place, add some of the horseradish thats on the counter. The flavors pair together wonderfully. Â Definitely worth the wait....the line goes fast!
