Food: 5 stars Atmosphere: 5 stars Service: 2 stars The food was very fresh and delicious.  Presentation was also excellent.  I got the Ceviche Camaron (YUM), Guacamole (DEF get this... the chips are also so good), and the Paella.  Everything was so fresh and soooo yummy. The atmosphere was also really nicely decorated and intimate... perfect for a date night. Lastly, the service we got that day might have been a one-off.  At the beginning, the waiter wasn't checking up on us and we had to wait maybe an extra 15-20 minutes before being able to order our food.  Also, he was just grouchy and a little bit rude to us at the start of the evening.  Example: my husband asked what ingredients were in one of the dishes and the waiter gave a rude answer along the lines of "it says on it on the menu"... but we didn't recognize one of the Spanish words so we were just trying to figure out if it was meat or not lol.  Anyway, he got happier by the end of the evening (maybe his issue was solved?), and thus he became nicer to us. This could easily be a 5-star place if the service was consistently nice.  It's a bit pricey but the food is amazing, so definitely save this spot for a nice date night.
