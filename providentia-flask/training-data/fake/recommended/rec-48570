This is my favorite place in the world. When I lived in Philly, I was literally here every single day. The regulars are a great bunch of people and the staff is amazing. I feel very lucky to count some of the staff as very good friends. Their beer selection is great! They always have some great stuff on tap! The food is surprisingly good! Taco Tuesday and Pierogi Wednesday! Used to spend hours in here drinking PBR pounders and shots of Jager and hanging out with the locals and people that came into town for a show. The jukebox is great. Some awesome punk and rock and roll. Upstairs is awesome. I love the skateboards hanging on the ceiling and I love all of the art. Sometimes they have a DJ up here and it can get pretty crazy. I really miss this place since I moved back to Jersey City. However, every time I go back to Philly, I make sure that I drop by Tattooed Mom!
