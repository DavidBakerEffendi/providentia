I love a good deviled egg.  It's a shame you don't see them that often - I guess they're kind of...retro?  So you can imagine my delight when I saw the deviled egg plate at Alta.  With white truffle.  With porcini.  I almost forgot to share it with my dining companions, it was that delicious.   The lamb meatballs were great, yellowtail sashimi was solid; some things on this menu, like the cucumber salad, you could easily make at home - others, like the gnocci, are nothing to rave about.  But the experience was warming and nicely paced, aided by the flow of some superb cocktails.  I happened to be with some friends, but this would make one sexy spot for a date.
