Pat's vs Geno's?! Keep reading to find out! You let me down, Philly, you let me down. I went with a friend and got half of a Pat's and half of a Ginos. I was so excited because i saw these places on the Travel Channel. Honestly, who's pockets did they need to fill with cash to even get on TV? Knew how to order, stepped up to the line to make my order. moved along the line, looked inside. saw them slapping some steak on the grill that had OBVIOUS freezer burn on it. Shame, -1. I had to get the fries on the other side, kinda weird id like to order all my food together. It came out. Bread was un-toasted (who doesn't prefer toasted bread). Had as much meat as a subway sandwich and was soaked with cheese. Nothing special. Who wins?!?!, Honestly, neither. They were both the same sandwich i swear both owners have some sort of collaboration with each other. If i had a gun to my head to pick one....Sorry mom and dad love you its been a good run. When i can make a product that is better then yours game over.
