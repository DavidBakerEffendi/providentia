It was an invitation from the guy who lived in the Lebanon. We came here like 11 people. Table was huge and round. I'v never tried such a good Tubule, Hummus and Eggplants before. Probably, the best middle east cousin in the city. I didn't try a meat, becouse I'm vegan, but guys really liked it. Aniseed liquor Arak was very good! You mix it with water, shake it a little bit and toss off this heating milky-white drink. Must to go!
