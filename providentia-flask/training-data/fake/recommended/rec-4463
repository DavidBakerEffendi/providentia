My husband and I have been here twice now for dinner and had excellent meals both times. Our favorite dish so far was the pork chop, which came with an amazing home style fried rice, stewed egg, and pickled cabbage-very close to a complete meal and very much what you'd expect to find in Taiwan!  It was delicious. We have also had the soup dumplings (which go by some other name in the menu), the Gua Bao pork buns, the Zhajiang main noodles, and double cooked string beans-all very good. The prices here are a little high, but the food is pretty authentic Taiwanese style and has soul. We plan to go back and try a bunch of other dishes. The way they have named some of their dishes is a little confusing (the traditional  3 cup wine chicken dish is called "three cup chicken casserole-Taiwanese coq au Vin"?) If you know what you are looking for, just ask. The owner was around when we were there the 2nd time. There is a Chinese menu in addition to an English menu, so you can be sure that all the traditional faves are available one way or another. Glad to have Taiwanese style as an option downtown.
