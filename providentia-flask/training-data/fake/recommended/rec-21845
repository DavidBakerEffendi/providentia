Get Fresh was definitely one of the highlights from visiting and staying in Brooklyn. Chiawen and I came here for brunch on Laura's recommendation and it was just delicious. I had the pork belly with scalloped potatoes, truffle cream and yuzu marmalade ($14), and also ate half of Laura's open-faced BLT sandwich with berkshire slab bacon, lollo rosso lettuce, oven dried tomatoes, and chipotle mayo ($14). The bacon wasn't your typical piece of Denny's bacon...it was slab bacon, so thicker and meatier. Kind of reminiscent of the pork belly I got...SO GOOD. I would totally want to come back here, although there are a ton of other places to try in Brooklyn / Manhattan. Note: there's also a superhero supply store next door, but it was closed when we went (Saturday noon).
