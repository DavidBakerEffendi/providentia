I was really disappointed by my meal last evening at Totto Ramen. My husband got the chicken ramen (which he thought was just ok) and I got the Spicy Ramen. The broth is tasty, but just WAY too oily for my liking. I know Ramen is a high fat item, so I'm not looking for diet food, but there was just way too much oil and fat in the bowl. By the end I was starting to feel nauseated. I will say that the pork was well cooked and the noodles were awesome. Unfortunately, I woke up at 2 am and started throwing up.  My husband was also stomach sick this morning (more minor than mine, but he said he'd felt ill after eating it).  I think something in what we ate made us sick because we both feel ok now. Either way, we will not be returning, as merely thinking about the soup is bringing back the queasiness.
