This place is gorgeous, with its beautiful tree-like bar and artisanal light bulbs hanging in the front.  In fact, it was because I noticed the decor that I gave the place a try. The fried pork on the sampler plate was seriously the best piece of pork I have ever eaten in my life.  The salad was gigantic and fresh, and the plantains (long crispy savory ones and deep-fried sweet ones) were amazing.  The prices are more than reasonable for the quality of the food. The staff was extremely friendly (it is at least in part family-run), checking in all the time without being annoying.  When we were less than thrilled with one dessert they were still fine-tuning, they took it off the bill. I will definitely be making the trip back here again.  And again.
