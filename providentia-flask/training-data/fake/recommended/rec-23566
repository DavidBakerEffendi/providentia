This place is so cute and tiny!! Went with a friend for a quick breakfast. I had coffee to sip while deciding what to eat (it was strong but not burnt-just right). It offers a small menu and has a focus on quick food to warm you up and keep going, without being a place with a large dining room. We had no problem finding seats as we appeared to have come at a slow time. We both ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on english muffin. I am incredibly selective about the way my eggs are done and this was fine. The eggs are local eggs which is always a great thing! I was also pleased to discover that cheddar implies white cheddar in vermont (yay!! can this concept come to nyc please!). All in all, a good place to grab something quick.
