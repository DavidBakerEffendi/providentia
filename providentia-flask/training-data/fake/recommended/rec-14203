After waiting in line and smelling grilled meat for 30 minutes, we finally got to order from the famed Halal Cart.  My friend and I ordered the lamb and rice platter, which was in my hands immediately after exchanging $6.  It was plenty for the 2 of us; however, we encountered one tiny glitch.  The Hot Hot sauce is.....HOT.  I usually like hot sauce and so I dove right in and was enjoying getting warmed up from the cold wait.  Then the spice HIT me.  My mouth was on FIRE.  Fortunately, we had also added the ranch sauce which helped cool the burn and tasted fantastic with the flavorful lamb chunks and lettuce. WARNING: Hot sauce is HOT sauce.  Use sparingly - if you dare.
