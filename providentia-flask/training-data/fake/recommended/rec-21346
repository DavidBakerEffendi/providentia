Stale unseasoned ( nothing at all! ) boiled and reheated, stringy chicken, and big hunks of boiled peppers in the so called fajitas...ugh 'Salsa's' were nothing but hot chiles in vinegar... Service was one lonely waitress who was more interested in flirting with the barback than serving tables... Never again...
