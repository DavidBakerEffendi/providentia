I've been here a few times before, and it's always been pretty consistent. Great food, great service, great vibe. But I'm yelping it now especially because our bartender last night (really nice girl who finished around 2am on a Thursday) was so freaking nice and sweet that my friend I was with yelled at me saying "why have you never told me about this gem before?" I am ashamed that I don't go here more often especially since it really such a dope spot. The last time I went me and friend ordered the buffalo wings, stared at our empty plate, cried, and then ordered them again. You should be going there right now!
