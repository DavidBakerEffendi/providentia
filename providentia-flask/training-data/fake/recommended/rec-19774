Clam flavored chowder no clams. Service non existent save your time and money. Used to Â have $5.00 lunch with salad bar. Completely different. Lunch specials not at all special. All items were taken directly from the regular menu. Burgers looked good, but burgers can be found anywhere. Not worth the trip.
