I'm usually quick to brush off anything Upper East or Upper West (except the Park and museums), so when invited up to see a girlfriend's new apartment on W. 72nd St, I didn't expect we'd dine anywhere memorable after.  But I was wrong!  Riposo really left an impression.  The service wasn't great (it wasn't bad--just not remarkable) but the wine and food were REALLY good.  We had the goat cheese flatbread with sea salt, citrus and rosemary.  The crust was light and airy, yet still soft and full of flavor.  And the toppings were SO flavorful and unique.  All the flatbreads on the menu sounded delicious, including the featured one of the day which the server described to us as we sat down.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the flatbread pizza--it was huge!  I also had an arugula salad that was on special--arugula with mushrooms, sea salt, carmelized onions and the restaurant's citrus vinaigrette dressing... I'm still fantasizing about how perfectly composed this salad was.  A perfect balance of all the ingredients and a huge serving!  Can't believe I'm saying this but that's a meal I'd travel back to W. 72nd. St. for.
