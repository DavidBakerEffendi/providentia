I spent 4 years of college in Philadelphia and wish Frankford Hall was around during my time. It actually might have been, but wasnt a place I frequented.  Whatever the case, I'm glad I know about it now. Its just a really cool bar in Fishtown. Inside the bar are two separate areas. Inside (main bar/restaurant) and out (beer garden) with table games and picnic tables. Really fun establishment for friends. They have the giant beer glasses and serve German food late into the night. Hard not to have fun while you're there because the atmosphere is just lively. There wasnt a live band playing when i was there, but it wouldn't surprise me if they had bands come in every once in a while (they sure have the space).   I still go down to Philadelphia at least 2 or 3 times a year and I will make a lot more visits.
