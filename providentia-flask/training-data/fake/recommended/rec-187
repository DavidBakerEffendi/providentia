I'd say this is a nice place to buy some pizza and to chill :) I'd say compared to Gino's, Enzo's, or Michalinos Pizza, they're okay, a lot of people say the pizza taste great. But to be honest, if a restaurant can provide a good variety of pizzas, especially buffalo chicken or chicken, then it's an A for them.
