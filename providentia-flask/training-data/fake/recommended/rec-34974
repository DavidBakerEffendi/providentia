The food at Topaz is simply phenomenal!  Me and some co-workers have been coming here for a few years and it never disappoints.  The thai tacos and basil duck are my favorite but everything I've tried on the menu is great!  The restaurant owner (mama) gets only the finest ingredients and everything is fresh.  Be careful when trying the upper spectrum on heat here though, unlike many other "Thai" restaurants, they will truly make your dish Thai Hot if you ask for it!
