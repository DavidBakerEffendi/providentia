Had a great brunch at Cookshop with my boyfriend. Luckily we made a reservation because there was a little bit of a wait. I loved the natural light coming through large windows. I got the brisket egg potato hash and it was so delicious. And I topped my meal off with a warm chocolate chip muffin. Service was great, food was great. I would definitely go back.
