The boy wanted to take me out to a nice dinner for my birthday. I picked sushi. We went, we ate, we spent a fortune, and we were still hungry, so we hopped on the subway and headed to midtown. After half an hour in line, we split a combo platter. Doused the plate in white sauce and SPRINKLED it with hot sauce (my first time at this cart I covered every inch of my plate in hot sauce. I totally deserved the pain that followed, but come on, it's just evil for them to put the hot sauce out self-service style like that, right? I cried for like 20 minutes, both out of pain and remorse...) Best birthday dinner ever :)
