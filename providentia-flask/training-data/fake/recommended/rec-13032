Dollar Dumplings, not dollar dumpling.   Fast and easy service.  Just walk up, order and pay when you get the food.  What more can you ask for.  It was cheap and good, but I suggest eating it there rather than keeping it in the bag to eat on a bench in Central Park like we did.  It can get quite soggy depending on which one you purchased.
