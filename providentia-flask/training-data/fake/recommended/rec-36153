We had been shopping all day and forgot to eat dinner, so at 11pm, we hopped in a cab and asked him to take us somewhere nice for a nice snack before heading to bed.  This was it! Next time I'm in NYC I'll have to come here for dinner. Because it was so late we had the goat cheese appetizer as well as the beef tartar.  Yummy!   FYI-  I asked for the house cabernet and it wasn't that great, but everything else was.
