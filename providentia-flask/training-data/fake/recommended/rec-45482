Blue Point stuns me again with perfection! Now they accept reservations so it is super easy to go on Open Table's website to reserve a table. Freshest seafood with an ever-changing menu of fresh fish. Wait staff is professional, knowledgeable and great at service. This still is one of my favorite restaurants and i can always find something new, different and unique to try. Grilled Portuguese Octopus was grilled perfectly with just a little oil and lemon, tender and delicious! It is hard to find a restaurant that knows how to properly cook and season fresh octopus. Keep up the excellent work Blue Point!
