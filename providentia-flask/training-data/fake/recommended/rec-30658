You know the mark of a good place is when you can get a great meal at 2 pm on a Sunday when you're hungover or 2 am on a Sunday morning when you just left "the club" and you need somewhere to sit and something to drink and eat.  Their sliders are amazing, their Mac n Cheese is awesome and not overrated (see White Stripes) and the service is pretty decent.  The only, and I mean only, downside is that sometimes during the summer they will literally blast the music so loud that you legitimately think you are being musically gang raped and you're just screaming for help.  Other than the occasional musical ear gang rape I like this place.
