Wow! This was Italian food at its best! My coworker and I happened to find this place on Yelp and we were not disappointed! I had the spaghetti bolognese, which was fantastic. We were from out of town and did not realize this was byob. So be sure to remember that! We plan on coming back here! Also, I would recommend making reservations.
