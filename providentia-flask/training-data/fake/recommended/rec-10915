When people ask me what I think of this place, the first thing that comes to mind is "well, there's never any wait." I live a few blocks away and have tried brunch, dinner, to-stay and to-go in all manner of combinations, and honestly, I think this place is hit-or-miss. At its best, it's pretty good, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be consistent. I just ordered some takeout (buffalo shrimp and a shake) and the shrimp arrived tasting of freezer burn, so I figured it was time to write a review. Rare occurrence of freezer burn aside, the food is nothing to write home about. I suspect some reviewers here confused "novelty" (no one else in w'burg serves chik'n and waffles) with "excellence." (side note: to be mind blown by this dish done right, head to Harlem.) That said, if you're in a hurry and want friendly service with decent (*decent*, not "mediocre" or "stellar") food, this is definitely the place to go.
