Given the many excellent options in Mercer County, this place is where my money votes (it doesn't take much $ either) most often. The senora cooks in the back and I eat great house food. Ask for the salsa picante for your costillas. I hope not many of you read this because it gets crowded fast. Â Nuff said.
