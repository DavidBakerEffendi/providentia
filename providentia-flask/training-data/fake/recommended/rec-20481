Please don't let the ugly plaza that it's in keep you away! As a local I was apprehensive, but so glad I finally tried it. The inside is gorgeous, the staff is very attentive, and most importantly the menu is extensive and delicious. You can pick your spice level 1-5 which pleases most palettes and it's BYOB.
