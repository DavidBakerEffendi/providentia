Awful! No one in here and it's a 30 minute wait to get the food once the order is placed! Messed up and made gluten free pancakes instead of the French toast... Seriously slow and the omelette wasn't even an omelette. Would much rather go across town to breakfast nook and wait in line for a more delicious meal than this!
