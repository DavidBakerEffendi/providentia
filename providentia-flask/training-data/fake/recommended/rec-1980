Pat's is definitely better then Genos. Ahhh, brings me back to my childhood when I use to live in Philly. Man I miss the place. Had both cheese steak side by side to do a taste test and pats come out ahead. Wizz with onions is the way to go. Dang I wish i was in Philly right now. Cheers, -Herbal Tea
