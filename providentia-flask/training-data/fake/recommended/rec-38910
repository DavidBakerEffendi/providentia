Delightful.  Friendly staff.  Open kitchen.  Great beer.   I stuck with the small plates and was impressed with the experience.  The pork buns were no momofuku but were innovative and garnished with a variety of in house pickled vegetables and mushrooms.  Chicken skins....I'd been meaning to try them at a couple of places but this was my first.  There should have been more picadillo to counter the salty goodness but I was very happy with it nonetheless.  And the ramen...same pickled vegetables as the pork buns, delicious pork belly...very happy. Do yourself a favor...stop in here.
