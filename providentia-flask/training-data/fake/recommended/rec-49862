Not sure what I can say that hasn't been said already, but I've been to this place several times over the past 3 years and it never fails to impress. I came recently with my family and had a pretty perfect dinner: grilled octopus, greek salad, the kyclades specialty (combo of broiled scallops, sole, lobster, stuffed clams, and stuffed shrimp), fried baby shark with skordalia, and grilled calamari. Everything was sublime, but the octopus (chargrilled and tender) and scallops (sweet, fresh, and perfectly cooked) were my personal favorites. Also love the fresh toasty bread, lemon potatoes, and free galaktoboureko dessert, which is creamy and just the right size and sweetness level. The portions are huge, so be careful with how much you order. 3 entrees for 4 people was just the right amount -- especially because the sides are also massive. There is almost always a long line, but when you put down your name you can give your cell phone number -- they'll call a few minutes before your table is ready, so you can wander around the neighborhood while you wait. As others have noted, you can pay with a credit card but you have to tip in cash. If you order the right amount you'll get an excellent value for the price.
