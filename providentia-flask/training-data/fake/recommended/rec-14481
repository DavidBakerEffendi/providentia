I took my fiancé here for dinner.  The wait was about 45 minutes.  Despite this, our waiter was very attentive.  The food was also great. Our dishes were spiced flavorfully according to our preferences.  It was a welcomed change especially in terms of the variety of dishes from many other Thai restaurants. The prices were affordable including drinks and tip. We look forward to going back soon.
