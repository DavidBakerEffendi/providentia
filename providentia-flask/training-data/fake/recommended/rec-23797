We finally made it to Zahav after quite a few cancellations because my friend and I got caught up with work and life. The service and food were excellent. We got the tasting menu and split many of the vegetarian options and were impressed. There was a wide variety of flavors, textures, and dishes to choose from and we enjoyed almost every one. Our server was super sweet and helpful and she did not pressure or nag us at all. We also had a lovely conversation with the floor manager who seemed genuinely interested in our opinions. We are definitely looking forward to going back soon.
