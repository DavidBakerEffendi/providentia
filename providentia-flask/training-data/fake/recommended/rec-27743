Just had dinner there last night and it was incredible ! I got the special which was pumpkin ricotta stuffed ravioli' with coconut shrimp on top in a cream sauce tht had craisins, almonds, and apples in it. It was amazing ! Thr service is always excellent there and their desserts are unreal . I got the carrot cake and my friend got the tiramisu ...both delicious. The carrot cake had cream cheese frosting, which I adore, as opposed to butter cream a lot of places put on carrot cakes.
