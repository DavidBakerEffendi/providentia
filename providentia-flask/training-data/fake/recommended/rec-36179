Balthazar continues to be what it is.  Classy.  Value.  Authenticity.  I love that the stairs are worn as if used for a hundred years (in a venue that did not exist twenty years ago).  Food and service are  always well considered and presented. NYC French is always subject to surveillance for pomposity and indifference.  Balthazar exhibits neither in my experience.  One of the best.
