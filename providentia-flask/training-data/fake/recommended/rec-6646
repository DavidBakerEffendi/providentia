Like an old man who's been living in his rent-controlled apartment since 1953, Corner Bistro has and always will be a staple of the NYC burger scene. Since I don't do hour+ waits anywhere, it took me a while to make it out here.  Come for lunch - we walked right in. There's not much new to say here.  The place is unapologetically divey but it's part of the charm.  The menu only has about 6 items on it - most of them have to do with how you like your burger prepared.  The servers are crotchety and surly, but what do you expect for a $6 burger from a tiny corner dive bar? As for the burger, yes, it's pretty fantastic.  Big, juicy, cooked the way you like it and topped bacon and cheese in classic Bistro style.  I never thought I'd ever say this, but skip the fries - they're not bad, but not really worth the calories.  Overall, I doubt I'd brave the dinner crowds for this experience, but for the burger alone, an easy 4 stars.
