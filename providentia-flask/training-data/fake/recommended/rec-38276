The good:  prices are low, food is good. The bad: Service is very slow.  Was shortchanged by $10 on my second visit there, which I understand happens, but didn't even get so much as an apology. I'd be back if the service was faster, but if I'm taking 80 minutes to finish a meal, I want it to have at least three courses.
