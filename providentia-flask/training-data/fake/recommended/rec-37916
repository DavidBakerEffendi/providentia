We are in town for the weekend, and decided to eat breakfast here. We arrived at 10 am, and were seated by 1015. Ordered pancakes, bacon, and morning potatoes. Expect powdered sugar on your pancakes, which were good. Morning potatoes had rosemary for a really good flavor, and the bacon was cooked perfectly. Staff was great, food was good, and wait time was minimal.
