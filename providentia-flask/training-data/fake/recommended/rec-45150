I came in for a drink a few weeks ago, I was visiting some friends who were in town. I ordered an Old Fashioned, and was rather shocked that an Old Fashioned with Blantons rang up at $21, this isn't Manhattan...but anyway, I ordered another beer and left. A week later checking my back account I had realized that I was charged $450.+ for that transaction. With haste I called my bank and disputed the transaction then went down to the restaurant to inform them and find out what happend. I met with the GM Daniel, who said that one of the bartenders accidentally plugged in the wrong tip, he said he was sorry and that was that. I was offered absolutely nothing for my trouble, this was not just $50, this was a huge chunk of cash. He never took my contact info or even bothered to follow up with me, my bank is still working out this dispute and I still don't have my money. Beware, it seems they have no idea what they are doing.
