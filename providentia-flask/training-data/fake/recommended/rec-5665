Great place for the atmosphere.  Try the scallops and the sea bass.  Both are cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent.  The staff was very attentive and made great suggestions for dinner.  Asian Fusion - with a very big Thai influence in the menu items.  Would love to go back whenever in Philly!
