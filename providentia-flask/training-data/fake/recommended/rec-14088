went for brunch on a long holiday weekend thinking we might avoid some of the waits.   i was wrong.   we got there (there were two of us) when it opened (the hours were posted incorrectly on the website and we had to come back two hours later) to find a line around the block.   since i knew i was never going to wait in this line again unless the pancakes were heaven on earth, i figured i would just stay and wait.   we waited for about 45 minutes for a table.   not awful, but there is no place to wait inside so you are stuck huddling together for warmth on the cold days.   we are seated in about 45 minutes. it was so cold outside that neither us removed our jackets during breakfast because we couldn't get warm. inside, the restaurant is cute, very small, and seemingly only decorated with framed articles extolling the virtues of the food. every magazine, newspaper and tour book has written about this place place. it certainly explains the crowds. we split two entrees, blueberry pancakes and a southern breakfast (eggs, bacon, grits, fried green tomato). we also get a side of chorizo. the food is good. i preferred the eggs, chorizo and grits and found the pancakes to be a bit too much like dessert.  the fried tomato was boring and not spiced well. sadly, the service wasn't that great. no one came to refill my coffee and the entire time i was eating, i felt rushed because there is a line of shivering people outside staring at you willing you to finish eating. i wouldn't go back and wait for the breakfast. if they expand, or the lines magically stop, it would be a nice meal. unfortunately there are too many great brunch places in new york to merit waiting that long for pancakes and eggs, especially for a place where i didn't even love the pancakes.
