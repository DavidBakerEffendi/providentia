Honestly kind of surprising.  We have eaten here a lot over the years.  Tonight we were going to Chelsea Market for lobster and decided to come here instead.  It used to be pretty darn good.  The lobster tonight tasted as though it was precooked and heated up.  Really tasteless, just really mushy and horrible.  The only saving grace of the meal was the scallop ceviche, could have had more scallop but can't complain.  I doubt we will eat here again, not that it was expensive, just not good.
