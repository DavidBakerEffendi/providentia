Quick service and yummy Pad See Ew.  The yellow curry was packed with veggies and it was ok - hence the 4 star rating.  You can tell that the restaurant use to be a house per the covered up bathtub in the bathtoom, but they added touches of decor to give it a Thai ambiance.  If you are looking for Thai food, fair price and quick service - this is your place.
