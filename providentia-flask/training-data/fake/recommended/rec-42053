Love this place!! The entire menu is delicious!! I usually get the Bulgoggi Pot or Fried Tiger sushi dish. Omg and the oysters are insanely good!!! Service always great and ambiance is so chic... The drinks are awesome too. I like the Elder Fashion (a bourbon specialty cocktail) and surprisingly for $13 each, it gets me nice. The manager Henry is great too. So attentive and always sweet and generous. I love coming here, I always bring guests because you can have a great time with incredible food without breaking the bank. They all love it!
