The infamous chicken and rice cart definitely did not disappoint me.  For $6, it was enough to feed my fiancee and I in all our post-drinking glory.  Get the mixed meat bowl, which consists of gyro and chicken with rice/pita, squeeze on some of that "white" sauce (or as I call it halal ranch sauce), go easy on the hot sauce (I felt it the next morning), and enjoy yourself on the sidewalk with a cheap and delicious meal. It still amazes me how $6 manages to go so far nowadays! 4 stars!
