So when two besties, need to catch up on their dinner and a movie haunts. U venture to a cool spot to just talk and EAT. So we were both feeling Thai, and kinda lazy on how far to go after an end of the week hang. First off, walked in and didn't realize that the seating situation was towards the back. We stood there for roughly 10 minutes, before staff even asked to assist. When we eventually did realize who the hostess was, he told us a 45 minute wait. So despite a crowded bar, we did order two drinks. We asked for a bar menu, bartender said there wasn't a menu and showed the bottles behind her. So my friend ordered two drinks, after 30 minutes, we did notice there were some tables that opened up. Mind you, we were there roughly 1.5 hours prior to closing. We watched the empty table go unassigned. Two stools, opened up at the bar and starving foodies ordered calamari(based on a hot order pass us by). The calamari was hot, and flaky. I love that it was not heavily breaded and you got quite a hefty serving for two. After waiting so long, and still not a peep from the hostess, we ordered at the bar. WHY? Well we overheard the bartender tell another female duo that the kitchen was closing soon. UMMM??? I guess we did not warrant the same notification. I ordered the spicy pork and pineapple fried rice, and my bestie ordered the spicy seafood rice. I have to say that both had heat, and the portion size, quite large. I have to say that Joya did have a cool Friday night vibe, with music playing in the background. But they lost points for me, for the lack of attention to the patrons.
