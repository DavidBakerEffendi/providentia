Dario makes the finest burrito on the planet. This is not hyperbole. Seriously. Words like "master" and "genius" lack the gravity that Dario and his burritos deserve. I would not be surprised if he puts ecstasy in his secret hot sauce. For real. For the last year, several of my classmates and I did lunch here once a week. The withdrawal is ongoing, hopefully the shakes stop soon.
