I checked out Doma last night because of all the great reviews on Yelp! I have to say that it definitely lives up to the hype. The restaurant looks very modern inside but not pretentious at all. Everyone was dressed casual. The staff is very friendly and always responsive. I had the Miso Soup, Whitefish Carpaccio and Omakase for dinner and Banana Tempura for dessert. Everything was fresh and delicious. For those that don't know, omakase is when the chef decides what rolls to give you. You get 6 pieces of sushi each with its own type of fish and various other ingredients and sauces. It was very good. I would definitely come back here again because they have a lot of interesting things on their menu that I want to try, including some Korean fusion dishes. It is BYOB, so don't forget to bring something if you want alcohol.
