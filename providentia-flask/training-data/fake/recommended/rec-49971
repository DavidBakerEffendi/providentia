I didn't go to this place for a restaurant but as a guest for a friend's wedding and I have to say everything was beautiful. They are absolutely fantastic for converting the hall into a more wedding style dining room for the guests. The servers were great, I don't even remember ever seeing my glasses empty. When it comes to food, everything was delicious. If you live around this area, I guess it's the perfect place to hold your reception.
