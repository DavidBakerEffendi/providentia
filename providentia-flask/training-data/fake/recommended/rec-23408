I wanted to love this place based on decor alone. Great vibe with a fun camp lodge feel. The food and service unfortunately was just okay. I've never waited 30 min. just for coffee and 45 min. for two meals. They really need more support staff. My gravy and biscuits were great but my BF's dish was terrible. The baked eggs were so overcooked that they looked like hard boiled eggs. It was crazy to me that they would serve a dish that was so obviously forgotten in the oven. Our server and the hostess were very friendly but we could barely get anyone's attention. It also seemed overpriced for what you receive. I wouldn't go back for brunch but maybe drinks because the space is really nice.
