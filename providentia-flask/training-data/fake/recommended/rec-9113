I work in the area and decided to pick up lunch from Song due to the good reviews on Yelp. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed. I went into the restaurant to place the order and the hostess was very rude. She took my money without giving me a receipt and did not even tell me how long it would take. She basically made no attempt at good service because I wasn't sitting down in the restaurant. I could forget this if I didn't receive my order of Pad See Yew and find that it's burnt--the noodles, the eggs, and the beef. There are distinct char marks on everything and it tastes disgusting. And of course, I can't very well send my order back into the kitchen. Perhaps my experience and food would be different if I was sitting down in the restaurant, but it is unacceptable to treat takeout orders with such disregard. I will not be returning to test the sit-down experience.
