This place is fairly close to my boyfriend's apartment so we have come here a number of times to grab late night dinner and drinks. The first time I came here we were able to try a few items from their dinner menu including the famous Rouge burger. I fell in love with their truffle fries! Last weekend the boyfriend wanted to go to Monks, but it  was packed.  I was happy that it was because that meant we got to go to Rouge instead.  The sophisticated-looking bar was full so we decided to grab a table and get dessert with our drinks.  I got the pomegranate margarita and chocolate chip bread pudding. Delicious! The drinks are strong so be careful if you are a lightweight like me. The only downside is that tables are right next to the door, so it gets freeeeezing cold every time someone walks in!
