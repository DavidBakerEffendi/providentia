The key to the Corner Bistro is to go when others don't or that failing get into a spot where you're not constantly jostled by the line for a table. Once settled in, get the burger (take a chance, medium rare) and if you must, get the fries. The burger doesn't disappoint but the fries do even though they come with that plastic fork sticking up like a rudder. It's hard to put my finger on it but I think if they used a different oil and cooked those bad boys up a bit longer they might be a bit crispier. Prices are hard to beat though you have to wonder just how many ounces of beer you end up getting in one of the heaviest mugs in Manhattan.
