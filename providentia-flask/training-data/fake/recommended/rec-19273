Most of our large table got the fish and chips based off the reviews on yelp. They were all very pleased. I got a veggie wrap with goat cheese and it was delicious and filling, which is super important. The place had a surprisingly cozy and classy atmosphere. I loved the mixture of exposed brick walls and candles.
