So glad my favorite burger spot in LA opened in NYC! I love the classic truffle burger, but the pastrami special and the 5 spice duck burgers are also a must! Actually can't go wrong with any of the burgers as they're all very juicy and full bursting of flavor. Both times I've been here there was no wait, got a seat by the bar the first time on a Monday and a table second time on a Sunday night.
