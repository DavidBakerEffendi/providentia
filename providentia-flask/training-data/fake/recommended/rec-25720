Okay, today was my second time at Sabrina's.  I knew it was a special place the first time I dined there with my best friend.  He had the Tofu Scramble off the everyday menu; I couldn't decide and had both the Apple and Cheddar Omelet (everyday menu) and a half order of the "Lords of the Underworld" pancakes (May brunch special).  Not only was the wait staff incredibly helpful, but the food was delicious.  I mean not one thing needed additional seasoning.   I ventured there on my own to see if they could deliver again.  And they did!  First, I have to say, seeing what the new monthly theme was like opening presents on Christmas... what will they have today?!  I wondered.  Imagine my delight when I discovered "The Neverending Story" theme.  I went with the "Southern Oracle Egg White Omelet" (though I wanted to order "The Childlike Empress's 'CALL MY NAME' Stuffed French Toast" just so I could say that out loud...).  Once again it was delicious. Sliced peaches, shaved fennel, red onion, roasted peppers, and herbed cream cheese?!  Yes, please.  And the home fries and toast were a great accompaniment.  As a solo diner, I often feel rushed out of an establishment when it's busy, but the staff was again attentive enough to meet my needs, but understanding and patient with me as I asked for a re-steep of my tea and finished a chapter of my book. Sabrina's has swiftly become one of my favorite dining establishments in the city.  I'll be back, if not to try lunch or dinner, then at least to see next month's theme.
