Great local bar!! Beers are always awesome. Rotating draft and cans! Food is always rotating as well. You can find fun concoctions like the amazing spaghetti sandwich!! And no one can f#*k with their onion rings. They are huge, lightly battered with a delicious mustard sauce. Perfection. Fun place, good music, beer, food and ample sitting indoor and outdoor. Clean bathrooms!
