Finding not simply good, but great seafood in Philadelphia can be quite a challenge, most the top ten lists that are easily googled are very out of date, restaurants pop up and disappear in a blink but I must say that I hope Little Fish is here to stay. This charming little BYOB is nestled on a corner of Catherine St.  Very small fifteen tables maybe with the chef station out in the open with a small low divider separating it from the patrons.  Get reservations because they fill up fast.   Get all three courses! Have an appetizer, have an entree, and please please PLEASE get a dessert!   We had the Peeky Toe Crab and the Scallops as a starter and they were cooked to perfection.  The crab melted in your mouth, the flavors fresh clean and full of everything wonderful about summer.  The scallop buttery and cooked to perfection, so tender.   Entree, the skate and the halibut and they were both phenomenal and we found ourselves dragging the bread on the bottom of the bowls to sop up the last bit of sauce.  The ingredients are all fresh and as local as possible and you can tell in every bite.   Dessert was the Chocolate torte and the creme brulee (ginger flavored with pink grapefruit)  The torte with a good red wine was bliss and sinfully rich, the brulee again  clean bright and perfect for an evening summer meal.   I suggest you make this a stop on your trip to Philly, you will be hard pressed to find better seafood in the city, maybe better food in general!
