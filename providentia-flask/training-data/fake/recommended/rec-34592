LOVE this place! Combination 3 roast meats ( pork, chicken, duck) on rice only $6-$7! Plus veges are $4! Beer $3! I will often come here for dinner if I'm downtown, its always busy, but they have quick turn around so you can get a table for 2 pretty quick. It IS no frills service though - but I've never had a bad experience! Not so much room for big groups though. And they're open til 4am!
