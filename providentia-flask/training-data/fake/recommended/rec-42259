I just joined Yelp and figured I'd start with my NY visit (I'm from CO)... this place is amazing!!! I went with w group of friends and all of us were craving something different and this place hit the spot! I had sushi, my fiance had lobster and my friends split the veal chop! Everything was superb and service was friendly- def will come back!!!
