Unique ambiance.  Noise level is perfect, music volume just right.  Clear spring rolls were delicious especially the peanut sauce.  Bathroom was through a door that looked like part of the wall. Pho Bo was good.  Lots of beef brisket but .  Broth could be heartier.  Presentation of all dishes was artful and added to the entire experience. Definitely worth a try,
