Margarita: prickly Pear. Good. Not to tart not to sweet. Get sugar on the rim. They are a good size for the price. Chips and salsa: Perfect, I asked for some fresh pico mixed in and the cute waiter with the beard hooked us up. Nachos: GIANT!!! Good, meaty,cheesy! Service: We (4 coworkers)  sat at a little table. I have a thing about having my back out in an isle or being seated where I cant see the door. The place was empty except for the few people sitting the bar. I don't see why he didn't seat us at the nice squishy half booth. It's not like he was running out of space.  So, seating situation was uncomfortable to say the least. And the guac: I'm not dumb enough to order $10.00 mushed up avocado's even if they do mush them at your table. and by the way, a side of the green paste is $2.00 So for $8.00 more I'll skip the table side theatrics and order another drink! I gave it a go and it was ok.
