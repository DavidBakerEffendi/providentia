Love this place but it is RIDICULOUSLY crowded on Sundays. Recently, my party of 4 had a horrible experience regarding our wait/ placing our name on the lists. We had been waiting for 10 minutes when a man walked in and asked us about the wait and how long we had been there. We talked and learned he was also in a party of 4. He was then seated BEFORE us. When we went up to ask about this they said there still two parties ahead of us. We left after being treated rudely by the seating staff after asking why we still hadn't been seated. Â  Bottom line: I love this place but NOT worth more than a 45 minute wait.
