Went in on a Friday night around 7 and were seated right away. The back of the restaurant was already packed and it looked like just about everyone who was there had just gotten there; still had menus in front of them, no drink orders, utensils on napkins etc. Considering that it looked like they had a rush before me and my friend walked in, service was timely and we were not rushed. We ordered crispy spring rolls with sweet plum sauce. Loved it, i wanted a deep fried roll and got it. I ordered the green curry with chicken my friend got the pineapple fried rice with crispy duck. I felt that it tasted like a standard delicious green curry, not too heavy and paired with white rice. I thought the crispy duck was a bit dry but liked that the rice did not taste super greasy. Lastly we both tried a red and a white sangria. The red and white were VERY flavorful, they infuse the wines in glass jars. Last thing! We've done pick up here of the Tom Ka Gai -coconut soup was Creamy!!
