Loved every bit of it! I went to Yuca for the first time last Saturday and will absolutely be back. I sat at the bar with one of my girlfriends. The bar had a decent crowd but wasn't too packed as it was somewhat early. The bartenders were super friendly and accommodating, even giving us recommendations on drinks and food to snack on. We started off with just a few drinks, which turned into a few tapas (yum!) Â and then impromptu dancing! The bar got packed and I was definitely impressed with the service. The bartenders were attentive and super fast. The music was great and even though they don't have a formal dance floor we cleared some space to get down! We ended up staying all night! Hands down my new favorite bar in the East Village. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, and a few more of those delicious cocktails ;)
