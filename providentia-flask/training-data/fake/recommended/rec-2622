I was heading to catch the A when I noticed this cute little spot. The server (Alexander?) waved at me so I went in. I had just eaten lunch not long before so I figured I'd have a glass of wine. I just asked him to bring me something red and then I noticed the sign...they serve locally sourced foods and free range meat! They also wrote about the family and the excellent pie...so I added that to my bill and was not disappointed. There I was eating a wonderful and huge slice of fresh apple pie with the crumbles on top, enhanced by some a la mode! The wine was fantastic and the service was friendly.There were a number of people at the bar chatting away and having a good time, but the server was attentive and we enjoyed a good long chat. I look forward to returning to NY so I can try Peaches friend chicken!
