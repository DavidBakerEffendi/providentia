I went here on a recommendation with some friends and I was pleasantly surprised! It's a very tiny place but the sandwiches were PERFECT! Everything I always hope to find in a sandwich and very rarely do... great crusty bread, fresh sliced meats, crunchy veggies and a perfect balance of condiments. I had the Capsule which had sliced roast turkey, Jarlsberg cheese, brussel sprouts and bacon jam. They had me at the bacon jam- I don't know what the hell they put in it but it was Yum-Ay! I also tried the ham, egg and frisee on brioche and it was also very good! To drink we had Pomegranate Lemonades that were not too sweet (just the way I like it). We finished with creamy hot chocolates and strawberry and apple pop tarts that were flaky and not too sweet. Everything was delish, I can't wait to go back already!! Good luck with the new business, I hope guys do very well!
