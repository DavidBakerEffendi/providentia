I really liked the atmosphere of this place for a nice weather day. The outdoor bar is really nice, & they have awesome cabanas. The drinks are reasonably priced & I even had dinner while I was there. I'd even go back for the meal! It was pretty good. It was only my 1st time going but I'd definitely go back. Be warned, I found out the hard way that they charge for parking on the weekends. I'll probably stick with it as an after work spot.
