There's not enough words to express how much I enjoy food at this place! I don't think you can go wrong with anything at this place but my 2 definite favorites are eggs and lamb and flourless chocolate cake - both to die for. Big compliments to all staff for their superb service - you guys rock! I can't wait to be back.
