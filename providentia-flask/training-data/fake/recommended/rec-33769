Very knowledgable staff! I had the French toast (server suggestion) and it was phenomenal! It was great that they had three options for sausage. I had the sage turkey sausage and it was superb! This is my first brunch spot on Philly, after relocating from Chicago, so my expectations are pretty high! Well done!
