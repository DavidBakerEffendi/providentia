One of the easiest 5 stars. This place is what Brooklyn is all about with a piece of real hispanic food. The service was great and the Â food brought memories of when I used to live with mom and grandma. I had the pernil with rice and my daughter had the sancocho. The food was plated great. The pernil was just like moms and the sancocho was flavored to perfection. You have to get the coconut flan. The best part of dinner was when we were caught off guard with a salsa band performing. It was a great night.
