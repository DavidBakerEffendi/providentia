We ordered food from here on a whim. Shockingly good. They actually make their food spicy if you request it - we mentioned we're Indian, said that we wanted it as spicy as possible, then they warned us against that so we backed off to "very spicy" (my husband eats ridiculously spicy food but this is our new policy after ordering suicide wings at hoagies & wings in LA). This was spicy enough for me to enjoy while still tasting the other flavors. Yes it is punjabi/north indian style food - I've given up on finding regional Indian cusine unless I'm in a big city. We had the chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani and raita. We'll definitely be ordering from there agian.
