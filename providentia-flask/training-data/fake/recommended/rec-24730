I took my mom here for her birthday, my folks go here often so we expected to have a good night. From what I was told, I think we missed out on a special night. The calamari was actually amazing, but the entrees were pretty bland. Our waiter did not seem to interested in serving us and I had to find him at one point because after he sat us, he went missing for 15 minutes and he did not seem to know the menu all that well. I would be willing to head back, but only if I had to.
