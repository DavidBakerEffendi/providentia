The menu is a bit confusing at first. Besides that, I was very happy with my experience. I had the chicken tikka Marsala crepe and my friend had a crepe with nutella, banannas, and some other jazz. Both were amazing.. coming from a guy who doesn't usually get down with crepes. A nice alternative to the south philly area that isn't a cheese steak.
