A stones throw away from my front door I have to make sure I don't abuse it's greatness.  Grab a quick drink, something to eat (Cuban Sandwich is my favorite), see a show, sit outside and critique fixed gear bikes, or shoot some pool, you can accomplish it all.     Reasonably priced, & usually a good crowd. They have a respectable selection of local beers, almost always have a rotating Dogfish Head option which puts a smile on my face.    I'm not hip enough for the juke box selection, but the venue upstairs is one of my favorite spots to catch a show.  Whether local or not, I find myself at this venue more so than any other in the city.  The space upstairs is straight up awesome!  Intimate, small balcony, and a nice sized bar.
