I highly enjoy this place. The atmosphere is awesome. A few friends and I got a table here during a huge snowstorm, and there was still a decent amount of people eating, and at the bar. The BBQ seitan is delicious-- $5 for a 1/4 lb. of it. It is very refreshing to go into a bbq place that actually has vegan and vegetarian options! I expected to go in there and just pick up some drinks.
