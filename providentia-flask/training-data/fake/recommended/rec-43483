Terrible service. I got the sense that they couldn't be bothered. It took a long time for anything to come out, then we were given the wrong food, then 1 starter came out and had to wait 15 minutes for the other. They tried to give me a completely different entree to what I had ordered because, by there own admission they put in the wrong order. No apology, and it will be a bit longer. No there attitude was just 'here eat this'. They made a substitution in my partners dish without even telling him, much less asking whether this was OK. They never checked in with us, never brought a desert menu, and I had to walk into the waiters pantry area to get someone to take my payment. Could not have been worse.
