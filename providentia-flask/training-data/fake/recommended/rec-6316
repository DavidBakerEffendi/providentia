Absolutely amazing. The decor was beautiful - great place for a date or for a night out with friends. Food was fantastic.  Highly recommend the "l a v r a k i   m e   t s i g  a r e l l i a" stripe bass. For wine, we had d o m  a i n e   p  r o t o p  a p  a s  (sauvignon blanc), and that was also above expectations. Will definitely be back.
