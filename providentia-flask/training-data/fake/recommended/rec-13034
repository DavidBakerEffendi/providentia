Rank: B. Name of the Game is Pasta. Good for groups - loud, fun energy in a large wooden hall style room. Food is mediocre though for the price. I can think of at least a half dozen other places I'd rather go, based on the combination of price and taste (Dell Anima, Del Posto, Maialino, Scarpetta, Convivio - before it closed, Babbo, Otto Enoteca). The prosciutto and mortadella meatballs and the tortellini panna (meat filled pasta, duck liver mousse) were two items that stood out in my mind.
