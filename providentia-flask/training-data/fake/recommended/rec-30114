I was meeting my friends for some drinks after work. She had some guests in from out of town and wanted to show them how bars in NYC do Christmas. While our first choice was Rolf's, then line there was out the door and around the corner. So instead we hit up Molly's around the corner. Cozy, warm, inviting - all words I'd use to describe Molly's. I loved the sawdust on the floor (although I wasn't expecting it!) It was also decked out with festive Christmas decorations and lights (Not NEARLY as crazy as Rolf's but still very festive). While Molly's was PACKED it was still a perfect spot to get some relief from the cold December night. We pushed our way to the back of the bar where the hostess was so we could put our name down for a table. It was still relatively early (7:00ish) the estimated wait for a table for 4 was 30 minutes. Unfortunately there were actually 6 people in our party (whoops) so we took our name off the list and just had drinks. Word to the wise, the standing space around the bar is very limited so get there early. Because there are booths across from the bar, if you don't manage to get a seat at the bar you are forced to stand very close behind the people sitting at the bar. Uncomfortable at times, especially when servers and runners are bringing trays of food back and forth. It was a bit annoying and but then again it was a Friday night...you're going to get jostled and pushed a bit. If you can't handle it then go to a bar in the burbs. If you have backpacks or shopping bags or worse yet...suitcases, please be considerate. Better yet, don't bring them. There is really that little space to stand. Subway etiquette please.
