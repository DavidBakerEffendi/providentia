Perhaps one of the best foodie spots in Burlington. Perfectly cold fresh delicious oysters on the half shell, amazing locally produced charcuterie and cheese platters. Â Fabulously creative use of local meats, veggies with nice presentation. Good selection of beer on tap from Lager to Belgian with some excellent wines by the glass. If you are interested in more breadth and depth in culinary options than Flat Bread and want a similarly excellent beer and wine menu all for a fair price, this is the place to come. Oh and I forgot to mention the music on Thurs-Sat nights can be really excellent as well!
