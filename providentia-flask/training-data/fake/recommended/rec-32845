There is a reason this bar has been rated the best craft beer bar in the northeast 2 years in a row. Â Because it is. The food is excellent. Service is typically wonderful. The promotions are among the best I've encountered in the NY/NJ area. I've been coming here for 6 years and have yet to be disappointed. I love the Cloverleaf!
