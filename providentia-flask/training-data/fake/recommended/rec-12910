I was reluctant about reviewing this place, because there are already so many reviews for it. However...one never knows how a review might help another and I am always ready to help others whenever I can! After a very long train ride down to this neighborhood, we walked and walked and finally grabbed a cab since we were completely lost trying to find this place that apparently serves the best breakfast in NYC. We would have taken a taxi from the start, but our daughter wanted to experience the subway, so away we went on the train...by the time we found the right street, we noticed we were right near Katz's Deli, which we also wanted to try - so we decided we'd stop there first, since now it was practically lunchtime. (I'll write that review later) We found Clinton street and found a very long line to eat some really delicious looking food...we walked up and decided to just order some pastries and lattes to go. Pastries were very good, not the best I've ever had, but very good. I cannot give more stars because I didn't experience eating a full meal. NOTE to visitors...this is a CASH only place. Ok, I get it - cc fees are high and it sucks to pay them, unfortunately, when you are traveling using cc's is the most convenient way to get around, otherwise you need to carry a bunch of cash with you that could get stolen, etc. Long story short, it was good we only had pastries and coffee, I would not have had enough cash to cover breakfast - which by the way, if you are wondering about the prices being less because of the cash only "business" they are not. Bottom line...I'd love to try their breakfast, I hope they take cc's in the future.
