Came in for a quick bite in the neighborhood.  Was expecting something a little quieter, not a sports bar.  Enjoyed that it was lively but not overwhelming.  They did have good music playing in the background.  I was seated at a high table so I had a view of the tvs at the bar and some of the other patrons.  I started with a glass of rose.  Sorry, I'm not a huge beer fan, though I may have been more courageous if I was sitting at the bar and could have sampled a couple beers before making a final decision.   Anyway, ordered the goat cheese and tomato pastry, which was good- lots of goat cheese.  It came with a small side of greens that were dressed.  I probably should have tried the grilled shrimp like I had wanted, but instead went with the server's suggestion of the stuffed mussels.  They were really tasty and there were plenty of them.  I'm not a huge mussel fan, and kind of lost my gusto for them after about three.  This is probably a dish better shared than consumed by one person.  It's a lot of salt and butter.  I think I'll be back to try the Belgian meatballs.
