Have never felt compelled to write a scathing review before, Â but my experience last night at Soul de Cuba was remarkably unimpressive to say the least. Made a reservation at 8pm, came in and the waiter seemed confused about us even having made a reservation for 2 and sat us. We received our waters after about 10 minutes and ordered our food from the restaurant week menu..then we sat there until 8:50pm wondering if we'd even get our appetizers sometime soon... At this time the waiter came over and asked us to reorder our food since they didn't get our order through for some reason! That's right, after sitting for nearly an hour they asked us to reorder our food! Basically start the process of waiting all over again! It was just ridiculous! We were the only people with not a thing on the table in the whole place. We asked to speak to the manager..which I hated to have to do, But the entire situation was absurd. Then we waited for the manager for about 10 minutes and the manager never even showed up at our table. We ended up just grabbing our coats and leaving, after sitting there for our reservation for an hour and receiving nothing but water. I can't even the critique the food, which sounded delicious, because we never even received it. Will always remember this very poor experience at Soul de Cuba! I'm sure the food is as great as it sounds, but WOW what horrible service.
