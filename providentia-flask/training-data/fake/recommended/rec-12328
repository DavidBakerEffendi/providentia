Finally I got to check this place out!  It was on my list the last trip but I hear the lines could be cray cray.  Anywho, stopped in for lunch mid-week, and we were seated upstairs.  Our drinks were deelish (they make a fantastic pisco drink), and the grilled cheese, and sheep's milk gnudi were SO good!  Albeit slightly a cheese overload for me. The bartenders and servers were all so chatty and nice!  The only downside was that it was so muggy out and the upstairs was SO uncomfortably hot and humid.  But I'd definitely be back again.
