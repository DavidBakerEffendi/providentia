Stopped in for a drink before Nobu. Cute casual vibe, with a great happy hour list of handpicked wines for 6 dollars (between 5-6pm) and only a few dollars more after 6. Not in this area much but would definitely return if i am, and will recommend this to others looking for a Â quieter bar in tribeca.
