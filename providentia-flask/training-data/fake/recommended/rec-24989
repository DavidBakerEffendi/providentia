I was raised in Sunset Park and I always had a soft spot in my heart for my old neighborhood.  On my way to work every day, I passed by this place, remembering it was the old Karate school ran by John the cop!  The place never looked appealing so I gave it no thought, not being sure what it was because when I passed by it was early morning and lights were off.  Anyway, when my parents invited me to this place, I was not keen on going but she had a gift certificate and I agreed to pay for whatever was over her certificate because I brought my husband and sons with me.   Like other yelpers, the place is not fancy, but it was homey.  What a wonderful time I had with my family.  Brian, the owner immediately introduced himself to me and my family.  Bryan was such a friendly host.  I am not used to that kind of treatment.  There was another gentleman there, who we didnt get to meet.  He didnt talk much either.   The food was absolutely fantastic.  It took alittle long but hey the food was fresh!  It had a homecooked taste to it.  First time I had pumpkin Ravioli.  It was delicious.  It wasnt doused with sauce, so the flavor was wonderful.   I found Brian rather comical in his approach of how he liked certain foods and how some of his clientele liked certain foods.  We shared stories about the neighborhood.  Thanks Brian for a wonderful dinner and am greatful for the opportunity to spend such a great time with my family.
