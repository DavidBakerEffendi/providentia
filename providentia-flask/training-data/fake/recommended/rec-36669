Had brunch there on 4/18. Service was impeccable, we had a good table off to the side, not by the front which seemed like too much crowd noise and general interruption potentially. We ordered a bakery basket to share (5 of us), filled with scrumptious baked goods. I got the eggs benedict - the eggs were perfectly cooked, the sauce was heavy but delightful, and the coffee went well with everything. I even thoroughly enjoyed the tap water! I will go back next time I am in the city.
