I really loved the atmosphere, the service and the wine, but was really let down on the food on all counts.  For the price and the hype, I expected larger portions and better quality.   I do want to point out, though, that I dropped a glass of wine on the floor (typical) and it shattered and they were so nice, quick, and professional about cleaning it up.  No rude glances or anything.   I ran to the bathroom to hide in embarassment and try to save my linen pants and when I got back, it was completely cleaned up and had a new full glass awaiting me.
