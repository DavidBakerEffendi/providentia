My husband & I stumbled upon this place and we are so happy we did! Nice atmosphere...friendly staff and delicious food and drinks! I ordered the Salame pizza: spicy salame, black olives, tomato sauce & fresh mozzarella...soo good!   My husband got the Carroll Place Burger foccacia bun, crispy speck & gorgonzola!  (so yummy!) Drinks were really great too! I would like to visit when they have a live band playing since they have a stage in the back set up where we were seated. Fun spot ! Would most definitely come again! :)
