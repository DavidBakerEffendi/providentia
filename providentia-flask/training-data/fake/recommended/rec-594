went for an early bird supper on a gloomy sunday afternoon.  a nice rose helped cheer up the weather.  thought it was rather fansssay for wburg with the white tablecloth settings but really, not stuffy at all.  had a light meal of the berkshire pork belly sandwich and a side of red chard.  my friend had the hangar steak.  both delicious and just right in size.  would definitely go back for another rendezvous.  being healthy ladies, we abstained from the donuts'  siren calls.
