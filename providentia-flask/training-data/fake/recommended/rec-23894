A carnivore's dream. I am one, just typical guy, not strictly carnivorous. This is my 4th time here. Its essentially all you can eat til your stomach bursts or arteries clog. The format here is a double-sided button, red on one side meaning stop, green on the other side meaning go. When green is up the waiting that swarm around the tables will approach you and ask if you want a portion. If red is up, they stay away. Do not try to be a "man" and never put on red. You will fail at some point. Unless you're Joey Chestnut. They do have a slick salad bar according to friends I've eaten there with, but I don't do salad. You also can order just the salad bar, minus the meat extravaganza for $25 for you vegetarians. I love the bread rolls. So buttery Paula Deen would be proud. The fried polenta is just alright, mashed potatoes seem like instant - boo to that, but the fried bananas are good. The meat. My personal fave was the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. That is high quality shit. The waiters have a slick way of dismounting the lambchop off the skewer which I thought was nifty. To be honest, everything was cooked very well (quality, not in finish), but from what I ate there were no premium cuts besides the filet, i guess rib eye counts but not in my book, but top and bottom sirloin, lambchop, chicken leg, chicken breast in bacon, sausage, pork loin. Again great eats, but wheres the porterhouse, strip? I guess what needs to be realized is its a brazilian steakhouse, not a standard american steakhouse. Easier bottom line for them, not having to order those though. $50 bucks for the main entrees. For dessert, had the mousse cake. That thing was a mountain of a slice when it got to the table. I took down about half only after eating all that meat, but it was good, cake was moist, not warm, but I can't judge mousse, but good nonetheless. I'd recommend this for a group outing. Not a recommended date spot, unless your date likes to eat meat. There's a sex joke there somewhere.
