Fantastic food. I had the pancakes with berries and my son had the hash & scramble wrap. Both entrees were fresh and very filling. I could not finish the pancakes due to the large portion size (my son took care of that). Real maple syrup, of course, and cinnamon "butter". There are gluten-free options and a variety of baked goods. We'll definitely be back.
