I managed to check out two BBQ joints while I was home visiting CT, and I still can't believe it. I don't think I'd been to one BBQ place in CT when I lived there, because they simply did not really exist, but apparently that's changing, and I'm all for it. BBQ is my favorite and Bear's does it extremely well. I found out about this place from my sister who had visited their other location and loved it. I've had a lot of BBQ, and this is some of the best I've had. I ended up going with the brisket, and it was so tender and juicy, and they gave you a pretty good size portion for a sandwich. The BBQ sauce was super tasty; I tried both the Sweet Kansas City and the Texas Pepper and ended up putting both of them on the sandwich. So so good. I saw on the website they had two other sauce flavors, and my sister said they were at the second location, but I didn't see them offered at this one. Also, I wanted to try the burnt ends, but they didn't have them at the time which was a bit of a bummer. It's okay though, because my meal more than made up for it. I tried the pulled pork as well, and it was just as good. The fries were super crispy and tasted great. I will be back here next time I'm in town, and you can count on that.
