What a fun spot! I took a Sertanejo dance lesson a few blocks away and my Brazilian friends asked if we could stop here. How can you beat Brazilian and Portuguese karaoke, mixed with food i love, and a well-stocked bar? Plus, the meninas walking around in tiny skirts and tight pants doesnt hurt, neither. A lot of fun if you want to try something different!
