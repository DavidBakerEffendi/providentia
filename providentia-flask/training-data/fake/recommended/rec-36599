Another OK restaurant that gets praised not for its food but for its relatively low prices... Food was ok (we got the bresaola, gorgonzola gnocchi & the fish stew - overspiced and not subtle), nothing to write home about. Super cheap for NYC. The level of noise is unbearable. Service is uncoordinated. Â Don't think I'll go back.
