As a frequent guest of the Chandler hotel, I knew that Juni was long-awaited, so I was eager to try it once it opened. I was not aware of the chef's reputation. My first experience was the hostess telling me that I couldn't take my coat into the dining room, even though I was cold and it was 10 degree outside, because the chef wouldn't allow it. The explanation was that the dining room was too cramped, but I was the only diner in the room. The first rule of any business is that the clientele's comfort is a priority, but apparently not at Juni. Luckily, the food made up for this first impression. The amuse were stunning to look at and beyond delicious, especially the goat cheese and beet tuile. As an entree, I had the bass with potato espuma. Again, a stunning dish, although the celery was a little bit difficult to cut with the odd knife that was provided. Delicate, stunning, but somewhat on the small side for $40. (Maybe 8 bites total.) Since I was the only diner in the room for most of my meal, I was under close surveillance by about 4-5 servers in suits. I had two small bread sticks (the olive was the best), but was offered at least two more. The attention made me a little bit uncomfortable. I was relieved toward the end of my meal when a few more tables were seated. I was a little bit disappointed with the French Sauvignon Blanc--it was somewhat flavorless for an $18 glass of wine. I prefer Marlborough Sauv. Blanc. I finished the meal with the complimentary petite fours--again, stunning. There was a hazelnut concoction, some kind of chocolate mint, a peanut buttery thing, and a pink unidentified flavor that was so tasty! All said, it was $83 with tip for about 4 ounces of fish, a bottle of San Pellegrino, and a glass of flavorless wine. When you look at it that way, it doesn't sound very impressive. But when you add in the visual impact and unbelievable flavors, especially of the amuse and the petite fours, then it's a completely different story.
