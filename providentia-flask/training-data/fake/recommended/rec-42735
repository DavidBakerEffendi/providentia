Perfect food and classy/warm ambiance, what's not to love about Print!? This place was not even on my "to visit" list, but my date randomly researched and picked based on other Yelp reviews. I'm glad that he did! I was so happy with my food! I got the crab salad for appetizer, and the scallops for entree. I didn't want either to end. The drinks were pretty good. We didn't get dessert, but I certainly will return and try that next time. My only gripe was our server, he was a bit inattentive for this level of dining. But overall it was a great experience. Definitely check it out when in Hells Kitchen!
