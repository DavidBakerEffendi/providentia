Came here with the wife on a busy weeknight, place was super packed around 8 pm and was told the wait would be about 1 hour.  The host was very nice and we were seated within about 45 minutes.   Sadly this was the only part of the night that surpassed expectations. Once seated we were left waiting for our server for 15 minutes.  When she finally showed up she took our drink orders and food orders.  As it was our first time here, I inquired as to how much food we should order.  It was around 9 pm and my wife and i were a bit hungry but the server assured us that 3 of their small plates would be sufficient.  "no worries" the server says, "the food comes out relatively fast and you can always order more" Well we waited and waited, meanwhile our water glass was generally not filled and our drinks took 20 minutes to show up.  Finally, when our food came we received 2 of our 3 dishes but the final dish (forgot what it was) took another 20 minutes after they cleared our table.  I thought they had forgotten the final dish since "the food comes out relatively fast".  When I flagged down the waitress she said that our final dish would take longer.  I think they forgot.   The food gets 3.5 stars as it wasnt bad but not great.  The service gets 1 star so 2 stars total.  With so many great places in the w. village not sure why we would return.
