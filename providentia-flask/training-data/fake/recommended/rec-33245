One of the best meals from a restaurant in a long while. Lamb hash was about as perfect a brunch fare as you can imagine. The Persian spread was tart and tempting as well. Staff is always friendly despite having to nearly bowl over people since it's such a narrow place, but that's part of the ambiance.
