Bad food and even worse service. I made the mistake of suggesting this for mothers day brunch based off of word of mouth - bad choice. We waited almost 45 minutes for our food, which we assumed meant it was because they were making it extra delicious - WRONG. Undercooked, sloppy, and we never once got our waters refilled. While our server was nice enough to apologize for our wait, it didn't come close to making up for our experience. Ill stick to Loco Pez when in that area.
