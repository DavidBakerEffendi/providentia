Just finished eating at this restaurant. AMAZING. Food is top notch and a great value. I can't help but call out Nick, the guy running the counter. This guy was on top of everything. He could tell we were new and walked us through every single step, explaining all of the ingredients. Even at the end when there was an issue with one of our items that another employee made, he went above and beyond to fix it. I don't know if he is the shift manager. If he was, he rocked. If not, he should have been. Attentive, friendly, responsive, and took full ownership of everything. He even talked with us after our meal, made sure everything was good, talked more about ingredients and philosophy on the best items there, and then personally shook our hands, welcomed us back, the works. Please congratulate Nick. He just made 2 (more) lifetime customers and huge fans.
