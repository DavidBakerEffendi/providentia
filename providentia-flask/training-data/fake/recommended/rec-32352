As someone who eats Vietnamese food at least once a week, I was very excited to try Mekong River and it did not disappoint. The interior is clean and the service excellent. Your water glass is always full and the waiters are extremely polite and accommodating. I have eaten here several times and the food is always fresh and wonderfully prepared. Some of their standout dishes include an excellent preparation of the Bo Luc Lac ( best I have had in the city) their raw beef salad which is a steal for $7 and any of the pork items. My favorite is the Bun Thit Nuong! It has tons of fresh veggies and the pork is perfectly BBQ'd. I highly recommend this place for a cheap, quality meal! They are still waiting on their liquor license, so BYO.
