It's amazing what a difference one letter can make. As a resident of Forest Hills, Queens my immediate impression when hearing of a place named "DaMikele" is that of a large, super-sized party place for the local Bukharian community. Turns out that particular place is DaMikelle, two l's versus one. With that clarified, I prepped myself for a Neapolitan-inspired menu from Michele Iuliano of Ovest and Luzzo's fame. On a Wednesday evening the place was fairly quiet. Airy, semi-industrial with a large bar offering up complimentary aperitivos, DaMikele's space was pleasant enough. What really primed my salivary pump was the literal sack of bread placed on the table after ordering. With plenty of olive oil and a single clove of garlic, the bread was fresh, crusty and delicious. I sliced and smashed the garlic before adding it to the dripping-in-olive-oil bread for a taste of Neapolitan nirvana. My wife and I shared a large pizza quadrata. (Quadra, quadralateral, why that's square! Thanks high school math!) For $19 (and an additional $2 for requesting sausage ), our pizza funghi's best feature was indeed the crust. Topping wise, this was fairly standard tomato, mozzarella and mushroom but what really distinguished the pie was the quality of the base. I kid you not that I'd have been quite content with simply the crust and not a single topping. The menu also features several oven baked Neapolitan specialties like cone shaped pizza or 'a cono which looked like a calzone but bigger. There is also a selection of focaccia breads with various toppings for $11. Including an appetizer of bresaola and salad, the final bill tally was only $33. And we left quite full as the large pizza can easily be shared by two people. (Along with the appetizer) Water refills were plentiful and service was friendly. I'd return to explore some of the other menu items and try the happy hour aperitivo specials. Just remember, one "l", not two and a world of culinary difference.
