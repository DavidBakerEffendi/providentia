You know what's a great snack?  Dumplings.  YES, always say yes to dumplings.  Don't resist the fattymonster in you and never say no to dumplings!  Especially here anyway.  After stuffing my face out all morning, I still have room for some more.  (I was on an eating tour.) Awesome filling, perfect thin skin, and at a cheap cheap price. Don't forget to get a sesame pancake to snack on while waiting for your main snack!
