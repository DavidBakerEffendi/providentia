Wife and I visited this place because my students said it was food. Service was average at best and beer selection was decent. On to the food. Wide had meatloaf and potatoes and they were great. I had there special which was Ribeye and a baked potato, potato was great but steak tasted like it was frozen and they slapped it on the grill with no seasoning what so ever. I had to season the meat myself with salt/pepper and had to use steak sauce, furthermore I also asked for med rare and came out med well. Not sure if the chef was having a bad day but food quality needs to be verified especially since there are many pubs in burlington. The decor is also out of date and needs to be updated.
