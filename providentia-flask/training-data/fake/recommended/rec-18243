This is one of the best Jamaican places here in Hartford! None of the other places make their food spicy enough for me without adding anything extra. This place cooks with just enough spices and I love it! If I also want it spicier, they give me jalapenos and more peppers. Great portions for decent prices. The staff is also wicked sweet and nice. I've been here two times already and I'm hooked!
