Sabrina's is a great place to eat breakfast. On a Saturday though, get there prior to 9 if you don't want to wait. Advise, bring along your own spoon. They never give you a spoon or a stirrer for your coffee, odd in a breakfast place. After our third visit we asked if they could PLEASE bring us spoons for our coffee.  He returned with 3 and informed us, "they are the only ones we have."  I'm not sure whether he was being funny or not. They have an inventive special list. In September there was a Simpsons theme. We went there twice in September. Two different times two different servers and I quoted the name of the special right from the menu, both times the waitron looked confused. The first time the waitron said, "I don't know the specials, they just changed them." Two weeks later, the same guy who told us that they only own 3 spoons, gave me a blank stare and then asked me whether I wanted a short stack or a large stack. I told him, "just bring me what's in the special page."  Another blank stare. There was only one size option and price on the page.  I will come back because the food is really great and I live in the neighborhood. But I wish the staff would get their act a little more together.
