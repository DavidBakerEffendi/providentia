This place has already been reviewed about a 100,000 times, but I wanted to add a brief review to make a couple points: First, our waitress, whose name I wish I could remember (she was young and blonde, with -- I believe -- a nose stud), was awesome.  We were fairly well-sauced on arrival, after spending a few hours at Proletariat and PDT across town, but she was as nice as could be.  And she gave us the recommendation of all time - the MUSHROOM CAPPELLACCI.  Incredibly silky pockets of luxurious pasta, which burst with creamy, mushroomy goodness when you bit into them.  The Italian maitre d', who shaved an entire truffle on top of it, also deserves a really positive shout-out.  We took a picture with both of them at the end of the meal. Second, the tomato and basil pasta, which I would never have ordered without reading the reviews here first, was just a incredible as everyone says.  Definitely make sure to get it. Overall, just an incredible place for pasta, and I'm sure pretty much everything else.
