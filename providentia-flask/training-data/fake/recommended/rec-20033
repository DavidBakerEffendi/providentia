One word: SCRUMPTIOUSNESS.  Wow, I can't get enough of this place.  I've been to brunch twice here and their specials are to die for.  First of all, get the biscuit with the apples and you will feel all warm and fuzzy.  Then try a special like beef and pork chili with a fried egg or the french toast topped with bananas in bourbon sauce.  The brunch is great - but I prefer bacon so I subbed out the ham for that thick cut cripsy and chewy yumminess.  It comes with fresh squeezed OJ and coffee that is really strong.  Did I mention it is house cured and thick cut?  I have yet to go back for dinner but I have a feeling it's in my future.  It's my pick for Smith Street brunch.
