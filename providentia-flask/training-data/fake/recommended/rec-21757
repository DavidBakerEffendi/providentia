This is one of our favorite local brunch spots, and we just had a party of 6 for dinner last night. They were short staffed because of Hurricane Sandy complications but they managed to deliver fabulous food with just minor delays. To make up for the timing, they sent out delicious little bites and even offered two free desserts. The plant-based food lovers and the omnivores were totally pleased. The only sour note was the loud, rockin' 70's music. It was pretty hard for us to hear each other, and the older folks in our party had a tough time with the noise.
