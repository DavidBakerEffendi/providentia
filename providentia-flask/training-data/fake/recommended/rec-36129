LOVE this place!!!  There are already tons of good, detailed reviews but I had to add my 5stars.   Great food, great service, great vibe.   The only problem is the wait but you can always get a snack next door at their bakery to tie you over but it takes a lot of self-control to limit your purchases there as well.   One of my "must have" meals every time I return to NYC.  Years ago when we lived in NJ, I actually ran into Yoko Ono in the ladies' room (lol).  One advice I have, would be "not" to order the bread basket at the restaurant (as tempting as that may be), save your stomach for the other dishes on the menu and buy assorted pastries from the bakery instead.  I felt the best thing in the basket was the sticky bun but i was already quite full after eating that (sharing, not the whole thing by myself) and wish I had saved room for dessert instead.  Oh, I miss NY -and Balthazar !!
