I've visited twice. The first time we were able to walk right in. The pizza was perfect in every way. Crispy, the right thickness, the perfect combo and amount of ingredients. The sauce was created to perfection, almost magic in nature. The second time we visited we waited in line for 2 hours. Was it worth it? Yes. The food was as good as the first time around. Had the 2 hour wait been our first time here, I think we would have given up in search of other nearby pizza. But, knowing is half the battle. Well worth the wait. If you have a choice of visitation time; choose to visit mid-afternoon on weekday. Avoid weekends at all costs.
