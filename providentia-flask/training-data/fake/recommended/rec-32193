I never eat burgers because I'm more of a pizza eater not a burger eater and all but I love the burgers at sketches they're DELICIOUS and the milk shakes are perfect! And even if you know you don't want a milkshake or a burger you can get some fries or a soda but either way you won't regret eating hear although the price is a little high just a little it's worth the taste and good feeling I hope this review helps you
