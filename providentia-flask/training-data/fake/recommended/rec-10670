As a resident of Boonton I've always walked by this place but never went in till recently. The place is small but that's what  I kind of like when I comes to a real Mexican joint, not some On the Boarder place. The prices here a pretty steep compared to most places ive been to but the food portions were pretty damn big. And now for what reviews should be about, taste. The ingredients are very fresh and composed perfectly into a savory authentic meal that makes you feel  like a true Mexican.
