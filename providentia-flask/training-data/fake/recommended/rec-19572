Great restaurant with authentic but creative Italian dishes, but a bit overpriced and perhaps over-hyped every since Philadelphia magazine listed it as #1 in it's top 50 restaurants. This place is worth going to juts for the Lombarda pizza - a thin crispy and smoky crust with sausage, bitto cheese (which tastes like very good mozzarella), and a delicious poached egg with liquid egg yolk that compliments the rest of the toppings perfectly. Definitely the best dish of my night. None of the pastas seemed that inspired and my ravioli with brown butter sauce was rich and delicious, but wasn't the creative or spectacular dish that I was expecting. Finally, the entree I got was the rabbit. I really shouldn't have gotten this dish, because I KNOW rabbit tastes like chicken and I always try to avoid getting chicken at nice restaurants, but my date really wanted to try this. Â It was braised and served over polenta which was thick and soft and very creamy. I actually enjoyed the polenta more than the rabbit, which a bit dried and yes, tasted like chicken. Overall, a decent meal, but I wouldn't call it the best restaurant in Philadelphia. Osteria should be treated like an italian osteria... go for the pizzas (which are definitely great) and maybe a salad or an appetizer and a drink or two.
