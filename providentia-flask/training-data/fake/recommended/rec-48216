I decided to try both Pat's and Philip's to settle this dispute. I got to say... after eating at Philip's at noon with the lunch crowd, this place deserves a higher rating. Here why I now think Philip's has the best cheesesteak in Philly (aka why I prefer Philip's over Pat's): +Pricing: You save $1.75 at Philip's. A cheesesteak with onions an cheese whiz goes for $9.50 at Pat's, while it is only $7.75 at Philip's. +Staff is a lot friendlier at Philip's. Plus, the guy that works the cash register is pretty cute ;p +Cheese whiz isn't overly salted at Philip's. Although Philip's cheese whiz is runny, it is nicely paired with a thick roll (and a few napkins) to slop up all dat cheese whiz. +After I eat a cheesesteak at Philip's, my stomach isn't filled with a deep pit of sorrow where all diet dreams go to die - like at Pat's. Pat's cheesesteaks are a heavier, and I left with a food coma. For me, I felt like the meat and rolls were comparable, and it really came down to the cheese whiz. Philip's cheesesteaks are a bit runny with a bit a cheese whiz leaking out, but I'm willing to deal with the mess for this AMAZING cheesesteak.
