Without a doubt, one of my favorite food and drinks places in the city.  My girlfriend and I fell in love with this little speakeasy the first time we came and have thoroughly enjoyed our times here everytime after. The food -  absolutely amazing!  I honestly feel that this place could be just as successful without the bar.  current favs:         BONE MARROW POPPERS - they come in 3s, but they can do 4s for couples looking to share).            the LINGUINE - i generally shy away from pasta without meat, but their linguine is so flavorful and masterfully seasoned, I find myself craving for it at random times.   The drinks:  at 15-16 a concoction, mainly gin/vodka mixes.  everything we've tried on the menu has been delish, some fruitier than others. The service:  so helpful and friendly that you forget you're in nyc.  out-of-staters, you know what i'm talking about.
