Love this place. The decor/atmosphere is perfect for a low-key night out with the girls, and the dinner food is solid. The chicken meatballs and grilled cheeses are good. The red velvet cake is to die for. I'm pretty picky when it comes to this cake variety (as in I refuse to eat it if it comes with vanilla frosting and not cream cheese frosting), but I think Penelope's is one of the best in the city. Super moist cake and they are generous with the cc frosting.
