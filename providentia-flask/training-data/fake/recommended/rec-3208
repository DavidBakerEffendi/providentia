The BEST burger in the city, hands down. So juicy and perfectly cooked...AND the bun is just right. My dad is old-school. He's from Irish stock by way of Boston. A real salt of the earth type guy. Â He doesn't care for pretension but loves a good burger and good conversation. When he was in town, I took him here for lunch. He couldn't have been happier. I love the dive bar atmosphere populated with hardscrabble New York characters and foodies who know this is where it's at for succulent burgers.
