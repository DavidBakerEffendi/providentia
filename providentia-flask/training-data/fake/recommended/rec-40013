I came here with my boyfriend for valentines day because he heard good things from friends. It's quite expensive but it was a special occasion and we decided to give it a go. We got the set tasting menu and were pretty pleased.  We ordered the crispy spinach salad with pomegranate, potato lollipops, lamp chops, venison, paneer and lobster.  The spinach salad was a bit heavy on the grease but tasty.  The potato lollipops were delicious and the sauce was a nice compliment.  I thought the venison was tender but I wasn't a fan of the gamey taste (but it was to be expected) The lobster was just ok and a bit chewy thought it had a nice flavor and sauce. The paneer and the lamb chops were really good.  I agreed with some other yelpers in that it was odd the waiter didn't ask for cooking preference on the meats, but in the end it was fine.  They accidentally brought us an order of the game hen and said we could just keep it. It was a nice surprise and had a good crisp skin!  Lastly we got the desert and the chocolate mousse which was yummy and I liked the real whipped cream. As for the carrot cake, not so much. It had a very gelatinous texture, not at all what you would call carrot cake in my opinion. Overall I think the food was good but it's too expensive for a typical week night date.  If you have the means, it's definitely worth a going.
