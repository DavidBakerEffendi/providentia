Totally suck up my political beliefs when ordering at Geno's. Joe V is just whacked. no other word for it... but on the flip side, love his sandwiches and fries! lesson one. when you say: "provolone with" that = 's a cheese steak with provolone AND onions. when you go to geno's or pats... please please please don't say... "i would like to order a cheesesteak with american cheese and onions..." have fun. sound like a native. "AMERICAN WITH!" (and step aside)...ala the soupnazi :) on cold nights... park on the street and eat in your car. Â the benches are very very cold. and in a drunken stupor ... don't argue politics with the very large man at the geno's counter..remember... they are making your food right?!! :-)
