Excellent place for cheap, delicious burger and fries (better than Five guys hands down). The burgers sauce is awesome and their other menu items, such as the chicken sausage are equally tasty. I also highly approve of restaurants that cater to canine companions as well. Nice touch :) The concrete's here are awesome. The La Colombe Coffee concrete and the Rittenhouse concrete are especially good. Their own beer brew is pretty tasty too. If you are not in the mood to spend $12 for a burger at the Village Whiskey (though totally worth it every now and then) this is an excellent option :)
