This is my first type having a cheesesteak at Pat's. They have lots of good reviews but I was expecting more. It's called cheesesteak but it was missing the cheese...  I'm sorry to say but their service is bad. The guy was looking angry and had that face like being sick of it.  Unfortunately I can give only 3 stars. Before giving the stars away I tried the same thing from their neighbors Geno's so I'll say a few words on their's profile as well.
