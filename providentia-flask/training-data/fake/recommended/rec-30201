This place literally oozes quality and yet has very affordable prices. I was there as my (adult) kids booked it for dinner on Father's day as I prefer to have my yellow lab around on holidays and sundays if I can while I eat out. So, the starting point was a dog-friendly place and is it one!  The chef makes a treat specially for clients with a canine companion that was showered on my dog while I waited for my kids to arrive. The food too is outstanding. I ordered the Mahi kebabs which had delicious sauce as a base with finely sliced pieces of carrots and pinenuts that tasted just perfect!  The outdoor sidewalk tables - dogs are not allowed inside  NYC restaurants  unlike say in Berlin or any number of international cities - are well laid out with sun-umbrellas to take the sting of the setting western sun. Certainly a place I plan on going back to - often!
