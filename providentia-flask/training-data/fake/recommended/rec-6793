The ingredients are so fresh! As a vegetarian, I love the capri. The other vegetarian sandwich, the verdura, is delicious but I'm personally not a big fan of smoky tastes.  Most of all, I love the little stuffed shooters you can buy on the side.  It is a pepper stuffed with herbed goat cheese...so tart and amazing.   I'm excited to see how this place progresses.  I hope they add a vegan option.
