The very kind waiter started reading the specials "Appetizers: Peel & Eat Crawdads" ...that's all I heard and I was SOLD! We started with yes - the crawdads, 4 oysters and a bottle of Vionger. I'm not an expert in Oysters - so we went with the waiters recommendations. They were GREAT! Served with some nice lemon, garlic and other dips/sauces. Then tackled the crawdads (given the choice - hot or cold. We took'em hot!) with a chipotle butter/mayo dip. My friend had the sole (I believe - Â I don't remember.) It was good. My "Sweet & Spicy Catfish" was perfect! Melted in my mouth. Served with mashed potato's and greens. We left full but not stuffed. It was perfect... The atmosphere? Awesome. Dimly lit, lots of dark natural wood. Casual/formal - could go either way. There's a bar in front. We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM. Had a drink at the bar (I was happy to order my hometown fav Anchor Steam), chatted with some local strangers that claim to be regulars and strongly suggested we get the raw bar platter (but that was a bit too steep for our wallets - looked great though), and sat down maybe 20 - 30 minutes later. Service? Excellent. Great wine selection - a large but definitely not overwhelming menu. Price? Totally fair for what it is - to do it right expect to spend $75 - $100 per person (including drinks, appetizers, entree and some tastings from the raw bar). If you live in New York or are just visiting Brooklyn. Blue Ribbon absolutely gets my recommendation.
