This place is really good.  However if you don't want to wait in line be sure to get there early as they don't take reservations and the wait can be very long.  My girlfriends and I got there around 8:50 am on a Friday morning and were told that we would be seated in about an hour.  They took down my girlfriends cell phone number and told her they would text her when our table was ready.  We walked around the neighborhood and ended up at a coffee shop close by and grabbed some iced teas, coffee while waiting for our table. What's funny is that while we were in line, someone in a cab yelled out his window "It's JUST PANCAKES!"  and that it wasn't worth the wait.   We waited for the rest of our group and they arrived around 9:50 AM.  Our table still wasn't ready and we had a tour to get to around 11:00 AM.  It was OK but we didn't get seated until 10:20 am but we had our order ready since we perused the menu prior to being seated.  We actually had everything written down since we knew we were very short on time.  We had approximately 10 minutes to scarf our food and our waitress was awesome because she gave us boxes and bags since she knew we were in a rush.   I tried the blueberry pancakes and they were AMAZING. Everything was fresh and local and it definitely reflects in the taste of their food.  Highly recommend but if you don't like to wait, get there early.
