I read a lot of great reviews of this place on different website before going and can say that I was very disappointed. The menu is small (brick chicken, beef brisket, turkey confit, chicken schitzel, sausage and mussels). My friend enjoyed the chicken schnitzel but my turkey confit was more like a pile of salty meat and a friend hated his brick chicken so much he resolved to eat left over chicken schnitzel that others didn't eat rather than continue eating it. As for the bar proper, I don't know how it got coined edgy. The decor looks like very suburban. But the worst part was that it was impossible to get a beer. I took me an hour to get my second beer. The servers were over worked. We kept reminding them about our second round of beer. We tried to get beer at the bar but you can only order from wait staff. A beer garden should, ABOVE ALL THINGS, provide easy access to beer.
