Let me start by saying that I went here once for dinner and liked it enough to go back. The food is great as is the wine. My first dining experience was positive enough to recommend a revisit for brunch with friends. The second time around however, I literally have never experienced such bad service. The restaurant does not have a lot of tables, and there were at least 5 people working. Hummus and pita is not a difficult thing to get out on a table, but it took them an hour. There were tables open when the three of us arrived and yet they could not seat us (why, I'm not sure.) At one point I noticed FOUR servers examining a ticket for the kitchen. Four. It was kind of baffling and laughable at first but then just became frustrating. Our server didn't write anything down them came back twice to ask us if he remembered our order correctly. I leave good tips out of habit which has got to stop. It took us two hours to dine here with very simple food and no cocktails. Will not be going back.
