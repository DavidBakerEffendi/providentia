Perilla was fun and delicious - would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could! Ate dinner there after receiving a 30% discount from Blackboard Eats (fantastic!). The food was great, atmosphere superb and the service was probably the best of the three criteria I just listed. What did we eat? - Farro Rissotto (as an appetizer) - AMAZING, prob my favorite dish of the night. It was a lot of food, so be prepared! - Crispy Lamb Prosciutto Crusted Lamb Belly appetizer - I've never had lamb like that before, it was very tasty - Trigger Fish with some sort of Thai curry - spicy and yummy - Tasting of Wild Boar - yup, you heard me, wild boar, in not one, not two, but THREE different ways. Who would've thought boar could be so versatile? The boar was interesting, different, but the taste was a little too salty for me... that was my only (small) qualm - Rhubarb Sundae for dessert - very interesting, the sundae was made of sour cream ice cream, which I really enjoyed All in all, a really great dinner. And now I guess I have a better gauge of what Top Chef dishes really taste like, instead of just drooling over it on the TV. A quick logistical side note - in terms of reservations, we didn't make one but still got in. For dinner, they hold 2 tables for walk-ins, we went at 7:00 on a Friday and one table was open.
