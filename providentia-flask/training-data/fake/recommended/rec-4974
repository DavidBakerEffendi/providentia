Place was amazing and the food was great. I give it 4 stars only because of the location. It's pretty small (I believe there's only seating for 6) but aside from that it was great. Will come here again. I advise not to bring a date here unless you want to take your food and go elsewhere to eat it. Getting a seat is hit or miss.
