This place should be renamed "Om nom Nam Son"  because despite it's location in what looks like a shady run down covered market which has it's own lot on 16th and Washington it's PHENOMENAL!!! Full Disclosure: I have only ever eaten the Bánh mì aka Vietnamese hoagie here and that's solely what this rating is based on but at $3.75 a piece there may not be a better deal anywhere... The first time I had one was this past new year's day while at the Mummer's parade.  It was so good in fact that two weeks later I had such a craving that I drove there at 8pm to get two of them. I'm drooling as I write this review...
