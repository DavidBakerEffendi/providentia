This place is amazing.  Seems like there would be more options for great ingredients, healthy, vegan and gluten free options in NYC.  This place knows what it is doing in that arena, and it does not taste like health food.   The drawback of course, is how expensive it is.  However, you are paying for what you get, which is high quality, healthy food.  And that is something I am worth investing in- but I wish there were some way to bring down the price to make it less of a splurge
