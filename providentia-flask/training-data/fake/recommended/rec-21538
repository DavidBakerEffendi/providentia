I am torn on this one.  I was very excited to stop in, as I live around the corner and an outdoor space is needed in the area...and this a huge improvement over the derelict warehouse occupying the space previously.  I will give this another go, but I hope a few tweaks are made The Good 1. Esthetically appealing outdoor space 2. Good Location 3. Many beer "stations" to accommodate volume The Ugly 1. Full Security team donning ear buds, incredibly tacky and ridiculous 2. Meat heads 3. Overpriced Beer 4. I heard there are velvet ropes, I did not see this.  If I do see this, its a deal-breaker #1 and #2 can be entertaining while enjoying #3
