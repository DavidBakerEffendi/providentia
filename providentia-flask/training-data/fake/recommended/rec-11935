YUM! Hour and a half wait aside, this place was worth it. Cozy, cute setting.. we were in a slightly awkward spot- 2 of us at the end of the long communal table but once we sat down we didn't feel the awkwardness.  We got the sliders which though appeared small, were very filling.  My favorite was the chicken with mushroom sauce.  We also tried the cauliflower side which was delicious.  Finished off the meal with one of their infamous (rightly so!) ice-cream sandwiches. Definitely a spot I'd recommend and return to!
