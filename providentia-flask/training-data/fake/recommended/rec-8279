There used to be lines out the door Â and around the corner for their salads, homemade turkey breast, ham, roast beef and pork. No more, there is rarely more than two people in line due to continued price increases over the past few years, since the new owner took over, that have nearly doubled prices. Salads are still good but I noticed that they are adding more dressing and less potato, macaroni, cole slaw, etc to increase profit. Same with fish cakes, more potato less fish and the Mac and cheese has less cheese than before and is bland where as before it was cheesy and flavorful.
