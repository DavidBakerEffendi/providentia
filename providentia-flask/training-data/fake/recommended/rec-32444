Best Pho in Central CT (5 stars is just for the pho).  Literally all they serve is pho and spring rolls.  It's a hole in the wall family-owned place (eat on folding card tables), so don't go if you're trying to impress someone with the decor, but if you really like pho this is the best in CT.  Pho Boston in West Hartford has a bigger menu but I've found their pho to be hit or miss... Ok broth but a lot of times their meat is really fatty.  501's broth is really good and they use pretty lean meat.  Le's Vietnamese down the road has other dishes that are good but 501's pho is much better.
