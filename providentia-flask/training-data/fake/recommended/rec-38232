For food and drink alone, Mezcal deserves five stars. The margaritas are DELICIOUS, and the food is fantastic (and, according to a Mexican friend, quite authentic). This is easily the best upscale Mexican food in New Haven, and, in my opinion, the best of the (very few) mid-priced restaurants in the downtown/East Rock area. You would be a fool to go elsewhere... ...unless you are in a hurry because the service is REALLY slow. It seems to me that they are perpetually understaffed, because while you can see that the waiters are working hard, it takes forever to get anything. The place is usually packed, and the slow turnover means that it can some time to get seated. But - and I say this as someone who absolutely refuses to go to places like Sally's and Pepe's - the food and drink at Mezcal are definitely worth your time. The margaritas might be the best I've ever had. And between the food, the drinks, and the fun and rowdy atmosphere, I've never gone to Mezcal and NOT had a great time.
