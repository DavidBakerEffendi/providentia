wowozers! Ordered the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen with a side of bakudan..and holy halloween batman, that dish was bangin!! I've been to a few ramen spots, and Ippudo by far served the meanest and most lust worthy veggie ramen lovefest, of them all! 2 bucks for a dollop of spicealicious chili paste sounds insane, but seriously worth it. It added an extra ummphh to my already amazing dish and my friend's tori ramen bowl. do it.
