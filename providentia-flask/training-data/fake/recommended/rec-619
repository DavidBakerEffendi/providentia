OH MON DIEU!  So good.  The pizza margherita is one of the best I've had...deeelish.  I also tried the white pizza with serrano.  It was good, but the ham was too salty and ended up eating the pizza without the ham. Must try.  Good for lunch, but much better after work or for dinner when the crowd is not rushing to get back to work.
