This used to be my go to place. The pizza and food were always great.  I felt they were the best in town but something has changed.  The quality of the food and what they serve has gone down the hill.  I think they are cheaping out on their ingredients and it shows.  I used to love their cheesesteaks, the last couple times I got, they steaks were tough.  Their garlic bread was the best, it was loaded with butter and garlic.  Now I am lucky if I can taste any butter or garlic.  Their pizza was awesome, perfect cheese, sauce to bread ratio.  Now it's all off.  Tonight was the last straw. I ordered the chicken marsala and the chicken was tough and when I was done, I felt horribly sick. I won't be eating from them again anytime soon. Update-My parents decided they wanted Vinnie's today for takeout and it was horrible.  They messed up the pizza by only putting toppings on only half the pie.  Luckily my dad caught it and had them fix it. But the fried calamari was another story. He didn't look at it till he got home.  The foam container was in the calamari and it was clearly deformed like they had microwaved it.  Then when we all started to eat the calamari and it was so tough.  They must have had the order sitting around and decided to microwave it to serve to us.
