It only feels like you're in line for the new iPhone but in reality you're just waiting to have dinner... There's no denying the food is excellent but the wait was ridiculous; told us 45 mins but ended up being an hour and a half, and that was with arriving at 9:30pm mind you. I understand waits can be crazy but just give me a more realistic estimate so I don't leave hating you. No utensils or napkins at our table; the waiters are so busy that it took awhile for these necessities to come to us. We were there for a specific dish and when we ordered the waiter told us they ran out of it. I asked if it's like this every weekend and he said no this is pretty calm believe it or not. Ok then how did you run out of a popular dish, especially when you were expecting the evening to be even busier... Makes no sense. Dinner plates were in front of us in about 9 mins; appetizers followed 2 mins after that. For a place that sees this crowd most weekends, they seemed frazzled and didn't have a good rhythm going. My advice--go on a weekday. For lunch.
