I got a reservation for a Saturday night in January and didn't realize at the time how lucky that was. There is a line outside before it even opens at 6pm with some of those folks having reservations and others just showing up for tables at will. It is a little confusing but if you do have a reservation you will get your seat and people who don't even if in front of you in line will wait. We got the Hot Pot tasting menu and were stunned by the relative cheapness (of both food and alcohol), the sheer amount of food and most importantly the quality and variety of taste in each course. It is a place to go back too and was amazing given how cold it was out. The servers are friendly and the decor is very Japanese. Will be back and highly recommend.
