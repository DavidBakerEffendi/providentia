A solid four stars. Servers were great, super fast and polite. The food was delicious my group had the Salmon Tartine, Escargot, Moules Frite, and Steak Tartar. All of the dishes (except the Steak Tartar) were fantastic. The steak tartar is what beings this down to the 4/3.5 range. It had a very odd after taste, the steak quality was wonderful, but the quail egg might be too much for the overall flavor. Very odd dish, yet it was a top recommendation. Great place otherwise, would do it again!
