Some come to the Neue Galerie for the German and Austrian art, from Klimt and Klee to Loos and the Bauhaus, but foodies in the know give the masterpieces a cursory glance then slip into Cafe Sabarsky, the musuem's homage to turn-of-the-century Vienniese cafes, where apple strudel, opera cake and brioche are works of art in their own right. The hot chocolate, served unsweetened on a silver tray, is a very grown-up indulgence, as is the elderflower soda. In addition to the sweets, there is a savory menu and as of late, my favorite has to be the spicy eggs with cornichons and paprika.
