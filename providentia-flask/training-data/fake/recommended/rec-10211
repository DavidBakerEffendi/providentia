One of the best Greek restaurants I've been to.  We went with a group of 6 people and shared some appetizers and dishes and they were all amazing.  Waiter was very helpful with entree selection.  The pasta with rabbit was delicious complimented with a bottle of Mythic red wine.  The wine was very smooth with fruity aromas.  Highly recommended.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate mousse which was tasty but was more like cheesecake/fudge since it was dense.  We also had the Greek dessert that starts with a "G" which was like flan but with a hard top layer.  The rice pudding was also good which came in a medium sized ice cream float cup. As for the restaurant itself, there are a quite a number of tables plus additional tables downstairs in the back.  You can also dine at the bar.
