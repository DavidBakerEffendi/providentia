So I had to go visit this place as it receives so much hype from the one in New York! And if you're new to Shakeshack, after you order from the register, they give you a little plastic contraption that will light up when they're ready for you to pick up your food so you can seat yourself first instead of standing around waiting for your order. Of course, I had the Shack burger. (Being that it's their house burger... and one's house burger should definitely be telling of how good the rest of their food is in general.) It was delicious! The burger patty was juicy, the bread became very flavorful from soaking up the oil and meat juices, and that shack sauce really tasty and ties the taste all together. If I had to describe the shake sauce, it's kind of like their own special mix of mayo with a hint of savory sourness. It tastes good though, trust me. Although I wish the burger was a bit bigger given the price - it's about the same size as a McDonald's burger, except double/triple the price. I also had a Black and White shake, since I just kind of had to try the shakes from a place called SHAKEshack. It was Â a vanilla shake with fudge chunks blended into it. It tasted alright, but it was a little too sweet and way too thick for my liking. Probably wouldn't get a shake again if they're all the same consistency. Lastly, I have to give an A+++ for their staff, they're definitely very nice and friendly despite the hustle and bustle of 30+ people in line. They also passed out little samples of smores ice cream while people waited in line as to lessen the long wait time impatience of customers. Was not needed, but definitely a very nice and tasty touch! I'd definitely be up for returning to try more here with friends!
