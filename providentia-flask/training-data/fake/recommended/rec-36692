Ok, of the 667 people that have already reviewed Balth I'm sure at least 665 of them will talk about the steak frite, brunch, etc. so I won't go there.  Two things to definitely try. 1.  Roasted lamb sandwich for lunch.  This is amazing. 2.  Duck Confit Sheppards Pie.  It is rich rich rich and best eaten on cold night, but damn is that a unique and satisfying dish. Great bar.  Service surprisingly good and unpretentious for such a popular hip place.  Been around a while but this place is still damn good.
