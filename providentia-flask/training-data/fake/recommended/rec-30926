Best scones. The only thing that would make them better is if they made different kinds more often.Traditionally heavy and on the soda side [vs flaky and buttery]. A classic French scone vs a British scone. Everything on the menu is fresh, creative, and DELICIOUS. The folks have a refined palate for comfort food.Purchase your goodies through the walk-up window, which is adorable.
