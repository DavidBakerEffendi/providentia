Talk about pork overload!   We ordered the Tonsaku Hot Pot - it seemed like it took forever before we could eat from it. They serve it to you, which I thought was a nice gesture. You really have to dig for the meat, and there were like three dumplings for the three of us. This hot pot is definitely not for the meat lovers out there.  We got bibimbap afterwards in our hot pot and they ask you how many portions you want and based on that is how they charge you.  We got 2 portions at $4 so that was $8 for spicy rice which we could barely finish.  What a waste! Mostly veggies in the hot pot, so I guess this is a healthier choice than the Fried Chicken Wings we also ordered.  They were a bit mushy and sweet for my taste.  I like the Tebaya Wings better.   Grilled Tonsaku with Spicy Sauce - spicier than I thought, my tongue was on fire afterwards.  The pig's feet was a bit ooey gooey for my palate, sort of like mochi with bones, weird in a way & I'm still not sure whether I like it or not. Where has this pig been running? The sizzling Homemade Gyoza barely made an impression on me. Not to be harsh, but I was starving and this gyoza didn't do anything for me. I guess I'm just a gyoza snob. I was disappointed because they actually ran out of sesame ice cream.  80 degree weather and they couldn't provide me with any relief.  However, we did get the Tea Infused Creme Brulee with Green Tea Ice Cream, which was a nice surprise.
