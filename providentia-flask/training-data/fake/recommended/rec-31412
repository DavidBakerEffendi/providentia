I had been to Room Service a long time ago, and while spending some time in Midtown with the beau, we decided to stop in for a bite and a drink. I've always really liked the decor inside, it has a swanky look/feel to it, with a giant chandelier in a glass case with one side that's shattered.  Oops. Anyway, we stopped in on a Saturday and had their lunch special - I had the kee mao with steamed chicken & shrimp dumplings (which were included free) and my boyfriend the spicy basil fried rice with chicken satay. We also ordered the lychee sangria to drink, and it comes in a half liter carafe.  Its sort of deceiving, you think its going to be enough to share but it ends up being 2 small wine glass servings per person.  It was mighty tasty but then I opted for the Room With a View cocktail and it was fantastic. The food did not take long and for being the lunch special, I thought was a generous portion.  I really really liked my kee mao.  All in all it was a great lunch and I'm glad to have stopped by again!
