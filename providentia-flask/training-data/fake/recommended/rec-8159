Went to White Dog for brunch and it was amazing.  I went half-sies with my husband (he got the steak salad, I got the brioche french toast with peach compote) and everything was delicious.  Love to eat local/organic/seasonal, esp. when they know what to do with the ingredients and I was not disappointed. The decor in the room I was in was great.  Dark woods, heavy wallpaper and curtains, very British.  Overall a great experience and I'll be back for more!
