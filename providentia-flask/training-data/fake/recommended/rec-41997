I use to always go to the Cantina in South Philly and I loved it though some of the staff was questionable. So I was ecstatic to say the least when I saw that they were opening another around the corner from my work. I have been going to this Cantina consistently for the past year (their one year is tomorrow) and I cant imagine going anywhere else. I love the staff and they have always been extremely accommodating when needed. If they recognize you, they will make an effort to talk to you and see how you are. No better way to get someone to come back then by making them feel welcome. They play the sports games in the bar when they are on and that can always be a good time. It feels like a neighborhood bar even though I would not categorize it as that. The drinks are good and their happy hour specials are even better. I am a fan of pretty much everything on their menu and most of the time their salsa is to die for (its been a miss a couple times). I love the Mixta salad and the mushroom quesadillas. It has gotten to the point that I eat their so much that I have to cut myself off. I still go their for drinks though, I cant get enough of this place!
