After trying the competition across the street, we made our way to Pat's. At a glance, it was the classier of the two rivals. Pat's striped awning sprouts from a very delicate, white Victorianesque building. A "no fuss, no muss" style of decor. Their steaks were so aromatic, my mouth watered just upon approaching. The meat was juicer, the cheese thick but not unbearable, and the onions sweet with just a hint of bite. The cheese fries, I assume using the same whiz as Geno's but perhaps cut with some actual cheese, were even better. Apparently the late-night crowds agreed with us; the line traveled around the block and all the outdoor seating was taken. Compared to the handful of customers at Geno's...well Pat's is the undisputed King of Steaks. Friendly and efficient service, even the customers were lovely. Still not an overwhelming sandwich for ten dollars, but much more savory and worthy of a repeat.
