Guys, can you believe it's been a whole year! Honeygrow has since expanded their locations and menu and I couldn't love this place more if I tried. I literally recommend it to everyone visiting Philadelphia for their first or 100th time. My favorite change of all the changes made over the last year was the addition of brown rice for stir-fry options. Additionally, I love the boards posted on the walls noting the farms being used on a daily basis, way to give the local guys credibility, it's so refreshing. I have never had a bad visit and I'm really happy to see how far the place has come.
