Great brunch ....UnGreat Waitress. Not a smile, not a "how is your food", not a "how was your food",  She brought us check before we were even done and didn't ask what drinks we wanted for our free brunch drink  and seemed bothered when we reminded her about it. I think i heard a soft thank you at the very end?? i mean i have waited tables it is not a party and maybe she was having a bad day but that was the coldest service we have ever had at a restaurant ... my regular diner has more friendly service. The host was great and so were our meals.
