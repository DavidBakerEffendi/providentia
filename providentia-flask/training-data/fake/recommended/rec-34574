The outdoor seating is great on a beautiful day. I highly recommend sitting here because the inside smelled stale and stuffy when I walked through. Unfortunately, after months of wanting to try this place, I was left disappointed. Boyfriend and I shared a roast chicken/mozzarella/arugula panini and the avocado/mozzarella/mushroom/black pepper panini. The chicken was terrible...dry, chewy, and smothered with spicy mayo. It left much to be desired, especially because I still have fond memories of amazing chicken paninis elsewhere. The avocado panini was better but the only thing I could really taste was the overabundance of black pepper. For paninis, I would still go to Press 195. There was nothing wrong with this place, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype on Yelp.
