Had the Mesibah with my wife.  It was a lot of food for the both of us especially since I seemed to be eating 2/3 and her just 1/3. The hummus was quite tasty and more creamy than the usual hummus I get from the supermarket.  Then a selection of mini-salads were brought out (similar to ban chan at a Korean restaurant). This was followed by 3-4 smaller tapas style plates.  Nothing stood out but they all tasted great.  The lamb was next which was quite a bit of meat.  It was accompanied by some crispy rice and chickpeas.  Came right off the bone, very juicy and flavorful.  I wish I could have some right now as a matter of fact.  But if you have to like meat (obviously) because aside from some skin which adds subtle flavor, it's all lamb. Finished with two desserts.  Overall a pleasant experience with on-the-ball service.  Just wish my stupid hotel had an in-room fridge so I could eat the lamb later...
