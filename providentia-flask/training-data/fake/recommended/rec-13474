I love me a good burger.  Shake Shack and Paul's are my favorite.  I've heard about Corner Bistro's burger but I'm rarely in this 'hood.  Thanks to Hurricane Irene, I happened to be staying nearby and now was my chance. Dimly lit bar. CHECK. McSorley's on tap.  DOUBLE FRIGGIN CHECK! Open during a hurricane. Check. Grimey bar that's older than my dad. Check I moseyed on down to a bar stool and plopped down for a Bistro Burger and McSorley's dark. The burger: it's a masterpiece.  Nothing too fancy, no truffled mayo or organic guac or fancy bread from some bakery I never hear of.  The patty is a thick, juicy, medium rare piece of heaven.  The patties are thick, flame broiled, seasoned simply, and just crumble perfectly as you bite into it.  For a few seconds, I'm instantly teleported to a happier place in my mind, where the grass is always freshly cut, the temperature is a breezy 70 degrees, roller coasters and old school bowling alleys are a just around the corner and everyone you love never goes away. The bacon on top was deep fried to perfection and complimented the burger perfectly, like peas and carrots.  The cheese melted nicely and lovingly on the patty.  Did SpongeBob make this burger?  Who's in that kitchen??  I want to adopt him/her.  I'll be back, Corner Bistro. You can count on it!
