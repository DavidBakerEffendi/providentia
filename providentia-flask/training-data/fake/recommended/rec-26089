I took some family friends here for dinner on a Monday night based on the reviews I read. I was looking for a simple Italian place near City Hall. Once we figured out the address (the whole string of stores and cafes on that Church St. block has the same address!), we got to our table. The wait staff was very helpful, patient and friendly (and gave us a good wine rec.). Note: CASH ONLY The cafe itself is teenie weenie.. a handful of tables right in the middle of the food prep. The lighting is very dark. The bathroom is up a very narrow, kind of dangerous spiral staircase, through a narrow food prep area, and then in a tiny room with a pull-flush. I wasn't very comfortable telling the guys upstairs who were chopping veggies that the bathroom was out of TP. The food was very fresh and the portions were right on. Of the four pasta dishes we had, two of us had very chewy pasta that really put a damper on the meal. The desserts (sorbet, and vanilla ice cream with espresso) were big hits. I think this place is nice for a run-in, and would have gotten 5-stars if not for the chewy pasta (at an "authentic" Italian place) and the scary bathroom climbing adventure.
