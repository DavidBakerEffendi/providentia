Fantastic happy hour, and a lovely location. Sitting outside when it's nice out is fantastic. Great beer selection! The happy hour appetizers are lackluster.  The bartenders are a little weird and grumpy though.  That being said, they did let me still have happy hour prices when I ordered at 6:58 and it ends at 7:00 pm
