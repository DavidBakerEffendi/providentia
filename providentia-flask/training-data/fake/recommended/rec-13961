If you read any of my reviews, you'll know I'm a recovering vegetarian.  I also grew up thinking pork was unkosher and therefore, just not something I should ever eat.   Fast foward to a few weeks ago when one of my friends and suddenly had a soup craving while walking around the city.  Luckily we were 3 blocks away from Ippudo, where she'd tried to go before, but couldn't stand waiting hours to be seated.  At 5pm on a Sunday, the wait should have been 45, and we were seated within 20.  She insisted we get the pork buns... which were AMAZING.   Then, the ramen.  DAMN.  Just plain incredible.  So filling and totally umami.
