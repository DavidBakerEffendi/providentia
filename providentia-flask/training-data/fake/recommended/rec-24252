Thank God for Yelp! b/c otherwise how would anyone find these tiny places. And this place was well worth finding. Courteous, quick service. Tasty chips and 2 sauces, both worth trying. Server offered suggestions and even offered ideas for our son. Hubby & I both ordered steak enchiladas with mole sauce and rice and a chicken taco for the munchkin. Our huge plates were overflowing with food and they put so much chicken on our sons plate, he ended up with 2 tacos. Top it off with a huge selection of beverages (hey, it's a corner market, so they've got everything), and we were waddling out the door.
