My last night of my most recent trip was spent here, first time for me having Portuguese food and it was a great new category for me.  I even think my wife would like this place.  Maybe I was just glad to be going home but I enjoyed the food, the restaurant and the entire dining experience. I love shrimp so I tried their spicy shrimp and rice dish and was very happy with it.  Not too spicy and lots of shrimp. Good to know there's a place I really enjoy for when I am out here again.
