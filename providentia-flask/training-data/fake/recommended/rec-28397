I went here for brunch today and I have to say, the food is solid. I had the poached eggs and my friend had the rye benedict and they were both impressive! The eggs were poached perfectly and the sauces that accompanied them were pure, buttery goodness! I think I was a bigger fan of the "poached eggs" dish as the virginia ham was salty and the moray sauce was worth closing my eyes and wishing I could put it on everything. The only issue I have is due to the attitude there. Our waiter, Brady had the hipster "don't give a damn" demeanor down pat but as a patron, it was obnoxious. He's one of those waiters who makes you feel bad if you ONLY get an entree, lacks the ability to make eye contact and makes you feel like you are bothersome. They might want to look into that because the food was good!
