Oysters. Here! Inexpensive and almost always cleaned well. As good as or better than anywhere else in the city. Service is great. Servers are knowledgeable, clean and well groomed. Food is great. Drink selection is diverse. Cool hip crowd. Never too noisy. Simple all around good time. The wait is worth it even on a busy night.
