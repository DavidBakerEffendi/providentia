Great place for brunch. Make sure to go all the way to the back if you have to wait for a table. There is a fire place and seating in a cozy back room that has a skylight window. I had the pancakes when I was there and they were HUGE. It's like you're getting a personal 2 layer cake. With everyone helping out I still had one whole pancake left. It was delicious and the group I was with enjoyed their food as well. The service could have been better..
