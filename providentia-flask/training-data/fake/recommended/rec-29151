I cannot even express how amazingly DELICIOUS these cheese steaks were. My mouth is still watering a few days later. We were in town visiting family and after all of the "holiday food" I said that I must have a good cheese steak. This place came highly recommended by the extended family. I ordered the cheese steak with mushroom and provolone cheese. Oh em gee....I ate every single bite. The bread was incredible and even after the transport back to the house the bread was not soggy, cheese steaks were still hot and I really enjoyed every single bite. THANK YOU for not disappointing me and I WILL be back soon!!!
