There are very few Mexican places in and around Montclair and so far, Senorita's is the best.  Unfortunately that isn't saying much if you love real Mexican food.  The chips and salsa are fine, and there is a drink special most nights which helps the rest of the food go down.  I have eaten there several times with my family, who are avid fans of the cheese enchiladas and shrimp tequila for some reason. The biggest problem is that the dishes are lackluster and watered down.  There isn't a lot of depth of flavor or spice.  This is gringo food.  I did order the tortilla soup and cuitlacoche quesadillas and those were appreciably better and more authentic.  Recommended over Mexicali Rose or Tinga's Taqueria.  Still, not particularly recommended.
