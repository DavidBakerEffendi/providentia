I was afraid that we had picked the wrong time to eat here. Friday afternoon lunch was packed. But we had just flown in from Miami with no reservation and hoped for the best. Well, as expected, it was a bit of a wait, but it was well worth our time. The food was absolutely perfect and the energy and vibe were intoxicating...or maybe that was the 4 scotches I had... either way, this plays rocks!
