If I could choose the way to die, I would probably opt for a heart attack after the pulled pork sandwich and the sweet potato fries at this place. I have been blessed by living across the street of this cozy, unpretentious restaurant that features very good food, kind management and fine art hanging on the walls. One star less because it's only cash.
