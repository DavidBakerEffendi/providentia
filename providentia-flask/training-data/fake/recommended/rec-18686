Great food and service!  We were in Philly from NYC, went on a Friday night and were lucky and got a table at 815.  The service from entry to exit was very friendly and helpful.  We opted for the $65 chef's tasting menu (it comes in three choices $45, $55 or $65) and we were so stuffed!  A few of the highlights were the jamon serrano, tuna dip with pita crackers, short rib flat bread and the seabass. There were about 10 tapas on our menu.  The specialty drinks are also very inventive and tasty. Definitely recommend if you are visiting Philly!
