Delicious food, but be wary of the french-looking wild haired gentleman who sits behind the bar not serving drinks and looking aloof. In between soulful gazes into the distance, he occasionally does laps of the restaurant, looking suave and important, but don't be fooled. He is not your waiter, and will bluntly remind you of that if you mistakenly think he is because your waiter has disappeared for an extended period of time. At first glance, we assumed he was the host, but rejected that hypothesis after he greeted diners with casual shrugs as the entered the restaurant.
