I've actually eaten here before and was satisfied with the katsu curry dish but this evening my date and I were mislead by the recommedations of the waiter and was nickel and dimed at every turn. The food was decent although the set meals seemed smaller than expected as opposed to the curry dishes. The occurrence that really threw us for a loop was the waiter recommended we get the katsu set and order an additional order of curry as opposed to just getting the katsu curry. DON'T DO IT! The waiter forgot to mention that the side curry cost an additional $8! A small bowl for $8?! Ridiculous! So the katsu is $15 and the curry side order is $8 for a total of $23. You can have the same meal for $11 if you just order the katsu curry! Albeit with one less piece of chicken. Â I also asked for more ice tea and they charged me full price for another drink. This is read "NO FREE REFILLS"! On ice tea??? I wasnt ordering a beer and asking for a refill. The waiter also didn't mention this... Come on, times are tough but stop with this crappy service.
