I liked it. The meat was well cooked and I think i got a perfect version of their cheese steak. I could do with more flavor though. I personally prefer the non Philly Philly cheese steak with white cheese and grilled onions and peppers. The cheese fries were pretty damn good though. I didn't go to Pat's but i would venture to guess they are exactly the same. It was a good value and I'm glad I can say I went here, It was a cool experience.
