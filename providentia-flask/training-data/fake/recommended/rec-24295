I needed a place to stop for a quick and cheap dinner before a movie, so after some quick Yelping I came across Nanzhou. Glad I did! The place is pretty small, but has also been uncrowded every time I stopped in. The menu basically just consists of appetizers and soup, but the options within are varied. I've only been twice and ordered the duck once, and oxtail once, both with the hand drawn noodles (as opposed to shaved). Both were excellent! Big piles of thick and imperfectly cut noodles in the middle of a big bowl of broth surrounded by hunks of meat still on the bone and topped with scallions and some vegetable that looked like celery but had a pickle flavor. (Sorry, don't know my exotic veggies very well, but it was a great addition.) They also have Sriracha chili sauce which I love adding to give it a kick. My method is basically to get chopsticks in my right hand, spoon in left and just scoop up whatever I can get with either one. This can lead to a bit of a mess but it's well worth it. Tasty and filling soup that hits the spot when you want something wholesome and hearty. Super cheap, fast service, and air conditioning so you can enjoy it year round.
