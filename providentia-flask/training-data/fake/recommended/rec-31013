I can't say enough good things about In Riva! On our trip to Philly this summer we were looking for dog friendly places and hit the jackpot with In Riva. The food is great - we especially loved trying the 3 pastas for $35. The best part was that our dog was able to be off leash running around while we ate at our own private picnic table. The waiters were so helpful and we especially loved that they gave our pup some love!
