I went to this place around 530pm on a Saturday, maybe one other table in the whole place. The sat me and my boyfriend at a very small table. When we asked to be moved to a bigger table to be able to order more food, they said they couldnt just incase it got busy. Sad to say, we walked out. Very unfriendly service!
