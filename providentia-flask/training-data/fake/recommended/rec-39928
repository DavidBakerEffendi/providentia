Okay. We stayed in a local hotel last weekend and decided to ask the concierge "What are the must do's in the area?"  The response was a map with pin points and the " Must Do" was this pizza place that is located just under the Brooklyn Bridge. When we arrived there was a line, which was a good sign that we were about to embark on some good eats!  As patrons were leaving, they would say things like...loved it!...great food!  I can tell you that I actually got excited to taste this famous brick oven pizza. We waited in line about 15 minutes and then were taken upstairs to our table.  Our waiter appeared as if he could care less if we were there or not.  There was no warm greeting or explanation of anything on the menu.  It was as if he expected us to just know.  We ordered an antipasto salad and a small pie. Thankfully, we ordered that salad, because it took a very long time for our pizza to arrive. The pizza was so chewy, my jaw started to hurt.  The ingredients were clearly fresh, but we couldn't get past how tough the dough was.  Not to mention our waiter never came back to check on us.  We ultimately had to get another waiter to give us our final bill. If your in Brooklyn and are trying to find a good place to eat pizza...DONT GO HERE!!!
