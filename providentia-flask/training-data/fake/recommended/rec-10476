really as good as it gets. since i first ate here a few weeks ago, i've been back 3 times and have had recurring dreams about tonsoku hot pot. it's heartier and more complex than any ramen, and then when they add the ramen to the leftover broth, it's the best ramen i've ever had. the pickles of the day are tremendous, as is any of the sushi and sashimi. the service is attentive and incredibly friendly. the girls are all so nice and very cute! hard to get reservations. plan ahead.
