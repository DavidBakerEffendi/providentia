yelp guided us to hagi under false pretenses of sushi, yet we were hardly disappointed in what we found instead. the crowded, difficult to find, forever wait-listed restaurant was definitely authentic yet hardly vegetarian hostile. we shared four varieties of soybean product, all were delicious, though the agedashi was hands down the tastiest.
