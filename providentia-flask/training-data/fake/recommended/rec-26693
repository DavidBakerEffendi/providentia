By far my favorite sushi spot in the city and my attendance record can prove that.  I bring all out of town visitors here without hesitation.  I also introduce anyone in the area that has never been to this wonderful gem.  The spicy tuna is amazing - no chopped up paste like everywhere else, they give real hunks of meat.  My favorite would have to be the Spartan roll not only for the flavor but also the creativity I've never seen elsewhere.  Must try!
