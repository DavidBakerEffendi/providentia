Went here for the first time last Friday night.  Was very excited as my cousin spoke highly of Ola.  I was the first to arrive in my party and was sat at the table.  I ordered the jalapeno pineapple marg, it was quite tasty.  When ordering we asked for suggestions from our waitress and she wasn't very helpful.   Working in the industry you should be able to sell your menu, that's just my opinion.  My sister and cousin ordered the skirt steak and when the food runner brought the food to the table she just kept saying medium.  I think the food runner should know the food she is running and also where it is going.  In the midst of her confusion she stood there waiting for help while the food was getting cold.  I ordered the shrimp dish, it was good, not too flavorful.  The guac was good and also the dip they served w the bread was tasty as well.  I would give them one more chance just out of curiosity.
