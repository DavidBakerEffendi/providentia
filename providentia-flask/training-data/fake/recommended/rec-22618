The pizza is fine, but not somewhat better, nor marginally cheaper than our other favorite pizza joints. The restaurant is in the back right next to the open kitchen.  The place seems to cater families with kids, and as a result it is extremely noisy.  The bathroom is situated right off the main dining room and uses a loud hand dryer which you hear every time someone, especially the many eager children, goes to the bathroom.  It's somewhat unappealing to have your awareness drawn to the activities taking place in the bathroom. Although I'm glad we went because my curiosity about this restaurant was satisfied, I wouldn't go back.
