I love Hakata Tonton. I can only think of positive things to say about it. The first time I tried this place was by pure luck...my wife and I noticed the pig logo while walking around in the area, just walked in and got a table. I didn't even check the reviews or anything. The place turned out to be awesome...an authentic Japanese restaurant, specializing in pork. And for sure, they know what to do with it. As other reviewers have pointed out, the fried gyoza appetizer is a must have. The meat and the skin both taste incredibly fresh. I'm pretty certain they make these in house from scratch. The Pork Tonsoku (grilled pig's feet), are another item you can't miss. Even if you're not a huge fan of pig's feet, the seasonings and crispy skin will make you really glad you ordered it. We got a Hakata Tonton hotpot for two, which was really comforting given the cold weather and the fact that it was a Friday night after a long work week. The service was excellent, as you'd expect from a place like this. The chef even held the door for us as we left the place and gave us a piece of candy from a Pez dispenser! Now that's class!
