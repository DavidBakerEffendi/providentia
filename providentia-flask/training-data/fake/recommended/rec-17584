It seems like this place is hit or miss with people. As soon as you exit your car in the parking lot, you can already smell what's cooking in Cuban Pete's kitchen. The restaurant itself feels like a mini-Havana, with outdoor seating integrated with indoor and cute decor. I had the churrasco (skirt steak) with yellow rice, and it was very flavorful and tender. I was happy to take what I coudn't finish from my portion home for lunch the next day. Our table had the limonada with red wine; for an extra $15, we were better off just having them serve the wine alone with some sliced fruit to throw in. Pricing was surprisingly fair for the amount of GOOD food you get. I have to agree with the other reviews, though, that the atmosphere is very loud since I couldn't hear the person sitting across from me. Also, I couldn't even hear our waiter, which probably explains why he mistook our order... twice. I will come back here for the food, but certainly not for a date night, or any night in which conversation is the central part of the meal.
