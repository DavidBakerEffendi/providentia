Real pizza is Neapolitan Pizza, that is where what we call Pizza in America began, Naple,s Italy, And there are few restaurants that get is as right as Bivio. Had two amazing Pizzas last night, just love this place. Though we always go during the week, because on the weekend Bivio is just so popular, the line can get long. Started with a great Arugula salad and after  the pies a delectable pumpkin bourbon cheese cake  for dessert. It is a small place with a charming atmosphere and great staff. Grab a bottle of good Italian wine and go here.
