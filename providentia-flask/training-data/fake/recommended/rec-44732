Let's start with the fact that it was my 21st birthday and a pipe burst in my apartment. Boy what a blast. We were late to our reservation (naturally), but they were really accommodating and sweet! Food was fantastic--especially the meatball sliders and the corn soup. When I found out about the cake coming out, they also sent out beignets as a surprise! Which lemme tell you....my mouth exploded. Had a great birthday dinner and almost forgot that I had no ceiling back at home.
