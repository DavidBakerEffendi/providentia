Topas Thai is my husband and I's absolute favorite restaurant in New Jersey. Its the one we always tell people they must try. I've never been disappointed ordering from the specials menu, although we tend to get the same things over and over because they're soooo good. We love: thai tacos, ribs, pork yum. The fall specials with pumpkin are also delicious! The deep fried oreo/brownie and pound cake deserts are also great, I like to save some of my dinner to take home so I can save room for desert - bonus, I get Topaz for lunch the next day!
