They have corn and white flour empanadas. I love yhe corn empanadas and my husband loves the flour one. Tgey have a variety of choices to order from. The green sauce isn't the best but accceptable. The space is small so we tend to take out the empanadas. Â On certain days the place gets packed and you have to eait outside in the cold.
