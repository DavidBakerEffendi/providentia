I came with 2 other friends on a Wednesday night and it was pretty crowded. They won't seat you until your entire party is there so the area by the door was insane. I feel bad for the 2 people who sat right in front of the door as they were getting brushed/bumped by other people. The ambiance and decor is super chic and trendy as many reviewers mentioned. I ordered the Tamarind Dish with beef. I'm impressed with how fast it came to the table, literally less than 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the dish was bland and flavorless, a serious offense for a Thai place. The beef was not crisp although the description says it's battered and deep fried. It was kind of mushy, probably from mingling with the sauce, which I could have overlooked if the dish was amazing. Also, I felt very rushed. Once we got our food, our server never came back and only came when he saw our dishes were ready to be removed. They did offer dessert politely but you can feel them trying to kick you out ASAP. I hate that feeling. Busy night or not, don't rush me when I'm spending money at your restaurant. Needless to say, I'll trade the chic and trendy decor for tasty food and a relaxed atmosphere.
