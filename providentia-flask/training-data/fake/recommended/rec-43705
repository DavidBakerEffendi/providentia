4 star for NYC - 3 Star Overall compared to Mexican food in states where the mexican food is abundant. Review For New Yorkers I love that the tacos are made fresh to order. You see the meat being grilled, the veggies chopped. The pork is crispy, and nicely seasoned. The tortillas are grilled. The meal is cheap and tasty. They sell Taquete beer. A perfect combo. Review from LA It is a good tacos joint for NYC. Similar to a lot of small fresh taco places in Los Angeles/California. They could have more salsas. The place is rather small and the line pretty long. The tortillas are average.
