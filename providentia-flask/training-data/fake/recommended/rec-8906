Everything about Umami burger seems to be targeted towards the Yelp crowd. Their burger list features attractive ingredients like shiitake, lardon, truffle, and a variety of sauces. They have a legit bar with a solid drink list. I think 3/4 of their music playlist was on my computer. Their Original burger was quite good. It came with a Parmesan crisp, roasted tomato, shiitake mushrooms, some grilled onions, and a thick beef patty. No lettuce though. :( Their fries are thin-cut Â and very crispy. Served with a variety of their homemade sauces (garlic aoli, Diablo, jalapeno). I have a suspicion that their ketchup may be homemade too; it tasted like fresh, sweet tomatoes with a hint of something savory. Surprisingly, I thought the ketchup was even tastier than the aoli or spicy sauces.
