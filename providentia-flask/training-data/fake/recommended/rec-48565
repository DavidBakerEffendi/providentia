Since I stand behind the reviews I write, I need to tell you that if you want to have one of the best dining experiences of your life.... go to Osteria and sit at the bar when STEVEN is working.  Tell him to take good care of you and then.... TRUST HIM!    He is very good at what he does. VERY  good..   The food is amazing.  Steven will guide you through an amazing experience.   He guided my GF and I through the best meal we've ever had in Philly.    Osteria is for REAL!   (If you don't sit with Steven, that's up to you. Don't blame me).
