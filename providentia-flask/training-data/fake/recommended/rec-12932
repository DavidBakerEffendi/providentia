My bf and I came in after a night of heavy drinking, seeking solace in a huge sandwich. Jake's totally delivered. He ordered the Gringo and I had the Mensch. We both got an order of fries and some sodas. The sandwiches were devine. I was worried that the whole wheat roll would be smaller than the plain or seeded options, but it was just as huge. The fries were standard...tasty but nothing extraordinary. Perhaps so they dont comete with the perfection of the sammies. I've been insanely full for the last 6 hours.
