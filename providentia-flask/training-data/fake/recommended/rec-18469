New Hell's Kitchen Hot Spot!!! Very warm and inviting homely bar/restaurant.  Not open for food quite yet but I cannot wait to go back and try everything (Open for food Sept 8th I believe)!  We received a sneak peek of the menu and it looks absolutely amazing.  The place is very open with large windows overlooking 53rd and 9th Avenue but still super intimate.  Great variety of craft beers on tap and very reasonably priced. Options for seating (bar, booths, and community tables)   The bartender Mark, was very friendly and knowledgeable of the different beers and provided outstanding service.  We felt very welcomed and like we had been going there for years. A must visit!!! (Who gives a one star rating for a $3 difference in a beer? Someone must feel some neighborhood competition.)
