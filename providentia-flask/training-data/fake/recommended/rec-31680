Can I just say the name "Trend" for a tea and coffee place is just silly. Walked in randomly with some friends one night. They had a live band playing. We originally sat in the back but it was so loud and hot (maybe they had one fan running) so, we had to move towards the front of the store. I feel like this place was overpriced for underwhelming flavors. I should've just ordered a water with ice. It took a bit too long considering we were just ordering something basic (2 iced chai teas and a nut roll). This place can make some improvements. I would suggest changing the name. Also, have an option to bring out pots for a table to share. I was interested  in looking at a variety of flavors but there was nothing out of the ordinary, just your everyday. I haven't tried any of the food so I can't comment on that, and I'm afraid I won't be trying it any day soon.  I don't know about you but I go to a coffee and tea house and expect some "exotic" adventure or indulgence that I can't do on my own or get somewhere else at a cheaper price. This place isn't like that. P.S.The outrageously priced artwork decorating the walls elicited some comical fury.
