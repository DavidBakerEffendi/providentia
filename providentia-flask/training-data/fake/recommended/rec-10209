I've heard lots of great things about Pio Pio Queens location and have been wanting to try it for awhile.  So I finally went there last night and YUM!!! We had chicken empanadas and the matador.  Both were excellent, the matador is a dish that could be shared with 2 or 3 ppl depending on the size of your appetite.  And they have a downstairs dinning area that could accompany large parties. Will definitely be going here again. WoooHooo!!
