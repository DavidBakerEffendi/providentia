We went for the first time tonight.  Yum!  Got the classic sandwich, beef stew, and spring rolls.  The sandwich was D-licious and holy cow the beef stew was amazing.  Seriously. And the couple who owns the place are friendly and interesting in their own right.   Highly recommended.  I would give it five stars if they were to up the place's decor, as it wasn't quite up to par with the village's other great places.  But that really isn't much of a criticism.   Thanks.
