Delicious food. Slightly overpriced, slightly. Order one bottled of wine, the sample board of meats, cheeses and veggies, and the Shorty pizza (braised rib, mozz, fresh arugula, port reduction, and b√©chamel). The atmosphere was pleasant and the facility wasn't too crowded (probably due to the fact that we (party of two) went on a Tuesday night. Music was Motown and distantly in the background while the lighting was low. Overall the food was delicious but perhaps a bit overpriced. The wine selection was great, but I'm a larger fan of what Tria has to offer.
