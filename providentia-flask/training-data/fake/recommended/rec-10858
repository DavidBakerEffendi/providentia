Wow. We took the short trip from Windsor Terrace to Red Hook to get lobster rolls at the Lobster Pound. It was closed so we drove down to see the progress at Fairway. Still hungry we decided to park the car and have lunch at Brooklyn Crab. We had seen the restaurant go up during the previous summer, but had never dropped in Are we glad we did. The food was terrific. Crab cake sandwich, calamari, clam chowder and regretably very good french fries. Superb. We have eaten in scores of seaside fisheries. We loved this one. Staff very friendly and helpful We will go back soon with friends.
