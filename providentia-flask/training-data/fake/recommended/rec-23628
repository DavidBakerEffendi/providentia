I live in the neighborhood but am hardly ever drawn to go here.  It is hit or miss from 2-star to 4-star depending on the night.   My last visit involved a chewy as hell octopus salad, ridiculously slow service, and a flavorless steak.  I wish I knew what other people saw in this place as it is near my house and I wish it were better.
