I was not impressed. The location is great and the interior decorating was very cool, but the food was greasy spoon diner food. Definitely nothing to write home about. One of us got an omlette, one of us got seared ahi tuna, and one of us got a burger and fries. The omlette was ok at very best, the tuna was really bad, and the burger was probably the best of the three. This place is probably great in warm weather if you can sit on the sidewalk outside because its RIGHT on Rittenhouse square but I would suggest sticking to cocktails and wine only.
