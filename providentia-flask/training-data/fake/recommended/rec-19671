This place is AMAZING! The perfect take out spot. The food is absolutely delicious and I've now tried almost everything on the menu! Consistently good, consistently well priced and consistently quick delivery. I loooove this place. It's 11am now and I'm literally just waiting impatiently another 30 minutes so I can order their lunch special which is also awesome by the way!
