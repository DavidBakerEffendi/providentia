I was in the mood for spaghetti so I yelped and found out this is one of the highest rated spots in NYC so I came here.   I ordered the meatball  spaghetti with the spicy meat sauce.  Didn't disappoint, definitely had the right kick to the sauce and the noodles were the right firmness.  I hate soggy noodles.  I also tried the ice cream sandwich it was okay.  It kinda tasted like Breyers to me.    My bill came out to $20 with tip.
