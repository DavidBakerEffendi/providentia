This place is awesome.  I sat at the bar for lunch on a cold rainy day and felt like I was having a nice cozy meal at someone's home. I started with the tomato bruschetta.  The bread was wonderful and it was piled high with large chunks of well seasoned fresh tomato. I also had the pasta bolognese as my main course.  Delicious is all I can say! For dessert I had a wonderful cappuccino with I smiley face. I really didn't want to leave.
