I hate the long wait, but love Ippudo's service. I dined there last night with friends. One suffered from food allergies. Upon informing the host, both the host and server checked with the kitchen to make sure that my friend's meal would not contain ingredients that would trigger an allergic reaction. Thanks Ippudo for the wonderful experience.
