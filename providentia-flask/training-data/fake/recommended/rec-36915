This place was good. The line was around the corner, which it always is. The wait was kinda worth it. The food was good, but not the best. The prices were good. This place has a BYOB, which is cool. We bought a couple of bottles of wine from the market on 6th and drank them with dinner. There is no cork fee, since it is BYOB. I recommend trying it!
