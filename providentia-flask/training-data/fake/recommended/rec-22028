Bf and I found this place late on a Sunday night when just about everything else was closed. We were prepared for the typical run of the mill pizza, but Leonardo's sets the bar high. We ordered the fennel sausage gourmet pizza, a white pizza, and were more than pleased. Bf can be a picky eater - this was a great stretch for us - but we both agreed the pizza just got better with every bite. Also had a garden salad, which they whipped up fresh on the spot and had Newman's Own balsamic vinaigrette to compliment. The guys that helped us were incredibly nice - providing utensils, napkins and plates for us to bring back to the hotel. We give it five stars - all cheers and no jeers!
