HOLY MOLY!!!! what a treat!!! only 18 tables but every 18 will walk away a satisfied customer. Chef Cezar Ramirez was absolutely amazing, his combination of ingredients surprised me on every dish. It was a combination of seafood (predominantly fish) and other ingredients but the combination just blew my mind, not alot of cooking alot of raw fish but damnnnnn....its realllllly good!.
