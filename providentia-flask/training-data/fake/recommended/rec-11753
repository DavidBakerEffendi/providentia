Love this place - very cozy restaurant with a delicious assortment of drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts! Kale salad, pork sticky rolls, and the chicken are amazing. The service is good. Wish the restaurant were bigger, because without a reservation, the wait can be a while - well worth it though!
