One of the better sushi bars in central CT IMHO.  Friendly and accommodating staff in a laid back atmosphere makes it a great place to meet up with friends and chat about the latest drama (I'm not the type to air out my dirty laundry so I just listen LoL).  Oh, and it's BYOB which is great for when you have one of those days where you tell yourself "I just don't feel like paying for overpriced booze tonight!"
