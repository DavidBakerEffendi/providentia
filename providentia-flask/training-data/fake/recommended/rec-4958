Ordered a veggie pie.  Was shocked to find out that there's no sauce on a veggie pie?  The "sauce" was diced tomatoes, which I find absolutely horrific.  Even though we were asked if we wanted "red or white sauce"...???  The veggie's were also not that great.  Looked way better than it tasted.. Their wings were sort of overcooked & kind of old... Overall not pleased especially since this place has decent reviews on here... Hmm..
