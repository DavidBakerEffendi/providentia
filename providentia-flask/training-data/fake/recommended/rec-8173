San Franciscan turned Seattleite, Tia Pol was my first meal after arriving in New York on vacation two weeks ago.  And it was absolutely amazing -- the most standout meal of my entire trip -- and I ate at some pretty highly regarded places during my week in New York. Every single dish had an absolutely perfect flavor and texture.  The chef is a texture master.  We had a soup with croutons on top, and there were just enough croutons to keep you wanting just one more.  It was painfully perfect.  Next, we had eggplant wrapped in something like a pasta, with an absolutely delicious pairing sauce.  I wish we got more than four to share!  Then we had fish, which was perfectly seared, and a couple more fantastically delicious dishes.  We finished it off sharing an ice cream desert with perfectly matched berries, and our white and red sangria complemented everything perfectly.  Perfect perfect perfect!!! :) Everything came out right when we wanted it, the wait staff was totally fun yet had the professionalism to make things happen right, and we finished feeling absolutely satisfied.  I recommend this place highly.
