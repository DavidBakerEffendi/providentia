Just when you think there wasn't room--har har--for yet another thai restaurant in Hell Kitchen... wa lah!  There's Room Service.  --Surprisingly, it's totally welcome!   Great thai.  Great ambiance.  And reasonable prices.   If you ask for authentic and value-priced thai, I would still recommend Pam Real Thai first, but for a fun, picture-friendly place for a group..  Room Service does the trick.  --Plus, here's the big bonus over Pam Real, they take credit.   Nice addition.
