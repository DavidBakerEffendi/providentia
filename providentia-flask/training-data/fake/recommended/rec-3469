My son took me here for some "new York" pizza... Great location! Beautiful building! Pizza was only ok. It had basil on it... very nice. Otherwise it wasn't that good. Some of the staff just had bad attitudes... but I guess it's ok cause we are in Brooklyn. Met the boos (Ralphie??) super nice. I won't be back...
