i'm sure this place was great and popular before gaining "man vs. food" fame...but since its television exposure, it has totally gone crazy.  with lines wrapping around each nook and cranny aisle at reading terminal, it does take a bit of persistence and dedication to get to your roast pork. so after stoking my hunger waiting in lines and hovering for a table, i was rather looking forward to my first bite of this famous roast pork hoagie with provolone and broccoli.  and whilst juicy and flavorful, it didn't blow me away as i had hoped.  good thing i tended my expectations...tv popularity doesn't always translate to reality.
