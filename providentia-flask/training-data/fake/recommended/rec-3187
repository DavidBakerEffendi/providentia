I could just eat the beans and rice and be happy. Throw in a savory and well seasoned roast chicken with fall off the bone meat, pollo chicharones or fried chicken, mofongo, and melt in your mouth roast pork and not only am I happy but I am in need of a serious nap. The atmosphere is like eating at your aunties house if they were straight from the PR. What a find, and for all the food we only paid $40!
