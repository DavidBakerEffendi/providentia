Went there with my mom during her visit. We started with the white sangaria, which was so tasty and refreshing. The mildly spicy pork sausage slice was great with the sangaria. We had grilled pepper, hanger steak, cod stew, date wrapped with bacon, marinated seafood salad and grilled asparagus. All dishes was ok good with the exception 1. the grilled asparagus was over grilled / burned and kinda of tasteless; 2. the hanger steak was very disappointing. I think they just did not use the best steak as they could. The service was friendly and attentive that makes me more want to give a 3.5 star. I don't mind go back there again and share tapas with friends while drinking lots of sangaria.
