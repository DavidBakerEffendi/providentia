I enjoyed the drinks and free cornbread.  The winter vegetable salad was nicely made and delicious. I was excited to try the crispy grits, but found them to be too salty as with the duck and the pork entrees which were unmemorable.  I did like the space though and would go again to grab drinks with friends after work.
