Food and service was great! Food taste good and menu is interesting. Not your typical southern food. Portions are descent and kitchen is open late. My only complaints were that they were out of a lot of things (about half the menu) when I went late (11pm) and too many IPA's on the beer menu. Would be better if they had a wider variety of beers. Â Beer menu is only on a chalk board so it is a little hard to read. Maybe there are more beers but there is no paper menu to read from.
