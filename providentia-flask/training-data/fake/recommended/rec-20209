After being denied immediate seating at Parm, we sashayed over to Rubirosa for some pizza.  My bf and I were seated instantly. It wasn't hard to decide which thin crust we would be ordering since I LOVE me some arugula and prosciutto.  But you can't really judge a slice unless it's a classic, so we only ordered half the pie with my favorite toppings. Upon arrival of our large pie, we surmised to think our eyes were bigger than our stomach.  But after first bite we were wrong.  As opposed to the traditional neopolitan pie. This pizza has a nice thinness to it. As a true New Yorker the litmus test for a good slice of pizza lies in the combination of three factors, sauce, crust and cheese. After our first bite it became crystal clear we were dealing with a heavyweight. The sauce was balanced with a level of sweetness that was tempered by its tartiness. The fresh mozzarella did not fail to stay on the pizza and provided a subtle creaminess that blended well with the sauce. The crust reminded me of a piece a of perfectly toasted bread. Although, the pizza was great... I have to admit the dressing on the arugula was a bit much after a few bites.  All in all, a must try.  A second visit awaits.
