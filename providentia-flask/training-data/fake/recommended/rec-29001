This is my favorite BYOB.  The food is absolutely amazing to me but if you dislike tight seating this is NOT the place/location for you.  They don't take reservations but if it is crowded when you arrive you can grab a drink at New Wave next door and the servers will get you when your tables ready- awesome!!  I have been coming here for about five years and have my ordering down to a science.  I start with the hummus, then split the Greek salad (good for two),  and finish with the Shrimp Pil Pil.  My Ma swears by the grilled Octopus.  I would recommend the fresh fish.  They always have unbelievable fresh fish specials I just cannot stop ordering my favs :)
