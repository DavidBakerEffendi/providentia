Amazing food a friendly staff.  Menu changes daily, so be sure to check the website.   There are very limited (but fantastic!) vegetarian options, so veggies may want to look elsewhere, but meat lovers should be overjoyed with the array of pork, beef and chicken.  Don't skip dessert... the cakes and pastries are excellent.
