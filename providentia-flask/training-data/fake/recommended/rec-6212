Unfortunately, I have to disagree with a majority of the reviews. While the service is very good and quick, the food leaves much to be desired, especially following the hype and the comparisons with Shake Shack. We had the Truffle Burger as well as the Hatch Burger, which both started off well but was subsequently hard to put down since the burgers were extremely greasy. Compared with Shake Shack this place is a bit more fancier however, at the end of the day one visits these establishments for their burgers and I have to say Shake Shack is still No.1 in town!
