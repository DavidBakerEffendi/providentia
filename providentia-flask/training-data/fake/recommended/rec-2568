By far the BEST cheesesteak in all of Philly!  WAY better than Geno's.  Geno's just slaps some shit on a bun and says "There ya go kid!  $7 we don't care about you we just want your money!"  Geno's does look better with the flashing neon lights and all that jazz but that's about all they got goin' in their favor! The Geno's steak didn't meet my standards.  It was just not of quality.  It was mostly bread and very little cheese and very little steak. They don't call it steak bread  or bread cheese for a reason people!  It's not really supposed to be all about the bread!  There was probably one very thin slice of meat on there.  It looked like they put almost no effort into it at all! If you go in the afternoon it's usually TREMENDOUSLY busy!  In this situation if you can't find anywhere to sit just don't sit at any of the tables at the end of the Italian Market that aren't Pat's or Geno's.  Those tables are for the customers of that business only and they WILL kick you out even if they have NO CUSTUMER'S!  Lol.  I know this from experience!  I had to argue with some italian guy and in the end I ended up moving anyway!  Not worth the argument!  I actually ended up sitting at Geno's with a lady from Easton, PA (where the Crayola factory is) so it can turn into a great opportunity to meet people! Pat's and Geno's are also some of the very few things in Philly that are open 24 hours so that's a definite plus!  Just don't walk down Federal Street late at night, some crack whore might start yelling at you from across the street that the dingo ate her baby or some shit.  I really couldn't understand her through the tears that she was shedding!
