I had a very disappointing dining experience at Balaboosta. After shopping in Soho, my brother, his fiancee, and I wandered in for dinner.  My brother had read the great review in the NYT (woohoo! - you're still living off the traffic from that but are about to blow it!). I was completely psyched when looking at the menu. Chock full of exciting ingredients.  Olives, fish, herbs, pastas.  Beautiful descriptions.  It was hard to choose what to get! We settled on: sardines and market salad to start; branzino, chicken, pasta for dinner; bread pudding for dessert.  At this point I was still excited. End excitement. Overall, the food was just not tasty enough.  Not for this beautiful restaurant, the great reviews, and the excellent menu.  The pasta was woefully undercooked.  The chicken not exciting.  And the branzino could have so much more kick!  The dessert however was redeeming imho. The service, however, my friends, was... actually not good.  Our waitress seemed pretty annoyed to be at work, and avoided any eye contact with us during the service.  I decided that *if* she asked us "how was everything?" I would reply honestly and say that it was disappointing.  But she wisely didn't ask!  Aha!  Avoider.  Asked nothing.  Once she got the hint that we were not super psyched and tipping time was growing near, she turned on the smile treatment but it was kinda too little too late.  Our asking about the mint tea (hot water with mint leaves), and why there was no *tea* elicited pretty much some snappiness. So.  In sum, I would imagine this is a great place to eat on an ON night.  Maybe the kitchen had the bench in, and the starters were off?  And the wait staff was tired?  But, I guess, you've gotta show up to play every night.  So, Yelp friends, this rings out an ol' "Meh, I've experienced better" on ye olde Yelpe scale.  See you next time.
