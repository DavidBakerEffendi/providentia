If you live in Astoria, and you haven't been, you should go. Intimate bar setting, outside seating area, food menu, nice crowd. This bar doesn't remind me of some of the other bars in Astoria. Its got a more chill vibe, more manhattan feel. Just a little observation: Pickles are definitely a theme to this bar's menu - whether it is the fried pickles (get them) or a pickled martini. There's lots of pickle talk! And I like it.
