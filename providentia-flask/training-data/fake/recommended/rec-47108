Been in multiple occasions, and we love Osteria! Plenty of space to move between tables unlike most of the restaurants in center city. Their Vegetable appetizer is great to begin with, grilled octopus is chewy yet soft. Tried three kinds of pizza, and all were good. Pasta with (squid? octopus?) black ink was flavorful but a little too salty for my taste. Other entrees were yummy too. Just watch out if you are driving. On my first visit in 2009, my friend parked her car right across the restaurant at 6pm, and when we came back at 7, one of the windows was gone(and so was her gps).
