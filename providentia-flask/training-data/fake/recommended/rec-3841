From the outside... it looks like an old cruddy bar. But you go inside, and oh boy, what Â surprise. Think old Italian farmhouse, shabby sheek, with a touch of old Brooklyn factory. Beautifully lit with all candles. So, the atmosphere was great. And so was the staff. It looked like a family establishment, super friendly. While it looked like they were tired (it was super busy!) they still looked like they were having a good time. And the food. GREAT quality. Fresh basil and tomato sauces, fresh crust, chewy Italian bread. Definitely worth the price. When you go, I suggest going for the whole package. Some wine, appetizer, a pizza and a desert. You'll be totally blissed out, just like I was! Absolutely going back! A gem in Bed-Stuy!
