I went here with a friend on our tour of the 5 boroughs.  Congratulations, Staten Island, you have a quality craft beer spot.  They have a good selection of American beer on draft as well as a few cans and bottles.  Apparently the taps are also rotated frequently.   The barbecue was well done also with just a little kick in the sauce.  Definitely worth checking out if you're nearby or just passing through SI.
