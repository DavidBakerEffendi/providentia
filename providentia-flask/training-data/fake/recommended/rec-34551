Best burritos I've ever had. No way to explain it. The strong flavors and combinations are amazing. I've had all the options by now and my normal meal is the beef burrito w/ extra guac. My friends and I go a couple times a week and walk about 5 blocks to get there, if that's any indication of how good it is!
