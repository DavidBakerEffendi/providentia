Food: I've been here a few times for lunch, they have a cheap lunch menu with appetizer included. While the entrees are pretty good.. I can't help but compare it to Spice, which is right around the corner with the same priced lunch/appetizer combo, but I happen to like the lunch choices way more. I really would only order a few things off the lunch menu here.. where I will pretty much eat everything off the Spice menu. But, their food that I have ordered is tasty! Space- very cute and spacious! Service- Fast and friendly. Overall- a great lunch spot on the cheaps... but I'm more partial to Spice.
