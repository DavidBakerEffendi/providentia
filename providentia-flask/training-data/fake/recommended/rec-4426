using the word "pleasant" makes me feel like an old lady, but that's the best way i can describe dinner here last weekend. everything about it was just cozy and nice, which i attribute largely to the fact that we ate at the bar. sweet lou, who's there wednesdays through saturdays, is a real peach of a bartender, and i'd go back again for a drink just to hang out with him (social skills are not really my thing, so this says a lot). it helped that my husband and i ordered really well, too -- seitan meatloaf for me and pork loin for him (both great, but the pork won the battle). the side dishes were the superstars, though -- especially the collard greens, sweet potato mash and spicy green beans (reminiscent of the ones served at grace tavern on the other side of the neighborhood). anyway. the bar is small, but i recommend that's where you sit.
