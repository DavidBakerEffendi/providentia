Lovely place for breakfast / brunch / lunch. Brilliant service and the food was simply delicious. We had a very late breakfast / brunch; the truffled eggs were superb and the mexican twist on a numbe of dishes worked really well. Good coffee, lovely atmosphere and great decor. Really very impressed and the next time we're in Park Slope we'll be sure to return. This would be a 5 star for me however we noticed another dish that went to the couple next to us that we figured could not be that good; a sandwhich that appeared to be drowned in melted cheese - still.... we didn't eat it and so cannot comment beyond presentation. Great place and certainly worth the trip to Park Slope.
