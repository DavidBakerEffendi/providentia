This was our first time. The food as well as the service was excellent food . Totally awesome scallop ceviche, yellow tail jalapeno appetizer and spicy girl roll. We also tried the soft shell crab which was delicious and crispy. Â The food was not only tasty but was presented beautifully, pieces of art.
