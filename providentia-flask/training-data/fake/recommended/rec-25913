I came here last night for a friend's birthday and had a delicious meal. We had the suckling pig which was a special of the evening, the croquette of the day which had leeks and celery in it, the razor clams and Â cockles, the tortilla espanola, and the chorizo con chocolate. Finally, for dessert we had the amazing torta de santiago. The meal was pretty flawless, the decor of the restaurant was hip without being pretentious. It's cozy and by cozy i mean kind of cramped although we were definitely squeezed into the tightest area of the place. They also have a back room that can be reserved for private parties. I will definitely be back, especially for that chorizo con chocolate!
