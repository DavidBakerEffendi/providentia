Order the buffalo chicken pizza and it was the sloppiest crap I ever had. You could not even pick the slice up and eat cause it would just flop over . It was almost like someone poured soup of my pizza. Lack of creativity and as far as taste was just like eating soupy hot sauce w chunks of chicken.
