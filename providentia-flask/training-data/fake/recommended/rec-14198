NOTORIOUSSS. The Korean's answer to Mickey D's of the States. Good, Cheap Korean for those on the go or wanting to grab a super casual bite with beverages ranging from juice, tea, soju to beer. You name it they probably have whatever you want to drink. There Kimchee Fried Rice is the amazing.  I buy in bulk like it's frozen pizza from Cost Co and freeze it to eat when i have to feed my need for kimchee!  They also have a good buffet. Beware of their lunch lines which are super crazy it's basically like riding the 4/5 train during prime rush hour.  You best be ready to FIGHT for your food and FIGHT to get into the CASH or CREDIT line as they have separate lines. [STAMP CARD] If you spend $5 or more you can acquire stamps that allow you free stuff, which honestly I'm a bit ashamed to admit I've only gotten soju here... And have no clue as to what else this fine institution has to offer.
