This place is astoundingly beautiful.  The walls lined with old hardcover books, the stamped tin walls, the dried flowers in tiny vases, the piano, the wine bottles. All of it feels like you've stepped out of the grime of north Greenpoint and into the most romantic cafe in the Italian countryside. The food is delicious, and it's obvious that Lauren, Misha, and the crew take a lot of pride in combining flavors carefully and thoughtfully.  The waitstaff is great too - attentive and kind.  In the summer, the back garden is spacious and idyllic too.  I can't wait to come back.
