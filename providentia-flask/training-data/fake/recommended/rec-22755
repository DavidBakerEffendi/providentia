The food was very good but I think the prices were slightly high for the amount of food you get. I went with a very large group 25+ for a surpise birthday party. The service was disorganized but overall acceptable. Again, the food was really good I just think the prices they were charging were a tad bit high. Lots of people stayed for Karaoke but we had to leave. Perhaps that would have made it a 4/5 for me.
