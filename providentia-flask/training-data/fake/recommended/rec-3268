I love the atmosphere of this place. Very intimate, clean and dim. My waiter was very friendly and he recommended all of his favorites and all. We ordered what he loved and everything came out perfect. The caterpillar roll is soooooo mouth watery. I put it in my mouth and I felt like the sushi melted in my mouth and was so creamy. Ugh I can't describe but i definitely recommended it ! Will be back here
