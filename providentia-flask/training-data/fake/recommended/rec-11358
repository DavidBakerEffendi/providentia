First time diner, ordered the Fat Boy Monster for takeout and it lived up to it's name. The burger was very good (but extremely greasy) and cooked as ordered. The onion rings on the burger and also the fries that came with it make you want to keep coming back for more. Would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good burger and is willing to pay for the calories associated with it. Will be visiting again to try other menu items.
