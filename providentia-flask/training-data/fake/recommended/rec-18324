My dream Fogo experience, inspired by Ron Swanson: A line of Gaucho's from my table to the kitchen, each holding one of those beautiful spikes covered in all manner of fire cooked steak, pork, chicken and sausage. I sit alone, not just at the table but in the restaurant and it is quiet as I sip my scotch - the 25 year Glenfiddich. My chip, custom made, is green on both sides; it sits proudly at the center of the white clothed table flanked on each side by the polenta and mashed potatoes (two sides only for me - F those banana's, I don't even want to look at them). My wine is poured. I sip, nod my approval and watch as my glass is filled. I raise the glass to the line of Gaucho's to signal that I am ready to begin. A slice of top sirloin to begin - rare. I grab my knife and fork to cut it (more a formality as it is tender enough to cut with a fork but there is something to be said for decorum) and as I take my first bite a single tear rolls down my cheek. After I stuff myself to the point of embarrassment things get a little weird as the Phillies pitching staff shows up, apologizes for interrupting me, and proceeds to beg me to pitch at the game that night which I agree to do but only after I conclude my meal with a 1oz pour of that $635 dollar an ounce cognac - I hear it's good for digestion. In short, go to Fogo. It's a delicious event.
