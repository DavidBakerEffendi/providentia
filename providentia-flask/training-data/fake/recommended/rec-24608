The atmosphere here is great, there is a lot of flowers, hardwood, exposed brick, and steel. The place just "looks" like you you're about to have a great meal. And I did! Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and the food was great. side note: the appetizers are small so order a few at a time, especially if you're hungry.
