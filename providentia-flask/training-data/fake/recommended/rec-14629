How is this so cheap? The food is fantastic and inexpensive. A favorite for vegans and gluten intolerant people. The Veggie Uthuappam is a massive hearty meal. The Samosas are incredible (get the mint sauce with coconut chutney) and I have no idea how the veggie drum sticks are because he is always sold out. That makes me think they are amazing. Seriously go there. now!
