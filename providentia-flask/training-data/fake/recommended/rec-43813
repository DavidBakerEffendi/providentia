I had a veggie bahn mi and it was amazing. Fresh bread, really well cooked flavorful tofu and lots of toppings. It was really good and cheap. The owner was very nice and knowing I asked for a tofu bahn mi made sure I wasn't vegan. Offered me tea and overall very nice and welcoming. Will definitely go again!!
