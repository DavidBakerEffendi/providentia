Long overdue review, but union league cafe was amazing. The atmosphere was regal. As soon as you walk in you feel like royalty. The service, top notch. The food, melts in your mouth. I enjoyed going to union league for new haven's restaurant week, and I fell in love. My goal now is to be brought back there one day on a date. :) haha but really the place was amazing. Your tastebuds will thank you.
