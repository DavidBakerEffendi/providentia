Love this noodle restaurant! The appetizer:sliced pork ear is awesome! U can not miss that! The beef noodle soup is very good. I love the soup better than the that handy noodle! But that area,parking is a big problem. Less street parking, but u can find a parking lot next street and pay for that.That worth!
