This tiny little place is a gem.  I might not have liked it as much if I had been seated at a communal table, but luckily my husband and I got a private little table by the window.  It is such a cute place!  The food was fantastic and inventive. The wait staff were professional and friendly. We loved everything we had, which was: Lychee Prosecco Martini - the best lychee martini I've ever had, refreshing, not too sweet.  Mango Paneer, Cumin Eggplant Buns, Duck Portobello Gratinee, Zucchini Hummus Pizza, and for dessert, the three cheeses plate.  I highly recommend every one of those dishes.  With the drink, two beers, and a glass of wine, the entire meal was about $80.  We will be back as soon as we can!
