We went to that restaurant yesterday and we had an amazing time!!! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is a little jem in the inside! The backyard is magical, the food was amazing, the ambiance, the waiter , the music. We had a remarkable dining experience. We had tapas such as shrimps, salmon ceviche, goat cheese, soft shell crab, and we had the catch of the day fish plateau. Thank you Donald, for your warm welcoming:) your Celine girls :-)
