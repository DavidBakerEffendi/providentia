More like 4.5 stars.  Great wine selection and a sommelier who was more than attentive and patient in helping us select just the right glass.  Even gave us a free half pour as the meal was ending to make sure we had enough to  finish up with.  Love that.   Food was excellent as well.  Entree was a whole crispy black bass for 2 fresh from whatever sea she swam in from.  Starter was farva bean salad which hit the mark and got me warmed up for the entree.   Atmosphere is very warm as the name implies.  Farm to table ingedients, a chef that loves to prepare them and a staff thats eager to present them.  All in all a great experience and will definitely be going back.
