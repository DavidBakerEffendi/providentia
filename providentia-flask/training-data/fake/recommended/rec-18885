Alright, let's be real. This isn't a place you would go during the day...it's more of a "I'm drunk, let's get breakfast at 2 am" kind of place. I mean it's good, especially when you have been drinking and want a heaping stack of pancakes or some greasy food. They charge for plastic utensils. That's about all I have to say about that. Enjoy.
