I came her based on a recommendation from an acquaintance and was completely happy in every way. My brother and law stopped here before a show at the Trocadero and were able to get our order in time to see the opening band. The food is delicous -the rolls are soft yet not too soft with meat cooked perfectly and slight crunch of onions not overdone like some others. The cheese was melted into the steak and mushrooms were delicous -just exceeded my expectations and they even have a nice small cooler full of local and national craft beer which is a plus.
