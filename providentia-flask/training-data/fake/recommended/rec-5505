I've been here once for happy hour and had a great time. The happy hour specials are amazing. I think it was half off on some beers? Definitely not breaking the bank at this place. The beer list was also very extensive. There were a bunch of beers I had never heard of, and the bartender did a goo job of helping me find one I would like. The atmosphere was very relaxed, and I felt very comfortable. I could have stayed forever. Love this place.
