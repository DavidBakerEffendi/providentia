An update re: my 06/25/2013 review: Tonight, on GrubHub, I ordered here by mistake -- I intended to place an order with another restaurant, and I was so exhausted from a day of traveling that I accidentally clicked on Mehek's menu. Here was the horrible surprise: Vegetable Appetizer Sampler (0 Star): A big mess of fried dough that looked like a mound of revolting yellow worms. It looked + smelled so gross that we threw it out. Paneer Tikka Masala (1 Star): Even though we ordered it "Medium Spicy", the dish had no taste whatsoever. My boyfriend was so hungry that he forced himself to eat it, though he felt sick to his stomach afterward. Chana Masala (1 Star): Even though we ordered it "Medium", the dish was so overpowered by spices that I could taste nothing else. It smelled heavily of ketchup and looked like baked beans. Two bites, and into the garbage it went.
