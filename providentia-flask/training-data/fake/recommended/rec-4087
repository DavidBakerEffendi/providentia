Went to this place on a friday night and was pleasantly surprised.  The one thing I will complain about it the parking.  They should invest in a free valet parking system and this place would be perfect.  Overall I go to places for the food and the food here was very good.  Their wings came out hot and crispy, and their "true blue burger" with blue cheese and bacon was delicious.  This place is a little pricey but the food is worth it.  Our waitress was personable and attentive.  The room we were in was a little loud however and could use some noise reducing padding.  The outdoor seating was closed due to rain but I'm sure it is an even better experience out there.  Overall this is a great place with a cool atmosphere that I will be trying again in the future.
