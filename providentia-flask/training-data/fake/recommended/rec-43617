This is definitely my favorite Thai restaurant in New Haven. The Som Tam, which is a staple of mine and generally a decent indicator Â of quality and authenticity, was sufficiently spicy and fresh. They have a number of intriguing specials that I am dying to try. Haven't yet dined in yet, but takeout is quick and convenient.
