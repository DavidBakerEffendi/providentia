Perfection at a reasonable price in Red Hook.  Thanks for making our Sunday so nice.  The warm Connecticut w/ butter and the cold Maine w/ mayo each have their merits.  Pick up one of each and go about 1/2 a mile to the waterfront and eat while looking at the Statue Of Liberty's best land view at Louis Valentino, Jr Park:  yelp.com/biz/louis-valen…
