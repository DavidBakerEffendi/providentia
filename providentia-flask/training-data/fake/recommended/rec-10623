Very good food! Very good menu! I've been here twice in one week for lunch and dinner. The atmosphere is cute and the waiters are always attentive and friendly. I love the menu with fresh food and new twists on traditional meals. The burger menu is so vast, anyone can feel like they're cheating on their diet. I had the tuna burger which was delicious, but theres a mahi mahi and sirloin burger too. They have a great selection of salads too, with a very convenient "make your own" option too. This restaurant has seriously improved with the new owners.
