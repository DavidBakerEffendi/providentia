We had a great private lunch with Chef Neil yesterday. It was such a delightful experience to be served by and eat with the chef. It's always best to take the chef's recommendations, so we put ourselves into his hands. We started with fresh scallops, mixed greens with tomatoes and fresh mozarella plus some sauteed mushrooms. All were fantastic - the scallops though were probably the most tender that I've ever had. Not even a hint of chewiness. For the entree we had the tuna - a massive, perfectly cooked succulent filet with mashed potatoes and winter vegetables. Divine. The filet wasn't seasoned, just broiled and the flavor was perfect in it's simplicity. We brought our own west coast Pinot but Neil brought out a bottle of Zin, and also a great Grappa. I'm not really a grappa fan, but his was a bit sweeter and slightly less astringent than I'm accustomed too. For desert - a chocolate mousse that Evan J. would have appreciated - rich, not too heavy, with some chocolate chunks to give it some additional texture. What a perfect meal. It's a great room - intimate, comfortable, and the service was utter PERFECTION.
