I went there today with a coworker for lunch. I had the black bean burger with french fries. I know what i am about to say goes against most of the other recent yelps about Jose Pistolas......here is comes....My food was excellent. I loved the fries and the burger. The sauce was particularly yummy. My friend got a burritos with black beans and shrimp and some other stuff in it and it was also spicy and delicious! The service eh. We didn't get drink and it was kinda dark in there for lunch but my stomach says yes to all the other parts. I am looking forward to going back and trying something else!
