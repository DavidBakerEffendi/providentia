We stopped in on Saturday afternoon, mainly to escape the 100+ degree heat. Our bartender Celeste from Hotel Palomar also works here, and she suggested we stop by. We didn't order much, but what we got was excellent. The Polpettini pizza was perfectly baked and absolutely delicious. The Miti Bleu Martini was incredible -- garnished with bleu-stuffed olives wrapped in prosciutto. The bartender (not Celeste) was kind enough to make mine with Hendricks Gin so it was super-tasty. Zavino's tables are tightly packed, and it was too warm due to a combo of the blast furnace outside and the big brick oven inside. But hey, we had a terrific two-martini lunch and would definitely return.
