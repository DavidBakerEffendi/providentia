Came here for a friend's birthday - food was ok. The Brussels sprout and fig jam was a little too sweet, duck schwarma was good but a little on the dry side. Rice and hummus was nothing special. But what brought this review down to a two was the service - the judging tone when some of us ordered three appetizers for our meal instead of an entree or those of us who ordered an entree, she asked about an appetizer. We are here to eat and enjoy the food, not gorge myself because I did that during thanksgiving dinner back home. we were here for a birthday and after stuffing ourselves, not everyone wanted dessert but we had to get something for the birthday girl - so we ordered two desserts for some of us to share - but she told us with attitude that it would not be enough for the ten of us to share - yes we are aware. Only five of us were going to participate. If I wanted to be judged for my eating and sharing habits, I would've gone home to my mother
