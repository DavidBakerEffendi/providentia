Just opened this week with crazy lines for dinner. I went for lunch and did not wait. This place is good but not worth waiting too long for a table.  I have been to the location in Santa Monica several times and enjoyed the food. This location will do well. Food was as good as I remember in California. I tried to eat healthier so I had the veggie burger (called Earth Burger) and the Market salad.  Would have preferred a burger with beef and some fries, which are delicious. The market salad was ample size and tasted great. The veggie burger was large and filling. Texture was a bit soft and burger broke apart easily. All good. I enjoyed it! Lots of burger places in every city. This is one of the better ones.
