Went to this place a few weeks back with my girlfriend to celebrate a work accomplishment. Overall it was a great experience. The pizza was good and the appetizers were delicious. I especially liked their cheese plate. They have nice menu and the ambiance was great! Makes a great place for a date night or if you're just looking to try something new. I highly recommend checking it out. It has a nice view of the river on Kelly drive. I will have to return during the warmer months so we can sit on the outside deck.
