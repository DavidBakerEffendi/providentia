This place is overpriced.  Dishes are small and they charge a fortune for them.  Got the sliders and they were $15!  Ordered a cup of hot tea and the cup was barely filled with hot water.  Asked for ketchup and it came in a teeny-tiny bottle.  I've had brunch all around the city, and this was one of the worst.  Don't waste your money.
