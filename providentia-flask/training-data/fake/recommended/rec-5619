Growing up in north jersey, Ive had my share of great tasting pizza coming from New York and from my local town. Lisa's Pizza and Tony D's Pizza in Westwood, NJ are the best. Â I moved to Philadelphia for school and during my eight years living here so far I've tried about 15 different pizzeria's pet peeve of mine about pizzerias is their ability too keep the pizza while delivering it to my doorstop. I hate getting room temperature pizza and having to reheat it up. I had an issue with this a this pizzeria and they issued me a free pie the next time I ordered. This is the way to keep customers. I didn't ask for it, but I did appreciate the man's reasoning. I can honestly say I do enjoy their pizza but so far its only been the 2nd time I've ordered from them. - Great tasting cheese pizza. - Customer service is outstanding. - Will order from them soon.
