I'm more of a fan of the girls who work behind the counter than the lobster roll. Don't get me wrong, the lobster roll was pretty good, but I don't know how often I would make this trip to red hook for it. The lobster mac and cheese was good and filling, but for $12 you don't get much lobster - looks like 2 chunks/claws. The lobster roll itself had lettuce and other things in it that were not just the lobster, bread and butter (I got the Maine style), but it was pretty. good. The girls behind the counter are nice and pretty efficient, as well as they can be waiting for the other foods to come out from the back. There was an error in our order which was fixed and I got to sample the error anyway, yay! The root beer they sell here is also good. There was a decent line on a regular day and they also sell the small Steve's Authentic Key Lime pies for $5 - get them here. They're $5.50 at Steve's..go figure. I'd probably come back and try it again, maybe a different style.
