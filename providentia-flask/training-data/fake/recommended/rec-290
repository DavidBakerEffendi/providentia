Fantastic! Be prepared to wait! Although I did most of my waiting in traffic, the other half of our party was advised to find a nearby bar to hang out at during the hour to hour and a half wait. We had a party of 8 in celebration of a friend's 30th birthday. Â We each ordered 2-3 plates depending on how hungry we were. Most of the plates on the menu are small. The last 4 listed are more entree sized. Some of the items change daily based on what is fresh for the day. I started off with the Beet and Blood Orange salad with cream cheese and basil. I loved how light and refreshing it was, although the basil seemed extra pungent and I love basil, so it gave me a whiff of surprise each time. Next came the Lobster & Citrus. It was nice but nothing to call home about. I wished there was more lobster to it. My last dish was the LI Duck Breast. That was amazing. I especially loved the lychee with it. Nice touch! Boyfriend got the Korean BBQ wraps, Pork belly (which also doesn't appear to be on the regular menu), and the Hanger Steak. I liked the Korean BBQ wraps the best out of the small plates we got. The Hanger Steak was also brilliantly flavored and tender. The pork belly was done nicely but the extra crispy skin irritated my already irritated throat from the cold I was getting over. It was no fault of the restaurants, but I didn't do so well with that dish. For dessert, we ordered the Lychee Panna Cotta with Yuzu Buttermilk ice cream. It was delish! It was a nice refreshing and light way to end a wonderful meal. The yuzu ice cream was pretty strong but paired nicely with the delicate sweet flavor of the Lychee panna cotta. All in all, it was a great experience. I highly recommend it :)
