Hands down, this is the best falafel I've had. I'm not a huge falafal fan in the first place but I think the falafel from this place has converted me into a fan. I particularly like how the falafel itself isn't as fried as most places, the vegetables are seasoned and they give you free pickles as a topping! The sandwich doesn't seem to be a lot but its actually quite filling. I would definitely travel to specifically get this!
