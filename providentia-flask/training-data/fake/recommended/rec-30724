I'm only reviewing the wine bar since I came here late afternoon after gallery hopping and they don't serve their full menu until 6pm. Can't wait to give the tapas a try but alas... I think the space is wonderful; it's warm and intimate and rustic. The bar draws a cool crowd and luckily I got there before it got overwhelmingly crowded. The wine was good. I was a little surprised that they only serve three reds by the glass but I tried each one and they were perfectly decent. I did spot a couple of wines by the bottle that I can easily find at my wine store for $10. Granted it is a very good bottle of wine for ten bucks, but I have no interest in paying $35 for it. I don't mind significant markups at wine bars when they are offering something very unique or difficult to find on your own. In addition, we ordered the fava bean puree and the black olive tapendade and it was fabulous. It was a hopeful preview of the full tapas menu which I will certainly come back to try. The service left something to be desired. I don't mind when servers are aloof, however this woman very much gave the "you are totally inconveniencing me for everything that you ask for" vibe and the only things we actually asked for were another glass of wine and some extra bread. I don't think that you should feel bad asking for another glass of wine at a wine bar. Overall, a pleasant yet imperfect experience but I will go back for sure.
