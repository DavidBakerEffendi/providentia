I went here for dinner during some time in town. I read the reviews, checked out the menu and everything looked ok. Well... I had a reservation and was able to it at the bar which was nice. The bartender was great. She knew the drink menu well and I was able to order something that wouldn't aggravate a food allergy (yes, I'm special). I had a ginger margarita that was delicious. For my starter I had the french onion soup which was delicious but a tad on the salty side. I had the sasso chicken for my main which was juicy but the seasoning was off - one bite of the chicken was a salt lick and another lacking seasoning all together. For dessert I had their tangerine sorbet which was just missing something. Nice room, good cocktails, great service, eh food..
