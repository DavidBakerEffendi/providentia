JB's has one of the best burgers in town hands down. They have some good beers on tap to compliment the tasty food. They have some good bands roll through upstairs. Downstairs has a nice ambiance with some cool decor. There is a pool table, and they usually play some good tunes. Definitely a good place to swing by for some grub and a brew.
