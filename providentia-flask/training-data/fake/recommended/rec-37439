I used to go to the east village location with my ex boyfriend all the time, like every weekend for brunches and for dinner. When we broke up, I stopped eating there entirely because who wants to sob in their hummus!? Too many painful happy memories. I moved to Williamsburg and let me tell you, I am SO HAPPY to have found this location! Now I can enjoy my middle eastern breakfast, falafel, and labne, totally drama free. I have rebounded hard with Mogador in Williamsburg and I am so so glad!
