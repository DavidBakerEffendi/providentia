It was ok. Staff was very friendly. Service was VERY slow however, we waited for over an hour for two burgers and some tater tots. I ordered the Village Burger- I didn't add anything to it, I just wanted to experience the taste everyone was talking about in its original flavor. It tasted good. It wasn't much better than other burgers I've had- honestly NOT better than Shake Shack across the street.  It was a little greasy for my taste. Im just not sure it was "wait around for an hour and a half on a SUNDAY" night good.  Maybe I would be more impressed if I ordered a fancier burger.  I'm glad I had the experience of trying this place, since it seems so popular but unfortunately I wouldn't go back.
