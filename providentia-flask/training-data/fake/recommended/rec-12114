Horrible experience. The food was okay, wasn't fresh at all, and the prices are low. Sure great thing. But we went there and sat down to eat. 15 minutes later they turned on the damn vacuum and no one could really talk anymore. It switched from from a quiet place to now a place with a loud vacuum cleaner running non stop. They kept coming to our table to sweep and mop in between us eating our dinner. We were told to move our feet , while our mouths were ful, so they could clean under our table. Not ONE Single server was cheerful or pleasant. I am never going back.
