My friend and I came here for the Sunday brunch. I'm not too sure why, but I didn't like the ambiance and decor. The food was okay. Everything was just okay. The food presentation was okay and the taste of the food was okay. Nothing too special and not worth $25 in my book. I will say that the Sangria was delicious and the service was good.
