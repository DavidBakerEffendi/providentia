Small Japanese dishes. Atmosphere is casual. I did enjoy the grilled mackarel (it says the price depends on the season, but for us it was $20) and the cod roe spaghetti was pretty good, as well as the takowasa, which is raw octopus with pieces of wasabi. Yum. Everything else, like the okonomiyaki and takoyaki and the grilled meats, tasted like typical bar food. I do admit having just come back from Japan, I have a discerning taste for Japanese food. Wheres the depth of flavors and umami to these dishes !? Until I find it, I'm going to keep on searching. Note** I came a little after 6PM for a table of 4 on a Friday night and we waited almost an hour. So, come early if you don't want to wait!
