The pizza here is absolutely awesome.   Gourmet pizza in NYC is one of my favorite treats, and Da Mikele is definitely one of my favorite spots for it.  This location is part of the beloved Luzzo's pizza family - so you know that the food is going to awesome.  My favorite pies are the traditional margarita and the rucola.  I also highly recommend the rice balls.  The brunch options are also pretty fun (who doesn't love fried eggs on a pizza, right?) Ambiance is very relaxed, and caters to Tribeca locals and families.
