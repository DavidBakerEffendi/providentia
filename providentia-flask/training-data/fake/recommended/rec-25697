Loves: -- The vibe. The environment is chic but comfortable, with dim lighting and sort of a lovely overall ambiance. The tables in the back are perfect for date night, and I can imagine spending a comfortable evening sitting at the bar. Additionally, the branding work was done by P'unk Ave, a great local design firm, so everything from the menus to the check envelopes (you'll see) are stylish. -- The staff. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. For a smart Center City spot, a hostess that doesn't glare at you is almost unheard of. -- The menu. Small plates totally work for this spot and the variety was interesting and exciting, especially the gnocchi with fava beans and the beet dumplings. Â I'm looking forward to going back and trying the things I didn't order. Additionally, as a person with a egg allergy, it was fantastic to be able to order anything I liked off the menu without worrying about looming anaphylaxis, so bonus points there. Needs work: -- The service. I asked for a drink recommendation, telling the waiter I didn't like sweet or fruity drinks, and he suggested the 5 Year Plan, which, when it arrived was very similar to an Old Fashioned, which I hate because they tend to be more like alcoholic fruit punch. It was good, just not my thing. My date had the Bullseye, which I liked much better. Additionally, we waited a *very* long time for dessert, and when it arrived, our apricot tart with vanilla ice cream was a plum tart with pineapple sorbet. It was delicious, but if there was a problem with our dessert, we should have been informed about the substitution beforehand. ----- Overall, I'm optimistic about Charlie was a sinner. It suffers from some of the normal new restaurant hiccups, but nothing I don't think they'll get the hang of and it will not keep me from returning.
