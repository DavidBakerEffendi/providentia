Perfectly OK place to go with a decent variety of menu items to try. I wouldn't say anything will blow you away in particular, but the food is solid and staff was very helpful and prompt. Wine list is good, but could use more beer items on the list. Inside decor was cozy with good ambiance and you won't have to yell for people to hear you.
