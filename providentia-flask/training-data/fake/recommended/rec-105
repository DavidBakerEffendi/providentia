How often do you find a place that serves pizza AND Mexican ?  Well, Pizza Corner in New Haven does both.  Been in a hand full of times in the last few weeks.   New ownership (since the Spring of 2013).  The pizza served at the old Pizza Corner was awful, but it's better now.  It's a good place to stop for a quick slice.  I find the Mexican fare here to be a lot better.  Had a pair of soft tacos yesterday -- one steak, the other spicy pork.  Both came with a slice of lime.  Very tasty, I enjoyed them.
