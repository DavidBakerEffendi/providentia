I've always had good experiences here until tonight... My boyfriend ordered the Mussels on their appetizer menu which he was really enjoying until he opened one and found it was entirely black (and rotten?  I don't eat Mussels but I'm sure they're not supposed to be black).  I don't think it would stop us going back because every other time we've been the food has been excellent - we just wouldn't order mussels! The hostess allowed him to order something else on the menu with no problems but... He ordered Pad Thai which was ok but not the best in the city. I ordered Aw Lao * soup (with sauteed lemongrass, shallots, chili, asian eggplant, dill: served with sticky rice, which was excellent. Need to remember they only accept cash. Lunch specials are also a great deal - soup, appetizer and main meal for less than $10. Great vibe tonight though - the place was really busy and full of chatter.
