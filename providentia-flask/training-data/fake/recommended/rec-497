It doesn't get better than this. I absolutely fell in love with the menu as soon as I came across this restaurant. When my friend gave me several restaurant options for dinner, I knew instantly decided on Kefi! I already knew what I wanted to eat before I got there. The grilled octopus and bean salad with a side dish of broccoli rabe was what I ordered. The grilled octopus is an appetizer size so it is perfect if you have a petite appetite, otherwise order a side dish to make it a complete meal. The appetizer was grilled to perfection. My friends got: selection of 3 spreads with flatbread grilled swordfish with tomato and cauliflower hanger steak with sausage and broccoli rabe flat pasta with pulled braised rabbit. I tried them all and give them 2 thumbs up! I enjoyed this place because there is ample space, many tables to choose from, and they take reservations. It doesn't hurt that they have an early bird special (before 6pm) and you can get a pre-fixe meal for $16.95. The entire menu is very reasonably priced. Now if only I can get people to get off work early to advantage of this deal! Planning on coming back soon.
