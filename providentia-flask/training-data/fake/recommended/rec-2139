When visiting Philly, my GF and I were told to go there and try it out.  Plus it was during the time when my GF's friend could get away and have a beer with us, no kids.  She started off by saying the had crab fries.  WOW!!  Parking was a challenge, but parked around the corner in a residential street.    Walking in, I really liked the set up and small bar feel.  We walked up some stairs and found a spot for the three of us.  The bartender was the one who took our order.  On the menu I saw Baltimore style crab legs.  Never had it, so I'm there.  Odered some beers and chilled.  Got the food in a timely fashion.  The crab fries were not what I expected, I guess I took the name a little to literially.  All and all, they were tasty.   The presentaion was not fluffy at all and I didn't mind it.  The atmosphere was the perfect place to hang out and have crab and beer.
