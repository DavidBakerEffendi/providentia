Have never been treated in such a disrespectful way!!! I met here with 2 friends just before 6pm on a Sunday evening to get a couple of drinks and some food before a movie premiere. We talked to the bar tender who told us that we could sit anywhere so we picked a table in the front. After 15 minutes without service (not even water - it was 95 degrees outside) we tried to get the attention of one of the waitresses who were busy chatting to a customer at the bar. More and more people started walking in and sat down in the back. The 2 waitresses started taking orders and tried the best to ignore us. A lady sat down next to us and got the menu right away. My friend asked her if we could order something (at that point we've been waiting for more than 25 minutes). Without saying anything she stared pulling the paper cloth from the table. I asked her if something was wrong and she almost shouted back saying that the table wasn't set up for dinner and that we had to move which we subsequently did. After another 5 minutes she gave us the menu. We said that we were ready to order which she ignored and ran away again! I was already steaming but I didn't want to disappoint my friend who had recommended the restaurant. So I suggested that we could order a drink at the bar and sit outside. The bar tender poured us drinks and I gave him my credit card. He asked me if I had cash. When I denied he said that there was a 2 Dollar charge for credits cards which I've never heard about. I should have walked out but paid and didn't leave a tip. Shame. Will never ever go back and would never recommend this place to anyone.
