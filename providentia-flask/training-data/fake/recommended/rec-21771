Visiting Phily for the day, I wanted to grab lunch at Reading Terminal Market, as I had never been there before. Looking around to decide what to eat, I hopped in line at Tommy DiNic's because if the 75 people in front of me are waiting for a sandwich, its gotta be good. I asked someone to fill me in on the sandwich they are known for, and ordered it verbatim: roasted pork, sharp provalone, and broccoli rabe.  This isn't something I would order normally, but I gave it a shot and it was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a very long time.  I have been to John's Roast Pork, and (I know this is blasphemous to say) I liked this much better.
