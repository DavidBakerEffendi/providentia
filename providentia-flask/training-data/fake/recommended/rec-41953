First time on the boat.  It was nice.  This place has a nice atmosphere.  We had the salumi plate (choose 3 for $17) and butternut  squash soup.  Both starters were fantastic.  Fresh bread on the table with honey and sea salt butter was delicious. For dinner we had the Salmon and Scallops.  Both were good dishes, but did not overly impress us.  This place is too expensive for regular dining, but maybe we will be back just to go back on the boat!
