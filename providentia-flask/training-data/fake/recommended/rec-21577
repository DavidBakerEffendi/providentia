stopped by everyone's racquet with mr. h to get a racquet restrung.  while we waited, we stopped into jake's for lunch.  it's clean and the staff is friendly.  the sandwhich board is easy to read.  the thing i don't get is that the pig is featured prominently on the windows, yet the menu is extremely cow-heavy.  not a complaint, just a disconnect i noticed. i can't remember the name, but i ordered one of the lighter sandwich offerings -- chicken, cheddar, avocado, and red onion.  it was good.  i could only finish half, though.  all of the onions are on top, so they kind of fall off.   overall, jake's is a decent establishment and a nice place to grab lunch if you are doing some shopping on 13th.
