Like so many other reviewers, Kefi really surprised me. I stopped in the other night to catch up with a friend over drinks. We shared a couple of starters and thought we were in for predictable fried calamari and selection of spreads. Wow. The calamari had some hidden gems of crispy fried chickpeas and lemon slices. I'm sure the fried lemon sounds weird, but you HAVE to try it. It was such a refreshing touch to a potentially heavy dish. The calamari was great too. Really fresh and not greasy at all.
