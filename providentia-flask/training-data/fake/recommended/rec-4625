I was only here for the beer.  Having imbibed on multiple half glasses to maximize my tasting experience, however, works up an appetite.  So I had some flatbread with some crazy combinations of toppings.  But they were local toppings.  And they tasted good.  So I was glad.  Then I left.  Thereafter I found out that this place was a chain restaurant.  And I was saddened.  Later that day I found myself torn between supporting a chain and wanting to try some more of their great beers.  The beer won out.  That same day I went back and drank some more halfsies.  And ate another pizza.  And I was happy.  4-star happy.
