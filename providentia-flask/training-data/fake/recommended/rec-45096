Super cozy and charming corner restaurant in the midst of residential west village.  Seriously, located in the thick of the beautiful townhouses and winding tree lined streets, the windows allow for lots of sunshine and people watching too. Came here for brunch during primetime brunch hours with a friend and had a table immediately.  Drank a lot the night before so I opted not to order alcohol (I know, that's like against the law at NY brunch) but all of the cocktails looked yummy. Split the portobella salad and ordered an omelet (spinach I think?) and my friend ordered whole wheat pancakes.  Super delicious, especially with the bourbon maple syrup. Lots of little details at this little place and I LOVE little details. Would like to do dinner there soon, I imagine they do a brisker business with dinner. Only gripe is that they don't have soy milk!  C'mon people, this is the west village!
