Experience:  Happy Hour Cocktails are yummy if you like fruit flavors and sweets. Each time I go, I get a glass of the Beirut with Passion (the infusion of mint makes it all worth it) and the Fresh Medow (the freshness of the cucumber gives the palette a clean taste). The restaurant's highlights -- the bartenders!  They are super friendly and fun.
