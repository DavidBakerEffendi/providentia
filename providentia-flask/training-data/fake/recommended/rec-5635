What can I say, their legendary beer list almost made me cry... but i was on a first date, so I had to keep it together.  I must say that Belgians know how to do beer!  I'm not even a fan of blonde ales (i.e. a proper Belgian beer), but the expanse of lagers, amber ales and stouts may just make you giddy.  And for being in such an uppity area you'll be relieved to find that Eulogy is actually a place that you can relax and enjoy beer.  The only warning is to be careful what you order, or you might end up with a $40 12oz. bottle... I love beer but... hot damn!
