I went on a Sunday evening.  The staff was friendly until we ordered soda instead of alcohol.  I LOVE salt. Love it. That being said, the bruschetta was so salty I couldn't finish it.  I feel like I could have gotten much better tasting food at The Olive Garden (kill me now), and it would have been far cheaper.  You can find better Italian food for a much better price in the city.
