After a few memorable trips to locations in NYC, hubby and I ventured out to philly's very first Shake Shack.  Since I am 9 months pregnant, we planned ahead and arrived there at 3:30 pm in hopes of avoiding a long wait.  We are obviously geniuses since we only waited 10 min in line to order then another 10-15 to get the food. I got my usual single shack burger with a root beer and hubby got a double hamburger.  We split a side of cheese fries and I got the coffee malt shake for dessert while he got half order of the Liberty Place concrete.  We sat in a nice booth and dug in.  The burgers were really juicy and yummy but the patties were thicker and less crusted than we had in NYC before so we we were a little disappointed.  As a root beer lover, my root beer was super crisp and refreshing.  The fries were not greasy at all which was great and cooked to perfection.  We both loooooved the desserts we got - thick, flavorful and quality. The service was really great as many have commented here already. Their price point is definitely high ($31 for our meal) but you shouldn't eat this meal too often anyway :) It's a heavy hitter fo sho.
