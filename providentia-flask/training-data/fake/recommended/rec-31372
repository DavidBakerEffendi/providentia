Thought I was going to the Ember Room only to find the name had changed to OBAO. I had never experienced Ember Room so I dont know if things were different. I was impressed by the decor. Everyone was attentive and friendly from the hostess to the bartenders. I had the chili chicken with cashew sauce and my fiance had pork belly with Chinese broccoli, we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. I wasn't a fan of the herb infused cocktail but I ordered another drink called 1001 nights that made up for it. Â I'll def go back and recommend this place to my friends.
