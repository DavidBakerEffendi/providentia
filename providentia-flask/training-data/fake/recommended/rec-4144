I was a little hesitant to go since I hate brisket, no matter who makes it and I heard the place was pricey. But after a visit I found it was not pricey at all and the food was a pretty good value. The mac and cheese was good and large enough to share and the pulled pork was great and enough for lunch the next day. I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the bread. Stroemann hamburger rolls are NOT bread! They are spongy chemicals and taste like dust. The waiter was right when he said it was traditional since down south they have no Idea what bread is and this mess is called a roll. Break tradition and get decent bread, then the place would deserve 5 stars.
