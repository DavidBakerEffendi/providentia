Their happy hour is pretty good. Wings are AMAZING, calamari is solid, and best of all, buck-a-shuck oysters! $1 for an oyster on the shell. The selection is bit more limited for this price, but frankly I'm not an oyster connoisseur so it all tastes great to me . I haven't tried the regular menu yet, but probably going back a few more times for happy hour. The service is a bit lacking. Food was slow to come out, and then the waiter seemed to have just forgotten about us after we asked for the check. He apologized, but it was a busy Monday night for me, and the meal had already had taken longer than I expected with the slow service.
