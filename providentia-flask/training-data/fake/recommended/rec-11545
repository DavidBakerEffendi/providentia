The set up of Penelope was very cute and trendy. I went there for breakfast and ordered their oatmeal. Pros - the oatmeal portion size was huge! It was nice and warm with nuts on top - servers were attentive and made sure we were enjoying the experience Cons - towards the end of our meal I started feeling rushed, server gave us our check without being asked to - even when we were clearly still talking, server was still at the corner peering over to check to see if we had out our cards in to pay - needless to say, our server was a little too attentive and pushy for the check - table set up was too close! I could hear the conversation going on next to us - the price for oatmeal ($6) is a little ridiculous...it was delicious but it was also something that's not hard or expensive to make
