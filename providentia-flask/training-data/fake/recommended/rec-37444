Stumbled on this place quite by accident the other day for brunch. Food was unique and very flavorful. I've never had anything like the banana pancakes in NY before--not too heavy and maybe a little too delicious. Other reviewers have called it pricey. It strikes me this is not a place for homestyle Indonesian streetfood. The menu is inventive and unusual. Service was also great. Really no downside except that they didn't have drip coffee for brunch. Not a huge problem though as the espresso was surprisingly good!
