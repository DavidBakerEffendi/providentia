This review is dedicated to Brooklyn's Finest himself, peter d. Why? Because he directed a hungry me and Deanna W. here after a particularly nice event. We had savory crepes filled with wonderful ingredients, in a room filled with wonderful French cheer. The service was warm as the South of France, the food was as delicious and satisfying - leaving me wanting more. So, of course, je vais retourner, parce que cette qualite d'ambiance Â est vraiment rare dans cette grande ville des moments perdues.
