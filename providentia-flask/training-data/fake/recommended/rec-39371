The BEST Chinese take out restaurants in the greater Hartford area. The food is always made fresh. The food is always affordable. And the food is always delicious to the last bite. The portions are awesome as well. You can order enough for yourself or get enough for the whole family. Service is A 1. Four thumbs up!
