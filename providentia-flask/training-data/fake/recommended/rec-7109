Stopped here for a late lunch.  The super club classic is great.  The assortment of meat, pickled condiments was packaged neatly into a crunchy baguette.  The mild (only has sirracha) was perfect giving contrast to the salt and vinegar of the filling.  If I could change something, I'd add more meat to the sandwich. I look forward to my next visit to try some of their other items.
