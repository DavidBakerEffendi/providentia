Walked in mid afternoon on Tuesday for lunch and the waiter quickly let me know that the Buffet would be over in 5 minutes...i looked at the full trays of dried food at the buffet and said thats ok i didnt even know you had a buffett....I then proceeded to sit down at a table..and the waiter says we close in 20 minutes....REALLY!!!...i look around...one other person at a table....so i sat down anyway i had been driving for over an hour and was hungry...he relented and allowed us to order.... I had a mango chicken dish which was excellent...My date had a lamb dish...also excellent.... And when my date asked for another soda..the waiter told her we dont have free refills....I was pissed ...do i look like i cant afford a soda... So overall food excellent...Service TOTAL CRAP....Learn how to treat a customer especially when you have only one other table with one person at it.. Unfortunately the service made it a moot point...I will never be back
