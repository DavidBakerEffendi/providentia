I held a family event at Joey's on a Sunday afternoon.  We had 22 people and had the place to ourselves, as the restaurant is usually only open for dinner on a Sunday.  Joey was totally accomodating.  He allowed us to decorate the restaurant and bring our own beer, wine and cake.  We also brought our own table cloths, flowers and vases to make the place look more elegant.  The food was great and Joey was really very generous with the serving sizes.   Best dish was the whole red snapper.  Joey's nephew served us; he was efficient and charming.  I think we were probably the maximum size the restaurant can accomodate for a party - especially if the guests want to mingle.  Thumbs up for JoeyThai.
