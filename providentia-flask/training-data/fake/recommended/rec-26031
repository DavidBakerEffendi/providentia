Little Owl! Or should I say, Little WOWL? Came here for lunch. We were two people and ordered a burger (comes with fries, of course), the roasted cod, and two sides (acorn squash and mushrooms). I had the cod while the bf had the burger. WOW. Never before had I actually experienced food cooked to such perfection. I am not talking about fancy ingredients--though they do have brussels sprout cooked in truffle oil with the grilled chicken breast, which someone sitting at the next table ordered and was so fragrant! Â Everything was just right! The cod is roasted perfectly, with just a very light crust on top and the flesh so nice and light! It sits on top of a bed of watercress with a vinaigrette. YUM. The sides were just wonderful, too. Acorn squash was baked just right, with oil and pumpkin seeds accompanying it, and I seriously marveled at the mushrooms. I think though that the side dishes change quite frequently. Then, we ordered the apple crisp to share for dessert. Oh it was so nice, and the cup of coffee to go with it was wonderful as well. Overall, I was very, very satisfied and inspired by the food. Little Owl really gave me a great experience!
