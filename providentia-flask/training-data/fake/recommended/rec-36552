This was the first Italian restaurants I ate at when moving to NY.  My cousin had taken me here in efforts to break me into the city.  After my visit to Carmines, I just knew I would enjoy my time in NY!  If you do not mind carbs, this is the best place to carb overload!  Their breads and pastas are all made from scratch, and I felt like I was eating in my living room.  All their dishes are shared, family style.  They've got a classy bar and decor that makes you feel at home. Bon Appetit...winning the hearts of food lovers one tummy at a time!
