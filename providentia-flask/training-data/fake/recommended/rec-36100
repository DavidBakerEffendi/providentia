I walked up and down Chelsea Market looking for something that would satisfy my hunger for deliciousness. I just couldn't get the right vibe for anything there, so then I took to the streets and lo and behold after clearing my head on the Highline, came upon this narrow store with an awesome offering of tapas! The waiter was patient and walked us through the selections and didn't try to make us order more than what we could stomach. The food is authentic, the wine we chose was from the La Rioja region which I happened to have visited earlier this year, so it was a special experience.
