Of course, it's always tough to reveal a favorite spot that hasn't become mainstream yet, but every time I go, I have such a pleasant experience that I want to encourage others to go and help keep them in business. The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is tasty, beer selection is wide and the happy hour deal is nice too.
