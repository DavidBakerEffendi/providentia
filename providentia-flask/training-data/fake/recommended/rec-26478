CASH ONLY. Well actually I don't know if they take card but you'll probably look dumb handing them your card for a 1 dollar meal. Atmosphere ?/5 - What is this- a shack for ants? Not, but it's really tiny and has maybe 5 seats. Service 3/5 - Fast, but I've been here when the guy has effed but my order severely. Food 5/5 - Okay 5 fried pork&chive dumplings for 1 dollar. They're huge too. What. whatwhathwathwahtata. Have definitely gorged myself to death here... and then bought some frozen ones to take home. Awesome.
