Stumbled upon this place while I was visiting my mom at Yale a bit ago. It was suuuper busy when I was there, though that's never a deterrent for me, but something to point out. I only had one thing which was their cappuccino, and it was not that great. Seemed like they just steamed some milk and then dumped foam on top. Also, I thought it was weird that when I wanted to order 'something for here,' they said I had to be seated at a table. You mean I cannot just pay for my drink at the counter and find my own table? It makes it seem more like a restaurant than somewhere to get coffee and check out books. Their menu did look good and I would definitely go back and try some things, but I probably wouldn't venture to order anything off their coffee menu again. EDIT: If you are a full service restaurant, then maybe you shouldn't be calling yourself a 'cafe'. Just a thought.
