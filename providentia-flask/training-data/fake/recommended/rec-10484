While I'm following the New York Pizza list; Emporio was close to us on Saturday night. The place is very cool with lots of hip young people being served by hip wait staff. Did I mention noisy? The pizza is great,brocolli rabe and sausage.WOW, reasonable wine prices and a sky light in the back room that is out of a movie set. Let's have the squash flowers too, OK and the watermelon and beet salad, OK. Let's go back soon and try the "real food" OK
