Wait, 4 stars? Dafuq?! Lunch here wins a trophy for the single worst dining experience I've had on this restaurant-dotted island. Guys, what are you smoking?? Tramped over for a farewell party. I usually stay far, far away from hotel establishments, but whatever, I'm DTF. The interior is elegantly decorated, albeit boring. Whatever, as long as my taste buds are appeased. ***Niceties end here*** At first glance, the menu looks slightly boring. BLTs...salads...ok, I'll go with the flow. We order, and then we wait. And wait. And wait. And still no sign of food. This leads me to believe that there is only one chef in the back. He also takes orders and buses tables, in addition to washing dishes and plating, in addition to sourcing ingredients and mopping the kitchen floor. The way this place is run makes it feel like a one-man-operation, and I've read plenty about OMOs that are a gazillion times more efficient than this. My sweet potato fries arrive. Nothing special. My main arrives, three indistinguishable prawns lying limply on a shrived bed of greens. I've never had prawns that tasted so mushy, like they were defrosted over and over again. What poor execution. Even worse, my colleagues flat out didn't get their entrees until a good hour later, at which point many were late for their meetings and had to ask for takeout boxes. The poor, confused server apologized not-so-profusely and attributed the lack of food to our large group size. That's funny. Last time I checked that's what restaurants do. Serve groups of people. At the end, no complimentary dishes, no certificates. Just a group of still hungry, disappointed diners. Strand Bistro, get your act together.
