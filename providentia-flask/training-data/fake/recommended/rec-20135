DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!! I really wanted to love this place. There's always a wait outside, it gets decent reviews and it's a stone's throw from my apartment (which makes me even more reluctant to write such a disparaging review). And it's so charming and quaint. Brunch was a disaster. We waited a good 35 minutes for a table then over an hour for our food to arrive. By that time, we were starving and expecting a grand feast of deliciousness and instead received a disappointing mix of WTF was that blandness. This was beyond underwhelming. Everything was flavorless and not warm enough. The omelets were watery no matter what was in them... whether it was rabbit, short ribs or veggies... it was all disappointing. The lamb ragout was a room temperature mess (it wasn't even a hot mess!). The waiter was friendly but apathetic and not attentive. It was busy during brunch but it's not a huge place. I'd at least expect a coffee and water refill after waiting over an hour for food. Plus, we even asked where the food was after 45 minutes and were told they were plating it. Not sure what special food plating techniques they use there that would take over 15 minutes... I'd want to give this place a second chance but my wallet is still pissed at me for donating money to a most unsatisfying meal.
