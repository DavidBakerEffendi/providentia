I have lived in Kensington for over a decade and have gotten excited time and time again when new restaurants opened, only to be let down and thus, forced to leave the 'hood for good eats.  Thank you Wheated for finally giving me hope! This is the first restaurant in my neighborhood that truly makes me want to stay vs. going elsewhere for pizza.  We have even taken friends from (gasp!) park slope and they were so taken, they now prefer to schlep to Church Ave. vs. pizza spots in their area. As for the pizza, I think the crust rivals the best in the city, using Roberta's as a standard.  We've eaten here several times and the crust has always been on point.  Most of the time, the toppings work and the ingredients are quality.  I am crazy about the Bee Sting pizza at Roberta's with spicy soppressata and honey--and am not sure if the toppings here quite match that brilliance imho, but overall, they're definitely good.  Cocktails are mixed well and beer is served ice cold, much to the deep appreciation of my picky, "only IPA's on tap for me, husband.   In terms of improvement, I would really, really, really love a few more appetizers to choose from.  At this point, we have tried both the brussels sprouts salad and the caesar and I am not sure how much else there is to try.  Fwiw, we're fans of the brussels sprouts salad--which is shredded and raw--but the caesar needs more of everything.  I love lots of garlic and lemon in my caesar salad and nice, big crunchy croutons.  Though anchovies are offered and there is parmesan in the salad, it just lacks oomph.  And the croutons are miniscule which just doesn't work for me. Aside from this though, this is a lovely, welcoming place that I hope will remain in Kensington for many years to come.
