I had a "large-bowl" with root veggie mash and grassfed spiced beef. Totally filling, delicious, healthy. Made me feel really good. Price = 9 dolars, which is at least two dollars more than what my meal would have costed at some non-health conscious place. But f**k it! I totally believe in what these people are doing. Staff was warm, funny, and attractive and knew their product well. (Should have asked her out...) Hu is stylish and has a great atmosphere. I hope this place makes it. Expensive, yes... but TOTALLY WORTH IT. (and I'm cheap as hell.)
