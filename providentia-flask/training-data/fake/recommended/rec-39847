Not too spendy, but not too special for the wait. What is up with waiting for a "great" burger in this town? Nothing special. Tasted like a well-cooked burger during a family cookout. Â Burger was juicy, delicious and great with a beer. Worth it? Maybe. Overall, I'm just disappointed we waited so long for a meal/burger that was quite forgettable.
