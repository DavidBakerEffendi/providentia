I am not saying that this place isn't awesome...but I am more of an okinawa noodle kind of guy.  The soup is awesome but the only gripe I got is that the noodles aren't chewy.   The buns filled with pork belly or spicy chicken are awesome and you could sell that from a cart on every corner in the city and you would make a killing. I fortunately went on a tuesday before the lunch rush and did not have to wait the ridonculous 2 hours wait for these noodles.  If i had waited and gotten what I had gotten I would have probably put them down for a 2 star.  I know I sound like a noodle snob but I like what I like and if I wanted that type of noodle I would have gone to eat soba.   The plus was that when you get the meal you at least get a good amount of food for the price.   Sorry ippudo!   The taste did not make my tongue sparkle! Happy eating and Cheers!
