As a gluten-free eater and GMO-avoider, I came across this place while in NYC for work. Literally, this is all of the food I make at home that I wish I could get out when Im on the road traveling----when I said "gluten free" and "no gmo" advertised along with "Food Humans Eat" I thought this can't be. But OH it was. And when I walked in , I was amazed. I had to stand to the side and take it all in. Smoothies, juices, desserts, deli, hot food. Even their ketchup was real and homemade! I ordered a 1/4 chicken plate with sweet potato and butternut squash. Then I got a carrot whoopie pie for dessert for like $20. I'm a fan. Now if they could only lower their profit margins to make it cheaper it'd get 5 stars! haha
