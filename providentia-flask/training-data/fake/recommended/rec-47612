what a disappointment, I've been going to this bakery for 30+ years, not anymore. Nothing is fresh and the cannolis are not good. Dont know what happened, but it certainly isn't worth what we paid....extremely expensive for quality that isn't there. Â The plainville location is also a disappointment, I prefer to go to Mangiafico's down the street, that is awesome.
