I've been here quite a few times.  It's one of our old stand bys when we can't think of any place to go.   There is a small dining area, and some tables around the bar.  Table service is much better than the bar service.  I dont' think I've ever ordered something that disappointed me.  The Tiger's Tale Chicken Sandwich is awesome and the Fish Tacos are fantastic (though i'd order them without cilantro next time) It's good food, cold beers and reasonable prices... Check it out!
