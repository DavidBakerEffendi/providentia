Was in town on Friday and we went to spasso.  Service was great, we had Claudette.  Food was great and the home made pasta was awesome.  We could have picked many places in town and was not disappointed with spasso for an Italian meal.  I had a ceasar salad and the pan seared scallops with pasta. . .great meal and atmosphere.
