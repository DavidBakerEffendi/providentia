Let me start out by saying I'm a huge German beer fan, and I'm keen on German food as well. I came here for my birthday dinner. Making the reservation was easy, and we were seated within ten minutes of our reservation time. The one thing that was off-putting was that the hostess asked if we were going to be done on time, because they had overbooked. That annoyed me, and did not leave a good first impression with me. Honestly, that stuck with me for the entire meal. When we were seated, our waitress was extremely attentive, and very helpful. The beer selection was excellent, even though the What's Next section on the menu was a little bit annoying, especially since it had beers on it I wanted. Minor detail, but it's worth pointing out. The appetizers were fantastic. We got an order of fries, a cheese plate, and soft pretzels with mustard. All were excellent. For dinner, we got an assortment. I had the meter-brat (the look on the waitress' face was worth it), and everyone else got a variation of schnitzel. The meal was fantastic. Dessert was impeccable, and the after-dinner coffee was good as well. The only thing that is keeping this restaurant from getting four stars was what the hostess said to me. If it weren't for that, this place would be getting four stars. As a side note, if anyone from the restaurant is reading this, I have never had a hostess say that to me. I've lived in DC, New York City, and I've traveled all over the world. No one, in any place, has ever tried to tell me to stay to a time limit because they were over-booked.
