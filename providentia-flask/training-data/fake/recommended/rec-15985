Uva is super cute and cozy, well priced, and has delicious food. I am obsessed with their ricotta truffle gnocchi and truffle / honey / goat cheese bruchetta. They also have some really good wines. We had an excellent waitress, I forget her name, but I know she trained as a pastry chef - thanks for the awesome wine recommendations! Excited to be moving close, will be back!
