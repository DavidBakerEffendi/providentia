I've been going to the Commune for several years for breakfast and lunch and have been very happy with the food and the friendly staff. But it took me until this week to try their new dinner service, and I was thrilled with it. I had the prix fixe--for just $25 I got a Greek salad that was way more interesting than the usual (with yummy olive pate), wonderfully seasoned salmon with a delicate puree of peas? (whatever it was, it was delicious) and a wonderful not-too-sweet but perfectly decadent warm chocolate cake for dessert. At dinner, the Commune is more grown-up, with table cloths, softer lighting, lovely ambience--and not too loud to converse. The waiter we had was lovely--friendly, informative, unpretentious. And you can bring your own wine, which makes the whole experience even more of a bargain. I'll be going back soon.
