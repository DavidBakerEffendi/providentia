This pizzeria has been standing under the Brooklyn bridge and serving NYC's "must have" pizza for years. Yes, the line was humongous. Yes, it was worth it. Yes, the dough was spectacular (and perhaps it was Brooklyn's "water" after all). But would I do it again? Not unless I was taking a friend for the first time. Or unless the weather was slightly more forgiving. We ordered: a large regular pizza with chicken, jalape√±os, and mushrooms.
