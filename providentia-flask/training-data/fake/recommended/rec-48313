Was headed to Brooklyn so I looked up German food and decided on Cafe Steinhof. Upon entry it seemed cozy and cute.  No appetizer menu though and I ordered the Jaager Schnitzel since it was my favorite dish from my Army days in the past in Germany.  To my surprise the dish came out in a small oval plate and the cutlets were ultra thin and overall the portions were very small.  At 6ft and 250lbs the main dish was like an appetizer.  And the taste was hardly how I remembered it, the sauce was bland with just a few mushrooms.  Never going back. My advice, find another place if your looking to eat.  If your gonna just have beers it's ok.
