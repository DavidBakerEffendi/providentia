Cafe Orlin lives up to its reputation - it was a nice, long wait for brunch on a Sunday at 1pm, but well worth it. I went with three others and our round table of four was packed with food soon after we had ordered. Two of us had the buttermilk pancakes - fluffy and tasty all in one. The fruit compote was tasty and the fruit in the pancake was delicious. The two others had savory egg-based meals that were similarly tasty. The service was kind and constantly refilled our waters. If we had any other requests, she made sure to help us. The bathrooms were quite clean and sometimes had a line but mostly were free. I highly recommend this to any and all - just be ready to wait for a table.
