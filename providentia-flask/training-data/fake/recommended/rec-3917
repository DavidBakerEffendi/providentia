A bit of a goat rodeo, but the old school feel and the fast service makes it totally worth navigating the crowds. I've been here a couple of times; the food is good overall...but the pancakes are amazing. So many varieties, and the three buttery sides make every bite an adventure. When friends are in town, we hit Tom's for good food, good value, good service and great atmosphere
