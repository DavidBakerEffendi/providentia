Came to NYC with some girlfriends and had brunch at Cookshop on a Sunday early afternoon. DEFINITELY make reservations. We made reservations that morning which worked out very well, and skipped a line that looked like it would take an hour to wait through. We were seated right away, the drinks and food were amazing, and the service was great. Couldn't ask for a better brunch spot.
