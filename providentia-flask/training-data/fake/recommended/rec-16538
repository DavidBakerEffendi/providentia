Came here on Sunday with a group of 8. Â The place is not large but seems to work well enough. The only issue is that we sat at a table where essentially we were all facing the same direction. I understand it was set up this way so that the waiters could place the hot pots on the table without going through any of us but it made for difficult conversation. So that was already a big issue for us, that we couldn't all sit around and talk. There were two burners and we all wanted to get to try different things so we ordered one hot pot that is like a soup already filled with vegetables and noodles where you just add the meal/fish, and another that was just plain boiling water where you dump the veggies, proteins, and noodles in yourself. Unfortunately, the way we were set up, one end of the table basically had one of the kinds of burners and the other side had the other. It took some time to understand how ordering would work - the menu isn't very clear when it comes to how to order for a large group looking to do hot pot. Once we figured it out though, we were happier. The food was good and everything was well cut and presented so we could very easily cook the food. Definitely no complaints in the food department. The only other thing that was sort of bad was the lack of vents. Basically one side of the table was constantly hit with steam from the hot pot because of the lack of ventilation. So basically the set up of the restaurant was the main problem. The food was not a problem. We got ice cream at the end. That was awesome.
