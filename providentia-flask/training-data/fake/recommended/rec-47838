Oh, sweet Lord.  As an Elm City native, this is THE place - thin, blistered, slightly charred crusts, great sauce, not too much cheese, awesome toppings.  I like the fresh tomato & zucchini pie, the potato pie, and the sausage, but I've never been disappointed here.  Never. If you're coming with a group (especially in the winter), bundle up and plan on chatting while you're in line - don't sit around the house until you're hungry and expect to drop by and be seated.
