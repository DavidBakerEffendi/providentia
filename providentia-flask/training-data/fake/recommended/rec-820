This place is awesome! The atmosphere is great, staff is great, and food was amazing! We ordered the Black Angus Beef Cheesesteak Eggrolls came out piping hot and tasted amazing! The California Turkey sandwich was dripping with avocado (I absolutely love avocado) and was a great blend of flavors. And the 1/2 Pound Sirloin Angus Burger (with caramelized onions for a little more) was fantastic! (I didn't have a bite of this, but I did eat half of the amazing fries that came out with the burger). Our waitress was friendly, and approachable! All in all a great experience!
