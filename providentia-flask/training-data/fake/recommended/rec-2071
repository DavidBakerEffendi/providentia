We enjoy visiting restaurants that we have seen on the Travel Chanel, which is how we found Geno's and Pat' Steaks. Flew in to Philly on our way to Atlantic City & stopped in for a taste of Philly!!! Enjoyed the food at both places but have to give the thumbs up to Pat's for their helpful & friendly service. Â  Barb P. San Diego
