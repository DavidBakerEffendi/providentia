How... How does this place... Only have 7 reviews?!! It was packed... I cook regional gourmet Mexican cuisine nightly ..I kid you not... I am a Mexican American as well. The food here is five star. Really amazing, the drinks, tequila, beer is delicious.!! Â I hope the locals appreciate thus place because its a jewel. Please no " margaritas and burrito types, this isn't that kind of place. It's where the true power, breadth and depth of Mexican cuisine is revealed. Viva mexico !! Viva la Bandera Aquila !
