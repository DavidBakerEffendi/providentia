What a fantastic lunch/midnight snack. Dough pressedand baked to order. Imaginative sauces and accompaniments: sunflower seeds, dry banana chips,roasted beet salad.... This is what i want to see more of. Mom and pop shops that care about what they're doing and offer a great, inexpensive product . loved it. next time i am in the neighborhood, i'm going!
