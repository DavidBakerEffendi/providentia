I stopped by Peaches yesterday for an impromptu brunch break and thoroughly-enjoyed myself.  The atmosphere is relaxed, casual and (I don't want to use this word but I can't think of a better one so...) hip.  The staff seems to be solely made up of beautiful young women of varying ethnicities, orientations, etc. (if there were men working there I did not notice.  Sorry, guys.) and the food is great.  I had a giant meatloaf sandwich (seriously, you will not be able to finish it in one sitting and believe me, I tried; it's delectable) a refreshing lemonade which wasn't overly-sweetened as is the case at other joints and my friends and I shared both sweet potato fries and regular fries; I recommend the sweet potato fries.  I hope to visit next weekend and try the fried chicken.
