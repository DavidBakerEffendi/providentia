Rye is the Answer. $5 Old Fashioned and $5 Cheeseburgers. I work up by Riverdale in the Bronx and after the first Happy Hour here, I almost moved to Brooklyn. I can barely arrive by the Happy Hour cut off at 7pm, but have a group of caring friends who ensure that there are a couple of cocktails and burgers waiting for me whether I arrive on time or not. Sometimes we actually eat from the delicious dinner menu but always pair that with a tasty Rye Old Fashioned. Mmm.
