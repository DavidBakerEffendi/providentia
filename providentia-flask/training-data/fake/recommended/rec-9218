Very small.  Very Loud.  Very Good. We went to celebrate our engagement and it was an amazing dining experience.  The bread they brought out was great with a very rich and tasty whipped butter.  Fondue appetizer was delicious.  The Bartender sent some free fried oysters our way.  My first time having them and they were also great.  We were so stuffed from the appetizers that we never though we could eat the main course. The lady had the Bass with a bunch of different peppers.  It was cooked to perfection and the sauce matched the peppers and fish so well.  I had the roasted chicken and it was also very good.   Prices were reasonable (about $25 a plate), atmosphere was great.  If/ when I go back to NYC, we'll be hitting up the blue ribbon again.
