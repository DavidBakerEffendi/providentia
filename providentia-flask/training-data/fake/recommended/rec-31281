So ive been here a few more times for the sandwiches. Their grilled pork sandwich is actually pretty good. And their classic is decent as well. Its not quite up to my Seattle standards but its good. I go there every now and then when im in the neighborhood. I wouldnt say its the best sandwich shop in nyc but its decent especially once you throw that sriracha on (which is a bit weird to me but still delicious).
