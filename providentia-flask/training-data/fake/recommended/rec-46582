Want a real traditional Philadelphia Cheese Steak? This is it!  My 8 year old son won't leave Philadelphia without stopping here. He doesn't care how long the line is.  We both like it plain (no cheese)... I like mine "wit" (with onions)... his is wit-out.  My husband gets the provolone and onions. All of us cheer when we're done.  My son begged for a second sandwich after plowing down the first one... but they are HUGE and there's no way most adults could eat 2 cheese steaks... let alone a lanky 8 year old. We just get in line, order from the pros, grab a seat anywhere (even with strangers if they don't mind) and chow down.  Don't miss the giant hot peppers at the bar.  I go nuts for 'em.  If you don't like the meat, then you don't like a traditional cheese steak meat.  The bread is chewy and a perfect complement to the gooey stuff piled on.
