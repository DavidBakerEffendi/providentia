What a great find...you have to know about it to find it. I've been there multiple times, and everything is fabulous. The staff is friendly, knowledgeably and the service is quick. The food is authentic, and well prepared. The first time I went with a dozen people, and we ordered pretty much every appetizer on the menu. They have everything from the standards (stuffed grape leaves, Tzatziki, Hummous) the the exotic (dandelion greens, beets with greek cheese-not feta, garlic dip, flaming cheese [HOPA], octopus, meatballs, beans) and more. Â We also ordered every dessert, and, DO leave room. Try something other than baklava for once! All their desserts are really really luscious. Other times I've gone, I've had a special (beef cooked in a clay pot...so tender that it practically fell apart, and with interesting spices, including cinnamon and others I couldn't identify, but enjoyed). My companions lamb was ultra tender and tasty. They have vegetarian choices, and seafood. Because they serve authentic Greek food, you might not get what you think you are ordering...for example, the Greek Salad isn't what you get in an American diner, as there is no lettuce. Just ask, and they'll be happy to explain everything. They have a full bar, and you can get Retsina and Ouzo (of course). And sometimes, you can even get a Groupon.
