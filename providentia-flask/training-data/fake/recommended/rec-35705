We ate here during the summer heat wave and, thanks to the wonders of ConEd, the airconditioner wasn't working. Â At most restaurants, this would have been a fiasco, and we would have turned around and walked out the door, but at Bouley the staff were accommodating and adaptive. First, they brought out a cool amuse bouche and ice water to cool us down while we decided. I had the shrimp and scallops to start, followed by the lobster and my father had the bluefin tuna followed by the black sea bass. Everything was perfectly done, but the tuna and the lobster stood out as superb. I'd also note that they included a pair of chilled soups (melon with ricotta and strawberry with another cheese that I forget) on the house to clear our palates and keep us cool. Moreover, they brought out iced tea and coffee with dessert to cool us down. Dessert was equally great; amaretto flan and the chocolate souffle. Between the two, I'd take the souffle, but the maple ice cream served with the amaretto flan was outstanding; intense, creamy, and well-balanced. Again, the food was incredible, but what impressed me most was the way in which they dealt with air conditioning in the restaurant. What could have been a distaster turned into one of the better meals I've had.
