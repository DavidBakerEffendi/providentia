Blue is a culinary complex masterpiece that offers both great cuisine and divine views of the Hudson River. This restaurant is a great addition to the other two restaurants in the group on Staten Island that offers great food at reasonable prices. The service was very detailed and friendly. I look forward to my next visit to Blue.
