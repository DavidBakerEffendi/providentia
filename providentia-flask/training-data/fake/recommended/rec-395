The feeling of contentment emerges within me as I finish my last bite of this truly crafted masterpiece. The taste of this work of genius created a thrill upon my taste buds and emotions, as happiness took over me like a child trying candy for the first time. The ingredients were truly unified and the quality emulated excellence. The bread and meat were soft as clouds; both were flavorful and concise, practical and effective to each other. Made for each other, one cannot simply exist without the other, and if one did exist without the other, life would be unfair, unjustifiable; this masterpiece would be incomplete. The manner of which this burger was intended and the basis for which it was created, is perfect the way it is, as simple as that. I guess what I'm trying to say is, the burger was really good.
