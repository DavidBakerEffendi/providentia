This review is not for their food but restaurant hygiene. We went to have kati rolls and sat at the back on the wooden benches. Both my sister and I got contact dermatitis where the back of our legs touched the bench. We had red itchy blisters and mine got pretty bad. Also we saw some mosquitos in the restaurant too. I don't know about the kitchen but the eating space is not kept very clean and the benches definitely have something going on.
