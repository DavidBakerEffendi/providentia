So amazing! I am writing my review as I eat their fabulous paninis. My sister and my father who dined with me were both equally impressed. The panini is toasted to crispiness, and the inside is warm and tender. There is the right mix of flavor, and not salty at all. I had the smoked salmon with avocado and goat cheese, which was delicious. My sister had the prosciutto, with pesto panini, which I favored more than my salmon. It is a great place to go, and the prices are great. We went on a Friday afternoon, and we had to wait 10 minutes for a seat because it was so packed! Great place to dine with the family.
