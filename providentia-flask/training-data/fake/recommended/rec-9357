No dim sum here! Was in Manhattan the other day with a hankering for Dim Sum . Used yelp to find a dim sum place and was directed to Joe's. Got there around 12:30, was seated immediately.  But I didn't see any carts.  I asked the server about dim sum, and she said no carts, dim sum through the menu.  Looked through the menu.  The options were either hidden, or on another menu.  I got up and left. Giving the place 3 stars out of courtesy.
