I came here with some work friends when the winner of the NCAA bracket pool offered to buy the first round. I tried beignets for the first time, and they were particularly good. The outdoor seating was nice, and if I lived in the Fairmount Park area, I have a feeling that this place would be my regular stomping ground.
