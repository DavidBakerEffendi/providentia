This has become one of my favorite restaurants. It is BYOB and they will make an amazing sangria or you can just drink the wine. The tapas are delicious I've had picadillo with tostones and it was divine. For dinner the skirt steak was perfection. I am Cuban so I have standards when it comes to Cuban food and this is delicious. Also big portion of food. It does get busy but I guess I've gotten lucky because I've never had to wait when I have gone. Even if there is a wait, it is worth the wait.
