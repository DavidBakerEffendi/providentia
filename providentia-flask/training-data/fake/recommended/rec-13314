i came here twice one summer ago, and from my vague memory, i can remember succulent, moist meatballs (pun intended if you're dirty-minded like me..jk!!) in decent portions and for a decent price. i recall having the special one time - the jambalaya balls and they blew my panties off! but i think their specials change almost everyday, so if you're lucky and you see it on the menu on your next visit, don't hesitate. order it! i would recommend this place for brunch, but be forewarned, the place is pretty crammed and the tables are tiny, so it's not made for a huge group hangout.
