Found this guy on Yelp and ventured out in the record-low January weather while on vacation in NY to check it out.  SO GLAD I DID! At first, I was like, "really?  there's just gonna' be some random guy with a cart in THIS weather?!"  And there he was... long line and all!   He was really friendly, and I ordered the pondicherry after reading reviews, and not disappointed.  Sat and devoured the entire takeout box at a train stop freezing my fingers off.  I couldn't stop.  I didn't expect Indian food to be so fresh and healthy tasting (who knows - maybe I'm wrong about that last part!).  Wished to God that I had ordered a samosa or ANYTHING else so my taste experience didn't have to end.
