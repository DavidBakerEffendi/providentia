Drink the beer. The draft list is amazing, as is the bottle list. Casey knows his shit, and if you ask nicely, he might just pull out something rare from the back. Don't eat the food. Actually, the pulled pork isn't bad, and they have improved much of the menu. But unless you're hammered, best to stick to the beverages until you are. Five stars for booze, minus one for the food. Four stars.
