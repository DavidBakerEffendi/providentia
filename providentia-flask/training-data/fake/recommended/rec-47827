So I'm going to go against a lot of the reviews and give Bar a meh.  I went here for lunch, and overall, I'd say that the place was very underwhelming.  I'd see how college kids might think the deconstructed interior with exposed wires and plaster would be cool, but as someone who graduated college a decade ago, I was not impressed. Nor was I impressed with the pizza.  I've had brick oven pizza before, and Bar's brick oven pizza left me wanting.  The crust is entirely too thin.  We got red pie with mozzarella, sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil, and the toppings were kind of skimpy, too.  Honestly, after four slices, I was still hungry because there just wasn't enough of a carb-protein combination.  I will say that the toppings were tasty, but the overly-scorched, almost non-existent crust wasn't. Bottom line: it's hard to ruin pizza, and I wouldn't say that Bar ruined it, but I would say that if you want real, substantial pizza, head somewhere else.
