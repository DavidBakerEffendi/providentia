The food was superb, and I thought it was the closest thing I've tasted to thai since being in Thailand. I didnt drink though, so can't comment on any of that. The decor is kinda odd for a Thai restaurant though. The service was good but a little hurried. All in all I recommend going for the food. I had dumplings, Calamari, and then the room service pad thai, which was excellent.
