First and foremost, it's important to understand the concept behind Momofuku Ssäm Bar (pronounced 'Siam').  Prior reviewers have commented that the food is Asian Fusion, but it is in fact American New Cuisine.  The idea behind the range of influences (many admittedly are Asian) is that American food draws influences from the immigrants that come here, so of course variations on Korean and Chinese food are as American as they are Korean or Chinese. And the philosophy shows through in the way traditional American dishes are infused with Eastern influences.  For instance, the beef brisket I had was served as small slices of beef in a broth and eaten with chopsticks; and while the horseradish was decidedly American, the spices definitely were not. This is a common theme throughout the menu here; a traditional American dish will be given a new spin through the eyes of immigrants.  True, some dishes are true to their roots; the pork buns, which are quite possibly the best use of pork ever devised, are essentially Asian.  But the rotating menu is not beholden to one culture or one way of thinking about presenting and eating food.  Except that it's all delicious. I recommend going with a small group of friends, maybe up to four, and ordering a bunch of small dishes to share.  Reasonably priced, a well-shared smattering will give you both an appreciation of the food itself and a full belly.  The environment is certainly hip and the loud, well-selected rock music makes it hard to think of Ssäm Bar as an intimate dining experience.  No, this is a good laugh with friends over excellent, mouth-watering food.
