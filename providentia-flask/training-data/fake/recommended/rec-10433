While I was in town for business, my cousin said that we had to come here to get the truly Philly fan sporting experience since it's located right next to the Philly sports park. While waiting for her to arrive, I was reading Yelp reviews and realized that the crab fries were a must.  I ended up splitting an order of those and going with the Philly Cheese Steak which turned out to be great as well. Atmosphere was a little loud since they were launching Corona on tap and this is the first place to serve it in the US.  TVs were also everywhere which made watching any NBA game possible.
