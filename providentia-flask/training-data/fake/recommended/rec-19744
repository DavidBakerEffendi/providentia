"Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and then have some pizza in Brooklyn" seemed to be the agenda for most tourists on that day...and you'd probably be tempted to do the same like I was. WARNING: Do not go here if you are already hungry! We waited 20 minutes for a table, then another 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive. Ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms. The pizza ingredients were each good on their own, but together something was just missing - maybe not enough fresh basil or spices? I don't know, I just didn't feel the Grimaldi's magic. Service was horrendous. Our waiter practically disappeared after bringing our order, so we had to ask two different people for water refills and the check. I wouldn't come back unless there was no line.
