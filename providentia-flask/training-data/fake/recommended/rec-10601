Terrible policy! We arrived for brunch, asked for a table, but there wasn't one available so we say at the bar. Before our food arrived, several tables opened and no one was waiting, so we asked to move. We were told by the manager that it was policy never to allow a customer to move. Our daughter left in disgust and our special family breakfast was ruined. We won't be back!
