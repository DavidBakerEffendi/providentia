After reading some reviews here....I thought I should drop in next time I'm in NYC.  It was a very busy saturday night  and we had to wait 10-12 minutes for a free table.  We got the table in the back located right next to the kitchen door where I had a clear view of the cooking staff.  The kitchen door was left open all night. We ordered two noodle dishes and a rice dish (salted fish and chicken fried rice).  While waiting for the food, I noticed a chef in front of the wok station lighting up a cigarette.  Yes...this might bother most people but I am pretty used to it.  I grew up and worked in chinese restaurant kitchens and saw this on a regular basis.  Let's move on.... The food came very fast.  Ingredients were fresh and the dishes were quite tasty.  We finished it off and got the bill pretty quick.  The food bill was cheap (that's a plus).  If you are looking for triple-A service...maybe this place is not for you.  They tend to throw dishes rather than serve the dishes onto your table.   It is your typical grease joint Hong Kong type eatery....which I like. Overall, I would return and try some of the other dishes that some yelpers are recommending.
