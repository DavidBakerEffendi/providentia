chaotic flashing lights. traffic. people. hustle. time square. slow it down. around the corner. serendipitous find. tucked away. hidden ninja Izakaya. write your name/number. 45 minute wait. they will call you.  5 plasma televisions around = reality check. kills the ambiance & your imagination of being in a cool hidden speakeasy tokyo pop joint.  simple unimaginative decor. but spectacular food. busy. busy. bodies. bottles of sweet sake. good recommendations. authentic. menu = too many choices. but inexpensive enough to order everything. small plates - sharing is caring. get greedy. try everything. keep it flowing. keep it going. so satisfied. but always, always, make room for dessert.
