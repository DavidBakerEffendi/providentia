Stumbled apon this place one evening for a drink and a bite to eat... - $3 coronas on the menu, yes not a special (which is $2 during happy hour) -  whiskey coconut waters!!!!  Who knew.  This is going to be the go to from this point on   - great low key hometown vibe - good food, had a sandwich and an appetizer that hit the spot Almost forgot to mention the live band killin it in this intimate space.  Was my first time here and for sure won't be the last....
