This has been a favorite of ours for some time now.  When we lived in New Haven we came here at least a few times a month with the same couple of friends and hunkered down for some pub grub and good drinks.   We always feel welcome here and the waitresses are always very nice.  The key here is that they recognize us and don't pretend as though it's the first time we set foot in the place which happens all too often in New Haven (Do you hear me Botega?).   I would venture to say that I am "beer-ed" within a few minutes of sitting down.   Or ,like last night I had two large Jack & Diet Cokes that had plenty of Jack.   In my opinion the food is always good.   They usually have a ton of specials to choose from in addition to a fairly sizable menu.   Last night we had the calamari tossed with hot cherry peppers and marinara.   I loved them and Bill liked them (I'll qualify this by saying if you put hot cherry peppers on grasshoppers I'd love them too).  Most times we go to Dempsey's when we are in the mood for a burger.   The burgers are awesome - not to mention the pile of steak fries they come with. Bill's favorite is the peppercorn burger.  Mine is the plain old cheese burger.   The chef salad is huge and fresh and comes with a great side of bread.    Don't overlook the 20 or so sandwhich selections.   There is outdoor seating.   But, as with most places here in CT - it's where the smokers sit so as far as I'm concerned you might as well be sitting in the bathroom.   Oh yeah - the bathrooms here are - teenie tiny but usually clean. Plenty of TV's around the bar and a juke box that doesn't seem to get a lot of action.   Hey, toss in a few Dolly Parton selections and maybe that will change?
