We went at 1:30 on a Saturday for brunch - tiny place but big flavors and great service. The pitchers of Sangria were refreshing but beware - a lot of those fruit bits are actually lemon rind chunks... Lamb skewers- incredible white asparagus- a little mushy for my taste, but caviar had great flavor chorizo- spicy and plentiful squid in ink- fun to play with - we drew mustaches cheese plates - not super original but yummy Great spot for brunch- loved the staff and the vibe.
