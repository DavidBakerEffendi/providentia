The Saint Austere is the best restaurant around Williamsburg. It's great for any occasion, whether it's date night and you're sitting at the bar or meeting up with friends and you grab a table. The menu changes seasonally, but you must try the patatas bravas, warm butternut squash salad, branzino, meatballs...it's all amazing. Absolutely get the dark and stormy, they bottle it themselves. The staff is friendly, you feel like it's your own neighborhood joint.
