I didn't even know this gem existed until a Billyburg friend brought us by the other night. What a pleasant surprise: a nice neighborhood spot that is thoughtfully designed with good drinks, food and service. Imagine that. We all started our meals with a cocktail. Mine, their take on a Margarita was excellent, dangerously smooth with the ideal balance of sweet and tart. I ordered the quail and it was the perfect portion for a late night snack - well-seasoned and expertly prepared with a side of smooth and delicate spoonbread. The boys at the table shared a bone-in ribeye. My husband was wary that the grass fed beef would be lacking in the richness he expects in his beef, so the server brought out the raw steak to show him the marbling - a nice touch. It came out expertly cooked and we all shared a side of broccoli rabe and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is a must order - one of the best I've had. For dessert we split the maple creme brulee - a well done version of this popular item with the maple adding a hint of interest to make it memorable. I would definitely go back to Rye for dinner or just drinks the vibe is great and the food is tasty AND well-priced to boot.
