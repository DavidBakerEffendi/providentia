I walked into this place by myself one evening to check out the menu. I immediately felt comfortable sitting alone at the long oak bar (a trait I think is hard to find) and decided to get a bite to eat. The bartender was super friendly and I noticed there were alot of "single" diners at the bar too. I had the rose by the glass and a spicy rock shrimp salad that was out of the world. A simple elegant dining experience.
