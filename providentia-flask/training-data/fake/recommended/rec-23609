I've never had a savory crepe before I went to the SkinnyP, and let me tell you, I'm a HUGE fan. Whether I crave something salty or sweet, there's plenty of good choices! Go to the restaurant on the waterfront ~ fun and seasonably stunning, or find their cart on Church Street. They also have fondue on certain nights as well as singers and bands... Great vibe, good food, one of my favorite casual and satisfying favorites. Oh, they make their own tempeh...hmmm so good! and poutine too - their vegetarian version is delish!
