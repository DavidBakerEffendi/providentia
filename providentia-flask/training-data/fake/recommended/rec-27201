I really love this bar and Mayor and Claus are very nice & friendly. I have been coming here about 2 years, but I gave to say that the last time I went I was disappointed. The brunette woman that was bartending was very abrasive and seemed put out over getting us drinks. She also kept slamming our drinks and plates down...I just didn't appreciate it. I didn't want to rate it badly because I've had so many good experiences here, but if this was my first time I wouldn't have come back.
