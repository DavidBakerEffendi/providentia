One of my new favorite places!  My friend and I got the $29 pre-fixed meal.  For my appetizer, I got mini tortillas with a seasoned avocado, main course pan seared blue fish, and chocolate mousse for dessert.  My friend got the orange cream pie instead.  I also got a glass of sangria.  Everything was so flavorful and delicious.  The atmosphere is so cute and cozy for a date, girls night, or place to take out of town guests.
