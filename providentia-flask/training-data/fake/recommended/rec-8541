I've been here only once so far so I don't want to be too judgmental.  Perhaps I'll have a more favorable opinion after another visit or two. Really I don't need to say much other than echo other reviewers' comments re: hipsters.  I simply didn't feel welcome when I sat down to order my honey and brie sandwich.  I asked for some water and after the girl behind the counter poured it then started to bring the glass over the counter.  I met her hand to take it and a bit of water spilled.  "Whoa, just let me set it down, OK??" cried the barista.  I didn't think this was a thing to get one's panties in a bunch about but my attempt to take the glass seemed to agitate her.  I didn't have much interaction with her afterwards as I watched her bob her hipster head to the nondescript emopop blaring in the background. Now I know this isn't a full service place but I wanted more water and had to eventually go to the other end of the counter to finally get the attention of the other girl working there, who was engrossed in conversation with a friend. Pretty much every baked good is vegan.  I wish there were more of a non-vegan selection.  Some vegan baked goods can be good, but only certain kinds of items.  If you think that any baked good can be just as good if its vegan, I'm sorry but you have no taste.  If I go there a few more times I wouldn't be surprised to run into someone I remember from college who ate at the co-op below my dorm, where dessert could be a sugarless cake with tofu-based frosting. So yes I'm using some hyperbole here but I just didn't get a very good vibe from the place.  Further bulletins as events warrant, and I actually try a few other things.
