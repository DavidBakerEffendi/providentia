Cozy sandwich place with a focused menu.  Best panini I've had in awhile.  Beet salad was nice.  A little pricier than usual or a panini (10 bucks) but well worth it.  After coming a few times, the winners are the porchetta, italian meatloaf and chorizo sandwiches.  In terms of the crostini, the egg salad with truffle oil and spicy tuna were delicious.  My kid, who hates veggies, orders the ham with garlic spinach and cheese here.  Just for that, they get 5 stars.  Hope they can keep it up, I'm planning on coming a few times a month.
