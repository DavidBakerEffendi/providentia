I'm sorry, but no....  Rather than question all of the good reviews of this place, maybe I should just assume that either I went on a very off day?  I admit that I do like the concept of fast Korean food, "Gourmet Heaven" style, where you can pick and choose from a wide variety of dishes, and the space is quite nice and clean with ample eating area.  But the food...My goodness, I've never had such atrocities displayed as food.  Tteokbokki tastes like burnt gruel,  japchae was tasteless, kimbap rice was hard and brittle on the outside and again tasteless.  If this represents Korean peoples' tastes (I assume the majority of reviewers are Korean), then thats a little frightening.
