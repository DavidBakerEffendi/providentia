The food here is really good. Everything we ordered was great. For appetizers we had the lollipop scallops which were cooked so perfectly and the andouille baked clams which were very tasty. For our entrees we ordered the seafood gone wild and the summer lamb; both were extremely good and well seasoned. Our drinks were also great. The only downside to this place is that is very small and service is ok. Would still highly recommend because of the food.
