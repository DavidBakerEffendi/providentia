This place is worthy of all praise and deserving of the historical preservation landmark (j/k!). Don't ask me why it took me so long to get myself over here, but it doesn't matter now because this bar is worth coming back to again and again. So what's the big deal?  Well, if y'all don't know by now, the Corner Bistro is renown for their burger. Their Bistro Burger is similar to a savory Gastroburger only skip the higher price and the "ambiance" typical of Gastropubs.   I stopped by here after having HH nearby on a Thursday night and to my very delight, enjoyed the burger to the fullest.  The Bistro Burger is the size of Shake Shack but the meat is akin to the thickness of fresh, perfectly flavored 6 oz+ beef patties. While I knew it'd be damn good, I just didn't know, it would be this friggin good. Add the American cheese, tomatoes, pickles and bacon and you get a serious heavenly burger.  For only $6.75, this is definitely a frequent eat of mine and yours. Pair that with McSorley's Dark (for $2.75 only) or Light, well, you get a wonderful snack or third/fourth meal of the day! So far, this is no. 2 on my list for best burger. Stay tuned with my future burger finds but meanwhile, this one is for keeps!
