Great beer, nice staff and awesome dijon mussels... a must eat... Good fries with sea salt and darn good bourbon dipping sauce. The place gets a little crowded at night but if you can sink into one of the front seats in the window, go for it. We try to get there in the late afternoon before the insanity strikes and we enjoy every minute.
