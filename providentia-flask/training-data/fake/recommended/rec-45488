On a street, with no water in sight, is NJ's best seafood / fish restaurant. Â Even though the noise here can be raucous, the absolutely freshest oysters and outstanding variety of fish, push BPG to 5 stars and beyond! BPG has been our favorite in Princeton for more years than we can remember. With it's growth a few years ago to the adjacent insurance office and the expanded sidewalk dining, it's lost some of it's charm, but more than makes up for with what's being served. Favorites here include the nightly supply of ultra fresh oysters, and the grilled whole branzino. Yep you'll have to dehead, fillet and debone the branzino, but no complaints as it's easy to do. BPG is BYOB and there's a wine shop two doors down Nassau that owes it's longevity to BPG! Reservations now allow us to eat at desired dinner hours versus standing at the door when they opened to avoid the nightly hour plus waits. There's lots to like at BPG and we'll be back again, and again, and again.... !
