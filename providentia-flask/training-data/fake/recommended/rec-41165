Get in mah belly, Chuko! It's all about the veggie ramen here, guys. I can't eat pork, so that's my only option and holy hell is friggin delicious. Add an egg and you've got a meal fit for a champ. Also get the brussels sprouts appetizer. Super duper--deep fried and tossed with what i imagine to be the following ingredients: fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, peanut oil, jalape√±os, and crushed peanuts. It's my new go-to way of preparing brussels sprouts. One star deducted because it's cash only. CHUKO! nomnomnomnomnomnom
