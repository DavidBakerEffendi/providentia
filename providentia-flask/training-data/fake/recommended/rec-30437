Very cool vibe. It is very small and private inside with very nice dim lighting. I I thought the menu was great lots of choices. I had the lemon spaghetti but I substituted the spaghetti for "priest stranglers" and it was fantastic. I also ordered a special from the menu which I thought was fantastic as well. I would definitely come back here, great date place. Also a great place to come with a friend to grab a drink. Very cool spot!
