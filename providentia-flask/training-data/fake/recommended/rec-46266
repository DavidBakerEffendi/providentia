This place is consistently FANTASTIC. I dined here for the first time last year and was almost afraid to come back because the experience was so perfect. I finally visited again last month and it was even better! The service is incredible, the drinks are amazing, and the food is absolutely delicious. One of my favorite restaurants in NYC for sure-- can't wait to try every single thing on the menu!
