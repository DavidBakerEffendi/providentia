While my time in law school won't go down as being the best years of my life, by any stretch, one especially fond memory I have involved heading over to Hell's Kitchen between classes with my bro Ted to scarf down $5 lunch and imbibe fairly priced ales. You can do it on the cheap, Miller/Bud/Etc., or stretch for the semi-craft brews, along the lines of Chimay. The chicken fingers, serviceable. Ditto the quesadilla, mozz sticks, and pita/hummus. Â But, come on, I am not above $5 and, I submit, neither should you be. If this applies to you, SHU Law students, know that The Wef will never question your sly and seemingly inexplicable grin during your 5:50 pm Professional Responsibility class. (Can I resist the urge to inject a well-placed but really juvenile Hell pun? No.) Just say it's the devil's work. It's kind of true. And he'll respect you for it.
