Char No. 4 is a very solid brunch option.  Just make sure you come hungry.  It looks kind of dark inside, but the back dining room is actually rather bright and airy.  If you're nursing a hangover, you can stick to the main dining room or bar area.  Waitstaff were all nice and attentive, and they were playing a pretty good 90s alt rock mix, so I was happy from the get-go.  I started out with a bourbon bloody mary, garnished with a house-made pickle.  It sounded really weird, but it was actually surprisingly good!  It had a bit of a smoky flavor and reminded me of a michelada.  I had poached eggs over cheese grits.  The grits were a little more watery then I like to make them, but the flavor was right on.  It was generally delicious.  The hubs enjoyed his lamb pastrami hash, which was a special.  The only thing we remarked on was that we both would've liked a little slice of toast or something.  Both our dishes were very heavy and we could've used a little something to balance it out.  I also had a few bites of the fried cheese curds- pretty good but pretty dang greasy.  I experienced the kind of bloat I usually only feel after a meal in New Orleans, so it seems like authentic Southern food to me.
