This place is amazing. It's on my list for top 5 fav burgers. :) Let me start out with the burgers. I got the truffle burger which was cheesy and moist. It melts in your mouth! We shared sweet potato fries which were amazing as well. The great thing was the service was awesome and the staff was so friendly, which is sometimes hard to find in NYC. I would go back, wish I lived closer. This place is also BYOB which is nice.
