Looked for a local spot on Yelp and came up with Maddy's Mexican Grill.  1.  Close by, 2. Open on Sunday and BYO 3.  Reasonable prices and pretty steady reviews.   VERY HAPPY with the turnout.  Having lived in Parsippany for 10 years there was no good Mexican food nearby.  The choices have changed over the years and Maddy's is a great spot.  The chips and salsa (as everyone said) were delicious.  Absolutely homemade and good.  The service was pleasant and attentive (including a glass of "on the house" wine offered and refills on chips/salsa).   I tried the tacos - 2 chicken/2 steak with the cilantro and onions.  Very tasty.  I thought they could use a little sauce and asked for salsa and stole some of my husband's sour cream.  Only made them better.  A little fat on one piece of steak, otherwise perfect.   Husband had the Maddy's Burrito and thoroughly enjoyed.   I had the coupon from the site and our bill was not enough, so I ordered the sweet tortilla chips to go.  OMG-ate some in the car and then devoured the rest when we got home.  They were warm, crisp, perfectly dusted with powdered sugar and what I assume was caramel or some amazingly delicious sauce.  And to think I only got these because I wanted to use a coupon and they were out of my favorite Mexican dessert, flan.   We will absolutely be back.  The table next to us brought their cooler and beers which I thought was an awesome idea!  Also the homemade guac. they had looked amazing as well, however my husband is not a fan and I couldn't eat it all by myself, so I didn't try it.   Interested to see if they will deliver to Lincoln Park but look forward to becoming a regular either way.
