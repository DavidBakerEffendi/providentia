Would have given this place 5 stars after our first visit.   Went with my folks and the food was excellent.  We shared the Calamari, 2 Pad Thais, and Green Curry,  Everything was amazing.  The service was decent, and the prices were pretty good. Fast forward a month and we went again.  The Pad Thai was really off.  Couldn't quite place it, but it was way too salty and didn't taste like the first time.  We asked if there was a new chef in the back or what, but apparently everything was normal.  The calamari was under-seasoned this time too, but the curry was still good.  Will come back a 3rd time to see what is the true story but was really disappointed the 2nd time we went back...
