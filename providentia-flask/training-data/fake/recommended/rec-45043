I came here with high expectations and left with them fulfilled. The service was great, the ambiance was perfect, the music was killer, and the food was wonderful. I ordered the meatball sliders of course. They were very good but difficult to consume due to their height haha. I also had a side of their french fries with spicy aioli. I daresay Little Owl fries a perfect french fry. Very very tasty. Service was great, water was always filled and the servers were very friendly. I also enjoyed the salt bowl and candlelight. Loses a star because they don't have their award-winning burger on the menu :( And it was 20 bucks for sliders and fries... A little high
