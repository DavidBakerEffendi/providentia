Yesterday on our way to Clifton we were looking for a nice lunch spot and came across this place on Yelp. I loved the vibe and decor of the restaurant.. very cute little spot with friendly wait staff and cozy booths. Didn't know what to expect when we got here as far as size and wait time so made reservations just in case (and to double confirm they were open on Sundays). They reserved a cute corner booth by the front windows for us. Food selection was nice - large brunch menu as well as sandwiches and burgers - just what we were in the mood for. I got the 596 Burger and my boyfriend got the Grilled Chicken sandwich. Burger was very good, juicy and tasty. The grilled chicken sandwich was overcooked - very dry and too charred for my liking. Would give this place another shot if in the area, but wasn't overly impressed with the taste of the food on our first visit.
