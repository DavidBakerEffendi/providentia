I am kinda sad to have to give this place two stars because I really love their pasta and honey truffle oil crostini, but I love my husband more and he got food positiong here. He ordered the seafood stew which gave him nonstop vomiting and diarherra for two days and fever for one of the days. It was the worst experience both he and I has ever had with seafood and trust me we had our fair share of seafood around the world. Please stay away from their seafood dishes.
