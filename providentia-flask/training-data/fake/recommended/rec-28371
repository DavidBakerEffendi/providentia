Way too small of a space if you're standing you have people constantly knocking into you when its crowded. If you sit on a stool against the wall that is classified as waitress service only and you're not allowed to get your own drinks from the bar. Weird and kind of annoying especially since the 4 inch ledge in front of you doesn't classify as a table in my opinion. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but if friends invited me I'd probably reluctantly tag along.
