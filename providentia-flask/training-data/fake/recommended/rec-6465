Make a reservation. This place is usually packed, even mid-week. The place is nicely decorated with clay pots hanging from the ceiling, clean-lined furniture, and a rustic communal table toward the back of the restaurant.  The hostess was very nice, but the service was slow (I almost thought they forgot about us).   The food was fresh and tasty. My favorite was the classic moussaka, which was great but overpriced. In fact, I think everything on their menu is a little overpriced considering that they are pretty basic Greek dishes...nothing super creative or over the top. But I guess in NYC we pay for where we eat first, and what we eat second :( I wanted to give this place 3 and a half stars, but don't know how to give a half-star!
