If you like a strong, well-executed cocktail and a fun atmosphere that takes you to another era, I'd definitely say go to Dead Rabbit. The full cocktail menu is creative and full of whiskey/scotch/bourbon based drinks--I tried three and loved each one. I'm amazed I didn't get catastrophically drunk. There is less emphasis on the food, but that's fine, as their fries (must have) and burger are perfect partners to the liquidy stars of the show. Since they don't take reservations I would def recommend showing up early, putting your name in for the second floor, and enjoy some cocktails on the third floor while you wait. Lastly, don't get the deviled eggs with caviar. It's simply not worth it--but everything else is. P.s. Many cocktails are served in antique looking tea cups, and some even have built in mustache guards. So, need I say more?
