What makes this a true diner is it's open 24 hours and not like some that are in the area that close at 10PM, I wont mention names, but you know who you are. The marinara sauce is surprisingly nice and thick, not watered down. When I got the shrimp parm, it was done almost perfectly, the clam chowder was average, pumpernickel bread that they gave out was really good. They're clean and the menu books we got were new, selections many, there's parking and the servers nice. I would have given this place a 4 but I'm taking a star away because the owner or manager at the desk wasn't friendly and he had an uptight disposition, not what an owner or manager should be right? He probably had a bad day but we'll see at our next visit. Our server was very attentive and made sure that food we had planned to take home was kept in a safe place before we left, she didn't want to put it on our table because we didn't have enough room, she and the others who refilled drivers etc were really nice.
