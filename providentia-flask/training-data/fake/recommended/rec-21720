I absolutely adored this place. It was recommended to me as one of the best in Brooklyn and I could not agree more. The quality and taste of the food was outstanding. The service was impeccable. On top of the dinner, the chef sent out extra tasting dishes, which were amazing treats. Instead of bread, they serve housemade veggie chips with sage and roasted garlic. Yum! The decor is adorable and the artistry of everything for the price was top notch. I would go back there many times over.
