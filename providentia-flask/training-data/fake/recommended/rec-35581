Expensive for the quantity and the quality of food. Â Every dish was too salty for me. Kampachi - tint skewer, nothing special. Paella - flavor is good but the rice is mushy Pork belly - very fatty but flavorful, probably the best dish. Chestnut soup - thick and nutty, would had been great if not overpowered by saltiness. Probably won't come back again.
