Oh, wow... We were headed into the city last night for one of the first rounds of Philly's Funniest at Helium and decided to have dinner in the city.  I was all about going to Vic Sushi until I realized that duh, we were going on a Sunday and almost EVERYTHING in that area is closed.  We looked at our options and like a beam of sun shining on my laptop screen with a chorus of angels, Village Whiskey stared back at me.  An Iron Chef burger joint that doesn't feel like fast food?  Count us in. We walked up at about 5 PM and there was a 20 minute wait for inside and none for outside.  We chose to sit outside and were seated at a table right as the shade was coming over it to give us a break from the insane heat we've had lately.  We ordered drinks and enjoyed some people watching while we waited.  I know it's probably sacrilegous, but we didn't even really consult the GIGANTIC whiskey menu, as neither one of us enjoys it, but we did appreciate the number of offerings.  I had a cocktail which was good, but a little pricey for the size, but not a big deal.  We ordered some clams from the raw bar, a burger each, and an order of the duck fat fries with Sly Fox cheddar sauce.  I honestly don't even want to write anything funny or witty or off the wall to review the food because it was that fantastic.  The burgers are huge and offer some great options for toppings that will keep you coming back again and again to try new combinations.  Our burgers themselves were cooked perfectly and my husband ate his and almost half of mine in 7 minutes.  The fries are crispy and savory and delicious.   We'll definitely be going back to Village Whiskey again, but I'll probably skip the cocktails and stick to beer, or (more likely) a car bomb milkshake.
