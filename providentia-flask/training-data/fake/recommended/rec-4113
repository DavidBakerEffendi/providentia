Really do enjoy this place very much. Came here as a group and we ordered about 5 different apps. Garlic shrimp was my favorite - although, I felt it was made more like a shrimp scampi... sauce was a little thick but still delicious. I had the Garlic Chicken and it was phenomenal... also ate some Picadinho off someone elses plate haha and it was definitely a winner. The portions are also very big! You will most likely be taking things home. For dessert I had the serradura (saw dust) which is my fave Portuguese dessert & it was phenomenal. My only two complaints are the "Filet Mignon on a hot stone" they they offer.... this is a steak they give you raw to cook yourself on a hot stone which I must say is pretty cool HOWEVER, if your at a table where two or three people order it or in a room where a few people order it, it gets very smokey!!! My other complaint was the sangria. I was really not a fan. Was very watered down. Other-wise, I enjoyed my time and the food! Would recommend.
