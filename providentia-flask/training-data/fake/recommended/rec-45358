Awesome place! We had an excellent server who was super friendly and suggested items for us to order. We ended up ordering some of the pickling samples (asparagus, tomatoes, and sour pickles). The asparagus wasn't too good (it was very heavy on the pepper) but the tomatoes and pickles were deliciouso. Â  I got the salmon salad which was really fresh and light (it had a citrus dressing) and my friend got mac & cheese and fried pickles-which she said were great. The coffee and tea was a bit expensive ($5 each) but they brought out an invidual french press so it was at least 4 cups. We stayed for nearly 5 hours on a Sunday night and no one seemed to care :)
