Currently here having a late night snack with my partner here. She ordered the Vegetable Bibimbap. Absolutely delicious! Attentive service, nice atmosphere! Noticed a cosy basement bar when going to the bathroom. Will be back! Quote from my partner: 'this is one of the best dishes Iv ever had' Enough said! Very impressed for a random late night munch and quick drink spot on Â a Tuesday!
