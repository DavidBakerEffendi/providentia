I stopped by this place by chance on my way to a school way, way on the East side. I picked up a spinach cheddar muffin to tide me over as I walked. That muffin was so freakin' good (moist, savory, delicious, surprising) that when I walked back after my teaching gig, I had to stop to get another one. I live nowhere near here and am almost never around the hood - but I would go out of my way to have another one of those extraordinary muffins.
