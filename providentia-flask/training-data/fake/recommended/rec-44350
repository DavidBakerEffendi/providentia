We have been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally made it.  There are 11,000 restaurants in this crazy City so sometimes it takes me longer ;).  Amanda Freitag is a wonderful person on TV and also a top notch chef.  The vibe in this place is upbeat, friendly, and most of all, welcoming.   Since it was Sunday brunch our options outside of breakfast were somewhat limited so we chose the fish sandwich.  The fish is Hake, similar to Cod but in my opinion, much better.  It was cooked perfectly!  Deep Fried with a gentle, crispy crust on the exterior and complimented by a thin slice of cheddar.  The menu is comfort food but not cheap comfort food.  I'm willing to pay top dollar for great service and food anyday! We will definitely be back to try more!
