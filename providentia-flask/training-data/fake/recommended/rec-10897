My office recently temporarily moved 10 blocks south and I have to say while I was happy about the faster commute, I was more excited to be 10 blocks closer to Ardesia, a perfect after work location for really good wine and some small plates (and I mean small!). I love the atmosphere, minimalist, without forsaking warmth - a slate bar, cool chalkboard walls, and a smattering of candles - and the bartenders and waitstaff know their stuff for sure.  A drawback however, they recently dropped their $6 happy hour wine deal and instead changed it to $2 off all wines.  According to a bartender, this was to allow more selection...but that still makes most glasses of wine $8 or $9, with the discount.  The $6 option was the reason I stopped in here in the first place. I hope they bring it back.  The beer selection is good for a wine bar.  They have about four drafts, which I don't believe rotate frequently, and a good number of bottles.  Plus, you've gotta love a place that doesn't even think of adding Bud Light (or anything Bud Light-esque) to the menu.  Thanks for that. On to the food.  I recently discovered the pretzels ($6), which are amazing and a surprising menu addition for a wine bar.  They are large and come with cheese and mustard.  Yum.  Another favorite is the S'mores ($5).  They are TINY (three to a plate), but sometimes a little bit of sweet is all you need...so more often than not, they hit the mark.  I also love the Salt Cod Croquettes ($5 for two), also small...but sometimes a little bit of salt is all you need, so...you get the idea.  The Duck Bahn Mi and the "Cuban" (both $14) are worth noting.  They are a little more hearty, but, you know, small (particularly for $14).
