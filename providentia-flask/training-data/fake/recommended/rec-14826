What can I say, the pizza here is pretty solid. The simplest pies showcase the quality of ingredients best here, while sometimes the flavors get lost in the specialty dishes (arugula, seafood, etc.) It can also be hit or miss as to how over-done the crust is going to be, but it's nothing that isn't remedied by the delicious red pepper soaked olive oil on each table. With a good selection of well priced beer and the fast service, the wait isn't ever too large but expect at least a half hour to an hour wait on a weekend night. Don't bank on their new texting app working (or even letting you register either).
