I was in a mood for a good hot dog and after some research decided that Hot Diggity was worth a try. I'm so glad I did! I got a Plain Old Dog w/ everything and tried the Cincinnati Skyline. They were DUHlish! I can't believe I'm so late to the party. The hand-cut fries were also great with the peppercorn ranch dipping sauce. Washed it all down with a classic Levis Champ Cherry and I was in heaven. Can't wait to try some of the other dogs on the menu.
