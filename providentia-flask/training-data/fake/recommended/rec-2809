Dined-in here again recently and also took-out a couple of pizzas. The dine-in experience was good, but it suffered from the chattiest waiter I have ever seen in my entire life. He wouldn't leave us alone, as he told a never-ending series of string-of-consciousness stories. Pizza was really good, especially the mushroom and onion.
