Been looking forward to this place opening for 2 months, the first Indian restaurant in Clifton.  Finally opened today (10/13/14). You pick an item (curry bowl, biryani bowl, burrito, or salad bowl).  Then pick the protein, sauce, and toppings.  They make the food fresh for you while you wait. We ordered a curry bowl with chicken, korma sauce, and a couple toppings.  We also ordered a Chicken Katini Roll. They forgot to put the toppings on the curry bowl.  Considering it was the first day, understandable.  Both dishes were delicious, fresh and lots of flavor. Why the 3 stars?  The curry bowl is way too expensive at $11 and change.  The portion is not that big.  Prices at a sit down Indian restaurant are similar but with larger portions.  A "fast-casual" Indian restaurant, which is akin to their food truck, should be less expensive.  Comparable places in Jersey City and Edison are much less expensive (and better food). Hopefully they decrease their prices.  Then I would definitely frequent this restaurant, especially considering they deliver.
