Pretty cool spot to go to for coffee and delicious food. I will say two things.. it tends to be crowded, and the music was loud - if you're going to read or do work, I'd recommend finding a quieter place. That being said, the food was great (large portions, decent prices) and coffee was amazing. Apparently it's unlimited, but the cups are so large that you probably won't need a refill! Highly recommend giving it a try!
