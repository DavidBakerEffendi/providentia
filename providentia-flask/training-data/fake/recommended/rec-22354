A pretty unusual spot for New Haven -- very upscale mixed drinks. In my experience, the drinks are all great and compete with any martini bar you would find elsewhere. The bartenders are really talented. The small plates are great too. I find the decor a bit over the top but have been told that I'm too picky about these things.
