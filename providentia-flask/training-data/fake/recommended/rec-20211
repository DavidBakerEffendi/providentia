Petite Crevette is that excellent, hole-in-the-wall kind of joint that everybody wishes was in their neighborhood. The owner is a French expat who must have sold his "sole" to Poseidon to learn how to cook fish the way he does. They start you out with flaky bread and a garlicy-oil that is more addictive than heroin.The thai cod curry is a must try, as is the whole red snapper. Despite my insane ravings about the seafood here, my mother, perhaps in an effort to spite me, ordered a hamburger, but even the burger was an A+. It's also BYOB and there's a wine shop around the corner. I'd recommend bringing your own though, as it's fairly slim pickings in the wine shop -- unless you have a palate for $9 bottles of prison wine.
