Showed up for an early (6pm) dinner on a Saturday night on Labor Day weekend. Place was practically empty and we were glad to get choice seats outside on such a nice afternoon. Great menu, not too big, but not too small. Definitely enough variety for anyone, price-wise and food-wise. Lots of really great tapas to choose from ($9-18) and entrees ($16-28). Hooray for fresh olive bread, olive oil with spices, picked red and green peppers, and olives as a free starter!! I so appreciate this versus crappy plain bread and butter. I got the lamb burger. Spicy, well-seasoned patty on a freshly toasted sesame seed baguette. Fries were as decent as can be. Waitress came by with fresh-cracked pepper over everything I wanted. Waitress and other waitstaff were tremendous. It was a suuuper humid day, and not for a minute were we in want for water! Every minute someone was poking their head out the door checking on the customers outside. Good for small groups, I really commend the service for a great job. Absolutely wonderful and I would love to go back here to try everything else.
