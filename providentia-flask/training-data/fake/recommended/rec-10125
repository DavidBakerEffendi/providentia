I had eaten here many years ago when it first opened and was thinking about going back to check it out again.  Happened to be in the area with time to kill before meeting up with a friend so thought I'd pop in and have a quick drink.  Most of the bar seats were filled but I found an empty one all the way towards the back.  Sitting there, waiting for quite a while for someone to take my drink order, I realized that it's actually quite an unfortunate space.  The décor and vibe of the bar and lounge is just plain awful, bordering on tacky.  Basically you are staring at a blasé looking shelf of alcohol behind which was a wall with sheets covering it.  Even the dining room left much to be desired. As I sat there enjoying my sangria, there was a lot of security people bungling around towards the rear doors and they kept slamming their cappuccinos and dessert plates on the stone bar basically in front of me. Seemed like managers were among the mix as well.   Unapologetic and immensely rude.  I left and went elsewhere.  Situations like that make me never want to go back.
