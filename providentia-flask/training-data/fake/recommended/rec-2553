I've got a thing for lounge-like restaurants. I'd rather eat instead of dance and when I hear Thai - well, here's my credit card. Room Service is one sexy spot, with a sultry vibe, a well-stocked bar, one creative drink menu, and lovely tunes. But you're here to eat, and the kitchen doesn't waste time getting food out. Share their curry puffs and signature pad thai, wrapped in an egg blanket. Their blackened fish is quite savory, downy soft. Their pad-noh-mai could be spicier but is worth sampling; most days I'll take taste over mind-numbingly wicked. Don't forget to indulge in a cocktail. Considering their small footprint and popularity, service remained on-point; we were never rushed during dinner.
