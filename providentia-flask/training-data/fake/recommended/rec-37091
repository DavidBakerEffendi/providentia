Me and hubby almost walked right passed this place since its practically tucked and quiet from the outside (or cuz from all the snow that was blowing in our face).  Place is cozy.  Sooo many tapas to choose from that looked delicious.  Obviously we couldn't order everything but we loved the wrapped dates, empanadas, short rib and lamb meatballs.  After a couple of cocktails and bottle of wine we couldn't keep track of what we ordered but enjoyed each dish that kept coming to our table.  I do remember, however, we thought that the braised octopus was good but its dressing was just alright.  Fun place to be. Gets loud.
