Hobby's is a beacon of food glory in an otherwise barren city. Great corned beef and amazing matzo ball soup. Chicken Parm with pasta is great if you are in the mood for something filling, or bringing leftovers home. Prices are reasonable and the staff is very friendly. The cookies are great as dessert! Â One of the best restaurants still around in Newark.
