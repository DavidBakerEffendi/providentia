Took my fiancé there for her birthday.  We couldn't decide what to have for an appetizer as I was really hoping they had the mussels on the menu.  They didn't so we had to find something else.  So we decided to go with the pizza.  What a great choice!  It was amazingly good...It was time to order the entrées and I ordered the duck and she ordered the halibut.  My only issue was that we didn't even finish the pizza before the entrées came out.    My duck was great!  It was a small portion but after the pizza I wasn't starving so it was just right. If I didn't have the pizza I would have been hungry.  I tasted the halibut and it was just as good.  Then dessert...I love carrot cake so we needed to try it.  Upon the delivery of the carrot cake the waitress brought out a lemon tart with a candle in it....I never asked for a candle and to me that is great service by the waitress as she anticipated the guests needs and made something special happen....wait back to the carrot cake - OMG - best carrot cake I have ever eaten....I didn't think the other dessert was good so I continued to down the carrot cake.  I would just go back and sit at the bar with a cup of coffee and that carrot cake. Overall the experience was really good!   Our waitress deserves 5 stars she was patient in explaining the menu and by bringing out an extra dessert with a candle made the meal that much better!
