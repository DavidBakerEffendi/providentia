I've been here a few times for lunch. The price is very reasonable for what you are getting and kids are only $6.99. The sushi is good and fresh. The rolls were a little messy and loose but the flavor was good. We got all the items we ordered and did not feel rushed when we asked for seconds as some other reviewers did. The one waitress I've seen is not very friendly which makes dining here a bit uncomfortable, but worth it in my opinion.
