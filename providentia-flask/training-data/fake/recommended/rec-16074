At first glance, there's nothing striking about the facade of La Sirene. The building looks pretty plain and the interior is very cozy with about a dozen tables. But it's one of the best dining experiences you can have in NYC. The staff is French and delivers good service. Everyone in the restaurant seems to be happy, enjoying their parties' company and the amazing food that this place serves up. It's BYOB and most people appear to bring it (which probably also enhances the experience!). You're not rushed through you're meal and the environment is so warm and relaxing that you won't want to leave. For appetizers, the goat cheese tart is one of their signature dishes and is absolutely amazing, bursting with really great flavor. Also, if you like escargot, the dish is marinated perfectly with butter and garlic and the remaining "sauce" is great for dipping bread. For the main course, you can't go wrong with the filet mignon with foie gras. It's definitely not the healthiest thing in the world but the taste is amazing and the meat just melts in your mouth. You've got to try it to really understand how good it is! Also, the duck breast with the cherry-port sauce is a really great dish. The flavors combine so well and the meat is cooked perfectly with no bones to worry about. Duck is one of those things that can be really bad when screwed up, but this restaurant really knows how to prepare the duck! Finally, I don't think there are any bad choices for dessert. I really like the profiteroles though and it's a great dish for sharing because it's huge! And the rum cake is really good, too! Everyone I went with leave feeling completely full but happy. We even got a seal of approval from the former Paris resident who dined with us!
