A MUST HAVE when you're in NYC. There are people still waiting in line at 2AM. They even have a fake Halal truck with guys in yellow shirts. Very flavorful and comes in a cute round pie-like tray. The meat is flavorful and the sauces are very good and not too salty. Thinking about the yellow rice and meat make me miss NY!
