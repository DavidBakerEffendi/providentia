We came here expecting the Americana to be the diner we remembered from 10 years ago, when it may have had (for us, anyway) the title of 'best diner in NJ'. Instead we found a place that had lost its soul, and in some vain misguided attempt to either modernize or capture the latest foodie trend Â had changed its menu for the worse. Stay away if you are looking for diner food.
