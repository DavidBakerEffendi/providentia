This place seems to have varied reviews but I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here the other night. We came on a Wednesday night at 9PM and, perhaps because of this, were treated to excellent service. For starters we split the Spiced Duck Breast and the Homemade Cavatelli. The Cavatelli was creamy, soft, perfect for a winter's night. The Duck was awesome with super crispy, spiced skin, only rivaling a duck entree I enjoyed at Perilla once. For mains I ordered the Pork Shoulder and my friend had the Veal Cutlets. The pork was falling-apart fork-tender, but my favorite part was actually all the caramelized vegetables that came alongside it. I spent some quality time with the carrots. I also had a bite of the veal - it was bueno. The Old Bay fries that we got on the side were excellent as well. Potatoes sounded like a boring side to order, especially at a place that specializes in farm-to-table produce, but they were perfectly fried and seasoned and served with what I would describe as a cocktail-sauce-salsa thing. Overall the food was what I would call "stick-to-your-ribs" good. Freezing NYC night, warm and rustic interiors, hearty food and generous portions, 2 glasses of wine and I came waddling out of Market Table a happy camper.
