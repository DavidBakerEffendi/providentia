We were very excited to come here, after hearing so many good things about the pizza. After sitting down, the waiter/maitre de talked to all the tables at the same time, screaming the specials to everyone. Although the restaurant only has 10 tables, it took him over 10 minutes to fill out waters, and another 10 to even think about taking our orders- although he was standing around talking to other customers. After waiting for 45 minutes for our appetizers, the waiter asked if it was okay if the pizza came before the appetizers- we told him that was not okay. We waited about ten more minutes (he came by three times and told us our food would come in 4 minutes). We got a hot antipasto plate. It was just okay. The shrimp were breaded and a little soggy. The clams were just okay, and the eggplant rollatini was undercooked. Â The grilled octopus was fine but not worth the 45 minute wait. After the appetizers, we waited another 30 minutes for our sausage and pepper pizza - while all the other people around us had already finished their meals. The pizza was fine. Nothing special. We thought it was a little weird that they kept on steering us to their other location.
