One Friday night, my friend and I decided to stay in to watch movies.  Around 4AM, we were bored & hungry.  We both got excited over Halal and took a cab there to grab a late night/early morning snack.  One of the many perks of living in a city that never sleeps. Chicken & lamb over rice please!!!!! Beware of the red sauce because it is crazy spicy so don't pour it all over your dish!  I don't know what it is about this cart but the rice is made perfectly along with the chicken & lamb.   Oh, what its like to be young and not have to worry about eating heavy carbs so late.  Damn you youth, I miss you.
