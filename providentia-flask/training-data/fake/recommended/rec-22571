The service has always been fine and the sandwiches and prepared food has always been good. The BLT sandwich is one of the best BLT's I've ever had, that tomato jam is kind of amazing. However, I do think the prices could be a little cheaper, especially for the cookies and desserts. I find $1 for a cookie the size of an Oreo to be absolutely ridiculous. The cookie really wasn't any different from an Oreo either. Maybe if it was 3 for a $1 I'd feel a little less ripped off. Momofuku Milk Bar has better and bigger cookies that are probably just as organic and made from scratch that cost less.
