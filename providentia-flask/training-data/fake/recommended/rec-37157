Ok... so finally after years and years of hearing the hype about Junior's cheesecake, I finally tried it last night. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake. Here goes my review....I was beyond disappointed! The cheesecake is way too dense it felt as though I was eating peanut butter that's how heavy it felt. The flavor wasn't all that great either. Honestly I though the Cheesecake Factory has one of the best cheesecakes ever. The food from what I saw looked good but I didn't really have dinner. Above all the service was wonderful waiters are friendly and the atmosphere was really nice. I would go back there to have dinner but I don't know about going there to eat the cheesecake.
