I'm completely thrown off guard; I would have never imagined that another stateside ramen house would de-throne my all-time love for Ajisen Ramen in Fremont, CA. I can understand how ramen from Japan truly is out-of-this world, but this place most certainly comes close. I 100% believe that this place captures the character of a trendy Izakaya establishment like Chanto in Osaka, the conviviality (great service by Ky) of a corner restaurant in friendly Asakusa, the energy of an all-night club like Vanilla in Roppongi, and the appetite-annihilating offering of food that is without second-guessing, unrivaled. -Matt
