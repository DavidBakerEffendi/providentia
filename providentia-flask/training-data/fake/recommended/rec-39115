Hey this girl is all about authentic food, but sometimes you just have to look pass that and see the creativity done on a genre (in this case Thai). I think we should categorize it "New Wave Thai" :). I really like this place. It's all about the hip, trendy atmosphere. Absolutely the cocktails . Many down falls to a good Asian restaurant are the drinks! Â This you can do no wrong. Did I mention the pricing is reasonable for a place that looks very expensive? It gets pretty crowded here but well worth the visit.
