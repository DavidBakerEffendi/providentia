Although the food was really delicious, we were shocked with the exorbitant cost of the bill. Expect to pay DOUBLE whatever you're thinking, and tip will be included in the bill. Also service was spotty at best. The waitress we had was very sweet, but the kitchen sent out our main courses without the accompanying rice, which reached the table ten minutes after. Not good. Really good food but unfortunately, not worth a return trip.
