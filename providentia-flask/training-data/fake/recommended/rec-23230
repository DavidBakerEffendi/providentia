FANTASTIC!!!!! I never know what to expect when eating at an Italian restaurant, seeing as how I lived there for so long and have my own idea of what that cuisine should be. Osteria NAILED IT! Â We started with this appetizer of grilled clams and calimari with chiles and vinegar that was just sublime! the seafood was cut into smaller ribbons and grilled, and dressed to perfection! Extra points for being served in a large clam shell. My son went for the margherita pizza. it's a simple pizza, but easy to mess up since there's only a few ingredients. This was an awesome rendition of the classic, exactly what it should be and nothing else. Perfectly thin and very crispy crust, great sauce, perfect amount of mozzarella and basil. I went for the brain and corn ravioli "doppio", that were just insanely good. the filling was velvety and smooth, and the corn and brown butter they were tossed in gave the ravioli the right level of sweet and nutty taste it needed. We also had a great dessert with this cake, toffee sauce, rum cream and raisins that was also killer. Just a great all around meal with perfect service and killer food. can't WAIT to go back!
