decor is nice, though a bit small. My girlfriend and I arrived there on a friday night. We were told a half hour wait, so we walked next door to grab a drink. It took almost an hour to finally get our seats and though that normally wouldnt bother me, there was a group sitting down before us, who only drank water...no food, no booze drinks, nothing. The staff needs to learn how to get people moving... The food and drinks made me forget I was any type of angry. The cajun iced coffee was delicious and unique. ive never mixed booze, spice, and coffee, though to my surprise it was a good move. as for the food.... I believe I had a naked ball with parmesan cream, and a meatball smash. there was also a rissotto though I cant remember what kind it was. the menu is a grid of various meatball variables that you can select to your liking. It was overwhelming, due to the fact I wanted to try everything. Will return
