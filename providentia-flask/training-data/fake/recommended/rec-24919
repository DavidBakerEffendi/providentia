Best roast beef sandwich around, hands down. This is a classic South Philly establishment.  The roast beef sandwich is perfect and here are some tips about how to order from an old pro. They only have one kind of cheese, provolone.  Don't ask for anything else because you won't get it. A "Combo" is a sandwich with cheese.  So if you want roast beef with cheese just say "Beef Combo". You can order "side cuts" which means the darkened meat from the outside of the roast. If you like your sandwich with extra gravy, and who don't, make sure you order it "Overboard". BTW, if you leave without trying the "gravy fries" your doing yourself a great injustice. The gravy fries are crispy golden fries drizzled with gravy and tiny beef chunks.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!
