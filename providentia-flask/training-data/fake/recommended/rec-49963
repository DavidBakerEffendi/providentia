After taking the Staten Island Ferry across the way from Manhattan, a few friends and I (tourists) decided grab a drink on a Saturday morning "yes morning", so we walked up the hill to what looked like the Main Street. Steiny's seemed like they were just opening (I could be wrong). Anyway, there were a few people already there, seemed like everybody already new each other. So five us took a seat at the bar and ordered our beers, the bartender was Michelle, she was nice and kept us entertained the hour we were there. I ended up doing three tequila shots and drinking a couple of beers, so I was in good shape before the clock hit noon:) We ordered a couple of plates of chicken wings to get some food in our system. Steiny's does not have a fryer, and these chicken wings were awesome!!! So order away!! So I give Steiny's Â 5 big stars for Michelle!! Go check out this nice bar with a great bartender!!!
