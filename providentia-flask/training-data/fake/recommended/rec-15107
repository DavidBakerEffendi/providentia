Im from out of town and after Eagles games we always have gone to Pats and Genos. This trip we decided to try Sonnys based on Adam Richman's column rating this the #1 cheesesteak in Philadelphia. After we got our food we took it back to our hotel to eat it. I took one bite out of my cheesesteak and not a single more. It just tasted awful compared to the cheesesteak at Pats. Its just not good. I dont know what kind of grass Man vs. Food was smoking when he rated this place the best in Philly.
