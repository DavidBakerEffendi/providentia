Would like to start off by saying I was surprised that this place had a C rating on the window, and hope they take care of whatever it was that caused the grade because its contradictory to my experience. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, and the decor was quite beautiful and contemporary. Crispy duck salad: A Cocunut Calamari Tempura: A Pineapple Fried Rice w/ Shrimp: A Massaman Curry w/ shrimp: From the looks of it, my friend really enjoyed this dish too, i thoroughly regret not trying it because I was so full. Delicious classic thai menu; would come back.
