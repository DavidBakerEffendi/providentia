I was spit ballin ideas for success and i thought of a resturant that served quick paleo food that didnt taste awful, these folks beat me to it. My biggest complaint is the price can add up real quick. Base price on all the menu items is very reasonable, borderline cheap for organic food on 5th avenue. But start adding a drinks and a side, it adds up quick.
