Six o'clock on a Friday night and the place is packed, reservations a must. We had them and were seated right away. Lively atmosphere Maitre de and waitstaff make everyone feel welcome. The menu had enough choices without being overwhelming and portions were generous while still allowing a table of four to share a Tartufo for dessert.
