Unfortunately I waited far too long to write this review, so I don't remember everything I ate. However, I do remember it was one of the best meals I have had on any of my visits to NYC for numerous reasons, not excluding my 4 delicious cocktails. Why didn't anyone ever tell me the wonder that is pork belly? I could've been eating it for years! I feel like a person who has missed out on their childhood or something - a childhood filled with seared pork belly. I remember thinking that one of their signature dishes, the duck meatballs, couldn't hold a candle to my little serving of heaven. The food was very solid, the waiters were prompt and attentive, and the atmosphere was exactly what I like - kinda cozy and fairly loud. If I lived in the area (and you know, had a couple million just lying around), I would definitely go here frequently and try everything on the menu.
