This place was a great find for dinner on our way out for drinks in the Village!  We came on a Thursday night, no reservation.  It was dead at 6 pm and lively at 7 pm, we got one of the last tables before the place filled up.  My fiancé and I shared the following: hummus with pita and falafel, merguez sausage with hummus and chopped salad, baked meatballs with onion and yogurt and mint, calamari with beans and pesto, and fried artichoke with manchego. We really enjoyed our meal, from the dimly lit and intimate vibe to our last bite.  Some bits were better than others though.  Loved the fried artichoke!  The cheese goes so well with it.  The "fried" taste of the artichoke is fabulous and addicting.  The hummus was very good, but pointless because the sausage came with hummus.  The server said the sausage came with "a little hummus" and encouraged us to still get the hummus plate, which we regretted.  We had more than enough on the sausage plate.  Still, I liked the crisp falafel very much.  The calamari was great, full of chewy texture and light fresh flavor.  Loved the white beans with it.  The sausage was very good, and nice to have the chopped salad alongside.  The meatballs were my least favorite - they tasted nice themselves but I wasn't mad keen on the sauce. We were stuffed and couldn't finish everything!  I think start with 2 dishes per person and go from there, you may well be full.  Definitely order with confidence here, food was very reliable across the board and there are some really inspired small plates.  A great example of how you can find unexpected gems walking around in New York!
