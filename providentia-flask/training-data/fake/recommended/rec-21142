I was pretty shocked at how much I liked this place. Unfortunately I did not get the burger like the other 100s of yelpers on this restaurant. I decided to go with the creamy chicken pasta and it was reaaaaaaaal good. Surprisingly filling with a good portion of chicken. This place is very very small (one cook with one pan making all the food), which is actually kinda cool because you can tell hey really put effort into every dish they create. I will defiantly be back for another lunch to try the burger!
