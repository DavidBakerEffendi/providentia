This was an interesting place with very cool decor and very busy. For an app, we had the chicken satay in peanut sauce which was excellent. We also had the coconut crusted calamari with chili sauce which was excellent as well. I had the spicy basil fried rice with chicken. I have to ask, where was the chicken? Very skimpy in that area but it did taste great overall. The service was very efficient but "cold". At no point did anyone ask how out apps or meal were. The servos was actually too fast. Things came out very quickly, likely in an effort to turn tables fast. The good was a 4 but overall I have a 3 because of the type of service provided.
