One of my favorite restaurants in the city!  We came here a few times for dinner, always amazing. The menu is always fresh with new items. Had brunch here this morning. 5 stars! I got the stuffed French toast, had spiced apples and Brie with a maple pecan butter. Amazing.  We usually go to honeys for brunch, but I can see Bridget Foys being close second favorite brunch. Great prices, and the staff is always friendly.
