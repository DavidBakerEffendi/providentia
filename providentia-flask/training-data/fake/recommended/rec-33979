Romantic, but not in a cheesy way.  The food here catered perfectly to both sexes.  Dainty and tasty for her, hearty and satisfying for me. She had the beet and goat cheese ravioli, "Knicker Twist" apricot cocktail, and Vermont maple creme brulee for dessert. I had the Scotch egg, meatloaf sandwich, squash cheesecake w/ pecans, and washed it down with a $6 shot-and-a-beer special. Guys, if you want to sweep her off her feet, but still get options like pork belly sandwiches and whiskey specials... take her here.  Did I mention the 100-year-old oak bar?
