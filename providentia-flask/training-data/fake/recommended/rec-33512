My new Pub because it's what a Pub should be. Plenty of beer selections, simple but tasty bar fare and a chill crowd (usually). It's dark, it's all wood and the bartenders are delightful. They are happy to give you samples of the beers so that one may expand their beer drinking horizons. There is a back room should you need more space or not want to stay in the bar area which can get a bit loud at times. I also like where it's located. Convenient & cool, yet not a scene. There are enough places around it that attract amateurs. So you know you can sit, have some great beer and actually hear the conversation in which you wish to be involved. Brilliant!!! Go, it will warm you up in every way :-)
