This is the best of the "traditional style" pizzas available. It's thin, it's tasty, and it's got real mozzarella on it. It is only sold by the pie, so go there with an appetiet. Tip: If you want to skip the wait on a long line, give Grimaldi's a call and order a pie to go and eat it on the dock down the street, while enjoying the best view of Manhattan. There is seating and prime people watching. You can also end your meal with an ice cream cone from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory (yelp.com/biz/wMoIGPBqCiPâ€¦).
