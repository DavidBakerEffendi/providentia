Beautiful setting, excellent services and wonderful food! We went in as a group 4, ordered hommus, tabbloueh, mixed kebab, grilled shrimp salad, ribeye and a few side dishes, it was just absolutely delicious! I also love their pita bread, which was warm, puffy and fresh. I wouldn't say it's a cheap place, but for the ambiance and setting, it's not very expensive either. I would totally go back again.
