Huge menu and great Philly cheesteak.  Choice of several cheeses including Whiz, provolone (the best IMO), american, and pepper jack.  Small place but great portions, good price, and super crew.  Want something else...plenty of hoagies, pizza (by the slice and whole pie).  Plus...hot peppers and bread pickles at the condiment bar.  Good eats.
