Amy Ruth's deserves 5 stars. The food is great, and the staff is nice. I'm from CA, and have a special place in my heart for Chicken and Waffles (Roscoe's, Merritt Restaurant and Bakery). In my opinion, the Chicken and Waffles are great and you'll enjoy them - the burgers and the fish are also tasty. Yes, it get's crowded and you might want to plan for a wait during weekends when the restaurant is filled with anybody and everybody: families, pre and post churchgoers, tourists, locals, friends,. couples on dates, graduation parties...you name it What sets Amy Ruth's apart for me is how they treat customers -- during one visit, Amy Ruth's waitstaff accommodated for a member of our lunch group who has a motorized scooter. In NYC accessibility seems paltry in comparison to CA (where ramps and elevators are more of a norm for most buildings) so I'm glad to know there is a restaurant that is A) accessible and B) whose waitstaff takes care in making sure ALL customers are taken care of.
