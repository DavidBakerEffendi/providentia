Disappointing food. Three of us shared about 8 mezes, and of those 3 were really tasty, several weren't worth finishing, and all seemed to have been sitting around for awhile (including the hot ones). The beans were canned, no doubt. Service was friendly, the decor was strangely tacky/old-fashioned, and prices were okay but not great. I would not return.
