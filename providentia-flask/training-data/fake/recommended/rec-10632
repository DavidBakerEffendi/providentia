My friend Elvis works nearby and stops in often. He has raved to me about this place for a long time. We happened to be in the area and stopped in with a group of 15. Well his rave reviews were right. The food was fantastic. The selection was great. The staff is hard working who really appreciates you being there.The prices are way too low,but I guess they make their money in volume. I live 45 minutes from this place,I will take the ride again to eat this great tasting food. Continued success you guys deserve it !!!!!
