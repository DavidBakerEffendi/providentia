They over charge for beer, period, enough said.  I looked at 3 prices tonight, 2 of which left me a bit taken aback.  First up was a 22 ounce bottle of Switchback; here it was $4.29, everywhere else its $3.99.  Now a 30 cents difference i can handle with a grain of salt, but as I moved across the fridge and noticed the lonely 4 pack of heady topper enticing me with its hoppy goodness, my hand instinctively opened the door and grabbed it as its almost impossible to find  this wildly popular brew in stock more than 4 hours after it's bi-weekly distribution. I didn't even look at the price, i'd pay anything i thought to myself...it was mine and it knew it.  Then the clerk rang me up for $18 tax included...for those not familiar with the 11% VT alcohol tax, that means the 4 pack cost me $16.20!  What's up with that?  I just bought the same 4 pack down the street at the South Burlington Co-op for $12.99.  That's a 25% mark up folks.  Don't Bother coming here for beer.   P.S. The 3rd price i looked at was the liquor which seemed reasonable.
