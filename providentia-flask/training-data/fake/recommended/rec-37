Fitler Dining Room doesn't miss a beat. My partner and I had an absolutely delicious meal here. The wine recommendations were knowledgable and friendly, the design and preparation of the dishes were impeccable. There were no bad---or even underwhelming---bites. Portions were nicely sized. Fantastic food with a good wine list at a reasonable price---in an overpriced neighborhood. From our visit, the super memorable items were: blood cake with scallops, gnocchi, duck, and the dessert wines. The staff were beyond generous with their friendliness and sweetness, recognizing that we were out to celebrate and treating us so so well. Mind you, without cloying sweetness, superciliousness, overbearingly instrusive check-ins, fulsome hosting, or fussily stilted formality. If you want a memorable night out---for the food, for the ambiance, to fall quietly into the company of your table---go here.
