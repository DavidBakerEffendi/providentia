Never actually wrote a review before but there's a first time for everything.. I will say I ordered for delivery and perhaps that's not their strong point BUT let me say it's the worst food I've had in a long time. They completely oversell their food as gourmet health food with great ingredients.. It was less than average, even the coffee was undrinkable!! I don't mind paying extra for quality food, but is wasn't quality at all.  I ordered the HOT breakfast bowl which arrived COLD, tasteless and a watery mess.. (Did not fit the delicious description)  and I also ordered the Raw Goodness salad, which was dry, lifeless and no dressing. It all seems highly priced for average food..
