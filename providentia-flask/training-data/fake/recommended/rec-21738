Great outdoor space for beer, drinks and tasty food. You order your drinks at the bar, order food at a station that is later brought to you and sit at large wooden, park style tables to enjoy your mini feast. Simple, easy, yummy good time. I was in Philly for the day and stopped by. I would come back again.
