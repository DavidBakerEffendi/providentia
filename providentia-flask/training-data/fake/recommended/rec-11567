Came here with a group of 9 last night.  I've lived in the area for a couple of years and have been meaning to check it out for some time. Now I'm mad that I didn't come here sooner. We had am 8:30 reservation but  we weren't seated for about 15 minutes, which was fine since we were such a large group.  I had a drink at the bar while we waited which was lovely.  It was a vodka and pims in limonata with basil. The waiter brought over an amuse bouche of potato and nettle soup which I quite enjoyed. To start, I shared the quail with my boyfriend.  It had a nice char on it.  On the side was a fried quail egg over farro with cucumber and some sort of light basil tomato sauce. Yum! I also tasted a friends warm vegetable dish to start - that was amazingly tasty as well. I also ordered a glass of wine.  Not sure what it was as I wanted a Chardonnay and asked the sommelier and it was delicious. For entrees, I tried a little bit of everything at the table. I thought mine was the best. I had maccheroni in a pork ragu with ricotta and peas. It was the best pasta dish I've had in the city. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because our actual waiter wasn't the best. He seemed a bit disinterested in our table.
