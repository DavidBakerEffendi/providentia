My fiancee and I come here about two sometimes three times a week all for different reasons. The hospitality from the great manager Keith to the bartenders, servers, etc are great. They offer happy hour oysters from all over the coasts ranging from $1-$3.50 each. Every oyster option is great. BuT I can't forget the drink happy hour being just as reasonable. Whey have a seasonal menu with fresh greens and local meats. Our favorite special is the prime rib and fingering potatoes with a side of delicious brussels sprouts. The fish in chips, trout, burger, and Cuban are a few of our other favorites. Brunch is just as yummy- our favorite is steak and eggs and the French toast. The coffee is strong and french pressed as well which I can appreciate. Mayfield has brought so much character to our area and the chef, staff, and environment is perfect for larger groups, two people, or even yourself if you want to sit at the bar. My favorite place hands down!
