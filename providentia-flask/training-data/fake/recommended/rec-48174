I have been a big fan of Juniors in Colchester for a long time, love the authentic Italian dishes! We went to Juniors Rustico to try it out, and we're not disappointed! There are obviously differences between this restaurant and their others, but that's to be expected, right? Different name, different food! The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, the food is delicious, though it is more expensive than there other restaurants. However, the quality and attention to detail is high too! We will definitely be returning!
