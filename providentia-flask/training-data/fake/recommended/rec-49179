yikes, so many reviews!  here it is short and sweet:  There was a short line because i came at an off time (weekday and at 3 pm).  We waited in line 15 minutes for a table of 3 so I thought it was great!  *** If I had to wait longer than 15 minutes I would have been disappointed and really really hungry by the time we got our food ***
