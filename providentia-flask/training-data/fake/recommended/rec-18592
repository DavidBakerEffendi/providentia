Food was decent, but I don't understand how this place got a Michelin star. This place doesn't compare to any other Michelin starred restaurant I've been to. It's very reasonably priced though. Staff is kind, but lacks etiquette and wine knowledge. The wine selection was poor at best. I like how this place focuses on local produce, but there were execution errors; soggy pie crust, no stuffing in the ravioli, the cheese ball was uninspired and was garnished with what seemed like a random assortment of pickles and raw veggies which reminded me of a plate of leftovers your sweet grandmother would pull out her fridge. It was all good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe it was an off night. Would give 2.5 stars.
