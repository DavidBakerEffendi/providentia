After a nice 15 min walk in the rain, eating and drinking all night...we all end up here. We got lucky, no wait, immediate sitting upstairs. And away we go.....Pigs Ear, Pate, Pork Belly, Burgers, Bone Marrow on toast, Chicken Liver, Deviled eggs...2 of everything! some 3...they serve a pumpkin ale on tap that i think everyone on earth should try! This place is on my list of places to go back to each and every time....
