So i had to go and get the roast pork with provolone and broccoli rabe after seeing it on TV.  Overall not up to the ridiculous expectation.  Far from the beat sandwich in the US.  The bread, meat, cheese combo was GREAT.... the broccoli rabe brings nothing to the table for me.  Maybe its the fact that it was almost all stems so all i got was bitter crunch from them.  Might as well have thrown brussel sprouts on there.  The greens don't play well with others.  Should have opted for the hot peppers instead. The wife had the meatball which was a 4/5.
