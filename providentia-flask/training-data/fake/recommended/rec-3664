I'm not particularly enamored of these hybrid cuisine restaurants.  I have found, though, that this specific pairing generally yields better Korean food than Japanese.  The rule holds at Ichiban, where I cannot say too much good about the Japanese stuff.  Korean dishes are surprisingly good for Hartford's West End, though, and one suspects that the owners are reticent to make a go with a full Korean restaurant.  I think, however, that Hartford at this point could sustain a mono-cuisine Korean restaurant. There are other places I'd sooner visit in Hartford, but if you're on or near Farmington, kimchee geegae, or most seafood soups (monkfish, cod head, etc) will fit the bill.  Four stars (or maybe 3.5) if they cleaved off the unmemorable Japanese arm.
