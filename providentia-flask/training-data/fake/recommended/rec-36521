A uniquely delicious food cart experience in NYC, a city with more food carts than bodegas and starbucks combined. The chicken doesn't have too much flavor in of itself, but you won't feel like you're eating week old chicken smothered in grease, unlike your typical halal cart food. Go with the combo platter (lamb and chicken), which comes with rice, pita bread, and lettuce. Drip a little hot sauce on top, add on a generous portion of the white sauce, and bam. Your taste buds will thank you. High bang for buck factor. Also, no need to wait in the long line for the original stand. They have three carts at the same block that cook up the exact same food. I suggest going to cart #2 on the south east corner of the intersection.
