Great place, has a good balance of Belgian (mussels and fries), pub (burgers and sandwiches) and their own (stews, fish, salads). In addition to that, or first and foremost, lots of bottled and draft beer. If you like seafood - go for the fish stew, but forgo the mussel soup (it is the base for the stew).
