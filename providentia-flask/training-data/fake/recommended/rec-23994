Not much to look at from the outside...or inside for that matter...but the food was good, and the front counter person was pleasant.  Had the #2 chicken curry...chicken was nice and crispy and plentiful (ordered the single...more than enough for one).  The curry had good flavor, and just a very little kick. All in all a good, quality place that I'd recommend.
