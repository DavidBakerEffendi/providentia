You let me down, fellow yelpers. I decided to take some guests here that were visiting from Virginia and wish I had made another selection. The decor was great- the chandelier in a box very sparkly, as promised. The music was a little loud and clubby, but that wasn't entirely unexpected. The prices were not to be believed, but the food reflected those cheap prices. We started with the corn spring roll, which was OK. We also had an avocado summer roll, but it was doused with a sweet, heavy, unpalatable sauce that made it impossible to taste the avocado. For dinner, I had the spicy thai tuna salad. The tuna was definitely a little off, not to mention served on a bed of iceberg lettuce that looked as if it had come out of a bag. There was no chili lime juice dressing to be perceived. I sent it back and got the green beans with almonds sauteed in butter with a side of brown rice. The green beans had clearly been frozen, and it was really salty, but I was so hungry at that point that I ate it anyway. My dining companions felt OK but not overwhelmed by their pad thai and thai fried rice. On a better note, my thai iced tea was delicious. Definitely won't be returning to Room Service just for that, though!
