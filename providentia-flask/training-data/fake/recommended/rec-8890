I like the idea of this place but it just wasn't hitting enough for my taste. First off, my wall came out kind of cold and with no butter! Blasphemy! Had to send it back for a slightly warmer waffle and they brought cold, hard butter. I feel like a red velvet waffle should be more decadent. It' was just meh for me. Chicken was okay. I think the space is cute, though. I think chicken n waffles I've had elsewhere have just Â spoiled me.
