I went to Graffiti last night and was pretty impressed. The restaurant is small and cluttered, but with a definite edge. The communal tables might be kind of awkward for a date but are perfect for a drink with friends. The food was very good but beware of Kate Moss-appropriate portions. The ginger scallop dish was the equivalent to one scallop finely chopped into about 13 razor thin pieces and spread out on the dish. It looked pretty, but I left wanting a Big Mac. The wine selection is impressive, and at $25 a bottle you can't really go wrong. Our waiter was also entertaining, giving me a book about graffiti to read while I waited for my friend and then giving long, flowery descriptions of each dish which reminded me of the spiels they give on Top Chef. Graffiti was a fun, quirky restaurant that could be no where else except the East Village. I'll definitely return, but will probably have a PB&J before hand.
