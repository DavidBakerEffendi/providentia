I know the secret to fast service on the weekend...... The trick is to come as a 2 person group. The place is loaded with 2 -person tables but the minute you want a table that seats 3 and up you have to be competing with a lot of other groups for seating. Also you can call ahead within a half hour of showing up and they put your name on the list. This got a family ahead of us even though we had be If I take someone here they always enjoy it. Great if you have vegan friends. For me though, often I get the stuffed french toast. I mean how often are you going to eat that? I took one star off for the hour long wait we had yesterday (Sun- which is probably their busiest day of the week understandably but still....an hour standing around hungry is difficult!). Plus I am not convinced they always call in the right order. Nonetheless great food always!
