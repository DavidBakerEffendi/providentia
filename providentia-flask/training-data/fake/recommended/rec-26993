I had high hopes for this place, and although it was charming, my food was pretty bad. I got the mussels, and not only was it a pretty measly portion for $25, the beer broth was incredibly, unpleasantly bitter. I know it might be partly my fault for ordering mussels in an ale broth, but I really can't imagine anyone enjoying a broth that flavorless and bitter. Also, putting French fries on top of mussels is stupid. Much of the food also arrived cold. We got an onion ring appetizer and, while delicious, it was cold. My mussels were cold. My girlfriend and her mother did enjoy their food, however!
