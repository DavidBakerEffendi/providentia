The hubby and I visited the Clinton St. Baking Co' on a recent trip to NYC from the Bay Area.  I have the Clinton St. cookbook, and also watched their "throwdown with Bobby Flay" on the Food Network Channel.   They claim to have the best pancakes in NYC, but if that's true then I feel sorry for New Yorkers, because Clinton St.'s pancakes are just ok.  I already knew this would be the case, because I wasn't impressed with them when I made them myself from their cookbook recipe.  They don't use buttermilk (or a squeeze of lemon, or vinegar, or some kind of acid in the milk to give a slight tang) in their batter, so they lack a necessary depth of flavor that a pancake should have (in my opinion).  The texture, however, is good, i.e., fluffy/cake-y, which they accomplish by whipping egg whites and folding them into the batter.   I should qualify this review and say that living in the Bay Area I have access to some pretty damned good pancakes at numerous places.  I can also make a pretty good pancake at home.  So, perhaps my standards are a little high.  I don't know... I guess when a restaurant makes such a bold claim about having the best pancakes in NY, you kind of expect to be blown away when you get the opportunity to try it.  Such was not the case for me.     Anyway, the southern breakfast (cheese grits, eggs, brown sugar bacon, and fried green tomato) was pretty good, which is why I'm giving Clinton St. 3 stars.  If I lived in NY, I'd be game to go back and try other items on their menu since the orders I saw going out to other tables looked pretty delicious.  For now, I'll just have to work my way through their cookbook and hope that their recipes turn out some good eats, since the pancakes definitely lack pizazz (and no, the two sticks of butter to one cup of maple syrup doesn't help).
