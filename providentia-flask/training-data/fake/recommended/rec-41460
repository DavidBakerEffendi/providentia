Excellent Italian restaurant in Times Square, which is an alternative to Carmine's. This restaurant does the "family style" servings, which can feed 2 - 4 people for each dish. Very good pasta dishes. Excellent wine selection. Great service, with very friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. We also like that the participate in the Rewards Dining program. If you want to eat here, I strongly suggest making a reservation, because they get really busy and you might be waiting a while for a table if you just do a walk-in.
