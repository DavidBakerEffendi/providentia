Excited to try this place but was a little disappointed. Servers were friendly but seemed short staffed, we waited 15 minutes before someone took our drink order, the waitress was also hosting. I don't think they had any bus boys working. Bread didn't come out until our apps came out, 25 min after sitting. Wings and Cajun Tuna sushi.  Wings were ok but seemed to need a little more sauce. Fried tuna sushi was something different and was pretty good. Unfortunately my wife wanted the baby back ribs but they didn't have. Entrees were Steak Louie which was really good.  Blue cheese crumble on the side was nice. Byron's seared tuna was cooked perfectly but maybe needed some seasoning, rice was plain on the side.  Salad was a nice addition on the plate. I would give them another shot because there were a few things I would like to try.
