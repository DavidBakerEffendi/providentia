I walk by this almost every day and finally made it in for a meal last night.  The burger was very good, and I appreciate that it comes with salad instead of fries.  The place is tiny, and had it not been a quiet Sunday evening, we'd have found ourselves seated with another few people at our table.  I love that sort of atmosphere and plan to visit when it's more crowded sometime. Waitstaff was excellent (the accent helps).
