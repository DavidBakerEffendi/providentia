I've been to Tria twice now, and both times I have been blown away by the professionalism and sophistication of the staff. Most recently, I went with a large group to celebrate a last minute birthday, and even though it appeared like it may be an hour wait or more, the hostess made magic happen within 25-30 minutes, and the show went on! The menu is fun, grouping wines and beers and cheeses by a feeling or attitude, such as "Bodacious Reds", and "Funky Bleus". The pairings of cheeses or meats and various jams or reductions are seriously amazing, and the servers explain each pairing as they present it to you. My favorite was a very crazy bleu type of cheese, with a lavender infused honey on the side. The salads on the menu are also quite tasty, and some of the larger items on menu. They have a few sandwiches I believe, but it's definitely most fun to come here for small plates. The happy hour specials and Center City Sips are a great way to get a feel for it without a huge investment....just be ready to wait for seating sometimes because it can get really busy! This is honestly one of the best wine bars I have ever been to....it combines upscale service with a casual enough vibe that I don't feel the need to dress up *too much*, and they really know how to roll with the punches and make some great decisions under pressure. From an operational standpoint, because I also work in service, I really feel and see this place is doing an incredible job.
