3.5 stars. Mac and cheese was amazing and tons of food. Got the combo platter and it was definitely enough food to last me 2.5 meals. My favorite was the dry rubbed ribs. Had heated up in a small oven at work and was the envy of everyone. Corn bread was meh - maybe it was dried up from reheating. The wings were tasty and very plump. Had tried friend's beef ribs - not a fan of beef ribs usually so not going to comment. Didn't really try any of the sauces on the table. brisket was tender. sweet potato fries were good too. The service was decent - didn't get offer a refill though for my soda, but I was fine. The owner's wife (?) came out to check on the patrons  - that was nice.  The restaurant also had a bar area with tvs, which look like it could be an awesome place to hang out to watch a game. We were seated by the windows and was relatively qiet so perfect for catching up.
