Excellent service.  Excellent food with good sized portions.  At our table we had tilapia in a butter lemon sauce, a steak cooked as requested (medium rare), a chicken and sausage dish in a reduction that was excellent.  We also had one person that had dietary restrictions that the restaurant gladly accommodated.
