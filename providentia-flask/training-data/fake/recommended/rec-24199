I have to give Fuel a mediocre rating because the service is SO TERRIBLE.  The food is usually prety good.  I love the healthy options, the calorie information and variety of vegetable infused dishes available.  The prices are great too.  I've been to Fuel Center City (and the Passyunk Ave location) many times and good service is the exception, not the rule.  We went last night (on a Saturday night), as the wait for many of the typical weekend dining spots were super crowded.  There were 2 other tables seated in Fuel and the waitress acted like we irritated her by showing up.  It took over 15 minutes for our orders to be taken and brought water.  We had to ask another server to open our wine and bring a cork screw (at least he was friendly!)  When he returned, all four wine glasses were noticeably dirty.  Dinner took forever to be served.  We asked for extra napkins, which she brought when we were finished eating.  Everytime I come here I am reminded this should be a takeout only place!  Plus, the pungent smell of cooked foods attaches itself to your clothes and hair.  I've NEVER had good service here. My last gripe is the juice bar options.  Most of the juices are NOT from freshly juiced fruits and vegetables.  They come from cans or bottles.  This is just not a real juice bar.  As much as I love the healthy options, and there are so little around the city, it's harder and harder for me to continue returning to Fuel.
