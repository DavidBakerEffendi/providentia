Upscale dining room and funky bar with a diverse crowd, great martinis, excellent lamb, fish and pasta dishes. If you eat in the bar, try the lamb burger with carmelized onions and tzaziki sauce, yum. Raw bar turns out gorgeous towers of shellfish and sushi, sit at the dessert bar and watch them make your sweet ending. Great decor, even in the ladies room. The only downside is the DJ/live music in the bar after 9 pm - WAAAY too loud.
