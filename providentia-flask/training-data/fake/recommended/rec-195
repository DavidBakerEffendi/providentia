Yummy!    My cousin from OZ texted me about melbourne cafes in NYC.        I visited Melbourne a couple of months ago;  I frequented a few cafes just for their flat whites... (melbourne has great coffee) I'm happy to say I can have my flat white here in NY.   I thought it was a little bit small compared to how they serve it in Melbourne - like an expresso shot (that's why it's 4 stars and not 5)   I don't mind paying more to have an actual coffee size...   I also ordered a chook sandwich which was very yummy.    The place itself has very limited seating but  it's very cute.   Next time I'll eat inside :) Edited 7/8/14:   I got a "latte" this time around -  it satisfied my serving size issue and had a chocolate chip cookie which was phenomenal.    So i changed it to 5 stars.
