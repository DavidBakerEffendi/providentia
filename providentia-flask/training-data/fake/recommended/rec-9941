I defy anyone to only eat half of this enormous roast pork sandwich, I went for the pulled pork with provolone and some hot peppers and I felt like a crack addict going on a bing, at first I thought, maybe just a taste then the thing thing I know I have jus dripping off my chin and I am face planted into the middle of the sandwich. I love the terminal, but do not ever go in hungry.
