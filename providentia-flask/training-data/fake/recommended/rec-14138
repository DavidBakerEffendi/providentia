Oh yes this was good food.  Oh yes.   I got the Pork and Rice Cakes meal, which came out and looked nothing like I expected.  More like a scramble than the tidy segments the meal's title would imply, this dish hit like a freight train of spices, meaty flavors, and oils. As accompaniment, I enjoyed an almost too-sweet unfiltered sake.  Looking like watery milk, it went down like sake with a dollop of sugar. While I prefer the exuberant wood usage in Momofuku Noodle Bar, which feels like a love letter to the material, the moody design befitted the more serious-feeling food.  On the down-side, our party of 4 had to squeeze onto a small table with another 6 people.  That's what happens when miniature East Village places take on large-scale Manhattan proportions. The food leans on the pricey side for moderate portions, which is the only thing holding me back from hurling 5 stars at this mother.
