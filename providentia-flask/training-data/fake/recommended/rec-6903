I almost never write reviews on Yelp, but I really want to make sure this place makes it and continues to put out such great, modern Mexican food!  My wife and I just got back from a long weekend in Mexico City, and this place brings us right back to the "haute mexican" food we had there. We were there today for brunch and had the scallop ceviche (fantastic - nice sea scallops, as opposed to the bay scallops you often see in scallop ceviches), the torta, which they make in a kind of "French Dip" style and which was FANTASTIC.  The broth it was soaked in was reallllly good.  And finally one of those handmade tortillas, fried, with slow roasted pork shoulder, a bit of guacamole, onion relish, cilantro, cabbage and radish.  It was tied together with a tomato-habanero broth which was just spicy enough. We just had coffee today, but they apparently got their liquor license recently so in addition to the fresh juices they now apparently have margaritas.  Oh and flambee mango with mezcal soaked cranberries and some sort of ice cream I believe was the dessert special - I wish we had room and that it wasn't 1pm. The few times we've been for dinner Chef Hugo hasn't disappointed either, but I'll leave that for a follow up review.
