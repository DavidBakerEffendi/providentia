I was here Thursday evening as part of the Palmer Square Girls Night Out- they were offering $1 Bellinis. They had one bartender for a very busy night, and two managers walking around who could have jumped in to help but chose not too. The bartender was not very efficient or friendly. I hadn't been there in a long time and now understand why. There are other places in Princeton to go to in which you can get much better bar service. It does have great ambience and our waitress was nice and the food was pretty good, so these facts saved me from giving it one star.
