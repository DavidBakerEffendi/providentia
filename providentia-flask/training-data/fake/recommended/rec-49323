Some luxury pubbing, perfectly meshing into the general college vibe of tweedy WEALTH. After my various visits to these New England college towns, I'm always a little alarmed at having The Dread Undergrad cackling maniacally at my next door table (seriously, as Laura Dern from Jurassic Park would say, they *do* move in herds!). But, despite the cackling, Murphy's was comfortable, the staff was gracious and attentive, and the food was very tasty, if not particularly memorable.
