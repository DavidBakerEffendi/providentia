Nothing is worse than looking at a wine list and not recognizing your "go-to" options.  No one wants to throw darts at a wine list or ask for a cliché semi-sweet wine.  Luckily, I found two of my favorites on the by the glass list: Dolcetto d'Alba and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.   I've been to their East Village location, but I was only grabbing a quick drink before eating at Hearth.  I was looking forward to trying their food and went with: - Veal and Ricotta Meatballs: they were your regular "run of the mill" meatballs.  They weren't bad, they just wouldn't be your first choice to reorder.   - Oxtail Risotto Balls: they seemed a bit overcooked, dry, and tasteless (we kept offering the last one to each other and no one ate it). - Chicken Liver Bruschetta: it was like the underdog that won the championship.  It was unexpectedly good and comes in a shot glass.  We left no evidence of the brown spreadable goodness in the shot glass.
