My friend once told me about this mythical cart across the street from Hilton in Midtown.  As my friends and I were walking around aimlessly at night, we stumbled upon a cart with a line about 100 times longer than just about all the other carts, I knew this had to be it.  All the reports are true, the white sauce is a godsend.  I'm not quite what they did to it, but it's considerably better than any other tzatziki sauce I've had.  Also, the hot sauce is pretty damn hot so be forewarned.  Everyone seems to rave about the chicken and rice, but I actually enjoyed the lamb more.  Well, really it doesn't matter, because the key is dousing whatever you have with white sauce...
