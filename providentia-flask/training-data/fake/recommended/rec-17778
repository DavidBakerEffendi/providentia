As a usual of the Yelp users, I ordered the Rodizio. Very pleased. The dish was topped off with a slice of pineapple to digest the last piece of savory and juicy meat. Big portions, so remember to take the to-go box! Those who have tasted the metallic taste, I wonder if it was from the knife that the Rodizio meat was cut with.  The salad bar not something I would waste my appetite on. The options were minimal and the entrees were already big portions so why need a fill on a salad bar.   The wait is 45+ minute waits w/o reservations. My plans were for a birthday gathering. You know those ones you just need a place to have them sing happy birthday and a slice of ice cream or cake. We had no reservations, so I kind of expected it. But the food definitely took the one less star up a notch. We'll see until next time, when I'm back for another Rodizio!
