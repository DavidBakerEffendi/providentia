Perfect place to duck into when the sky decides to open up and rain cats and dogs! The subtle storefront makes this place easy to miss unless you're looking for it. Great atmosphere whether you're in the front (seats right by the window looking out or a huge picnic table) or in the back of the house (both large and small bar top tables) or along the bar. Cozy without being crowded. It's the perfect place to park yourself with your computer, have a cup of coffee, and write your next to-be bestselling book. Great selection of coffee from Guatemala, Costa Rica and beyond, as well as beers on tap and by the bottle, and grilled cheese sandwiches (I will go back to try one of them because they looked SOOOO GOOD!). Even your standard cup of coffee never comes from a pot that's been sitting out for who knows how long. Each cup is hand brewed when ordered. The friendly staff knew just how to help me (they asked me if it was my first time there - must have had "newbie" written on my forehead...slightly embarrassing) and were more than happy to answer any questions I had about the menu. I will definitely be back!
