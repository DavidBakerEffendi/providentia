So many places have been opening up in the Financial District - I am always delighted when a new lunch spot pops up. I had the Fuego chicken sandwich.  As I bit through the layers of cheese, mayo, avocado, and focaccia bread (with chicken), I could feel days evaporating from the end of my life.  I do not put on weight easily, probably because I do not seek out opportunities to ingest all 2500 daily calories in one sandwich. Twice the chicken, one-third the cheese and mayo and you have yourself a sandwich. I've only eaten here once, and they definitely have healthier looking options like salads on the menu.  I will probably revise the review once I've tried a few more things.
