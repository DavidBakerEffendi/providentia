My house! that's right, you've come to the right place, the major turn off for this place is that it gets so crowded during lunch and dinner peak times it kind of sucks walking around in the narrow hallway like restaurant. I commend them for renovating their interior and now the space is alot better used then before. If I'm ever in need of a quick cheap meal (which is a lot) I go here. I usually get a chicken side which is like $3 and a kimchi fried rice which is like $2.50, $5.50 for a decent korean meal! If you go to Seoul Garden it's $11 for a fried rice over there! They also have the noodle bowl station in the back which is pretty good food that doesn't hurt your wallet, but it's cash only! I would DEF check this place out, this is one of my favorite places in Ktown to go, cuz I get the food to go... get it?
