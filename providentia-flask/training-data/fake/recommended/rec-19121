From the old-fashioned, white enamel doorknob to the baby-blue walls, ceramic-tile bar and mirrored backsplash, I am in love. During the lunch hour, they played wonderful music but not too loud, it was bustling but not overpacked, and my server was laissez-faire enough to let me just enjoy my meal and do my crossword. When she could see I was done eating and done with my paper, she came over and chatted for a while. I ordered the brie and Granny Smith sandwich, which was served warm on toasted organic seven-grain bread. I think there was an entire apple sliced up on that sandwich, the perfect balance of tangy sweetness with the brie, which tasted like butter. For real. I ate it open faced and cut up so I could finish the whole thing--the bread was so thick, there's no way I could have eaten it all otherwise. It also came with a yummy green salad in a roasted-garlic vinaigrette (topped with dried cranberries!) If I were a real foodie, I would have taken pictures, but I dug in as soon as it arrived. For dessert, I had a slice of homemade Red Velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Dear god, that cake was sex. It was just perfect, except that I wish I'd had a glass of milk to go with it. How refreshing to find a place in New York that slows the pace of life down, even if it's just over the lunch hour.
