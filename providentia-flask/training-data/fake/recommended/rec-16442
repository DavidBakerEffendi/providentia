The best thing about this resty is the decor, which sets it apart from your standard Thai restaurant. The interior is aesthetically pleasing (aside from the uncomfortable chairs) with cool lighting. But the food, while good, is nothing special/unique. I honestly can't even remember what I ate here but remember thinking it was alright. The service was also just okay.
