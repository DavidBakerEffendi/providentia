I love this place. I love that it is a little off the beaten path in Sunnyside - its always busy, but not overly so that you dont get seated right away. I love the staff. Friendly, warm, helpful, knowledgeable. I love that they do take out/pick up. I LOVE their food. My bf and I have different tastes, he eats beef, i only eat fish or veggie - and we always find something yummy to share for an appetizer and to eat for ourselves. I LOVE their Flan. I usually hate flan..but theirs... please, don't leave without trying it. :D
