I'm a bit surprised at all the poor reviews for this place - I went for the first time today for a late Sunday brunch and it was great. Cosy, a bit too loud but you get used to it and it comes with the territory, and inviting. Servers were all very friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately there was a bit of miscommunication with my order (I had asked about the French toast but eventually settled on another dish) and the wrong order was brought out. The waitress was really apologetic and polite and even brought us a few mimosas on the house. All in all, lovely experience and will definitely be back. The brunch prefix is a steal.
