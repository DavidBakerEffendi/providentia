I took a few clients here for an early dinner on a Monday.  We arrived around 5:45PM and had no trouble finding a table; however when we left at 7:15PM and it was packed along with a crowd waiting outside. The food and service were excellent.  We had the New York strip and the lamb shank, which my taste-buds are still thanking me for. Great place for a first date ... I'll definitely come back here.
