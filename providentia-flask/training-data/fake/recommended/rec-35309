Since my midtown-west Katsu Curry connection dried up, I went looking for a new place and found Katsu-Hama (a not horrible walk from work, but I was in a fix for curry!). Rice is great, chicken katsu is great -- curry is not. It tasted almost tomato-y, too sweet and too many onions. Don't know if I'll go back (unless I really, really need some curry) but I'll try to find somewhere else in the meantime. Especially for the price. Note: They do NOT deliver from either location.
