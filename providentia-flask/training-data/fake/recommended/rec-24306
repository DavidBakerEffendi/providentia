A small French eatery that doesn't have much seating space, but boy, is their rotisserie chicken heavenly. For slightly over $10, you can get a half chicken with two sides. I have tried the baked creamy cauliflower, the rotisserie potato and the ratatouille as sides - and they are all fantastic dishes. I would also highly recommend their carrot cake as dessert. They call it the "best carrot cake ever" on their menu board, which I think is a pretty apt if not 100% accurate description. Bottomline: I have been looking for a quick, inexpensive and delicious dinner take-out place in the neighborhood, and this is just what I needed. Bonus points: 1. The hostess is incredibly friendly and helpful. 2. You can now order from their website. Yay.
