Blessed assurance! Halal Guys is mine! Oh what a foretaste of glory divine! The gospel truth is here. Sometimes there is no line. There's little I can say that hasn't already been said about the guys. They're just great. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert. I'm not even kidding. Sometimes, I go a little too heavy on the red sauce. Take it from me, you want no part of that unless you have a quart of milk close at hand. In other words Halal Guys is church. And I am a forever worshipper.
