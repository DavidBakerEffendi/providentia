The directions for this place are super confusing to me and I felt very unwelcome for a hot minute, but it all ended up OK. As a tip, don't try to sit down at a table by yourself even if it seems like that's what you're supposed to do because you will get kicked out. We went up to the counter and ordered and should have just stayed put there; turns out the cashier was also the hostess/ bouncer. Once the table situation was taken care of, the rest of the brunch went off without a hitch. The food came out pretty quickly and 2/4 of our group really enjoyed our meals, but we all left satisfied at the least. This place is perfect for groups and out of town guests since everyone can pick up their own check at the counter before the meal (no buzz-killing, post-meal check calculation necessary) and there's something on the menu for any budget (prices ranged from around $8 - $14).
