If I lived in the area I would be there once a week. love this place.  The food is excellent. The fish is incredibly fresh and well prepared, whatever they order.  If you end up at this place, it's not on a whim, it's because you went there for a reason given its location. On my most recent trip we took 8 people and eight bottles of white wine, Bordeaux blanc, etc and gorged ourselves on seafood.  It's almost like having a catered dinner party when you have already purchased the alcohol.  The staff is expert and friendly.
