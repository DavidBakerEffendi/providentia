When I moved to West Hartford, I was ecstatic that there was a Thai restaurant called Lemongrass in the middle of the Center--until I ate there and was completely underwhelmed, never bothering to return. I wasn't surprised at all when it shut down, but I was eagerly hoping that something superior would open in its place. Now replaced by the just-opened "Blue Elephant Trail", the restaurant is a complete rebuild of the old space, with a menu very like (though not exactly aligned with) its sister location, "The Elephant Trail", in Avon. The decor is much improved, the staff went out of their way to welcome new patrons, and the food was every bit as excellent as their namesake--in fact, the Tom Yum seemed more well balanced than what I found at the Avon location, which was already my favorite in town. If you've been looking for a good place for Thai food in the West Hartford area, I think this is quickly going to become the go-to spot for it. In addition to the soup, I recommend the Som Tam (Papaya Salad), and the Kraprau (spelling?) chicken--minced, spicy, and delicious, and authentic to boot.
