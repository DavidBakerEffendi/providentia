When I take the first bite, I rarely go "MMMMM!" This rare moment occurred today at Mood Cafe. My friend and I were the only ones there so the owner took his time explaining the chaats and created two chaats that he thought we would enjoy. I had the beef chaat with hot sauce which I thought was better than my friend's crazy chicken chaat (chicken was cold too). It definitely has that spicy, crunchy, savory and sweet combination. I want to try the lassis when I go back. I would definitely bring my friends here!
