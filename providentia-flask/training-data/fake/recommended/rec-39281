Oh man. This is my first visit to Papa Frank's and let me tell you that I am very impressed. The feel of the place is really inviting and makes you feel like your part of a family. They have beer and wine so definitely get one. I got one of their pizzas and boy was it good. It was juicy and crispy, definitely great. Don't even check this place out, just go there.
