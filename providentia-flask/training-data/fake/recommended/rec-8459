I honestly do not understand what more you could possibly want out of a restaurant--the chronically dissatisfied yelpers continue to amaze me! I came here for dinner on a date. The food was absolutely delicious. (I had the black cod entree--perfectly cooked, so much flavor). The cocktails were great, the service was great, and the atmosphere was perfect (classy but casual, dark and quiet enough to talk). We were both totally impressed. I will definitely be back to try the brunch.
