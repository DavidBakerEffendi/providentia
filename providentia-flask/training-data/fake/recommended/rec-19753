Unfortunately  my niece was recently diagnosed with Celiac's Disease.  So when my entire family came into the city we felt it would be best to eat at a legit gluten-free restaurant.  I'll be honest, I'm kind of a food snob and was nervous we wouldn't find a decent place.   There didn't seem to be many legit options either. Lots of places say they can make gluten-free to order but they kind of don't know what they are talking about.   Upon researching different options I stumbled upon Bistango.  Though it's outside of midtown (Murray Hill, what?!) and we were seeing a show in the Theater District at 8pm, I decided the reviews were good enough to go off the grid and take my family on an adventure to Murray Hill.  ...and I'm SO glad I did! Anthony is the owner of the restaurant and couldn't be a nicer guy.  He was very helpful when I made the phone reservation, even told me the history on the hows and whys Bistango made the switch to gluten-free food options. The food is delicious.  Whether or not you need to eat gluten-free you will really love the food.  I had the skirt steak and think it was possibly the best skirt steak that I've ever had.   Creme Brulee for dessert.  Calamari   appetizer, tuna tar tar.... I have to say, I would totally go back.  Great service, great food.  If you're looking for a great gluten-free option (or even if you're not!!!) you won't be disappointed.
