Unlike most of the comments I liked the service but didn't like the food because it is everything but Greek. Having lived in Greece and had to learn that the things we ordered weren't original at all. We started with the selection of spreads: The tzatziki was extremely tasteless, and the eggplant spread I generally love tasted like nothing. The main dishes were nothing special either and far from Greek food. The menu lists the Greek names for the dishes but we had to use the English description because the waiter didn't speak a word of Greek. Also, the typical Greek coffee was missing. If you have a craving for Greek food you should avoid this place.
