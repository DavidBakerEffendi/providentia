I really don't understand how people could say that the pizza was GREAT or anything  close to being good??? This might have been the worst money I ever spend on food!!! Sorry, but if you say this place has great mussels and pizza then you really don't get out much!!! My mussels came out cold as if they weren't microwaved enough and Prego and Ragu have tomato sauce than this place!!!  The pie is your typical pre-made out of the box pizza, however, the garlic bread was good and the beer was cold.  I could have saved a tone of money and went to my regular spot "Applebees", and oh by the way, what bar doesn't run drink specials because they are so called cheap already???
