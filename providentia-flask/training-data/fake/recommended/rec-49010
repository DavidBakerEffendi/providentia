Been here twice and have had different experiences each time.  This place makes fresh, delicious food.  The problem is their lack of consistency.  I had the same thing twice and both were very different.  I love spicy food but they need to check their compass on fresh jalapeño.  They put WAY to much in everything and leave many seeds which ultimately takes away from the delicious food.  Spicy is good, painful heat is not.  In order to succeed they need to be more methodical in their prep work, tone down the heat across the board and focus on accenting the delicious food with heat not blowing it out of the water.  I hope this place gets better as otherwise it has the potential to be great.
