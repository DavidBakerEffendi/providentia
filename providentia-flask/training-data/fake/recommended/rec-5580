Not a bad choice for the neighborhood.  The tapas menu is pretty heavy on fried foods, which is why this is only a three star place in my book.  I'm sure that some of the entrees are more balanced, but they are also more expensive! The service isn't the best.  On more than one occasion, the bartender has just hung out at the other end of the bar, chatting with people.  Not cool, but also strangely par for the course for the Ironbound.
