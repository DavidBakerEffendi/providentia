EXCELLENT BURGERS I've been here twice and had the truffle burger and manly burger. Both were very, very good. The meat is delicious and the buns are amazing. They also have a nice selection of beers. The space is fairly large with ample seating and space. I've never had a problem with service. TIPS/ADVICE - Appetizer: Truffled fries - Burgers: Order the truffle burger and/or manly burger, although I'm sure all the other ones are good (the beef ones) too - Stay away from the Greenbird burger (turkey) - For drinks the Bruery mischief beer is great - If you decide to go here for dinner especially on a Friday or weekend, be prepared to wait a long time--seriously this can be annoying.
