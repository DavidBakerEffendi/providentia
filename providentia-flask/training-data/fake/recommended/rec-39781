walked into bxl east  on a recent rainy day.  my cousin spotted the symbol for delirium beer and in we went. the place was empty on a Monday evening which was cool . the bartender was nice and informative and recommended a dessert beer to go with my tart tatin which was amazing!  he recommended we visit during all you can eat mussels on Sundays and Mondays. i will be back very soon
