I came here one night with friends for dessert after a satisfying feast elsewhere.   Each of us ordered our own dessert.  I ordered the pumpkin chocolate cake as did a couple of my friends.  We all agreed on one thing...it was delicious but....WHERE IS THE PUMPKIN?  WE TASTE NO PUMPKIN.  Hence why I am giving this three stars.  It was such a disappointment and I was really looking forwards to it. However, I will return here again at some point to try out breakfast, lunch and dinner, and other desserts they have to offer.  They all look delicious...I just hope they don't disappoint like this cake did.  It was good, but...it was like any good, delicious chocolate cake I can get in other places.
