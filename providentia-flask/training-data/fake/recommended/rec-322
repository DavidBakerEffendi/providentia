Had to wait on line for about 15 minutes for a two-top on Monday just after 7pm, but the cheeseburger was a little piece of heaven. Decent fries. And just amazing that one can get a really good $6 burger and $3 beers in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan. (side note: real plates rather than disposable would be a nice touch, and probably cheaper for them in the long run, no)?
