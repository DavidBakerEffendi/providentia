The positives: A large 2 story restaurant, out door patio at the front entrance and a romantic, atmosphere,well decorated and 3 bars. The cons: Expensive tiny weak watered down margaritas $ 9.00 each. Beer is also expesive, $5.00 for domestic beer.   I had quesadilla appetizer which was one tiny $11.00 tortilla folded in half with a bit of stuffing with a saltless salsa.   My husband had the sea bass $26.00 which was small but  prepared well and tasty.  I can't recommed this restaurant since the value isn't there.  It's over priced fot the actual amount of food served and just now worth it.   I should add that the waitstaff  seemed attentive and friendly.
