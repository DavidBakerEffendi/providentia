Wonderful restaurant, and an overall lovely dining experience.  Gorgeous decor - romantic yet up-to-date french bistro vibe with some moroccan (?) light fixtures.  Excellent service; they were packed (Thurs. night @ 7:30-ish), so we sat at the bar.  Wonderful bartender, lovely wine.  We ordered the potato pierogies with lobster, which was fabulous; the red hot rapini - one of my faves & I was having a strange craving for just that.  Highly recommended.  And my husband ordered the porkchop, which had figs and dates mixed in with a romaine lettuce mixture; wish I knew more specifics on that, but I did indeed taste it and it was delicious.  We shared a cheese plate to finish, which was excellent.  The food came out surprisingly quickly for how packed the place was.  A little pricey for what we normally do for dinner, but we had just had a successful meeting with our accountant and were feeling celebratory!  Really lovely date spot.  Recommended!
