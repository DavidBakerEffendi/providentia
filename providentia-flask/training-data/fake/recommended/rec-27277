Edit: Don't come here when it's below 0 outside because it's freezing cold in this restaurant. All the patrons were wearing their jackets, including myself. I felt bad for my friend cause her feet felt frozen. I don't think they have a heating system and so they warm up the space with a little tiny space heater. It doesn't help that their only window also leaks cold air into the restaurant. No joke, I think it was 30F in the restaurant (9F outside). I never imagined I would be freezing my butt off while eating hotpot of all things. I'll still come back here because the food is heavenly but with the artic weather still plaguing NYC...not anytime soon. Make a reservation ahead of time or be prepared to wait 1-2 hours during peak hours. They don't seem to take down your name so you'll have to stick around for your table. If reservations are full for the day, there will be a shorter wait if you arrive early or late in the evening. That being said, the food is absolutely delicious. We had the snow crab croquettes, battered shrimp, tonsoku, and hakata tonton hotpot with ramen. If you come hungry, do order appetizers to fill your tummy or you'll be salivating as you watch your hotpot cook for 15 min (then another 15 for the rice/ramen). We left feeling full and satisfied. I heard that a lot of Japanese natives come here so the food must also be quite authentic. We left feeling full and happy, the perfect combo. After taking a few steps out of the doorway, a waiter came running after us. I thought we had forgotten something but he pulled out a dispenser from his back pocket and gave us pez. They are serious about their pez!
