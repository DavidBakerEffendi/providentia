We stopped by Ole last night because we had a Groupon for some tapas and sangria and we were not disappointed. Â The decor reminded me of your typical Spanish bar and the typical Spanish pop music playing made me feel as if I stepped out of the Ironbound and into Spain itself. The selection of tapas that we chose were each very tasty from the patatas braves with a new world twist to the selection of Spanish cheeses. The sangria was some of the best I had (rivaling my own)! Our bartender was extremely friendly and provided us with great service. We'll be sure to stop by Ole again.
