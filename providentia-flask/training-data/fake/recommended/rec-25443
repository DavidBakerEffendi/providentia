Our table ordered the Lockhart deal - each person gets a portion of each of the meats and sides, and it was friggin fantastic!  Loved the pork belly and the chicken, and the cornbread was great.  It also came with a dessert, and i ordered a root beer float.  I normally hate floats but gave it a shot as i wasn't in the mood for cake, and i did not regret it.  my friend also loved the Hell or High watermelon beer. my only complaint is the whole table has to order the Lockhart or they won't serve it, which was a minor nuisance because some at our table wanted to order their own meals.  but peer pressure got the better of them and they did not regret it.
