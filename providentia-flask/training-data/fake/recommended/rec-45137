I decided to patronize this establishment on a whim after purchasing a groupon coupon.  If I could I would have given this establishment  2.5 stars but couldn't so I rounded up. Very mediocre italian food.  I've been spoiled growing up in New Jersey and having the accessibility to an abundance of very good to excellent italian restaurants.  If I grew up in central Pennsylvania this restaurant would have gotten five stars.  I've had better and have had worse.  Place was packed so they must be doing something right...either that or most people bought the groupon.
