Just went last night to celebrate our anniversary & had a fantastic time.  The brussel sprouts were crisp & flavorful, the duck salami was delish, the wild boar soppresata a little less so but still quite good, and our main dishes--Veal Oscar "Sunday" and the Seared Wild Salmon were outstanding: the "Sunday" was insanely savory, the veal fork tender; the salmon was cooked perfectly, & the sriracha gave it a nice kick.  Servers were zealously attentive & helpful.  All in all, a great time!
