I now realize that this is a wonderful low-key DINNER spot.  Brunch...ehh not so much.  But dinner, YES. Especially when you don't want to spend too much money, and want comfort food in a laid-back friendly setting.  Penelope is an anomaly in Manhattan.  There's no hype, no lines, it's not trying to BE anything other than itself. When I eat here I feel more like I'm the local nice spot in a smaller town.  It's great.
