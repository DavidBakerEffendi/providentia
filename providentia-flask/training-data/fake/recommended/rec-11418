After drooling over their menu for months, I finally stopped in to try them for brunch. The atmosphere & crowd had me considering bumping them up to a 3rd star, but alas, it was not to be. The bloody mary was pretty good, but the food tasted assembled rather than prepared: bagged, canned, and jarred ingredients rather than fresh. They are mediocrity in gastropub's clothing and they certainly did not deliver value for the money charged. Much in the same way Chili's is not real mexican food, Kite and Key is not a gastropub.
