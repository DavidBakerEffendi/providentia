Oy oy oy... I really wanted to like this place. Came once for brunch and it was okay. Decided to come back for dinner a few weeks ago and it was awful. We got the pork nuggets thinking, hey, how can you go wrong with pork nuggets? My boyfriend selected a nice big plump one from the pile, popped it in his mouth, and then promptly spat out the frozen solid center. We told the server that it was frozen - he took the plate and went to get us another serving! We didn't want to see those things ever again and had to tell him to please don't bring another pile of frozen nuggets to us. Then we got our entrees. I got the hanger steak and he got the chicken. Or should I say that we both had SALT with sides of beef and chicken? That seems more accurate. I felt myself dehydrating with each bite and could barely make a dent from fear of passing out.
