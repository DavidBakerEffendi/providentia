BEST MARTINI in America!!  Hands down!  Wow!  I still think of this martini ALL of the time.   The French Martini was to die for!  It is vodka, Chambord, and pineapple juice.  The drink was so frothy!  They actually use FRESH juice and not Dole from a carton.  You have never had a great martini if you haven't been to Balthazar. I would go here for a drink anytime.  I hope I have time for a meal next time I am in the city!
