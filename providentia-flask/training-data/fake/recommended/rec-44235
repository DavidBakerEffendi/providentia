A hip place where people go to see and be seen. It can be very crowded on weekends, but you can usually find a place to sit at the nice bar, which looks very cool because it is lit from below so that it glows.  The food isn't necessarily fantastic (although if you like deviled eggs, they are amazing here!), but the extensive drink menu is really fun.  The mixed drinks always taste as good as they look.  The bartenders are very helpful and can recommend drinks based on your tastes. I should mention that it can be quite pricey, not a great place to look for a bargain!
