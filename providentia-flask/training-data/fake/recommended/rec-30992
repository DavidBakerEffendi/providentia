My experience here was bittersweet. In Riva has the most amazing Italian cuisine I've ever tasted, which makes me upset because of the miscommunication I encountered. I came here with my partner for Valentines Day dinner. We were excited because we had only heard rave reviews of this spot. We got here at 9pm and the parking lot was completely packed, so we had to look for parking elsewhere. The wait to get a table was about 5 minutes, which was great. We sat down and our waiter greeted us but we couldn't hear a single thing he said all night. The music was too loud and would drown him out entirely. He handed us the standard menu and the Valentines Day specials menu. I looked over the placard briefly and concluded that the 5-course meal would be our best option coming in at $45 per table. The food was absolutely amazing. Previous reviews cover this. The only issue was that the 5 course meal included about 8-9 dishes, and my boyfriend eats a LOT but we just had to get the last two dishes boxed. I had no idea it'd include so much food. Maybe if I could've heard the waiter... Finally, we're delighted with our meal and get the check. Uhhh... $120?! Since when!? Apparently, the 5 course meal was priced per person and not per table, although the printed out specials card said "$45pp per table." I don't know... Maybe I'm not experienced enough but I didn't realize the tiny "pp" meant per person. I was really let down. I tried to talk to the manager, but they said they couldn't bring the price down on our check for "that amount of food." BEWARE: this place is not college-student friendly!! Seriously expensive. We don't have any problems spending that much on a meal, as long as we know what we're getting into. If we knew we'd be spending $120 on Valentines Day dinner I would've went somewhere more upscale. Don't get me wrong, In Riva was really lovely. But I'm not thrilled with the idea of spending $120 on meat, cheese and pizza. :(
