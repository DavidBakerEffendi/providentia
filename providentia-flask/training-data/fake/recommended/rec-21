Lovely spot. Especially to eat outside. Food excellent. Very nice Salade Nicoise. Great service. Though waiter did take very long time to come with bill which was good and bad. NIce to linger outside but am sure we were taking up good real estate at the peak of lunch house on a nice day. Def a place to return to!
