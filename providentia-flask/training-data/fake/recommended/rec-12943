I'd like to state upfront that it is definitely not worth the wait. We went during a weekday and arrived around 11:50AM, and was told by the hostess (a very lovely girl) that the wait would be 1.5 hours! Usually, they like to pad themselves but really we did wait that long. Thank God for the app they have otherwise I would have bored myself with the wait since there isn't a lot to do nearby. I will admit that I ordered something I wouldn't have liked so I can't fault them for my poor choices in ordering. My friend ordered the eggs benedict with salmon and it was OK. It wasn't bad but I'd rather have my eggs benedict on an english muffin. My issue is with the texture. With the salmon and the eggs/sauce over the biscuit - it's just a mouth full of MUSH. Plus, I prefer my yolk a little more runny. The pancakes on the other hand, OMG, they were amazing and delicious!!! Stick to ordering that if you ever go. Overall, the food just doesn't justify the wait time. I won't be going again so I'll be stuck trying to perfect my own pancakes at home. At least now I know to mix my maple syrup with butter and warm that up.
