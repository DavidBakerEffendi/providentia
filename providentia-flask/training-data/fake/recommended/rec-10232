This is a 5-star review even though they forgot a candle in my sisters birthday tiramisu - which they comped our wine and desert because of We started off with the baby arugula and fennel salad with lemon dressing as well as the burrata salad, both were light and refreshing as well as fresh and delicious! For our entrees we had the parpadelle and sausage pasta which was one of the best pasta dishes we have ever had - homemade pasta cooked al dente in a light lemon sauce We also got 2 pizzas - the Parma as well as the Turin (margarita with wild mushrooms) both were great but we preferred the Turin since our particular Parma pizza was not made with a lot of cheese Above and beyond all though was our service. The ma√Ætre de Michael as well our justin were so nice and accommodating that we cannot wait to come back. This is a great place for any occasion and any night of the week. Great service, ambiance, and most of all, food! HIGHLY recommend.
