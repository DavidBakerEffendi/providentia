Came there with four friends to celebrate birthday. The drinks were great (if a tad overpriced) and the service was a bit slow. The food was okay for midtown but nothing to write home about. We had a couple appetizers and individual entrees and it came to about $90 a person so it is an investment. It was kinda cool vibe but nothing terribly memorable.
