I've been on a hiatus, but after eating @ Tia Pol, I felt compelled to review on YELP.  The tapas were succulent!  I'm not a big fan of lamb, mostly because to me it tastes like meat that has gone bad, but every once in a while, since I am always willing to give things another chance, I will order it. But the lamb skewers @ Tia Pol changed my view on lamb forever, that is how good it was.  Cooked to a tender perfection and marinated in a habanero/lime type sauce and served in french bread that has soaked up this delicious concoction of sauces, I almost couldn't believe that I was eating lamb. Tia Pol is seriously small, but the food is superb.  I think it is better as a date/one other friend type of place, vs. a group place not only because the plates are small, but also because of the mood lighting and the intimate ambiance. As with most over reviewed places in New York, I think it's best to go on a random night - Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Sunday - I find it extremely pleasurable to not have to fight with people for a table or feel rushed or be extremely hungry when I am having an epicurean experience.
