This was our 2nd visit to Azucar and both times the food was great. The Chicken Parm was some of the best I've ever tasted. My wife had the Chicken w/Carmelized onions. I'll get that next time. We had Flan for desert. Normally, Flan doesn't float my boat but the Flan they served was OMG! Nuff said. The restaurant combines both an upscale dinning experience with a homey touch (White linen, crystal water glasses and is family owned and operated). Â We stayed and danced Salsa until late in the evening.
