Folks -- It is just hype. There are much better Halal carts in the city. It's bland meat with rice and some sauce. And it cannot be any better because they are making it for the masses. It gained the fame somehow and now it is riding on that fame. All the folks who are raving about this probably don't know much about how this food should be. If you really want to try good halal food, try Raffiqi's cart. I have one near my work at Park and 23rd street. The meat is spiced, the rice is moist, the sauces are mixed in the right proportion
