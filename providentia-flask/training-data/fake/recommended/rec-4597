An intriguing combination of two worlds which may never have otherwise met.  Stop here for a memorable bloody mary, and a whole brunch feast while you're at it.  The burger and eggs benedict are among some of the meals I've gorged here in my day, each being a right start to a lazy Brooklyn Sunday before a jovial balter at the yard (RIP).  Don't forget the horchata, and ask for some more complimentary churro starters like you never got any in the first place.
