I treated my boyfriend to dinner here for his birthday since he enjoys bourbon...it was definitely the right place. We ordered the Belmont flight but they didn't have two of the three so according to the waitress, we got "upgrades."  No harm done, they were all good. As for food, we ordered the pork nuggets and butternut squash soup.  The nuggets were tasty, but a bit on the greasy side and somehow had no texture.  The soup was delicious but a pinch of salt would have been nice. The special was a Texas-style chili with a side of bacon-jalapeño cornbread that the waitress described as "edible."  Umm, sounds great..no thanks. We ordered the chopped pork sandwich (mostly just because it came with a signature sauce) and the sweet potato gnocchi with the intention to share. The pork sandwich was good, but it needs a little umph. It was tasty but nothing special.  It was my least favorite dish of the night.  The sweet potato gnocchi served on a bed of hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and swiss chard was out of this world amazing.  I had to pace myself because I could have eaten the whole plate in about a minute.  That is the dish that will make me go back to Char No. 4. The brownie with peanut butter ganache and dulce de leche was rich and decadent.  The brownie almost had a cheesecake consistency but was super chocolatey and delicious. The portions are right one target - not overwhelmingly huge so that you'll have enough leftovers for two more meals, but it is just enough to eat most of the plate and feel perfectly full.   In order of favorite to least favorite dishes: sweet potato gnocchi brownie butternut squash soup pork nuggets chopped pork sandwich
