I love Mediterranean so I'm a fan~ by default. The venue is on the small side but cute. Seats are in tight quarters but service is friendly. Food equally on par. I would tag this as a neighborhood spot. Â A bit more low key than Aria but similar in feel. Definitely worth checking out, if in the area.
