Worst Spanish place.  I celebrate my bday there this month.  The place was full of 50-years-old dressed inappropriate for a night out.  Also, the staff was very rude and careless: the bartenders,  the host, EVERYONE! They promised a bottle, and a cake, and what I got was a small bottle of the cheapest vodkA with no free juice refills,  and a horrible looking cake.  We couldn't finish the bottle 'cause it tasted really bad and did not even touch the cake. Finally, all my guest had to pay for their own entrance.
