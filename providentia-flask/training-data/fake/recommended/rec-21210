this is the kind of place that tourists or people who rarely have thai food will come in and be like "OMG IT'S SO GREAT." the food is fine, and it's an interesting decor, but something about this place seems so fake, manufactured and americanized - the menu just kind of throws every single type of thai food you could think of in there, and the cocktail menu is a mess (key lime martini, mojito... what are these doing at a thai restaurant?). room service is trying way too hard. at least the food is decent though. TIPS - the worst kind of crowd: super touristy, uncultured, and weird (single white guy in suit at the bar to asian bartender: "so, are you chinese?") - dinner specials can get you dinner in around $10 pre tip
