Cafe Orlin treads the middle line for me in terms of brunch. My hunger pains/brunch hankering led me to believe that this place is a 5...but after digesting it all I realize it was...ok. Hmm..what kind of cafe doesn't serve regular coffee? The only options similar to coffee were espresso-like. Eek. I could only get through half a glass before I felt like I wasn't going to be able to fall asleep that night. It was just..aggressive. I got the egg white omelette with tomato and basil. The food itself was good but on the super oily side. After eating, I felt the oil emanating out of my pores and whoever looked at me thereafter could see their reflection on my face. Ambiance was eh. The service wasn't so friendly and did not aim to please. Rather they just wanted to get things done and get through the day. I guess that's socially acceptable enough...but not enough to make me want to return.
