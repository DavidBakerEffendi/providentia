I was sitting here trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars for this but I went with the latter because it's one of the better halal carts around and a really excellent place to go to after a night of partying in the city. Open late, cheap, and hits the spot. With that said, I haven't eaten here in almost a year (though I have accompanied others so they could get their fix) because just thinking about the greasiness and generally fattening qualities of their lamb and chicken platter doused in white sauce and a little bit of the red sauce makes me queasy. The next time I get dragged here, I'll probably grab a platter for myself, eat a few bites of it, and regret it immediately. I have never finished this in one sitting and I don't plan to try. This tastes best when fresh but it's good as leftovers too. I've also had their gyro which is good if you want a change from a platter. If you aren't into spicy food, use caution with the red sauce because a little goes a long way. Don't be deterred by a long line because they have a pretty efficient system that moves everything along quickly. Know what you want by the time you get to the front of the line. If you're here during a lunch or dinner rush, they might get skimpy with stuff in your platter. One time they totally ran out of lettuce, another time I got only 2 small triangles of pita bread, and yet another time there was a noticeably higher amount of rice than meat.
