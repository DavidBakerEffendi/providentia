For my first trip to NYC, I decided to stop at Harold's restaurant since I loved him on Top Chef. I didn't know what to expect -- but I loved it. I've dined at a lot of nice, trendy places in D.C., New Orleans, etc. but this place was solid and holds up to any comparison. I'd really recommend the corn side dish. AWESOME.
