Came here for a friends birthday brunch and was super happy with their food and drink selection. They have a good bloody mary, as well as this milk drink that I completely forgot the name of but you would recognize once you saw it on the menu....very similar to coquito for those of you who knows what that is. There are no unlimited mimosas or bloody marys, so drinking can get a little expensive, but they are good drinks. We all tasted each others dish, so I had a good selection of the menu and I must say all of them were really good. Good food, good drinks. It gets really crowded and it is basically self seating, so I would recommend getting there at the earlier part of brunch times (noonish?), though I am a fan of later brunch.
