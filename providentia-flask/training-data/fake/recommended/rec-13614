I LOVE the Halal Cart!! This is another one of my must haves when I am in NYC. The only reason I give it a 4 star is because they only service it late at night! Argh!! The food is cook just right!! And only for about $7 bucks it is a lot of food and GOOD food at that!! I always get the combination when I go. The rice,chicken,lamb, lettuce with the sauce and a little hot sauce (because it is extremely spicy!!). A PERFECT combination to a awesome late night treat! Definitely recommend everyone trying this place!
