People seem to have very polarized views of Corner Bistro, but I enjoyed their Bistro Burger ($6.75) very much.  For what you pay for, it's a steal, along with their $2.50 McSorley's Ale & McSorley's Red. Waiting for a table in the back seating area takes a while, so if you don't mind eating at the bar, I recommend you not bother with the wait and just eat up front.  Don't expect nice or courteous service though.
