100% my favorite place in Ktown. Woorijip is a little korean self serve place. They have a buffet, and also tons of packaged containers of korean dishes. Since I live on my own, this is the perfect place to buy a meal for one. I love the kimchi pancakes, the kimbap, the soup, and the chapchae. Sometimes when I dont feel like going out, Ill grab a few to-go containers (all around $4), bring home and stream a netflix movie. Perfecto!
