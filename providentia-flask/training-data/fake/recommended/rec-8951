Decided to try while visiting on business from L.A. due to all the rave reviews and I'm glad I did.  One of the best dinner experiences ever from food, service and ambiance. Let's start with the food.  So of course I had to try the ox tail bone marrow appetizer.  It was very good just as every one else has raved about. The different flavors of the marrow, marmalade and sea salt just filled all the taste buds! For entree I decided to try something I've never had, the pigeon.  Now it was a little too under cooked for my taste so I barely had a few bites.  That's not to say it was bad, just not my cup of tea.   But the waiter noticed that I barely ate the dish and asked was thre anything wrong.  I told him it tasted a little under cooked and he said thats how it is prepared so not to over cook it (small bird).   He was very gracious and said they won't charge for it !! Now that's what I call great service without me having to say a singke complaint. The restaurant is very small and seats people very close. Usually I would mind, but we got lucky and were seated to a great couple which we actually started to converse through out the night. Would definately go back.
