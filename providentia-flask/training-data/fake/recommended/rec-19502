Sabrina's is a very good place to eat an inexpensive breakfast / brunch / lunch / dinner. They open most of the time at 8:30 a.m. but do serve breakfast until 6:00 p.m. / Lunch starts around 1 p.m. / Dinner after 5 p.m.. It is also a B.Y.O.B., but with Franklin Beer Distributors right across the street that shouldn't be a problem. I ordered the salmon and onion omelette which was served with a side of potatoes and around eight slices of sour dough bread. It was delicious, just exactly what I was looking for that morning. The second time I had the stuffed French Toast (two big french toast stuffed with a vanilla cream cheese and bananas). The third time there I had the 'I haz Cheeseburger' or something like that served with a side order of home made parmesan fries. Both those dishes were also completely tasty!!! ...So two thumbs up.... Anyone living in Philadelphia looking for a good breakfast 'diner' this is the place to go to, I do also recommend it for lunch and dinner. Tourists staying in the hotels around, such as the Sheraton, Four Seasons etc. before you spend $15 on a small portion of scrambled eggs, spend around $8 - $12 on a good breakfast selection in a nice atmosphere leaving later with a full stomach and money left in your wallet.
