C'mon--it's such a great place.  Went on a Saturday night, around 6, waited for about 45 minutes.  No big deal, had a drink, played some mini golf.   Service was decent to good, food came quickly; wife had the steamed lobster, was well cracked, good pieces (I had crab; waitress helpfully offered to crack it for me and was very deft!).   food overall wasn't spectacular (lobster mac and cheese was surprisingly bland), but it's different from anything else you can get around here and definitely the place itself is transporting.  I will go back!
