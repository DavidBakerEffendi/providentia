I've had several meals here and most recently enjoyed an evening in the Biergarten.  I've never been disappointed with my experience at Nurnberger.  The biergarten has a smaller menu than the restaurant and is cash only.  The beer selection here is not huge, but they do offer really good German beer choices.  The pretzels are delicious, more especially because of the mustard options for dipping..  Service is always attentive and friendly.
