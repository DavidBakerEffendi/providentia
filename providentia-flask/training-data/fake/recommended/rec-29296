I live in roxborough and so many people swear by this joint but I'll be the first to say that this place is garbage. If you want a mediocre roll filled with half burnt chopped mystery meat drowned in cheese to mask the utter lack of care given by whichever miserable employee cooked it. Then go here. Oh and get a credit card processor it's not 1960 anymore and it doesn't make your place old fashion and "by the books" you're just turning away customers.
