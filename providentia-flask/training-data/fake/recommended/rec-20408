Went here for a work dinner, friend was raving about this place and set the bar very high; it did not disappoint, the staff were very friendly, and not pushy or get all butt hurt when we decided to stay at the bar 30min past our reservation. The Duck Fat Popcorn, tasted like popcorn, don't bother pulling the trigger on it. When we sat down, we immediately order the Spicy Duck Meatballs, Crispy Wild Boar Belly, and the House Made Orecchiette. The meatballs were great, cooked perfectly, and the broth with the quail egg was perfect and not too rich. The Boar Belly was also great, cooked tender and not salty. The winner of the group was the Orecchiette, it was Highly Truthful; I was contemplating ordering another as my main meal. I order the Duck, as I eat it rarely, and usually with every bite I hear the theme of "Duck Tales" in my head. The Duck was excellent, and only so because of the paring with the huckleberries & spiced cashew sauce; homerun, without it it would have been a double. Duck Takes Woo Hoo! The table split the Pear Butter Donuts, which were stupid good; the wine selection was well rounded and priced. Perilla is more on the quiet side of things, small intimate tables and a few booths; a good parallel would be the (awesome) music they play: Bloc Party, Crystal Castles, Old Kings of Leon, Broken Bells, but at a level you can barely hear.
