Having just moved to Point Breeze, this is one of the several nearby gastropubs that are my new neighborhood businesses. But in all honesty, I'll probably cross Washington Ave and go to the places in Graduate Hospital--most of the time. Don't get me wrong, the food here is good. I had the tuna melt, which came on swirled pumpernickel bread. Delicious for a tuna melt. But I'm a tad irked that it doesn't come with fries, and if you want to order them it's another $5. $14 for a tuna sandwich and fries? Umm... no thanks. Our waitress was so great and the beer selection is also wonderful, but the fact that I can walk to 3-4 other places and get fries with my meal for the same price is a huge factor.
