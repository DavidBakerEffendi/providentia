Krupa Grocery really meets a lot of needs in Windsor Terrace.  They're open for most of the day and are receptive to folks sitting around for an hour just for a cup of coffee (and the coffee is very good! iced coffee on tap!).  There's a casual beer-garden-type backyard that seems like a nice spot for groups and families with young kids.  The dinners at Krupa are outstanding--it's a typical new American menu, but executed particularly well.  Indoors, Krupa is a good spot for a quiet date, and there's a small cocktail menu and a decent wine list (Krupa's owned by the folks who run the wine shop across the street).  The service is attentive and friendly and the staff has gone out of the way to make me feel comfortable when I've stayed long after finishing my meal.
