When I talk to my friends about NYC (especially food), they always seem to ask if I'd been to the  "Chicken and Rice Guy."  So this guy is like a local celebrity...and for good reason... the food here is great.   How great?  Well.... late at night, there was still a line at least a block long.  I was scared I'd be waiting forever, but they got serving down to an art form here.  Everything went by very efficiently and smoothly.  Portions were pretty decent and were great for a late night snack.  I had some leftover and let me tell you, it also makes a good breakfast haha. At the end of the day, yeah, it's still street food... but it's really good street food--so much so that no trip to New York should be without a pitstop here.
