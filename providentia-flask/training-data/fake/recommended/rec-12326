This restaurant is in the middle of Chinatown, not far from where my hotel bordered Little Italy. It's so small, you could walk by and miss it, which I did the first time. But luckily for me, I read my fellow Yelpers reviews before my trip, so I knew about the tasty food here! The bacon wrapped jalapeño hot dog was delicious. It is topped with their own slaw and salsa. Delicious with a mild amount of heat. The Breakroom fries are also delicious, but very filling. They have a runny egg, bacon, onions, cheese, jalapeños & pork belly. They also had some heat to them, which is why I made sure I ordered a mint lemonade. That was so yummy, and tasted like it may have also had a touch of basil in it...and it was the perfect mix of sweet and tart. The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.
