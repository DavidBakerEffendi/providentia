I'm not sure what's going on with this place, but they need to take a step back and get their act together. I tried to place an order for delivery last night. The first time, I was told to call back in a few minutes because they were so busy. I waited 10 minutes before trying again and was put on hold for a moment. I thought that my order was pretty simple; tortilla soup and a fat veggie Indian sandwich,  both of which are featured on the grub hub and website menus. After being told that the tortilla soup didn't exist, I had to explain that I wanted chips and guacamole instead about 5 times. I tamped down my annoyance and added two drinks to my order. My total came to $29.34. After I hung up,  I calculated and realized that I was being overcharged by about $6. I was getting ready to call back when the cashier called me to say the the Fat Veggie Indian that I'd ordered didn't exist. I argued that they were listed in two different menus. the cashier related my complaint to the owner/cook/manager who told him to say that they'd have the ingredients next week. If I could leave no or negative stars, I would in a heartbeat. At this point, I'm so fed up with their awful customer service that I completely canceled the order. I won't do business with a place that's this much of a clusterfuck. I don't know if the crew working was new, but they need to figure out a game plan, soon. Also, I'm checking my account regularly to make sure I'm not being charged for their screw ups.
