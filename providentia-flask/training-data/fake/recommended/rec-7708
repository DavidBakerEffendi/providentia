We ordered the clam pizza and the Margarita.  The clam pizza tasted of garlic and fresh clams... it just turns out I don't really like clam pizza.  Don't get me wrong I still finished the pie!  The Margarita pizza was really good.  The crust was a little burnt for my taste, probably a result of the super hot coal fire ovens.  Still worth the wait in line.  If I'm in the New Haven area, I will be back.
