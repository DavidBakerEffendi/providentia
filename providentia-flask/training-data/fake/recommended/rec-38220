The pizza was good, but not much better than a well-made pizza from home.  The service was efficient but didn't do a whole lot of checking back to see how it was or if we wanted anything else. She also asked where my brother and I are from and if we had ever seen snow before?  I guess they don't get a lot of latino customers? Surprisingly rude. I went to see what all the fuss is about and it was just ok.
