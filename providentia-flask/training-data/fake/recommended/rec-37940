I am always on the lookout for new sushi places in the city, and somehow Izumi was listed in my "Memo" application on my cellphone in my "List of Restaurants to Try." I hate to admit this, but I don't venture into South Philly as often as I should, so when getting together with a friend who lives south of Washington, I took this as an opportunity to try Izumi. We started with the Seaweed Salad, which had a variety of seaweeds and was quite obviously very fresh.  Next we tried the Izumi Sashimi Sampler, consisting of the typical sashimi platter options (tuna, fluke, salmon, squid, and clam) with complimentary condiments sitting nicely on top.  This was probably my favorite dish of the night.  Next round was specialty rolls, which unfortunately, I didn't find that special.  They weren't bad per se, but not anything that stood out.  Last but not least was dessert.  We got the chocolate cake with meringue and toasted coconut, and it was the perfect palate pleaser. If you're in the mood to change up your sushi dining options, give this place a shot.  And remember, it's BYOB.
