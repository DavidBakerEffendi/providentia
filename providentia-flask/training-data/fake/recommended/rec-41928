Savas is great, I've been here a few times and I've gotten take out. It isn't pricey and the food is delicious. Every time I have eaten in I've gotten excellent service - the wait staff is super friendly. Take out was delivered within a reasonable time. I definitely would recommend the wings and pizza, which I've gotten several times. The pizza slices were huge, definitely some bang for your buck. However, stay away from the potato skins, they were well below expectations.
