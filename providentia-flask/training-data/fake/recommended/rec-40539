Not Jonsing for Jones! First time in Philly with two nights at Budakkan and Parc, 5 stars and outstanding and then breakfast here this morning...what a letdown. Couldn't give it no stars as it deserved so here's one for good coffee albeit @ $4 a pop. And tell me, where did you get those bagels and whitefish salad and tator tots ...at some nearby food stand (sorry any food stand)! Skip breakfast at this Steve Starr disappointment!
