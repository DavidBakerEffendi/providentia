With over 1000 ratings averaging to 4 stars, we had high hopes from this place. And as is normally the fate of high hopes, they were squashed. Guacamole & Plantain chips - really average. I don't understand why so many people have been raving about it. Greek Spinach Pie empanada - The filling was quite dry and flavorless. Red Bean side - Very average. Not much flavor My husband had 3 empanadas (shredded chicken in oven baked wheat flour, another chicken in corn flour and sea food stew in wheat flour empanada) - He said it was average and he'd rather have empanadas sold at one of the kiosks in Grand Central than here. At ~$3 per empanada, it feels like a steal, but remember that the empanadas are really quite small.
