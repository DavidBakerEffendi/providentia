First off this place truly rocks! I will not go to NYC and not come here. I came in for lunch on a Monday afternoon around 2 and the joint is packed. I sit at the bar and order a glass of white Burgundy (Cros Hermitage). The barman a very cordial chap proceeds to run me through the menu of which I opt for the Onion Soup, Escargot, oysters and a steak frites. Everything was fucking delicious. The ambiance is like being in a seriously bustlingParisien Bistro. After the meal in true fashion I order a Fernet and ginger and the barman asks me if I was a bartender from SF? I guess Fernet truly is a SF cultural thing. I replied that he was half true, I am in fact not a bartender but a purveyor of fine spirits. He then joined me in the imbibing Â and sent me on my way. What a great afternoon.
