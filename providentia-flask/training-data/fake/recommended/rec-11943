This was my second time here, the first was a late lunch, we were two people had salads  and shared a pie, we loved everything we ate and the vibe and atmosphere were great. Nice people and good food. Today we came for brunch hostess and staff super nice and welcoming. The waiter was attentive and sweet, knowledgeable,  we had the cornmeal pancakes and shared a breakfast pizza. Coffee and cocktails,   The pancakes with apple butter were tasty but crumbly, they kind of fell apart on your fork had to scoop them up to eat it.  Pizza was decent, over easy gooey egg was the best part. Crust was doughy and floppy. Not at all the firm slightly charred crust we experienced before, Overall it was good and we would recommend and go back ourselves,
