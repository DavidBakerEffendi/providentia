First off for this place to be so pricey you would expect the burgers to be better. My burger was grainy as if they use fillers which would indicate that for what they are charging for burgers that they feel the need to further rape their patrons. If I want a good burger I'll just go next door to shake shack or down to 500 Degrees where I can get bang for my buck and a better burger! I really feel the is place is not that great to have to cram myself in there to get a sub-par meal.
