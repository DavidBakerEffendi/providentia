I had been dying to go here for as long as I can remember and boy am I sorry I waited so long. They have quite an interesting menu of Asian fusion infused items served almost tapas style, which I don't mind because you can try more things on the menu. I had their special oxtail tacos of the day which were so moist and tender the juice was dripping down my hand. (Damn you really need to write reviews the next or same day because my old age is getting to me.) I will return soon enough for an updates review.
