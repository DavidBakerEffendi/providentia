A not so pretentious restaurant that serves quality food and great service at a reasonable price. Even better, this is BYOB! The truffle burger was very juicy, but could use sightly more seasoning. The pulled pork sandwich was just right. Spicy fries and sweet potato fries both have a nice twist. There's a cute backyard that can be perfect for a breezy summer night. The waiter was very nice and consistently made sure our glasses were filled. Even the chef made a point of coming out to talk to every table. It's rare to find a restaurant with people that really cares!
