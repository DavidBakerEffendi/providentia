Crazy dark and cozy inside, Paulie Gee's had been on my list for years after hearing from my old med school colleague (and Brooklyn native) that it was her favorite pizza joint. While I can't quite remember the exact pies we picked out, they were all delicious and based on the most glorious of foundations...ie. the best thin crust I've eaten yet.  While a lot of people might describe a crust as "paper thin", Paulie Gee's truly lives up to this description.  All the toppings were mad fresh and that Mike's Hot Honey is NO JOKE.  So freakin' good with just the right amount of heat. Legit Brooklyn 'za at its finest.
