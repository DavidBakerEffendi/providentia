This is a basic Pizza joint, they are the closest Pizzeria near my customer's site so I drop in a few times a year. They have a big screen TV in the dining area but as I remember they have soap operas on or TV drama's. Dude's put some sports on that thing. The place as I recall is clean. The portions are ample and fairly priced. There is plenty of parking. I recommend this place as a matter of convenience and proximity to Route 1 and Randolph road,
