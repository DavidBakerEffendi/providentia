So I went here last Friday, the bartender was a complete jerk. He never told us any of the specials which are always on Thursday and Friday I heard, and when he did tell us the specials, after we got our first drinks, he made the specials and it was for all things that me or my other 4 friends got. I guess the drink specials are to his discretion but he made sure to not put any of the 4 different drinks we got on that special. This doesn't even add to the outrageous prices they were already charging for mediocre cocktails. I would only recommend if this place if you like the pompous hipster bartenders and paying way too much for cocktails that aren't even that good. I wish I could remember the bartenders name so I could tell you not to go when he is working there. The only thing that is nice was the actual bar, the service, very mediocre.
