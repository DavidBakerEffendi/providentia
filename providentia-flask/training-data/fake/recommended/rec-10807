I stopped in here for dinner one evening. It's nestled between apartments on a residential block, which is either cozy, or strange, depending on how you look at it. The interior is nice, interesting decor with a cozy atmosphere. Service was really friendly and fast. Unfortunately the food, was only so-so. I know people rave about how much they love things, maybe it's just the brunch everyone craves, but I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't bad, but I feel as though the dishes were randomly thrown together. Mixing and matching sides with mains, in strange ways, that just didn't fit. Other than that, it's a nice intimate place to go. I just wouldn't (personally) visit too frequently.
