I have to say I was rather disappointed with Hudson Clearwater - although the venue itself was absolutely lovely. I can imagine it is even nicer in summer with the little backyard patio. However I wish someone had warned me about the absolutely minute portions. I ordered a barley risotto - and was so disappointed when a tiny plateful eventually showed up, which was barely five mouthfuls. I've seen bigger side dishes. I ordered the banana bread pudding for dessert as I was so hungry, which was OK, although I had to ask for extra chocolate sauce on the side, which was a nice addition. The quality of the food was perfectly fine, and my friend who ordered a pork chop seemed to have a decent portion, but I did feel distinctly short changed, which was a shame, as it is a lovely place and the staff were super friendly and helpful.
