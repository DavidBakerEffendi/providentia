Yum yum yum. It was an hour long wait but my, was it worth it. The space and place was not crowded by all means, a rarity in Manhattan or Chinatown. The food was excellent and served in infinite supplies. The only complaint I have is that the charge for tea is too much. Something so common of a drink in Asia should be served free! (Most asian places do).
