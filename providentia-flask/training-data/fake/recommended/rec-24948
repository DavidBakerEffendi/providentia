Went to Blue this past Saturday and it was a great evening all the way around; we had to wait for outdoor seating but the wait was well worth it; the setting was beautiful and the food and cocktails were amazing.  We also got to see all the dishes come out for other tables and wished we could order the entire menu.  The manager and staff were all top notch, we look forward to returning; btw, we never at anytime felt rushed even though they were crowded and people were waiting for tables.
