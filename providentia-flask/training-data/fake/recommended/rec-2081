I've been dying to go to Little Italy for a long time, so when we were in the area I was completely taken back by all the options. I had no clue which places were good and which were bad, so I looked to Yelp to guide me. After wandering up and down the street many of the restaurants were very pushy, trying to get your business. Pellegrino's was not like that which I respected. It was pretty classy inside, so I felt bad that I was just wearing a tanktop and shorts, but they didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all. Service was very professional and attentive. The lunch prices were reasonable and the portions were still large enough to make you leave stuffed. There are a couple different kinds of bread they serve. One was more like a tomato pie and was very good. I was looking for a Chicken Parm sub but I only saw dinners listed so I just went with the dinner. I'm not gonna say its the best Italian Restaurant ever but you won't be disappointed either. Another plus was the fast service, so we were able to make our train home early.
