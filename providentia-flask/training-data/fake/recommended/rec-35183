So incredibly unique! Absolutely loved the twist to a burger - the patties were super juicy filled with flavor, and the bread held everything in so well with a great toasted crunch on the outside, softness on the inside. I ordered the Bronte Burger and my friend ordered the Whaley - I couldn't finish all of mine but seemed like the perfect, filling portion size for my guy friend. The place itself is fairly small and we came for a late lunch (~1:30pm) on a Saturday with no line.  Staff are super friendly.  We waited quite a bit for the food to come out but it was definitely worth the wait.
