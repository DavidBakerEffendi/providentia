I went to Balthazar for breakfast, and was not impressed. I ordered the quiche lorraine ($11), and got a tiny slice of only lukewarm quiche, on par with what you'd expect from under a cheap cafe's heat lamp. While it's not a terrible restaurant, it's not a good value (for breakfast anyway) and I don't see myself returning soon.
