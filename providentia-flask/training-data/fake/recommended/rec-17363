After hearing/seeing mixed reviews from friends and online I finally tried out Cuban Pete's myself. I gave this restaurant a 3-star rating because the food and atmosphere were great but the service was horrendous. I felt like I was inconveniencing the person whose job it was to serve us. Went in for an early dinner (party of 2) so we were sat immediately. I was highly impressed with the decor and atmosphere, then our server arrived. No introduction, didn't give us his name, just proceeded to ask "what are we having". We ordered the Pineapple Mojito, Goat Cheese Fritters, and Chicken Empanadas to start. The drinks and the tapas came out fairly quickly and were delicious. Our server never returned to see if the food was satisfactory or if we needed anything else even though he had other tables directly next to us. Our entrees arrived which were the Lamb and Pepper stew and the Paella. Both were large portions and once again tasted delicious. Between the sweetness of the mojito and the savoriness of the stew I could really use a glass of water at that point. But once again our server was nowhere to be found. I'm not sure if I would ever go back but if I did it would only be for takeout.
