I have to counter balance the ridiculously high reviews this place is getting. Lower quality and higher prices than Whole Foods, but people are giving this 4.5 stars? I don't see it. They have a really great selection of natural and supplement related items, but at a serious premium compared to Amazon and even Whole Foods. Their vegetable selection really needs help and some pricing as well. Two stars because of pricing. If they were more reasonably priced, they'd get 3 stars. Go to Whole Foods is you can, if not, this place will work in a pinch.
