South Philly Italian! The South Philly Italian is like a symphony of meats. It, and may other of their sandwich creations, reside way up in the stratosphere of sandwich hierarchy. Do: Try a riviera, south Philly Italian, Sicilian, Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak, breakfast sandwich, or some wings; plan on talking a little baseball, and taking your time...you don't need to be in a hurry to leave. Don't: Be a tool and add Cosmi's to your list of places to try a 'wiz wit'. They certainly know they difference between plastic cheese and aged provolone, but will happily pander upon request. Get a real sandwich instead...'you'll thank me later.'
