This one frustrates me.  I've been to Peppercorns a ton over the years, as it has always been one of my favorites.  But this past weekend's visit was a disappointment.   Our server was new and inexperienced.  She didn't know what menu items were,  she didn't recognize dish names.  She was also inattentive.  Our drinks sat empty.  No biggie - the rest of the waitstaff seemed on the ball. I'm not here for the service - I'm here for the food!  I love the classic italian menu, lots of salumi plates and lovely sounding pastas.  We toiled over our selection, and finally settled on three apps + two entrees for two people  (yes, the menu looked that good).  Here's the skinny on apps: - Lobster Carpaccio was the standout, with an inventive presentation for classic flavors: lobster, spring peas, and truffles. - Prosciutto de parma with figs - I eat prosciutto like it's my job.   This particular plate offered enjoyable, albeit dry, meat.   - Carpaccio trio of tuna, octopus and veal.   There were only two quarter-sized pieces of veal, equivalent in volume to two peas.  Was the kitchen out of veal?  The smoky  tuna was great. The entrees were the great shortfall...my hubby's "Prime Ribeye" was seared so hot it was contracted into a bowl shape.  Thin cut, it looked like something served in a diner with eggs.  And served with french fries for $31????? My Striped Bass fell victim to the restaurant's heat lamp. By the time it made it tableside, the plate was searing hot and the fish and roasted potatoes were so dry they were unpalatable.   These plates should have never left the kitchen.   Even great restaurants go through ups and downs.  Maybe this Saturday night dinner service was short a chef and working with the "B" team.  But at $200 a clip, I'm hesitant to be the supersleuth  behind what went wrong.
