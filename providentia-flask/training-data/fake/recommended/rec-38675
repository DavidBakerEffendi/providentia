After seeing all these rave reviews, I trekked up to Rex from 42nd and 7th in the bitter cold.  I passed multiple other coffee shops, but I was on a mission to try the amazing Rex! Sorry to be a downer, but I am not seeing how Rex is getting all these five-star reviews.The place is very small with barely anyplace to sit.  The food selection is sparse.  The scone was okay, but was not bursting with flavor like I had expected.  The mocha was good, but not outstanding.  I was disappointed that Rex only has one -sized cup.  Maybe living in the land of the amazing coffee shops (RI) has spoiled me, but I didn't see why my mediocre scone and nothing-to-write-home-about-partly-because-it's-­so-small mocha was worth $7--even in NYC.
