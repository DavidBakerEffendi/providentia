I only tried the Panna Cota here. It tasted like vanilla cream with fresh strawberries and walnuts. It was so yummy! This is something I would give up my diet for. When I was inside I saw their menu and saw that they have organic coffee, which Â is something I would want to try next time. I cant wait to go back and try their other products!
