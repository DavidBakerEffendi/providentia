For this famous pizzeria (established in 1925) the line we faced was nothing with only one small group ahead of us.  It is located on Wooster Street in New Haven's "Little Italy" district.  New Haven is famous for having some of the best thin crust pizza in the country. The root beer soda had more of that "old time" sasparilla taste.  The "white birch" soda had a clear wintergreen taste and smell and the "kola" was fairly close in taste to a Coca-Cola. Dad had the Margherita pizza w/roasted red peppers & sausage.  Bella and I went with Clam, bacon, olive oil, oregano, garlic, mozzarella pie.  This pizza was amazing, although in hindsight, I probably wouldn't have added bacon.  It was outstanding bacon both visually and by taste but it clearly overpowered the taste of the clams. The crust has a nice chewiness to it (yet was firm) and it does get slightly burnt in places as part of the "wood-fired" process (super high heat and short duration).  As a result, fellow customers should simply -- "deal with it" -- and shut their pie-holes in regards to this aspect of the pie.  A bonus of this type of cooking is that the pie arrives at your table quickly.
