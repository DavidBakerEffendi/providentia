I was excited to get some fried chicken. Got here at 430 and they said I had to wait until 5. I asked multiple times if there is anything they can do but no. I am not a happy camper especially because their lunch menu is like 4 things. I will not be returning although I will say their fried chicken is usually pretty good. Better than Lincoln or crown but worse than a good fried chicken place.
