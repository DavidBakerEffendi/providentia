First time here and I could smell the deliciousness as soon as I opened the door. Our delightful waiter recommended the fat boy to share.  Blackened anything,  mac and cheese, greens, red beans with dirty rice and potato salad.  Amazing. All the flavor with a pleasant kick. Even room for dessert. Banana pudding cake to die for. Overall, outstanding.
