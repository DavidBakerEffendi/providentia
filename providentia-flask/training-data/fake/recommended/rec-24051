Traditional versus Truffle. I liked the Truffle better because it was a little sweet whereas the Traditional had a little freshness with the tomato. My wait wasn't terrible because we went after the the lunch crowd at 1:30pm. This place is always bumping at all hours but going at prime hours would probably be not a good choice. It is so Yum! Who doesn't love a good burger?
