I came here for an event and actually liked the place. it is however not anywhere near my neighborhood but I can see myself headed back here in the future.  I think the waitstaff was excellent.  The views from the top floor were great.  We didn't get to see the outside patio but the setup looked really nice.  Sampling menu was pretty good as well.  I recommend the Lamb Shank, that was pretty tasty.  The reviews overall from other yelpers were not so excellent.  i don't know but check it out if you are in the area. It is above the Eden Gourmet and right off the train stop in South Orange on NJ Transit.
