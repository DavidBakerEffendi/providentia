Atmosphere is everything at this place.  Open air, views of the waterfront with warm breezes make  you feel like you're at the beach.  The food was good but also pretty generic.  Can you really screw up snow crab legs? Service was friendly but they are all clearly overwhelmed.  We waited 1.5 hours but got a seat at the bar and an appetizer there.  I'd go back if I wasn't that hungry or in a hurry.
