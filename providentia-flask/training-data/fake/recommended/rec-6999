I don't remember anything else but the RYE MEATLOAF SANDWICH. It's the tastiest meatloaf sandwich of all time. If you dream of eating a meatloaf sandwich, make your dreams a reality (a borderline wet dream) and purchase and eat that sandwich. It'll make you forget about spending $ on that overly expensive Bloody Mary and you'll remember the meaning of life...which was to eat the Rye meatloaf.
