the good rewievs is not correct, i was not happy visit this place. Staff very nice and heplpful Food good but out of flavours and Â just expensive. We tried about different 4 courses and i wasnt impressed at all. Beverages was also expensive. Our party of 4 was 200, and i was stil hungry and just one beer for me. Should not recomend this place, try Ippudo 2 blocks away instead
