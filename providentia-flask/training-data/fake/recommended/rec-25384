I've visited the few Vietnamese restaurants in the area and this one did not disappoint. The combos available for the b√∫n (meat with cold vermicelli) were interesting and the place offered many apps, entrees and beverages. My only complaint was some slow service, but it was not a deal breaker: just cost them one star.
