My friend invited me here with high remarks of the food in their NJ location. Well, I thought it just so so. Ambiance was great. I had wood grilled octopus, veggie platter, chicken liver pasta, chocolate flan.  Octopus was tender. My favorite thing in veggie platter was celery root. I guess I don't like white sauce pasta. Chocolate flan was actually molten cake. All the food was great but somehow I just didn't leave feeling wowed and dying to return.  Next time I'll try the lobster pasta and maybe my experience will be different.
