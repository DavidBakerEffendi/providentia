I think this place had the longest line at Reading Terminal.  They have counter seating around the kitchen, and you can watch them assemble sandwiches.  They have a few meat options, but I went with the traditional roast pork with sharp provolone.  I was expecting the pork to be like porchetta, but slices are thinner, and it's leaner (but still has good flavor).  The extra stock that the roast pork is warmed up in is poured on top and soaks into the bread nicely.  The cheese also gets melty, which I love. I never would have thought to top my pork sandwich off with "greens," but it turns out they use bite sized pieces of broccoli raab, which adds good texture and a nice kick, plus it makes you feel a little less guilty about the rest of the sandwich. It's a very filling sandwich.  I didn't even realize they were on Man vs Food, and apparently they got some best sandwich award on Travel Channel.  This is anything but your regular roast pork sandwich!
