Had the eggs benedict. It was delicious. Came with potatoes and orange juice. My only disappointment was that the 'small' orange juice was probably not much more than a shot glass and the waitress didn't really check up on us in time for me to order another one. Great atmosphere and it's reasonably priced so I'd recommend it.
