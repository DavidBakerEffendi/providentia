I like to take my out of town friends to Sabrina for brunch. Friendly staff but there is always a wait. Highly recommend the stuffed challah french toast, Omelettes, and Mel's chicken cutlet. Â The Mel's chicken cutlet comes with sweet potato fries! The portions are huge...i can never finish and would pack it for home.
