Making the decision to go here to eat instead of the adjacent Pat's (simply because of the "we go to Pat's all the time so lets do Geno's this time" syndrome) was a big mistake. The bread was super cold and tasteless as also was the meat. I think to pull off a super uncomfortable and inconvenient culinary experience for your customers and have them come again - you really have to have exceptionally/out of the world - knock it out of the park - quality. Geno's is no where near - expecially with a much better alternative nearby (Pat's). Going there was a big mistake - not gonna do it again - stickin to Pat's.
