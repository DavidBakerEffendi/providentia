Best no frills burger. The beef patty is thick and when you bite into it all you see is fresh meat. I've heard they don't even season it so I always salt + pepper it when I get it but that's it cause it's so fresh and juicy, you don't want to mask that. The bun is flat and unobtrusive so you really get to taste the meat. Their fries are pretty solid but they always need salt in my opinion. Root beer on tap is how I wash this one down.
