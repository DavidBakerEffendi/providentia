Great place! Fortunately, the restaurant we were planning on eating at was closed and we happened upon The Marshall. So glad we decided to stop in. We didn't have reservations but the hostess was great at getting us in with a small wait.  We had a glass of wine at the quaint bar until our table was ready.  The place is small and intimate, very nice, but not pretentious.  The food was very delicious.  The prime rib was amazing and huge.  The butternut squash salad was really flavorful and fresh. I don't think you will be disappointed.
