Now THIS is how you do it. The Mexican food in this place is really good. The food is well seasoned and flavored, the guacamole sauce is fantastic and the chips are great too! Only thing: maybe portions are too tiny for American standards. But I definitely wanna go back and try out other dishes. Moreover, the staff was friendly! Which is rare nowadays (to all the other impolite and unfriendly restaurants' staffs: learn from this place. See? It's not that hard)
