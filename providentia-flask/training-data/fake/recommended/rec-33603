Talk about NY street food! This is as good as it gets folks! I highly recommend this joint to anyone who plan to experience NYC in its true form. I was dragged here by my friends back in 2009 after an Offspring concert at Roseland. That night changed y life. When I first looked at the line, I was like "Dude, really? We were already standing for like 5 hours!" but my friends swore that it was worth the wait. Actually, the guys there are pros and have their system down to a T and so the line goes quickly. For 6 bucks, you'll get a generous portion of yellow rice, pita bread and meat (lamb or chicken) but I always get lamb. Top it off with hot sauce and bathe it in white sauce and you're all set. If you want to have an even more orgasmic experience, come here when you're drunk or have the munchies. Listen to some Pink Floyd and your ethereal experience awaits. *** Take note: they are only here from 7 pm- 4 am. Food carts that are here other times are not associated with the Halal Guys.***
