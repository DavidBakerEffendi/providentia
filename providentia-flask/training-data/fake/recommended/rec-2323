I've been to both Geno's and Pat's. They both tasted...kinda the same. I was told that the locals in Philly like Pat's better. Â The good thing about the two is that they are both opened late so that is where we headed after a night of drinking at the bars. I'd recommend Fat's Sandwich over at Rutgers if you get the chance. They are about 5000 calories per sandwich...but well worth it.
