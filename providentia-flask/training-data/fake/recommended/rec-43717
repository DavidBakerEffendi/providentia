My friend chose this restaurant because of the BYOB feature. Since I don't drink, this wasn't too much of a perk for me (but I guess it helps the bottom line since the alcohol does tend to increase the tax & tip immensely). This is a really quaint location. She invited a total of about 20 people (after looking at the space, I was seriously wondering why). This wasn't a turn off. After all, we ARE in Manhattan. However with the space, there were only two other patrons in the whole restaurants. I didn't like that we were constantly being hushed by the waitresses. The other patrons weren't complaining and we really weren't making that much noise (Tuesday after work..everyone is too tired). When the food arrived, we were astonished at the portions. The hanger steak about 6 or 7 of us ordered was JUST A BIT too small for an entree. And the side dishes were more for the table to share, and not individual courses. I would give this more a 3.5 because the food itself was DELICIOUS, just wasn't enough...which sucks when you're enjoying the food. But this is definitely a cozy place for a small party. would def go back there with only 1 or two people, on a night i'm not too hungry.
