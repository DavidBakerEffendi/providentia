Excellent excellent! I walked in with 18 starving teenagers (my students) after a field trip at the museum next door and we were promptly taken care of! Everyone had a sandwich within 15 minutes and we all LOVED the food. The portions are very filling and the prices are extremely fair. The bread was amazing, the fresh mozzarella on my "Italian flag" sandwich may have been the best I have ever had. The staff here is very friendly, excellent customer service!
