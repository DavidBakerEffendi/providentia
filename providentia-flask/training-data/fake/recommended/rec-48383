What can I say- I love this place for what it is... a reliable place to get decent food, cheap drinks ($3 beer/wine/well during happyhour? I challenge you to find a better park slope happyhour for drafts!)  While it's not super "authentic," my Scandinavian father loves this place as a blast from his german-living days.  The food isnt artisanal but its good and consistent, and its a great place to strike up a conversation with people from the neighborhood!  A billion stars for the hoff
