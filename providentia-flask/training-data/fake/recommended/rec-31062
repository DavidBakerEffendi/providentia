Always looking to try new restaurants outside of Center City. Really liked In Riva. Pizza was good; loved the charred octopus, but probably the best thing we had was the fried artichokes. Loved the variety on the menu - wasn't just pizza or just pasta. I agree with other reviewers that it might be a tad pricey for what it is, but the quality of food was excellent.
