This place is so awesome! I tried the meatloaf burger, the pulled pork sandwich, a cinamon bun, and coffee, all of which were great. Lunchbox is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and I'll be going back often. The pulled pork sandwich was especially good. I've never liked pulled pork before because it ends up being stringy, dry, and soft, but the pulled pork at Lunchbox is cooked perfectly. I can't wait to get another one.
