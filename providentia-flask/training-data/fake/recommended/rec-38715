Really great, authentic and tasty menu. a bit loud peak time on a saturday night, but could still hold a conversation. Â I had the fettucini appetizer, actually large enough for a small entree, absolutely fantastic and unique. Made perfectly aldente and served piping hot. Not alfredo, but in a light oil base with sausage and --mint !? which kicked it over the top. salmon in parchment also a great entree. overall excellent dinner , a place to return again on another night.
