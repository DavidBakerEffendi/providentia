I've actually been here twice. The first time about 4 something years ago when I was visiting family for like 2 weeks in the summer and then most recently after my grandma's funeral. I guess I had remembered this place a little better than it actually is or it declined throughout the years. It has your typical Americanized Chinese buffet options and since I'm going through a phase of just being over these types of buffets, I wasn't very impressed. The food is still decent though and the service is pretty good, but nothing really stood out. I guess the only thing that left a memorable impression on me was the ice cream. It had a nasty and awkward aftertaste, the only saving grace about it was the cone lol. Other than that though it was a nice spot for everyone to gather and eat after a rather depressing and emotional day for the family.
