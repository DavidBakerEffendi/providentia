Went for a birthday dinner on a Sunday night. It wasn't as packed as I'm sure it gets on Friday or Saturday, but it was decently full. The waitress was great and friendly. The blood orange frozen margarita was amazing. Food was pretty good, but not to die for. We got the 3-in-1 appetizer with classic guac (excellent), salsa fresca (delish) and cesar guac (eh, i've had better). By the time the food came out, though, we were so stuffed we had to take it all home and that rarely happens to me. BONUS: photo booth is a lot of fun for parties and dates... very cute results. Warning: Bathroom situation is semi-confusing, mostly for the guys, all of whom thought they had mistakenly walked into the ladies' room becuase there is a shared sink space and a "Ladies Room" sign up. The Guys are around the corner, apparently, so warn the boyfriends haha
