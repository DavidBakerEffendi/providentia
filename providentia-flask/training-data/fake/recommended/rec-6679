The wait staff was nice but the food was quite bad. It was completely tasteless,  the tomato sauce  tasted like it was out of a can. Seafood was very blend and lacked any seasoning. We had ginger calamari as an appetizer and the calamari was very chewy and the ginger sauce tasted blah... I ordered the risotto with shrimp and scallops, the risotto was ok but the seafood wasn't tasty at all. My husband had the red snapper dish with calamari, shrimp and scallops. It was all covered in tasteless tomato sauce and the seafood was overcooked. Overall a pretty bad experience.
