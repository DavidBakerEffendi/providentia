I don't know why this place is getting such great reviews. I guess good food isnt one of the criteria its getting rated by. If you're basing the review on the view, you're looking at gas storage tanks, beautiful? I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The staff was extremely friendly, very attentive to our needs. The drinks are made with just the right amount of alcohol, that's about the only thing that's on point with quality and price. Aside from that I'd say the place is over price. I'm not paying for the view I'm paying for food and I don't think it's worth the price. Yes they have some very nice appetizers, the crab fitters are great, so are the spring rolls, but they're both overpriced considering the portions served. The dishes are big portions but they fall short on taste. The three plates we ordered were all bland, nothing stood out. if your'e going for drinks, and a light meal, order from the appetizer menu, otherwise, I'd say skip for dinner.
