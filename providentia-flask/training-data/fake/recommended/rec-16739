I love this place. Food is great. Wine is inexpensive. Service is fabulous. It is tiny, you may share a table with others and you have to squeeze behind the cook to get to the bathroom: I think those things make me love this place even more. Food here is for sharing, flavor full and interesting: Delicious!
