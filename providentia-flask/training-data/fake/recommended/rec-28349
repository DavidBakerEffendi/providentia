My first thought - "It's my very own little piece of Brooklyn, right here in Queens." I saw this first in San Francisco (Ritual, Blue Bottle, Philz).  Coffee shops that take 10 times longer to make a cup of coffee than anyone thought possible, resulting in the most amazing experience a coffee drinker can hope for.  The Kickshaw takes up the mantle of 'coffee for coffee people' right here in Queens and then throws in a menu of incredible grilled cheese to ensure full pleasure. This place is perfect.  Outstanding coffee, simple but great menu and now - they have wine and beer.  The team is chill, the atmosphere is great.  This is now my top stop in the neighborhood. Recommend - the minted eggplant grilled cheese.  Mexican coffee blends.
