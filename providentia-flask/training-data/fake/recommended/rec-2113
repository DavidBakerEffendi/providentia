Pats or Geno's? Pat's is slightly better but neither is great. Much respect to Pat's for being the originator but i think its time to reinvent their classic sandwich. I honestly believe that Great Steak and Fries in shopping malls are even better. Pat's meat was dry, bread tastes stale, and service was poor. I don't understand it. Iit is quite tough to make ribeye tasteless. I have no idea Â how to do it....So pat, please tell me your secret... Needless to say, it was a big disappointment to come to these 2 tourist traps to fill my cheesesteak craving when on my roadtrip. I ate half a sandwich from Geno's and half from Pat's and int he end, i was still dissapointed and my craving for GOOD cheesesteak was bigger than ever...I should have done more research instead of just going with the most well known places. Maybe Tony's Luke's next time.. Where do the locals go?? Please tell me that the best cheesesteak is somewhere in philly. I still believe there has to be a great one that can hold redeem the name that Pat's and Geno's has made a mockery of.
