I've been here several times. In the cold months you eat indoors and in the warm months you can eat indoors or outdoors on stone street. Personaly I prefer to sit indoors because the outside tables get sooo crowded when it's warm....keep in mind they share stone street with all the other places on that block. But some people dont mind bumping elbows with the people at the table behind them. I hate the over crowded dining experience. The thin crust pizzas are very good...Different topings available, nice selection of beers and wines. Indoor atmosphere is nice, dim lights and wooden tables. Service is quick, and the waitstaff is usually friendly. You can hang your coat by the door....the tables can be a little tight if it's busy....it gets a bit loud during the "after work hours of 5-7" but worth the food. It can be both casual and dressy but since this is in the financial district most people will be wearing business casual clothing.
