What a disappointment.  I really don't understand the hype. My husband and I were so excited for this to open in our neighborhood.  Really pleased to find a time when the buzz died down so we didn't have to wait in the long lines.  Wait time was 9 mins.  One of the few positives we took from this experience. I had the Shack burger and my husband got the one with the fried mushroom on top.  Burgers were forgettable - small, over cooked and under seasoned.  My husbands burger was very messy and oozed cheese; this still didn't add to the flavor profile.  Fries looked like those you can get in the freezer section of your grocery store.  Needless to say, they tasted as they looked. The best part of the meal was the root beer.  Adding insult to injury, we had to walk past Village Whiskey on our way home.  What a waste of a dinner.  Now we know.
