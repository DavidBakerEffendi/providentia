I had been hearing the hype about Paesano's for a couple of years now, but had yet to venture out to try this gem.  Wow!  This place makes a mean sandwich.  First, they got that good Liscio's bread.  Second, since there are only two people working and it is such a small place, they actually care about crafting your sandwich.  The staff was also very friendly.  I got the namesake Paesano sandwich which was brisket, hot pepper, a fried egg, cheese and horse radish mayo.  While a bit messy because of the runny egg, the yolk provided an unexpectedly good sauce, which only helped to make the brisket juicier.  It was also nicely loaded with meat so definitely got my $8 worth.  My girlfriend enjoyed her Italian.  (the Daddywad).  Can't go wrong with hot or cold sandwiches.  Can't wait to go back.  (p.s. - we tried to go to the other paesanos on 9th street prior to coming to this one, but they had run out of bread)
