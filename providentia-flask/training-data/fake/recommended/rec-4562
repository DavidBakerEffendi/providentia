I have been a regular customer to this place for almost 3 years until my last visit. Since this restaurant has been acquired by Ootoya months ago. The quality just went terrible. They cut the fish for the don 1 inch thick per piece! R u kidding me? Not to mention the fish is not fresh at all, has a very bad smell. Other dishes are just as normal as japanese fast food restaurant. So sad this was one of my favorite japanese restaurant.
