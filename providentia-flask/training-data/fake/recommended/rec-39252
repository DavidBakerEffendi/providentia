I had the Hunan Beef yesterday - clean tasting and spicy, but more importantly as previous reviewers have noted, China Pan's menu has pages of Vegetarian and Vegan choices.  Decor and ambiance are mediocre, BUT again - you cannot beat world class Vegetarian offerings.  Why can't big city restos do the same? Total bill: $20 plus tip, so very reasonable.
