I absolutely HAD to try this place while visiting Philly after seeing it on the food channel.  First off, parking is almost non-existent.  We circled the block a few times until we saw someone leaving.  Cars are parked in the cross walk and in no parking areas to get to this place, which made me even more excited to sink my teeth in one of these steaks! The line here was so much shorter than Geno's.  I ordered mine wit onions and cheez-whiz.  They fix the steak and hand it to you unwrapped so that you can go to the condiment stand on the sidewalk to put your choice of fixings.  I didn't try anything extra. This cheesesteak was so disappointing. There was just no flavor at all. I tasted the whiz and bread. Overall the cheese steak tasted watered down. So I went across the street to Geno's to try the competition....
