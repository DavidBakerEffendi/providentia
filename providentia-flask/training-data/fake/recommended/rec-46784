I too definitely watched that episode of How I Met Your Mother which left me wondering about this Corner Bistro place. This place is no frills and kind of divey...but perfect. If your food is good and delicious, you don't need to have a thousand things on the menu. Think about this, the psychology of choice: more options sometimes means more opportunity to be discontent and be left wondering "what if I had ordered x instead of y..." Anyyyywayyy, simple menu suited me just fine. A Bistro Burger medium, fries and a McSorley's beer is all you really need on a Friday night. This place is apparently a go-to meet up spot for bros. I didn't mind, but given that the space is small it got pretty loud. Good thing the burgers are good enough to quiet even the loudest of loud mouths :) Be prepared to wait though, especially between 6-8 pm which I imagine are prime burger hours regardless of the night. If you have a larger group, it might be a longer wait. No worries though, it's worth the wait and the service is nice and quick. Takeaway: A dark, divey and delicious burger joint!
