Went here on a date and it was perfect. I went a little early to grab a spot at the bar (as Sophia does not take reservations) and within 10-15 mins a couple got up. By the time my date arrived I had my first glass of wine and was ready to order. They had great, casual tapas style items to choose from which was perfect. The bartender was attentive and the wine selection was vast. Highly recommended for a casual mid-week date. Maybe follow it up with a drink at the top of the Kimberly to cap off the night and you're sure to have a great night.
