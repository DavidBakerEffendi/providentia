Eh, what is the big deal? Please tell me...Granted, I'm vegetarian, so I don't get the full experience. I will say that their falafel is AWFUL. SUPER hard, and none of the food was hot. My family kept saying the rice was so good, but I really beg to differ. I do think the meat products are supposed to be very good, and we all really liked the hot sauce. It is indeed very hot. Now explain to me this white sauce thing. Reading the reviews, it seems that it should be a garlic based sauce. I have to say it tasted very mayonnaise-y and very much like a bad ranch dressing. I was not a fan at all, but poured some over to give my crappy falafel some much needed moisture. :( I wanted to like it so much.
