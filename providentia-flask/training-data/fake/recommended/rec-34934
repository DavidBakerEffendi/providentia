Thank God their cooking is better than my Spanish!  This is one Gringo that's glad he found Chili Willies.   We were a table of 6 on a Saturday night and they squeezed us in without a huge wait. The whole staff made us feel like family.  Food was brought out quickly, correctly and hot.   We ordered a good sampling of the menu and everyone left with a huge doggie bag and full stomach's.  The food was more than fine. I'll gladly go back in the future.  What a find!
