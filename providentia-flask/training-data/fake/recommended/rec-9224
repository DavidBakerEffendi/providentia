Where else can you get the tastiest fried chicken and the melt in your mouth mashed potatoes and gravy at 2:30am?  While I might live a few days less due to indulging in the artery clogging menu, it was divine. Our server was witty and knoweldgable about the menu.  Service was quick and efficient.   The food...well, to die for is simply the best phrase.
