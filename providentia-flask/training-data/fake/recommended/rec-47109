Went here with local friends a couple weeks back. The food and the portions were AMAZING. We all split the mussels to start. They were phenomenal and the four of us couldn't finish them. They really give you enough to serve an army! And then, as if we hadn't had enough, we split the stuffed meatloaf dinner. He had his with the garlic mashed potatoes, I had mine with the mashed sweet potatoes. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! We couldn't believe they had split the meal in two. We're BIG eaters and the half-portions were way too much for us. The veggies were steamed to perfection (maybe grilled - either way good!). The mashed potatoes (both styles) were fluffy and yummy! And the meatloaf....I don't know how they worked their magic, but it was to die for! To top it all off, service was impecable!
