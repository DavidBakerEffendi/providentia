The only reason I give it two stars is our waitress and hostess were both very sweet. Not speedy and attentive, but genuinely nice. And if the food were a little better AND the prices a little more reasonable this place could be a 3. But two is generous. First impressions: decor fits the "shanty" name and seems inauthentic and cheesy. And as soon as you step in, it smells heavily of fried fish sticks. We came on a Monday during "scallop harvest" which implies to me that the scallops are fresh. Most folks had some variant of the scallops. All of them were tiny, seemed pan fried regardless of preparation (no difference between the "seared" and "fried" scallops,) and tasted fishy and stale, not fresh. The oysters seemed pretty decent and had no grit. Most other things on the menu were battered and fried. But then there's price. I had a salad on special. 5 little, greasy scallops on a big plate of grocery store greens for $14. Other items were $18-mid $20s, apps were a little under $10. A few nights ago in Columbia, MO I ate at the restaurant of a James beard nominated chef, and had a scallop app and an organic pork chop, beautifully prepared, for about $40 including a drink. My salad, one beer, a side, and a couple oysters, was a little over $30 with tax and tip. I don't mind paying for good food, but this was, no exaggeration, on par with a long John silver's. I forgot to even mention that despite the restaurant being empty, it took us an hour to get our entrees, with long gaps between being checked on.. the experience, on the whole, was just a mistake. My party felt like getting some fish and this place was more like a badly managed red lobster. Deeply in need of a visit from Gordon Ramsay and kitchen nightmares. Seems like it could work in this town, but they need to get fresh ingredients and step it up. I would have gone elsewhere but was sucked in by the illusion of fresh scallops for the "scallop harvest festival." Don't make the same mistake.
