Came here Â for lunch on a snow day. Place was a quarter full and dazed and confused was playing on TV there, so that was a good sign. Started off with the guacamole. Packed with flavor, though I like it a little spicier so just added some hot sauce. Tried three of the tacos (pork, fish and beef). All three were delicious. The fish was my favorite. Waiter was very friendly and attentive. Great Mexican food at a good price (20 bucks for everything without a drink). Highly recommended!
