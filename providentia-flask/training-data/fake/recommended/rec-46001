I cannot agree with the rest of the reviews on this site.  I had delivery. It was quick & friendly, but the wings were the worse I've ever had. They tasted like they were boiled & the sauce had no flavor.   If u live in Montclair Tinga Taqueria in Upper Montclair has much better wings & they deliver!!
