Came here for Sunday breakfast, there was a 20minute wait for a table for two, it wasn't so bad. They called us right on time 20mins later. But when we got sat our server took pretty long take our order and he took another table that got seated after us, it was annoying because we were ready to place our order. Finally after he took the other tables order he came to take ours, he was pretty friendly, he was obviously busy running around since it looked like he got seated with 3 tables around the same time and he was sweating. Our food took a little longer then expected and my meal was a little warm, I could tell it was probably sitting there. So that def could've been better, the lemonade was fresh. Once the server gave us the check, it took about 2 minutes and another server asked if we wanted them to take our check and they came back with the change, so we didn't even see our server after he dropped the check. Would def go back, but I expected more customer service.
