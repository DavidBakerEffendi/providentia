Chop Chop is damn tasty! I live around the corner and have been frequenting the shop for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I have had pretty much everything on the menu at this point and have honestly enjoyed it all. I also like that its seasonal so the menu will always stay fresh. The omelets are a favorite for breakfast, and have nice pieces of roasted garlic and fresh herbs. The french toast is super great too. The pressed chicken and lobster roll are fantastic for lunch on those tasty pretzel rolls, and the lobster ragu for dinner is just.... ermahgerd. so good. I could pretty much go through the whole menu and talk about how much I love it, but you should go try it yourself. Its worth it, and super affordable for the quality and amount of food you get. To make it even better, everyone who works there is super nice and conversational. Its so comfortable you feel like you are going to your friends for brekky, but Chop Chop has better food and coffee than your friend.
