Love this place! Try the roast corn, rolled in parmesan and spices. Good mojitos and margs. Great little bench in front to watch the world go by. Reasonable prices. Some cool green innovations like the bicycle powered blender. The patio is wonderful when the weather permits. I met one of my best friends from Brooklyn here!
