These sandwiches are to die for.  I have been there about 5 times over the last month, and it has been consistent every time.  I've had the Grilled Chopped Chicken, Grilled Pork Patties, and Zon Sandwiches, each amazing. Fresh ingredients and very flavorful. The reason this stands out a little more than Nicky's, the other top dog in East Village, the bread, and the size. The bread they use is perfect, not too tough and easy to get through. The size of these things are huge.  You can have half for lunch, and then half for dinner, or just share one.   The place is tiny, so get it to go, or delivery, or go there in the middle of the day on a Monday.
