Right when we entered, the restaurant was beaming with great service. I loved how the entrance led into the coat check area, which led into the bar, rather than into the dining area. I know I enjoyed eating my meal without having people entering and leaving the main restaurant during my meal. The best part of the restaurant was its classy decor and ambiance. The lighting and great crowds really made my dining experience oh so much more better. When we were led to our table, we (a pretty sizeable group of 10) were constantly doted on by our waiter. Not doted, more like nonstop jabber. He tended to our needs, but kept on suggesting foods that we clearly had no interest in. For the prices, the food is definitely overpriced, (or as our waiter said, the each mezza is the size of your fist and designed for sharing), but they all were amazing (if you're on a budget, aka, a student, dont come to the restaurant expecting to be filled by what you order). The lamb ribs had soft meat, the kafta was a bit salty but perfectly marinated. The rice was nicely fluffy and had a perfect amount of nuts. We were excited for the four orders of Â chicken shish taouk because of the glowing yelp reviews. Most probably it just wasnt served and made well when we dined, because by the time it came to our table, it was cold, lost its flavor, and looked a bit unappetizing. It was mediocre compared to the lamb ribs and kafta. I would come back for the beautiful setting and pretty amazing food.
