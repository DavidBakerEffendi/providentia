Ignore those bad reviews. Follow these steps & order any one of these dishes & you won't be disappointed: -Scrambled eggs, SERIOUSLY -Roasted octopus with the incredible orange flavor -Charred carrots. #justdoit -Roasted cauliflower (only if you enjoy spice) -Kale & wild mushroom paella-wow...even if you're not vegetarian & don't enjoy meatless dishes -Tarragon chicken - so moist & perfectly cooked just as chicken should be -Duck with pomegranate ...texturally it was delicious -Crab risotto...plentiful crab with a delicious crunch of something sprinkled on top. Really enjoyable To sum up our least favorites were the rabbit, duck & risotto...however that is no way touting those dishes as bad. There really are just too many incredible dishes to choose from & I stand firm with my claim that this is NYC's hottest restaurant right now. The depth of flavors are just simply outstanding. Ps the talented mixologists will happily craft you a fabulous off the menu cocktail too!
