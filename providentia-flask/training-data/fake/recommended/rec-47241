This is definitely a perfect place for drinks with friends, girl's night out, or even for a casual date.  This place gets crowed quickly, so you might have to wait for a while (30+ mins on busy nights).  I ordered the chargrilled burger, and unfortunately, it was way too salty.  The saltiness was so overwhelming that I could not enjoy the flavor of the burger or the fries :(
