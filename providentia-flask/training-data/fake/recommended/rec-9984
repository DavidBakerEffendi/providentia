Very cute, intimate restaurant. Wait staff was super attentive. Ordered a bottle of wine (overpriced for the quality) and started with a watermelon salad and crab cakes. My bf had the crispy duck and I had the dry spice rubbed pork chop. The duck was tender with crispy skin and cooked to a perfect medium. The pork chop had great flavor, but was a bit tough. However, the crispy bacon, mushrooms, white beans and watercress on the bottom of the pork chop were delicious! We shared a side of julienned beets, which pleased our palate. Had a meyer lemon bar for dessert...let's just say, I'm still thinking about it right now. Overall, good food and great service. We'll be back!
