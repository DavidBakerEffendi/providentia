I'm a super fan of Hot dogs, like a SUPER fan, most specifically I am a super fan of really yummy VEG hot dogs. Yes I know, it's quite rare to find a REALLY good veg hot dog, and unfortunately hot diggity failed with their veg hot dog. I got this chili hot dog ( they also have veg chili =D) and everything on the dog was good, except the hot dog, which typically you think one bad thing won't ruin it all, but the bad part was the HOT DOG! I mean the CORE of the meal.. *sigh* I give this place 3 stars because I love that they offer a veg option, their uniqueness and the super pleasant staff , but if you're a veg head like me, I would not recommend their dogs.. I may go back , to try the fries, since I hear such great things about those sauces.
