Carribbean food is almost impossible to find in my hometown of Phoenix (along with decent Thai, a flourishing live music scene and respectable politicians). When my favorite cookbook author mentioned this place on her blog, I made sure to bookmark it for my upcoming NYC trip. My sister and I trekked over here after shopping at Brooklyn Flea. The customer service was very "New York." When we arrived, we were told they weren't open because a wedding was going on upstairs. We asked if we could take out, and they were like, "Duh, of course." So we ordered the veggie curry and plantains, and they were like, "Those plantains aren't happening. Not enough burners on the stove." It turned out to be a blessing though because the curry, rice and cabbage was more than enough for the two of us, and it was magically delicious. All for $10! Who knew cabbage could be so tasty? The gravy for the curry was so creamy, and the rice and pigeon peas reminded me of something my Puerto Rican grandma would make. I'd happily come back again during my next trip especially when the weather is nice enough to eat in the park.
