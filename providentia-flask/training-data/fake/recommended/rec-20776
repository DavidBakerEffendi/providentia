The bistro burger ( bacon cheese burger) hit the spot. The patty is juicy and generous. Not a lot of frills, but just an excellent burger. The fries were also excellent. Very much like crispy McDonald's fries which is a plus in my book. We tried the chilli cheese fries which were too soggy. My husband tried the chilli cheeseburger which he enjoyed although it was so messy that it had to be eaten with a fork and knife. Simple and excellent meal.
