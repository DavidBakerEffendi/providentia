A big steamy window with warm lighting and a smoking grill is what caught my attention turning off of Saint Marks onto Second. In the dreary Winter this haven was affordable and the quality of the skirt steak meat neatly cut and prepped in the quaint but clean kitchen just past the dining stools and wooden counters only suited for 6-10 total. The thing that made this place extra special is that the owner Matthew, a tall log of a man Mustache and sleeves rolled up was present and manning the register, closest to the door! BRRR!!! but that's but all he had his main line cook teaching a younger cook the assembly order, quality control. And also 2 prep cooks in the kitchen.  One fellow was peeling the stomach lining off the strips of fresh skirt steak.  A Uruguay and Argentine specialty. Any how a glass in hand and a many Cheers to this place becoming a staple in your diet!
