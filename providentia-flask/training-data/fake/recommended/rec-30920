score one for the little  guys--this places call to transition from wholesale to a local consumer facing establishment certainly counts as a win for the average person--in that we can have this fantastic food  near daily, and my wallet fears I might do just that. From the friendly salesgirl at the window, to the last crumb i scraped off the paper my sandwich and scone came rapped in, this was a fantastic dining experience. I'm near certain no other part of NYC or any city has quite as many unique innovative and fantastic dining options as this little slip of Clinton Hill/Bedstuy, truly a joy to be living here and to have watched the area evolve. Go here and do it often, I know I'll be back!
