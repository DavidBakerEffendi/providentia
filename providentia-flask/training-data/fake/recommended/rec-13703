Got a monster craving for mussels and $17 to spare? Â Head to The Smith where your money will buy you a bowl--or more like a cauldron--of mussels swimming in what I can only describe as buttery heaven in broth form. *cries a tear of joy* And the tastiness doesn't stop there...the dish also comes with a side of skinny fries to use to sop up the delicious broth (though the fries themselves are mighty tasty alone).
