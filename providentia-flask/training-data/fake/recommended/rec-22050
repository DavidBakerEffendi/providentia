Another great dinner: Duck sausage is a savory song on the tongue, like a yummy wonton making love to your taste buds, so good! Then the escargot always a winner, beet salad & cuttlefish special very good. Skate meuniere (sp?) was a little bland. Service a little off but forgivable very busy tonight. On a Monday no less! Drinks were tasty & strong.
