My friends and I are always in search of a good cucumber flavored cocktail and speakeasy drinks cheaper than those of The Campbell Apartment.  This cucumber cocktail is sweet and also the liquor tastes strong, $10 is a powerful motivator compared to the similarly flavored drinks from other places that get it right (Death and Company's Midnight Sun and PDT's Badminton).  Their oysters are fresh and the small sturgeon dish is also of good quality with creamy potatoes on top, but piled sky high with some feathery greens that need to go.  This place is too expensive for what it is, though.  It's not quite a bar, its tables scream dinner rather than private cocktail party, the bar is propelled in the front where everyone can see the George Bataille quote tattooed on your "back."  Neither is it a place where you can get your fill on entrees or exclusively eat appetizers.  For every expensive place in Brooklyn, there are two cheaper ones of equal or better quality.  I know this because I was still hungry and somewhat broke when we left here and headed to Momo in Bushwick where I ate my fill of outstanding and still five dollar sushi.  I could have sturgeon anywhere.
