Chicken meatballs is all I have to say. If you are a traditional meatball lover and refuse to convert, please come eat here and you will be.  They are moist and delicious and the pesto dipping sauce will send you over the edge.  Reasonable prices and a very quaint environment make this place a trendy spot to enjoy some poultry balls of meat.
