I liked this place alot. The salad bar was good, the meat was good but tasted the same more or less, the desserts were good except for the fruit creme (i think this was the name) it just tasted like melted ice cream not to be confused with the creme brulee which was quite good. Two things, alot of the stuff they bring out isn't well done so you have to request well done all the time and if you want them to bring back something in particular then be prepared to wait forever, oh and the side dishes are just alright. I actually ran into a well known actor here!
