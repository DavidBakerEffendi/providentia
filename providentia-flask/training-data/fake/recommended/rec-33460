We had tried going here last time but it was too crowded so we came back on a Saturday when it wasn't too crowded yet instead of going to our usual and delicious place. I had four people in my party and we all ordered different things. There were two tables that ordered at the same time as us, one right before and one right afterwards. The table next to us that had 2 people ordered received their food pretty quickly and we were like all right! us next! and then the table on our other side with 4 people that ordered awhile after us got their food! We still patiently waited. Eventually the people all around us were done with their food, and had the checks and paid for them. During this entire 30-45 min period, we did not see our waitress come to us once in this tiny restaurant. We tried fruitlessly to flag her down but she was quite determined to chat up other customers, stand by the bar and chat with the people working there or disappear into the back. We finally got our food and all the people who had come in at the same time or after us had now paid their check, eaten their chocolate, and left. We got the spanish omelette, the parmasean toast, lamb sandwich and egg polenta. Everything was good, but not amazing or even pretty good. The best thing I had was probably my fresh squeezed orange juice. The polenta was so bland I had to add salt and pepper with gusto. We saw our waitress three times in an hour and a half. Once to take our order, twice to be there when our food was finally brought out, and the third time to take our check. Pretty disappointed and will be trying out other places in the area for sure instead of coming back.
