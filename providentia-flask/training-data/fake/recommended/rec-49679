My friends and I have travelled throughout the tri-state area to find the best sportsbars for NFL games, it doesnt get better than Miami Mikes. Every game is on, Mike has them songs programed for all team and supports all fans, not just miami fans. Â You need to experience Miami Mikes on a Sunday during football season. TIP - if you're travelling far to get to Miami Mikes (i come from queens) and want to stay at the hotel, ask Mike for the Miami Mikes hotel rate.
