Incredibly slow and inefficient. A staff of dozens present but no visible manager, most of them wandering aimlessly on a busy Sat night. It's been an hour and I still don't have my main course, although apps and salads showed up pretty much on top of each other. Tried to check in via Yelp multiple times sitting at table and parking lot to be told I'm too far away (I think its blocked.) Bar service pitifully slow. Apparently it was too cold for the hostess because she threw on an Eagles sweatshirt. Nice and professional, that. Watched a couple next to us start to steam trying to pay their tab for over 15 minutes with no sign of their server and everyone else avoiding eye contact. Way disappointed, whomever is running the show there needs to be fired.
