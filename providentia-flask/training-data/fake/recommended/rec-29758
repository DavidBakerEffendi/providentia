We had my wife's baby shower/brunch with a group of about 25 friends at the Counting Room last week.  It was a perfect venue for what we wanted:  a relaxed gathering among friends, good food, nice space and attentive staff.  Best of all, the management gave us the entire space even though they definitely could have seated other guests. Its high ceilings with the large open windows was perfect for the summer.  We ordered several snacks, salads and sandwiches.  Everyone loved the deviled eggs.  People were popping them in their mouths like candy, we had to order extra.  The bench-style and bar-seating arrangements were great for our group, especially for our friends' kids.   Overall the venue is great for gatherings without pretense and for spending quality time/hanging out with your friends.  Highly recommend!!!
