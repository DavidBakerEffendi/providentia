Nomad's is huge and has plenty to keep you occupied. They offer laser tag, black light mini golf, mini bowling, pool, arcade games, a climbing wall, two full size basketball courts, a cafe and possibly more that I didn't notice. Certain things are kind of expensive, but what isn't these days? Laser tag is $7.75/person for 15 minutes which I think is kind of a ripoff. But I don't have anything to compare it to, so maybe that is an OK price. Overall this is definitely a place to check out at least once.
