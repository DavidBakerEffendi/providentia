I had the pleasure to discover O'Cabanon yesterday and was not disappointed at all! The a√Øoli was so perfectly cooked it reminded me of my grandmother's recipe - she's from Provence, France - and the pairing wine was gorgeous. Being French, I usually try to avoid French themed restaurants, as I'm always disappointed, but I think I just found my new "cantine".
