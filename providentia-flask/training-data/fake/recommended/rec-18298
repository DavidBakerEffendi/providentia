We came here for lunch and had the potato and mushroom pamboza and roasted open faced chicken sandwich.  The pamboza was a little too spicy for me (I can tolerate low-medium heat), but the flavor was good.  My husband loved the open faced sandwich.  Great beer selection, nice clean place with friendly service.  It was easy to park.  Next time I'll try the sardine sandwich.
