We ended up at Melograno by accident! headed to Mercato but suddenly forgot the name.  We enjoyed our meal with our 12 year old daughter but the place is much too loud to hear across the table.   My husband loved his fried bread and cheese appetizer (a take on pizza turnover) and I enjoyed the pear carpaccio but the shaved pecorino was stingy.  I thought the wild boar bolognese was tasty but for a pasta dish a fairly small portion for the price.  My daughter liked but didnt love her spaghetti carbonara.  Hubby polished off the yummy lamb chop special with crispy potatoes and asparagus.  The bread was average as was the service. Not sure we'd go back because of the noisiness.
