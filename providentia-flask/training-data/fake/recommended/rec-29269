Have been in search of a great Roast Beef ever since my favorite Beef n Beer joint in Jersey burnt down. What a loss for me! This place is as close as I have come to yet. Yes I know they are known for their Roast Pork. But I save that for John's. The beef with sharp provolone and greens is delicious. Great quality ingredients and cooked to perfection! Just the right amount of Salty and Savory in each bite. The counter people are hit or miss. Once and awhile they seem a bit grumpy. Deal with it - grab your sandwich and enjoy. It's worth the trouble of the wait and staff.
