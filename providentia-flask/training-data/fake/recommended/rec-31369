This is one of my top restaurants in new york especially because it is extremely vegetarian friendly. All the items we ordered were outstanding. Hommus Mouhmara- delicious - very flavorful! tastes great with pita bread Falafel- its not the regular wrap which i was expecting- its like crispy and comes in rectangles. We got both Batata Harra and Phoenician Fries- since they are so similar in flavor i would recommend getting one of them. The dip with the fries is so good!! The star in this category was Arnabeet Mekle- it was just so good! the sauce on this was yummy! We also got the semolina gnocchi which was yummy as well! The portions are large enough to be shared which is great if you come in a group! also lets you try different items on the menu! For dessert we tried the Strawberry Rhubarb Cheesecake which was alright. It wasnt that intense in flavor. We also got the ilili candy bar which which worked perfect with the salted caramel icecream! For drinks- try the Cucumber Lemonade!
