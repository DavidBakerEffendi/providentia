Last night the gf and I headed to Osteria so she could finally check it out. It started off on not such a great note. OPur table was right next to the server station  - my gf could not see anything around server station and I had to face a wall and have servers literally on top of me all night as they entered their orders. I will say though the service was outstanding the entire night.   SO onto the food. We started with a 14 month aged proscuitto that was an addition for the night. I was definitely surprised with the amount they gave you - extremely generous. Next, we has the parma pizza which was pretty damn good - maybe a little too thin. I personally still think Zavino has the most authentic pizza in the city but this is a close 2nd. After the pizza came our pasta dishes. My gf had a pasta with a wild board ragu which was very flavorful. /Unfortunaltely the sausage ravioli I ordered was extremely bland. My dish was so overpowered by the parm on top of the ravioli that was all I could taste - well except for the one bite that was nothing but black pepper. The ravioli were definitly the low point of the night. The deserts we had were pretty good. I had an apple and riccota strusle (im sure I spelled that wrong) and my gf had one of the chocolate deserts. It was surprising to see Marc Vetri hanging out at the bar. All in all it was good but nothing amazing. Definitely over priced for certain things. Next time I will do what I was told by friends, just sit at the bar and get a pizza.
