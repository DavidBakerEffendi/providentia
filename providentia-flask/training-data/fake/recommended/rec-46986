This place is adorable.  This place is delicious.  This place is always busy (two empty tables at 10:30am on a Monday?).   Portions are huge, and delicious.  However, it also comes with a price tag.  I got the Challah french toast - the unstuffed version.  Would you like strawberries AND blueberries?  Sure, for $1 each.  Oh, you want syrup for your french toast?  $1 extra.  SERIOUSLY?!??  Thanks for dropping that bomb on me with the check, guy. Also, my boyfriend ordered a sandwich that had an option of a side salad.  Someone misunderstood and brought a full size salad, with a full size $12 price tag.   I wouldn't have minded paying for it if half the food wasn't left on the table, but it just seemed a bit unprofessional.
