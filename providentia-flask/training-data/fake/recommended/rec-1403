We came here shortly after they first opened. The food was excellent; I was totally not expecting this level of food out of an open-air BYOB with the menu on a chalkboard. At least with what we ordered, I can't deduct any points for quality of food. That said, there were a few things I would do to improve: first off, print some real menus! You're doing a disservice to your food by not at least printing a daily menu on an inkjet. Second, the service was slow even though the place was nowhere near full. This was made even more obvious because by the time we got seated, we had already perused the chalkboard menu and were ready to order. Anyway, I'm willing to forgive this since the place is so new. Food this good is hard to do; the service and menus are easy to fix. Will definitely head back.
