Before visiting Philly, I had already decided a trip to Tommy DiNic's was in my cards.  I had seen the pork sandwich advertised on the food network and needed to give it a try.   Reading Terminal is an awesome place, especially if you like farmer's markets.  It's not as big a market as you'll find in Seattle, but they do a good job of bringing in all kinds of vendors and at reasonable prices.  Tommy DiNic's is one of the more popular places, and at 11 am on a Saturday there was a pretty long line.  That being said, it moved relatively quickly and there was plenty of staff around to take and prepare orders. I decided to order the original pork sandwich without cheese or rabe.  My husband thought I was crazy to forgo the toppings.  However, after biting into the sandwich, we both agreed that it didn't need anything!  This restaurant has found a way to make roasted pork juicy and succulent and flavorful.  The meat is amazing.  You can taste the garlic, rosemary, thyme and pepper, but they're not overwhelming.  They are perfect.  The pork practically sings in this sandwich.  I cannot finish the sandwich review without mentioning the bread.  Overall, we've found bread in Philadelphia to be well above average, and Tommy DiNic's is no exception.  The roll was delicious, firm, chewy, and exactly what it needed to be. I highly recommend the pork sandwich- suck it up and wait on the line.  It will be worthwhile!
