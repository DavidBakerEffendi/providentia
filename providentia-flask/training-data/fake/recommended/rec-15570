We stumbled upon Ivy while looking for a place close to our hotel to get drinks before dinner that wasn't a total tourist trap. Ivy beyond delivered. First of all, the Happy Hour Specials were awesome. We were there on a Sunday, so happy hour isn't always a sure thing for weekends, but Ivy still had several $5 wines and beers and some $6 cocktails. I had a Bohemian Rhapsody and prosecco, and both were great. It was my friend's birthday (which she not so casually mentioned to the bartender), and they brought her out a free dessert. It was some kind of chocolate pie/cheesecake, and it was really good. Speaking of the bartenders, they were both great. Super friendly and attentive, which can definitely be hard to find in midtown. Ivy is really cute inside. Take a look up at the ceiling when you go - it's awesome. There's plenty of seating at the bar and at various lounge tables of different heights. We didn't eat anything other than the dessert since we were headed to dinner afterward, but everything coming out of the kitchen smelled amazing. I would definitely recommend Ivy as a happy hour destination, or somewhere to go early in the evening if you actually want to be able to talk to the people you're with. It's a gem among the flotsam and jetsam of tourist traps!
