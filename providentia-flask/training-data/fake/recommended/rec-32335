Went Saturday afternoon with my wife for a late lunch...super freindly staff, pretty attentive...the burgers where really good, second best I've had (sketch is best)...short rib cheese fries, the reason to go back over and over...but only if I become independently wealthy, holy shit this place is fuckin expensive!
