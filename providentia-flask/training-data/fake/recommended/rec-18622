Overpriced for what it is. Yes, flavors are unique, but you can't charge $17 for a bowl of plain noodles with 4 small shrimp and 2 pieces of pork about the size of a quarter.  Ps--you're all about money, not food, if your restaurant has no tables for 2 people.  Ribs were hearty.  Stick with corn and ribs (or just go to a BBQ :)
