It's easy to miss this shop, as it's next to a more prominent, better-known chain (Le Pain Quotidien), but if you're in the mood for some Italian-minded sandwiches, this is a great choice to stop by and have a bite. There's not a heck of a lot of space to eat inside - one high-top table and a few seats along the countertop - so if it's crowded, definitely plan on taking your food to go. That said, if you can stay, it's very laid back, and your food gets brought out to you on a cutting board with plenty of space for the food you've ordered. I will also say I appreciate that Peroni is not the only Italian beer around, and that the Moretti is a superior alternative on all counts. As for the sandwiches - they're pretty straightforward, but they are oh so delicious. I went with the Capri, which is very much what you would think it is - buffalo mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes drizzled lightly with olive oil. It's very fresh, and the buffalo mozzarella is of a superior quality; it melts right in your mouth. It also pairs well in the other sandwich that we had, the Paestum. The prosciutto, with its slightly aged flavor and its chewiness, is a perfect complement to the mozzarella, and combined with a fresh baguette or ciabatta, is a delight to have a bite of. It's hard to argue with getting a sandwich and beer for $14, even if it does feel slightly overpriced. The food here is phenomenally done, and the folks behind the counter are very friendly, even if there was a bit lost in translation when we were ordering. Although it's close to one of my favorite sandwich spots in the area (Num Pang), I'd definitely come back again.
