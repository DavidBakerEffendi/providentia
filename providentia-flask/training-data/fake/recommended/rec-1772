For my 400th review, I'm dedicating all of this little white space to the Reading Terminal Market. Go to Philly. Find your niche. Raw, pure honey. Check. Quality, local wines.  Check. Home-style wings.  Check. Donuts.  Doughnuts.  Check. Pulled pork.  Check. This place will appeal to any and every sense. Global cuisines.  American eats.  Local crafts.  Wild herbs.  Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. I am a Libra.  I cannot choose.  Variety anxiety.  That's a new one I just made up. Self-diagnosis. Sigh. I'll be back in a few months.
