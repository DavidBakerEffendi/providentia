The restaurant has an intimate and sexy vibe. It is a great place for a first date. The service is great. For Appetizers: 1. Hommos with Jalapenos is delicious, especially if you like your food spicy. 2. Raheb Batinjaan eggplant, fresh mint, tomato, olive oil. This dish was recommended by the waitress and it was much better then the Baba Ghannouj. The beauty of the dish is that it does not even taste like eggplant especially for those who are not fond of it. This dish is definitely worth trying. 3. Tabbouleh parsley, fresh mint, tomato, burghul. This was a solid dish.     Entrees: We had the Lamb and Chicken kebabs which were cooked perfectly. Overall a great restaurant in the Flatiron area.
