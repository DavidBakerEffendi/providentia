I enjoyed this place when it 1st opened. We have always enjoyed the time spent here. However, the last time we dined tin the restaurant we brought another couple only 3 orders came out together we waited an additional 15 minutes for the last meal to out which was a simple burger done med-rare. Finally after a month my wife and I called in an order lobster Mac and a DLT sandwich. I was told 20 minutes it was a Tuesday at 4:00. I got there bartender stated it was coming out in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later I was asked what I ordered figuring it was ready and I would cash out. I was wrong, apparently they never placed the order. The bartender said the kitchen staff accidentally dropped something and was replacing it for the order, a second waiter asked if was here for lobster Mac. Turns out the bartender never put the order in.
