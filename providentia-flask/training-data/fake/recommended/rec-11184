LOVE this place.  great first date restaurant, if you know your date is also a carnivore ;)  GREAT wine list, as well.  the staff is my favourite part.  very attentive.  they make you feel like a celebrity (lol it's true though) there is never something that is too much to ask of them. they will get you anything you want.  i loved it. BEST service in the whole city i swear. oh and i havent even gotten to the food yet.  yes this place can stand on good service alone but the food is TO DIE FOR.  not for veggie heads.  this is strict carnivore territory.  and i love it.  i could go on and on about how much i love this place, you just need to go.  make reservations! and go at lunch to save money BUT it is nice to go at night.. feels really special at night :)  bring a date and clean out your bank account!!! :D
