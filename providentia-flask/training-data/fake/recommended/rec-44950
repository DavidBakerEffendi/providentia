I cannot wait to come back to this place!!! Best Italian in NYC!! My favorite be the Braised Beef Braciole- Homemade goodness!! baked Clams cooked perfectly along with the Stuffed Artichoke!! I had the Spaghetti and Meatballs for dinner and the Meatballs were perfect!! We also got a classic pizza for the table and it was great at first i thought it was going to be too saucy but it was really good!! The service was great he just kept making sure we were happy and full!!
