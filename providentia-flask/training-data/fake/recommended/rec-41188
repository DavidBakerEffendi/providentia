What can I say about Chuko that hasn't already been said before. The bone marrow is great, amazing and seriously comforting. The broth is exquisite - definitely within your first bite, you get a sense of balance. And of course, we cannot forget the fried brussels sprout with its salty briny sauce with pickled peppers (could have these for breakfast). The only downside to this joint is; its cash only and sometimes the wait is really really long, but worth it.. The menu is simple and to the point, which is exactly why a place like this can exist and thrive, do one thing you do perfectly and they will come.
