I found this place while on a Yelp search for Pho. The reviews looked great so I figured I'd check it out! As a vegetarian it can be a bit difficult to find Pho restaurants that work. I've noticed that most Pho restaurants I go to have an option (sometimes an off-the-menu one), but that was not the case at Obao. I tried not to let this get me down, though! We started with the vegetable dumplings and they were delicious! Both of my friends ordered the Pho Bo and had nothing but good things to say about it, but I ordered the Papaya Pad Thai and I wasn't too impressed! The shrimp was great but there was a burnt-like taste to the noodles that I couldn't quite figure out. Overall, the experience was an okay one-- the service was great and the ambiance was pretty cool! I just wish I had been more impressed with my meal.
