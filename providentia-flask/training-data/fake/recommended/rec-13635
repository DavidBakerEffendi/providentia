As a former "new yorker" one of the things I miss most is brunch. It's amazing to me how much of a ritual it is and how uniquely important it is in New York. Now that I've lived there and experienced it, I now see why it's so important and Jane is one of the reasons that I believe. I am a big eggs benedict person and Jane definitely masters it, offering its patrons several variations. By far, my favorite was the Benedict Jane which had a poached egg on top of a crab and crawfish cake. DELICIOUS. It's such a nice savory treat. A bit heavy, but definitely worth it. Well seasoned, well balanced and definitely worthy of being classified as a comfort food. Plus it comes with home fries and a complimentary cocktail. Did someone say peach bellini? This place is far better than Norma's. A definite must!
