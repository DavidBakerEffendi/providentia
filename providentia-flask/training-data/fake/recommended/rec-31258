Spiciest hot sauce in all of Midtown. I'm West Indian so I can properly gauge how hot "peppa sauce" is. Rice is always delicious but that is where it goes downhill. The chicken is always bland and flavorless to me no matter how much I drench it in sauce. These guys give you a ton of food for $6, the line moves quickly and the food is ok. There are much better street meat carts in Manhattan like Kwik Meal. Occasionally when I work super late I'll grab a bite from here but for the most part I think the cart is just hype.
