My cousin is crazy about crepes. So, I set out on a mission to find a place for us to get our foodie on. I found this place (here on yelp) looked up the menu and it looked perfect. We set out on our adventure. Once we get there we find this cute little place. The menu is interesting and intriguing. I ordered the shrimp avocado as recommended by one of the staff. It was very tasty. I liked how the flavors came together well without them getting tangled with each other. What i didn't like was how expensive they are. After eating the one crepe I was still hungry. Thats not something I still want to feel after eating. I was debating order seconds but i passed. The establishment is tiny, almost no seating inside and outside they have Â couple of benches on the side walk. I'd come back, but only because I really want to try Azuki Berries crepe.
