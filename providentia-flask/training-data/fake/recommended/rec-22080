The Saint Austere, while tasty and chic, is incredibly overpriced for such a minuscule amount of food. The whole "family style" they tote openly about their restaurant is utterly ridiculous. Also, if you make reservations for a group, make absolute certain that these folks are coming because you will be charged $15 for every person that does not show up.
