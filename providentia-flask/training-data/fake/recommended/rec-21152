The people who work here are really mean.  Even the busboys. I once overheard a conversation between the bartender and a patron that went like this: Patron (scanning the drinks menu on the wall behind the bar): Do you have any drinks specials? Bartender: If these prices aren't cheap enough for you, maybe you should go someplace else. I think they try to play up the rudeness.  Either that, or these people are just mean.  Once, the waiter brought a plate of fries to our table.  Rather than inquire as to who had ordered it, when I asked aloud who had asked for fries, the waiter just threw the plate on the table and walked away with a disgusted sneer. I once came here with somebody, and we argued the entire time.  We enjoyed our burgers, but the argumentativeness of the experience made me depressed. Come for the burgers.  Don't come for good service, friendly people, a nice atmosphere or bathrooms that don't look like locations from the movie Seven. I've never understood why people in New York put up with things like this.  We pride ourselves on being sophisticated and much more savvy than our suburban and urban counterparts, but we wait on endless lines, put up with meanness and accept questionably clean bathrooms. Still, I'm going to Corner Bistro next week.
