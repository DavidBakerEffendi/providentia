I have never had even close to a bad meal at this lovely northern italian restaurant.  From the simplicity of its decor,  the knowledge of their staff to the menu of perfectly priced dishes....i love this place.  Don't let yelpers be the judge though, i just read in Travel & Leisure that this restaurant was named top 32 in the country for Italian restaurants.  Doesn't surprise me!  The Bolognese is by far the best i've ever had and the duck is done to perfection.
