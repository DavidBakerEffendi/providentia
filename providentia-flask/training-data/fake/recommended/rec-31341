I am a connoisseur of French fries, well at least I think I am and Pommes Frites has left me sooo disappointed. Pommes Frites, you have one sole ingredient to make.  It's not like when I entered your place of establishment that there was a line out the door at any point.  So I ask, 'why is it that when I ordered my Pommes that they were slightly undercooked?' How is it possible that a twice fried potato ends up just on the right side of done? What was the haste of taking them out of the fryer under the suggested frying time? I believed the hype and bookmarked this spot quite some time ago and now I am in total agreement with the majority of reviewers that the absolute best part of the Pommes Frites experience are the sauces. Thank you Pomme Frites for making my experience an underwhelming one, 'cause if this single concept eatery can't get this sole ingredient right the first time, then what's the point. So for me, it only takes one visit and now when I'm in the mood I'll go else where for my pommes frite craving.
