The other night I decided to give London another try.  My decision is made.  The service is consistently below par and the food is inconsistent. If you are in the mood for an expensive burger you found your place (but for a good burger a block away try Rembrandt's).  If you are in the mood for a nice meal, receiving what you ordered, or food and drink in a timely fashion I highly suggest trying the other restaurants in Fairmount (Illuminare, Rembrandts, Zorba's).
