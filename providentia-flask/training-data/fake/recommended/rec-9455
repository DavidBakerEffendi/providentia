Been wanting to come here for ages but every time there is at least a 2 hour line. But luckily I arrived in the city around 4:30 on a Tuesday and went straight to Ippudo to meet up with a friend since they open at 5:00. We were the first ones in the restaurant!!! I had the Classic Shiromaru Hakata Ramen with an added topping of soft boiled egg. Don't get me wrong, the ramen was wonderful! But I think my expectations might be a bit too high before I got here so I wasn't absolutely blown away. The ramen itself was very savory. The soup base was really really good. The pork was very tender where it almost melts in your mouth. The egg is cooked to just the right consistency where the yolk is half-way liquid to solid. The reason I give it a 3 is because personally I find it not really worth all the hype that you see on yelp. It's also a bit overpriced (which I know is nothing new in NYC but still...$17 plus tax on a bowl of ramen...common) Although I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again to try some of their other ramen and appetizer dishes. With all that said, welp, I'm glad I tried it at least once!
