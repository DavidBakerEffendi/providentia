Wow, I can't believe people are so into this place.  I got the Shack Stack (burger with the fried portobella).  I thought it was lacking flavor on top of being well done and small.  Has this place heard of seasoning?  The fries were pretty much tasteless too.  I should have known after seeing how many kids were in the restaurant.  If there are a lot of kids in the restaurant, the food is generally nothing to write home about.   On the positive side, they had some great root beer by Abita on draft and the staff was really friendly.  Unfortunately the positive don't outweigh the negatives so I won't be back.  I would much rather spend three times as much for food that is ten times as good right across the street at Village Whiskey.
