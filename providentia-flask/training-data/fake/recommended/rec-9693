I have ordered out from Pio Pio many times. But this was my first time dining in. The food is good, but it is pretty pricy for rotisserie chicken. We were seated across from the bar on the upper level next to the entrance to the kitchen - not the best ambiance. Despite our location, The service was pretty slow and it took our waiter a long time to take our order. After we got our food our water was never refilled, and we were never offered a second round of drinks. With all the great restaurants in HK -- I most likely will not return.
