Only reason i gave this place a 3 is because of the location and setting really nice almost as if your having dinner in a cabin.   Now as for the food ive been to a few authentic peruvian places out of the city in the hartford ct area and the food was excellent very affordable.the food here was disappointing i ordered a lomo saltado and what they gave me looked like pepper steak with a few fries for almost 30 bucks ive paid way less for the actual dish at places like flor de mayo.i also had a pitcher of sangria which i felt shorted on 15 bucks for a half a pitcher insane and lets not talk about the shortage of fruit.will there be an encore i dont think so i rather stick with flor de mayo and dont get it twisted this place is not cheap. if you only go to a place for  the roasted chicken you probly eat at the same places
