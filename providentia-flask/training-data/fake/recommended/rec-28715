This is one of my favorite places in the city! I've eaten here 4-5 times now (more often than any other restaurant I've been to in the area) and I have yet to have a subpar experience. The service has always been friendly and speedy. The food is excellent! The menu has a wide variety of foods: from risotto and penne to shwarma to traditional African dishes. Usually I'm cautious of places that don't specialize in just one type of cuisine, but this place seems to execute everything very well. This place seems like I well-kept secret since I never have to wait for a table. I highly recommend the truffle macaroni and cheese and the lamb burger. I will continue to go back often!
