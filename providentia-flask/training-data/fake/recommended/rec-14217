This place is amazing, we showed up at 10:45(ish) and had a 1.5 hour wait... I ordered the potato pancakes which were amazing. I loved the carmalized applesauce that you eat with them. I loved all my food, my only regret was that I couldnt have ordered everything I would have liked. It all looked soo good. My friend ordered the banana nut pancakes which were also very good, although I think the potato pancakes beat them out. My mom had been here awhile ago (on a Wednesday) and said that they had lemon ginger pancakes then. I would have loved to try that, I was told they were absolutely amazing! Definately a place I will be coming back too, despite the wait...
