Worth the wait!! Try the Mexican coffee (soooo good!!), huevos rancheros was the bomb!!!! And my hubby got the country breakfast (he said average). Place is super small, so be prepared to wait outside while ur waiting. Friday at 12:30 was a 50 min wait...Food came super fast though!! I'll def be back!!
