I stopped in for a quick bite before heading to a theater rehearsal. I started with the rock shrimp tempura appetizer. This was the only disappointment. While the shrimp was cooked well and were clearly fresh out of the fryer, the sauce was served on the side instead of being incorporated with the shrimp. Once dipped, the shrimp were good but I like to get in there and get them good and messy. I had the sweet potato tempura and the kamikaze roll (spicy tuna and avocado with tobiko on top) for my meal. The sweet potato tempura was still very warm (I love that) and crunchy. The spicy tuna was tasty and fresh, the avocado made it creamy and the tobiko added a little bite. Overall a really great experience. Masa 8 is cute, local place. The wait staff were great and non-intrusive, the restaurant was clean and the food came out quickly. I'd love to go back with some friends so I can try some additional dishes.
