Is it pizza? Is it crack? Hard to tell.... There is some kind of magic in Dom's hands. His pizza is totally worth the wait. If you're not willing to be patient than you shouldn't go. Everyone else is gonna roll their eyes at you. My only complaint here is the people, they are vultures. Be prepared for seat hogs that are not yet eating and just "holding" seats while others with pies hover around them. Perhaps pizza at its best brings out humanity at its worst. Great pizza though and Dom is the man!
