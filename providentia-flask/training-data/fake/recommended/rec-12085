Consistently the best, traditional pizza around! The crust has a perfect chewy-ness and a perfect thickness. We also love to top off our meal with a Rockslide (Blizzard) or a good ol VT creemee! Rocky's atmosphere is extremely casual and chock full of white, red & green decor. There are also a lot of outdoor picnic tables that are full on beautiful spring, summer & fall days with long lines at the outdoor creemee windows! Rocky, the owner, is extremely active in the community and is the one who started the Penguin Plunge to benefit Camp Ta-Kum-Ta, a camp for children with, and survivors of, cancer. If you want some delicious pizza and are in the area, stop on in. You won't be disappointed! They also do sandwiches, pizza-by-the-slice, pasta & salads. Can't speak for any of those because I'm really happy with what we get each time we go. They also deliver and you can also stop in to buy their dough for close to nothing (although we never do it justice!).
