The food was very tasty, and when they say "Burmese" they actually mean it. The menu was pretty new and interesting to someone who had never had Burmese food before. The pumpkin soup was great and had a different, delicate flavor.  My garlicky noodles were very good, and my dining partner's shrimp balachao was very good too.  Our only complaints were that, (unless you happen to be in the area) parking will cost you... and my partner, who was raised in a Burmese family, said the food could've been spicier and more flavorful.  But overall the food was very good and interesting, and we plan to go back!
