I enjoyed this restaurant quite a bit. The staff was very friendly and attentive and I love how small the dining area is. You can actually have a conversation with your Â dinner guests without having to yell over noise from hundreds of other patrons. I don't think it would be fair to comment on the food as a whole since I've only been there once, but the meals my wife and I had were both very good. I gave it 3-stars because of the price. I don't mind paying $24 for a chicken dish if I can bring home some leftovers, but my dinner was served on what would be considered a side plate at most other restaurants. Dinner for my wife and I was just under $50 (before tip) and we each had 1 soda (no drinks, apps or desserts). I enjoyed my experience and food at this restaurant. I think it's unlikely that we would return simply based on price.
