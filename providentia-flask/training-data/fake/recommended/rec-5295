I've actually never been able to dine here because each of the 3 times I have tried the hostess, with an extreme attitude, has refused to seat my party due to lack of tables. Why a restaurant would rather have an empty 4-top than seat 2 people at said table is beyond me. It is extremely frustrating considering I've heard the food is great but there is no excuse for attitude in the service industry. Luckily shake shack is right across the street.
