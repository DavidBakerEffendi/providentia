4.5ish.  Our go-to panini place in Astoria.  We've tried several of their paninis and have never been disappointed (my favorite is the speck with spicy slaw).  The cheeses and desserts are also phenomenal.  They have some kind of relationship with Murrays, so they always have some high-quality cheese platters and I believe they get their cupcakes from Crumbs.  Solid little wine list and great service too.
