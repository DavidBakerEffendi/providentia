I love coming here for lunch on week days because it's never, ever crowded. Service is always friendly and not the least bit intimidating, considering the reputation this place has. Everything on the menu is tasty; some items are strange. But it's always interesting. And, highly caloric -- so don't come here acting like you're on a diet. My personal favorite is the steamed pork buns with hoisin sauce, cucumbers and scallions ($9). You get two of them, with the most melt-in-your-mouth meat you ever had. Oct. 12th, 2010 -- I just changed my rating from the highest to the lowest. Â A visit over the summer was so-so. Then I went a few days ago and I'm officially done. Momo has lost its magic for me. I paid $25.04 for a single entree, a pork shoulder in a miso sauce with some side veggies. I used to think that no one does pork better but the strips of meat I got were salty rather than savory. The portion was smallish. The meat strips were a little too chewy rather than tender. I still left a decent tip because the room and waitstaff are as friendly as ever. But there are better, much more filling ways to spend $30. I hate to let this place go. But it will be a long time before I go back.
