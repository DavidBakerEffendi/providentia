Been there on two different occasions within two weeks that's how much I loved it. Old school Italian food made the right way. Yes it's a very simple place but it's one of those places where simple is done right. The villa salad is a must try! In regards to the decor, yeah it's a little weird but villa isn't one of this restaurants you go to to judge the light fixtures. It's a family establishment that's made a name for itself solely because of the quality of the food they serve. If you want something more upscale with a large fancy wine list this is not the place for you. Oh and don't forget to hit the ATM before you go, it's cash only and they don't have one on the premise however there's one about a block down the street closer to Washington ave.
