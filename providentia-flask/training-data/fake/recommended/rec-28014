Went here for a family lunch, and it was quite busy. We ordered the roti canai and a few lunch specials. I ordered the shrimp with lady fingers, l which was labeled as spicy, and a Thai iced tea. The ice tea was spot on, so flavorful, and perfectly strong and sweet. The chicken soup was also very flavorful. On the other hand, my plate had a few pieces of shrimp, and I feel for the size, six would have been appropriate since they were pretty small. The okra could've been cooked a little more. It was not very brown and slimy inside. It's cooked with shrimp paste which made it a little more on the salty side but lacked the spice.
