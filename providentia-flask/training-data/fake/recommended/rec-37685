Good place with really nice vibe! The staff is amazing, our waitress was nice and the food took really few minutes to arrive! We went there for my girlfriend's birthday, nice dinner in the heart of Williamsburg for four people. We got some guacamole and chips to share and some of their sharing Arepa place with different filled! I also ordered for delivery, we placed our order by phone... and was a kind of long conversation.... They should give the On-Line order option...! We took also two sidekicks : Croquetas and Yoyos! Papelon con LÃ¬mon is a nice alternative for Lemon Tea fanatic! I'll come back for sure!
