Philadelphia stop #3.   The market is worth a visit regardless of what you eat. LIke most visitors, I opted for the famous DiNic's sandwich bar. Service-  I must of got lucky because the line was short.  The woman was quite pleasant, efficient and accomodating.  She was happy to accept my last minute addition to my order.   Atmosphere- Fun market. TIght quarters.  I found a seat in the food court area.   Food-  At the recommendation of  three locals, I opted for the brisket with broccoli raab, sharp provolone and long hot peppers.  The brisket was well seasoned but a bit dry and maybe the expectation is that the greasy buttered bun would offset the dryness.  In the end, it was tasty but the soaked paper and poor mouthfeel reminded me that the excessive grease was not necessary, Overall- Fun experience but the combination of the hype and grease made it a bit underwhelming.
