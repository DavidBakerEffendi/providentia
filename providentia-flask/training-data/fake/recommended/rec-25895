The Bronte burger needs a warning!! Come on people!  This is 5th grade level essay writing basics; don't just say something is good, say WHY it's good.  Argue your point.  Persuade. So here we go: THE BONTE BURGER IS SWEET.  It has sweet chili oil on it.  The ingredients were clearly high quality, but there is no way that I would ever order it again.  Sweet and burger together is a yuck to me (unless it ketchup or BBQ sweet).  Meat is not fruit, it's MEAT. I made the mistake of skimming a few Yelp reviews and diving right in.  Learn from my mistakes and actually read the menu.  I was with a dear old friend and I just ordered what I'd heard was good and I was disappointed. The place is cute and comfy and I would come back, despite the menu being limited (they only have Coke, DC and Sprite, for example), but I will never order casually again.  That, and I'm sorry, but it's a sad sad day if this burger is in the top 5 of the city. But hey, everyone's allowed an opinion... welcome to Yelp.
