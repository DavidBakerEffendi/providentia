I've been attending gigs locally since 1981, and by far this is my current favorite location to not only catch some great local/national musical talents, but for the friendly crowd, perpetually rotating home  brewed ales, and friendly servers. Ah yes, the downside, the place is small, which means a gig can, and often does sell out. Being trapped in a small, crowded bar at a sold out gig there is not fun for me, but U make due for a great gig!!! Naturally when the place is crowded, the bar service will inevitably be reduced, so..be patient..or if you are that much of a drunkard, head downstairs to grab a few beers and bring them back upstairs with you (yes, it is allowed).       The sound at JB's is state-of-the-art. The multicolored digital lighting's back drop and stage lights are second to none in the city's small club venues. This place is a must play concert venue in Philly. I have yet to experience the first floor food, but it looks and smells appetizing.  Give it a go. There is plenty of nearby free parking, and the area has become very safe over the past few years.
