100% giving Penelope 5 stars! Bf and I went for a late lunch, hotel recommended it to us, and thank God. :) we were so happy. A cute little cottage-type place. Pretty small but that's what makes it so neat. Trust me if you have to wait for a bit, it's worth it! I had the English muffin sandwich is egg and tomato, and pesto, comes with choice of meat but I changed it. Wow, excellent. My bf got the BLT and added a fried egg ontop of wheat toast. All I can say is holy bacon! So much, he was in heaven. Best BLT he said he's ever had. Hands down best breakfast I've had since I've been in NY. No joke.
