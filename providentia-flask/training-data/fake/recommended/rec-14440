[TL;DR] Very tiny Italian restaurant. Very good Italian food. If your budget and your stomach will allow it, start with the Caprese. It's so good. To expand our dining profile, we split a spaghetti carbonara, and a fettuccine w/ salmon. Both were excellently prepared and presented. The pasta was prepared al dente, as you would expect. The portion sizes along with the bread basket will have you going over your max limit if you're not careful. Service is friendly and excellent. If you're a table of two, expect limited mobility where your elbows are concerned. You get packed in. Totally recommend this place for Italian food while in NYC. Thank you Yelpers. TIP: If you have to wait on a table, you can lean on the coatrack. You can also be smart about it and make a reservation on Opentable instead. Also, if it's cold, you might want to state your preference to be away from the door.
