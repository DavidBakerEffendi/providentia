PHO REAL. Do it. The bbq chicken kimchi is pretty good too, but not the same level of flavor explosion in your mouth. One star docked b/c of quality control. I don't know if it was just my experience but when the sandwiches are surprisingly better when you get them delivery as opposed to ordering in-store. Not what you would expect, but I'm definitely sticking with delivery in the future. There is a $10 minimum, but just grab a friend or get 2 sandwiches and eat one later.
