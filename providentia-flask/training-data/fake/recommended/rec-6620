I have been here about six times and typically get a spot at the bar.  I used to love it but lately I feel that they are banging out too many plates and QC is falling down.  A little too much salt the past two times on multiple dishes.  Salads seem to be shrinking in size.  Still very good but I dunno I want consistency....perhaps they have the B team on the line.
