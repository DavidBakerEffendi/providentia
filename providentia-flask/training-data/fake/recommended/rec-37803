Great spot. It's small, but if you call ahead, you can get your name on the list, and they'll let you know when your table is ready. Until then, you can go to one of any number of bars in the area for a drink. Their appetizers were delicious (we got a vegetable plate and and tasting board) great to share between a few people. The pizzas were good. I have had better, but not many. I usually measure pizza places by their Margherita, and though I wouldn't recommend that, I thought the Diavolo was much better. We finished with the tiramisu, which was delicious and very light, which is a pleasant way to end dinner. Our server was also very friendly and knowledgable. Overall, it was a great experience and definitely worth doing again.
