Went for dinner this past Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Despite not having reservations and not calling ahead, the hostess was able to seat our table of 5 within 10 min.  Not an easy feat since the restaurant is not huge, and there was a good crowd that evening. Overall ambiance was really nice, candles, low lights, and large black and white photos decorated the walls of the room we were in.  Think would be a great date spot! Our group shared the Creamy Orzo 'Mac N Cheese and Loaded Potatoes. Both were a hit, we literally scraped every morsel off the plates before letting the servers take them away.   I ordered the Oyster Pan Roast for my entree.  The dish was very rich, creamy, and decadent.  I kind of wish it was a tad less salty, but overall, it was very good.  If you're a big burly man, I will say the portion will probably not fill you.  It was a good amount for me though. (Small asian girl) Other dishes that my friends ordered included the Lemon Chicken, Steak and Potatoes, Patty Melt, and Empire Burger.  No complaints, I think everyone really enjoyed their meals. For dessert, we shared the Blackout Cake and one of the specials, a Banana Cream pie.  I usually don't like chocolate cake, but this was so delicious.  I literally tried to eat half of it, probably to the dismay of my friends and the birthday boy.  The Banana Cream pie was also good, it was a little small portion wise, but whatevs. Celebrity chef Amanda Freitag was around, so that was cool to see her flitting around her restaurant. Our waiter, the hostess, basically everyone who worked there was very nice and friendly.  I give them an A++. I definitely want to go back, and am already planning another dinner asap.
