I love this place so much I've decided to start writing Yelp reviews. I walk a half mile from my place in Bed Stuy and I am always happy when I get here. The decor is beautiful and comfortable and somehow spacious and intimate at the same time. There is one waiter, middle aged tall friendly guy who is amazing. There is a young girl waitress who is just fine, a little blas√©, but whatever she's still a capable server. The drinks are nice, the brunch is delicious, lots of sandwich/salad/classic midday dishes. The dinner is my favorite though. Things run out quite often but I feel like that is par for the course when you are doing local/seasonal. You can't really go wrong with any of the dishes...the trout, the chicken, the cowboy fries, all of the appetizers...all great. My mom loved eating here. My husband loves eating here. My out-of-town friend loved eating here. The place def has a family sort of crowd, but its perfectly romantic for couples and legit for a group of friends as well. It sort of all-emcompasses the neighborhood place that you can always fall back on.
