On a 6 day business trip here at the Hampton Inn which is attached to this restaurant, this is my second night and half way through my meal I did not feel right, thought maybe I was full....after half of one crab cake (which btw, they charge $16 for...yes $16 for ONE crab cake)... well turns out it is a lovely case of food poisoning including a fever. The food tastes horrid, but it is basically my only option around here. I sincerely feel sorry for the people who live in this area who say this is the best restaurant around. Wow. If this is the best... I'd probably die from the worst. I guess I can starve for the remainder of the time and eat real food once I get back home.
