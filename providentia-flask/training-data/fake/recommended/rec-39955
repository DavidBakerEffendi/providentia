I went here for dinner a few months back based on the good Yelp reviews. Maybe there were having an off night, or maybe we ordered the wrong things...but whatever it was, I wasn't too impressed. I'm not too much into the bar scene, so I can't really comment on that. We ordered calamari as an app, and it was fine--nothing exceptional. The scallops and shrimp I had were good, but they weren't really cooked to perfection and I think that they use the creamy sauce to cover that. The portion was fairly small as well--there were 3 scallops and 3 shrimps for a dinner entree! My BF had lamb, and it was mediocre as well. A little over-seasoned and tough. I would go back simply to give the place another shot, but my first experience there does not have me yelping for more!
