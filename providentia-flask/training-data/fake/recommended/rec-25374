I understand they are the new hot spot for everyone to go in and try. I've been to the cherry hill mall location before and loved it so I thought I'd give it another try at this location. Went in on a Friday night at 5:30 not thinking we would need a reservation (totally wrong). The hostess took a few minutes to even acknowledge us since she was busy on the computer (big no no...always warmly greet the customers even if you have to ask them to wait a minute).  Gladly grabbed a  drink at the bar with my parents while we waited for a first come first serve table near the bar which the hostess helped us out with. Waited 45 minutes which isn't really a problem but it took awhile for a bartender to even approach us. Once he did it seemed to take him forever to find a particular white by the glass that I ordered (restaurants should generally  know their wines by the glass). Anyway bar scene was packed and enjoyable with mainly middle aged folk. When we sat down for dinner our waitress was wonderful (Christina or Christine as I recall). Very personable and she also knew her wines and recommended a new favorite which I always appreciate. Flatbreads were great...crust was nice and thin and light. I got the scallops which were nicely seared but the risotto was just ok (butternut squash was not cooked all the way). Our dinner would get 4 stars...waitress 5.... But beginning of the night took away from the experience I must say.
