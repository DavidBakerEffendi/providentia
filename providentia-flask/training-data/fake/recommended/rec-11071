Awesome!!  I was on Temple's campus for lunch reminiscing about the good old days when I was a student here many years ago and thanks to you Yelpers, decided to come to this food truck for lunch.  I'm glad I did!  I wish they were around back then. They have the Sweet Crepe and the Savory Crepe.  Both have an abundance of choices to put in the crepe.  I went for the Southwestern Savory Crepe which included chopped steak, BBQ, and ranch dressing.  Also had some peppers and other greens.  It was huge! The only other thing huge was the wait to get my food.  I think I was #22 and they just called out #8 when I ordered.  About 20-30 minutes later I got my order but it was worth the wait. Based on the students I watched and orders made, it seems most were purchasing the Sweet Crepe filled with all kinds of goodies like strawberries, bananas, nutella, honey, whip cream, chocolate sprinkle, cocoa, and other calorie busting stuff. My crepe with a bottle of water was $5.50.  You just can't beat that. And, I used LevelUp to pay for it with my Iphone. Man, I felt old back on campus, though!  I'd definitely come back to The Creperie.
