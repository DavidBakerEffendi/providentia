Went on Christmas Eve 2009.  Got there early, which was good, as it filled up 30 minutes after we got there. Clean, orderly place.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy, so be careful walking, particularly on side streets. Service was friendly and efficient. Food was excellent.  I got spring rolls - fantastic.  Unlike any I've had elsewhere. I got the vermicilli noodle bowl with various barbecue meat toppings.  Absolutely delicious.  Meat barbecue flavors I'd never tasted, plus some crisp and cold vegetables thrown in for contrast.   Sorry, can't remember what my dining partner got, but he thought his was excellent as well.   Very inexpensive, for what you get.  Again, very clean, which I really like in a restaurant. Only thing I wasn't crazed about was the Vietnamese iced coffee.  It was expensive, for a small glass with no refills, and it was really no different than many iced coffees I've had elsewhere. I would definitely go back.
