My Gourmand friend Helen suggested we go for "Americas Greatest Sandwich" (According to Alan Richman) on a hot summer July afternoon. My first thought was too heavy for such a hot day but on we went. The day we went the line was quite reasonable. We both got the Pork, Broccoli Rabe and Provolone. The sandwich lives up to the hype. The roll was just right and the mix of succulent roast pork and fixins was awesome. Â  And somehow it was not heavy. It was satisfying and delicious. At gunpoint I would take a Louis Lunch burger over it as my best thing between sliced bread but its a close runner up. Thanks Helen
