I love Cheeky Sandwiches. Artfully crafted and decorated environs, lovely staff, awesome prices, perfectly paired music, Zapps chips(!), and most of all, delightfully buttery Southern biscuits. If you appreciate a great biscuity treat in a city that hardly knows how to spell biscuit, you'll adore this off the beaten path joint. I rarely trust advice from non-Southerners on topics of biscuits, gumbo, crawfish, and most anything fried, so knowing Cheeky has Southern roots gave me faith, and that faith was heartily rewarded. My companions had biscuit sandwiches: one with eggs and muenster the other with fried chicken, slaw, and gravy. I took in a biscuit with just the right amount of butter and honey. Needless to say, perhaps, few words were uttered...other than the occasional "goddamn" or "that's just right." All were satisfied. Chicory coffee is even more of a rarity in NYC, so it was a happy meeting we had with a couple of cups of the Cafe DuMonde variety. Zapps chips (Voodoo and Salt and Pepper) scrumptiously complemented our delicious feast on the LES. The handsome and talkative chef kicks up the aesthetic a bit, and I can't see the ladies OR the gentlemen complaining about that. Hand painted walls, plank floors, and a tin roof give a roadside of Hwy 105 kind of feel. The open windows in the front make for a thoroughly enjoyable experience and are the only reminder that you are actually in the city. I had been dying to try this place for months. As I understand it, Cheeky will celebrate its anniversary on 14 December! Check it out, and get your biscuit on. I'm fairly certain that the only people who don't like Cheeky Sandwiches either hate life, the South, or more likely, both. Viva Cheeky!!!
