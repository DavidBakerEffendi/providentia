Living right across the street we were all SO excited to go to Bufad. We love prohibition and cafe lift soo much we know it would be amazing. Wow. We were so disappointed we didn't even discuss it. It was just one of those sad moments. Went there on a sunday, there was a 40 minute wait. That is fine I guess, we decided to just do take out. But get this, as we were waiting for out take out slices, people came in behind us and GOT A TABLE IMMEDIATELY. I don't know if there was a miscommunication or something but that was super effed up. We didn't even say anything. We just wanted to leave at that point. The pizza was cold. We literally live less than a block away, no excuse to give us cold pizza. I think the worst part of all was the way the pizza was just sitting out on the counter. EVERYONE walked by it, and bent over and looked down at the pizza. Can you imagine all the nose crustieees and boogers that dropped onto that pizza?! UGH!! It was all I could think about. SO DISGUSTING. I can't believe they would even do that. So as the employee was explaining the pizza's to us, she is reaching across them, pointing her and pointing there.. and we're leaning over the pizza's looking at them. breathing on them.. then I thought, omg this is what EVERYONE does. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. That was so disgusting. I am willing to ignore all the other issues but having the pizza out on the front counter like that, NO GLASS, no barrier what so ever... that is terrible. It is unsanitary.. and just blurg, disgusting. The pizza was okay. Nothing great. Better than the other pizza place on the block but not really worth it. just order from brandywine pizza and you'll be better off.
