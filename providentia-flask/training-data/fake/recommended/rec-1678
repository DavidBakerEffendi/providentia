If you look past the ridiculous long lines, the inconvenience of eating in Reading Terminal, and the fact that they may run out of food an hour before closing and close early with people in line, this place is actually really good. They were on the food channel for their roast pork sandwich. it's an amazing, greasy sandwich. I normally get mine with the broccoli rabe and I love it. I do. Many philadelphians claim the pork sandwich is the true sandwich for philly. Either way, it's a great place if you can get past all the effort to get one. I'm ranking it 4 starts not among all restaurants, but as sandwiches/junk food goes. This is one of the better sandwiches I've had in philly, but I've had pizza and hotdogs from other places I enjoy more.
