I've been living in the city for over 10 years, and I've tasted A LOT of pizza, and hands down this is the best pizza I've had outside of Napoli.  Thin crust, fresh ingredients, in a  very simple italian dining room bustling with psyched hungry pizza heads.  Service is brisk, but who cares?  You are there for the food!  I haven't eaten much else here besides the pizza. ( I save the italian dishes for when I visit mom ) Its not that hard to find this place...and its in a nice neighborhood (Dumbo/Bklyn Hts area).  Nice view of the Bklyn Bridge too.  If you haven't yet, GO!
