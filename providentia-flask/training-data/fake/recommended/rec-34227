I'm a local and I really wanted Open Door to be good but it just wasn't. The atmosphere is really nice and everyone was very friendly but the food is mediocre. I have no idea why they have decided to take the small dish approach when regular fare would suit the place. The wine list features mostly California wines which was disappointing but it's the food that leads the way in that dept. I had a flatbread special which was bland and cold, some fried chicken fritters which looked and tasted uninviting and three Â croquettes which are all different and no one on the staff could identify for me which was which. Not good.
