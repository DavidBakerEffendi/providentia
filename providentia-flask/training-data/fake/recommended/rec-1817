I was there this past weekend with my fiance. He got the ribs, which came with french fries. I got the Caesar salad with chicken and some potato latkes. Initially, I had asked for a cherry coke, no ice because that's what I always order to drink. They said they had no cherry coke. I'm like, hello? You have a full bar? Don't you have Grenadine... but I decided to drop it, and just drink plain coke. Then the food came out. My salad had several brown leaves of lettuce. The chicken just looked like boiled chicken that had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. I guess if you just wanted protein of some sort, it would've been okay, but if you wanted flavor, you were shit out of luck. There was also hardly any salad dressing on the salad. The potato latkes were burnt and tasteless. My fiance's ribs, he said, were good. The fries, however, were caked in grease. The prices were kind of meh. If the salad would've cost more, I'd be much more pissed. Also, considering this was about 5pm on a Saturday and there were only 2 other tables, kind of raises a red flag. Most likely won't be coming back.
