Saturday Brunch in Westville - having chosen not to wait outside of Bella's and not wanting to forgo a proper brunch cocktail at Lena's we ventured down the street to try Stone Hearth. Our server Pam greeted us warmly and mixed up two delicious, and strong, bloody Mary's. She went on to explain that the chef was very accommodating to various diets: paleo, vegetarian, gluten free etc.  Fortunately for us we can order from the menu, as is. The BLT with New Hampshire bacon, toasted focaccia and dressed micro greens was outstanding. The lump crab eggs Benedict was just as good. Great farm to table fresh food, excellent service, strong drinks and no wait.  And the tab was $52 for two meals and four strong cocktails. #newfavoritebrunchspot
