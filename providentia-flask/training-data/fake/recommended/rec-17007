What a fun place!  This is a must if you are in the area.  This establishment is BYOB.  They have pitchers of sangria's and etc to add to the alcohol you bring.  My friend and I went on a Saturday night and were seated promptly.  We ordered several tapas to share.  I had the papas rellenas which are delicious as always  I 've had the ropa vieja in the past and was hard not to order it this time since I wanted to try something new.  I had the ceviche made with tigerfish and citrus.  It was so refreshing and perfect for the summer.  I was a little disappointed with the stuffed plantains.  I felt there was barely any stuffing and they were a little dry.  The garlic shrimp is a must. I practically licked the plate. The atmosphere is fun and the decor is colorful and vibrant.  It was very loud inside and the servers played the bongos and sang to several tables for birthday celebrations.  Being a Saturday night, this was expected of course. The service was great and the waiter was always available.  I can't wait to return!
