I live a few blocks from this place and was curious to try this since I received a menu on my door a few months back. Craving pizza one sunday, we decided to try this place out. WOW what a great idea! I ordered a large thin slice bbq chicken pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. the pizza was HUGE and in those square pizza cuts. the pizza was awesome and just the right amount of thickness! spaghetti was pretty decent too not too much sauce but i am a saucy type of person i suppose so that all depends on preference. anyways will definitely be ordering here again soon!
