This review would have been a 5 star but.....30 minutes before they closed me and 3 friends ordered a round of expensive tequila and drinks and we were told to leave 3 minutes after the last drink was made. Manager was extremly rude at the end and you could tell that she wanted to go home and cares nothing for customer service. Bartenders were very nice and sweet but the manager was not at all. I would have rated a 4 star but being kicked out after spending many benjamin Franklins was not nice.
