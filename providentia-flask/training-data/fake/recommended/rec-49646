After years of being vegetarian, I've drifted back into eating seafood, largely because of how much I love sushi. And for years, I tried so hard to be happy with just vegetarian sushi, but at most places it is so bland and boring. Well, not here, that is for sure! This place could get me back to being fully vegetarian if I always came here for sushi. The best part is that they use either black rice or a six grain rice blend for all of the sushi, both marinated for extra flavor. Total punch of flavor. And all of the types of sushi are paired with sauces and pastes to match the ingredients. The carrot ginger in particular, that we had on the snow pea nigiri and the Pickle Me roll, is just DELICIOUS. I could put that in a bowl and lick it and be happy. :) And don't miss the rice paper rolls. The Nutty one (I don't remember the exact name) was my favorite thing in the whole place. And be sure to try the watermelon mint lemonade. That was a real treat. Seriously delicious food that is so fresh and so healthy. This will definitely be a regular spot for me.
