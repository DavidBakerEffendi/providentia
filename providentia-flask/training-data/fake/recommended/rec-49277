Small place, clean and well set up... the area didn't look like the home of some of the best food in New Haven but it is! Portions are basically what you'd expect; bout 7 oz, 8oz for sides and something like 12 oz for the "pick your meats". Everything was delicious! Definitely worth going out of your way for. Prices were good. My boyfriend, who eats a ton, was able to share a "fat boy" with me with leftovers. It's nice that dessert doesn't take a huge bite out of your wallet, either.
