A couple friends and I stopped in here on a whim and were so glad we did! The space is beautiful, the servers are friendly, the food is delicious. Also, they have a small but well-chosen beer selection. Our waitress recommended the eggplant and potato dish, which was wonderful. The steamed veggie dumplings were bland, but the chicken and rice dish was great. Oh, also, the cabbage that comes with the little complimentary appetizer dish was awesome-- though the peanuts needed some work. Looking forward to returning!
