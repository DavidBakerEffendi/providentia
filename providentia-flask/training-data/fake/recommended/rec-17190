The burgers we had here really separate themselves from our past burger experiences. We had the 5 spice duck burger, which with its' blend of textures and flavors, was something I've never experienced before. It was delicious (an understatement)! They offer lettuce wraps as an alternative to their trademark burger bun with the U on it, I considered, but could not pass up trying their signature buns. The bun was pretty good, however, nothing especially standout about it. The fries are the small, short and thin cut type that go well with a burger. They have a full bar at this location as well! My girlfriend had one of the truffle burgers and it was very different from my duck burger, yet equally delicious. If I had to order again, I think I'd go with one of the truffle burgers as well, just because of that burst of TASTE that enters your mouth when you bite into that burger! I'm salivating as I write this, just thinking of this burger again is making me really, really hungry haha... The burgers go for about $15 each w/ out french fries, which isn't the most reasonable, but I highly recommend if you don't mind dropping the dough.
