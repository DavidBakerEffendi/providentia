Really not that exciting. I have some friends that are on a mission to "TRY EVERY SAUCE" here, but I thought the fries were salty and a bit boring (peanut satay sauce perhaps not the best compliment.) If it was dirt-cheap, I could understand all the hype. But it's pretty expensive, as greasy snackies go.
