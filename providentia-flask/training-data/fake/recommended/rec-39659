something about this artichoke slice that makes it akin to crack (i can't actually vouch for this, just guessing here) - so addicting.  it's gooey, cheesey, and dripping in things that i shudder to think are probably still coursing through my arteries (even though it has been days), but it's just so delicious. mind you, i ordered a pie over the phone - it only comes in one size, so i confirmed my order and hung up.  i did a double take when the delivery boy told me it was $30.  i was going to tip him 5, but he told me he only had $3 change - so i ended up just taking that.  long story short, i ended up paying close to $40 for a pie.  not sure it's THAT great - but definitely good to stop and pick up a slice once in a while when there isn't a crazy line.
