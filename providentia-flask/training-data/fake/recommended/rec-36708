Only basically three meals you can have here: 1) Chicken 2) Lamb or 3) Combo plate of the two. I'd say skip just chicken and go combo or lamb. The line here is always pretty long during anytime of the day (Lunch - 6am?) so be prepared to wait 15-ish minutes in line to get your foods. The meat itself is pretty simple rice, meat, pita, and some "salad". Load up on some white sauce if you like it (i don't) or load up on the spicy red sauce ( be warned it is very spicy, a bit like sriracha but with more staying power in the heat). Pro-tip: If you don't want to stand in the long long line go to the Southeast corner of the intersection and its the same guys look for the same shirts and yellow bags. The food is very nice and expertly seasoned. If you do not have an iron stomach your tummy might ache a little after eating. The portion they give you is pretty big for $6 I have never been able to finish the entire meal. If you are craving an excellent street meal at any hour of the day/night go here with the $6 you scrapped together and dig in.
