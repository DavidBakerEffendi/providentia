Stopped in for lunch randomly and was pleasantly surprised. The bread and olive oil were good, but the margaritas pizza was really good. The mozzarella was fresh and the crust was great. I tried the fried mozzarella appetizer, and that was good but it really just tasted like a fancy cheese stick. Also, the servers were very friendly.
