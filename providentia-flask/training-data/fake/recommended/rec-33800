I was here on Saturday 2/16, 8:30pm reservation. Promptly seated and well taken care of: tableside hand bathing and bath towels for napkins come standard.  A very unique experience, you might say this is the cheapest way to go to Morocco and be back with supper. Cash only, has a full bar (cheap, great house wine) but is still BYO as well. The lamb course (cooked in honey) is breathtaking. That is, when recalling how I devoured it, I don't remember actually taking a breath. You get served whole, uncut/unpeeled fruits at the end, some of it not yet ripe, all of it clearly having been at other tables beforehand--because how many people, after such a huge, disabling meal, will actually feel like peeling an orange? Also, a great (not best) baklava is around the corner, so save your dessert stomach for that. Belly dancer was very entertaining, though it seems a bit out of place to have to tip her by inserting bills in her costume. I got pulled into dancing with her. "Non, je ne regrette rien!"  :-) Other people dining here were very chill and the tight seating makes it natural to feel like you are all in there together. Expect anything from casual chatter to loud groups shouting conversations at each other. Meal took 2.5 hours, definitely pleased, but I hear the menu never changes, so it may be a while before I return.
