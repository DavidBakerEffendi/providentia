Had lunch with a friend after a meeting. This place is amazing, at least for what my friend and I ate. I had the Kobe burger, cooked medium. My friend had the pork burger and we shared sweet potato fries. The burgers are topped with Japanese shredded vegetables and a teriyaki sauce and they are delicious. It was one of the best burgers I've had anywhere and my friend said the pork burger was incredible. The sweet potato fries were tasty and held their crispness.  We tried both the spicy mayo sauce and the teriyaki ketchup.  I loved the spicy mayo but thought the ketchup was too sweet. The only reason for 4 stars, rather than 5 is because the food is a bit messy and napkins don't really cut it for cleaning your hands after eating.  Wet naps would definitely be a plus.
