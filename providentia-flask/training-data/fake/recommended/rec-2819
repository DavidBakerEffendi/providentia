We read the reviews and decided to go there, was expecting something a bit different but I did like the place, but I have to say the beer was nice and cold and the food was ok, I had the burger and my girlfriend had the a chicken sandwich, the burger was ok but typical bar burger, and the chicken sandwich was the same.
