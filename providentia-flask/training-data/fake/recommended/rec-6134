I can come here anytime and evertime and always feel satisfied.  I have been here with work colleagues, girlfriends, group of friends, with my cousin and his baby-- this place just always delivers!  Great food, (a very vegetarian friendly menu!), nice service and great ambience.  I am usually very critical about my food experience, so this is place is truly worth it. they also have happy hours which is a good deal.   Brussel Sprouts is a must try!
