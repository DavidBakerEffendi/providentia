Romantic BYO on a great block in South Philly.   The food is labelled 'italian', but August is far from a typical South Philly Italian restaurant.  The menu emphasizes 'family recipes', which presumably means a family of wizard chefs. The porkchops are my favorite of the entrees, but I've had several very good seafood dishes as well.   Don't skip the Eggplant meatballs.   The head chef prepared a nice vegetarian dish by request, but it would be nice to have 1 or 2 consistent options. Spectacular staff.  No uncorking fee(!!!).  Go there.  Bring wine.
