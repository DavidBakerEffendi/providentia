Lucky for me, my friends live right across the street from Barbuto. So when a group of us were all trying to agree on the best spot for dinner, we decided just to go to the closest place near their apartment. New York was dialing up some Chamber of Commerce weather so the open air design of the restaurant made for a lovely early evening dinner. We started of with the mussels, and for an entr√©e I tried the pork, veal and prosciutto ragu. Both were tasty and I would order them again anytime. The wine was delicious and I felt it was all moderately priced. I was really happy with our service and the overall experience.
