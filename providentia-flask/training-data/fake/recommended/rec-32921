I've been here many times, and it's honestly such a shame how horrible the service is.  very rude attitude, rushed, they don't make sure everything is okay, always having to wave them down.   this place has so much potential, it used to be my favorite spot!  but really the service has just gotten worse and worse, and the food isn't as great and as fresh and it used to be my first few times coming here but it's good though.  my boyfriend and I are bummed out , were still searching for a good sushi buffet replacement :/
