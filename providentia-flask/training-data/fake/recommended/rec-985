Another place that's been hyped up so much that it ended up being a disappointment. Hell yeah it's good for a late night post-alcohol grub. I would even get this for lunch on a normal workweek (granted they opened up a branch in LA). It was a mind-twister to me seeing the hordes of people lined up 40, 50 even 60 deep. I got the mixed gyro/chicken over rice. All components were hot and fresh. I guess it's all about the white sauce. Without it, HG's food would be dry and bland. Add the red sauce as well. Pour it all over and be friggin' adventurous for gyros sake.
