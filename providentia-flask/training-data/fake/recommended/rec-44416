Central Station is a fantastic addition to the Bushwick neighborhood! The atmosphere is fun, friendly and all-around welcoming. I would not classify Central Station as a sports bar as a previous reviewer did. They have a couple unobtrusive TVs that go on for the big games, which is something sorely lacking in the neighborhood. And the back yard is huge (but could use a little landscaping love.) The menu is smallish, but-oh-so-good! I'm pretty sure I've tried all the food (I'm a piggy) and the burger is by far the best around. The fegatini is so delicious I've had to restrain myself from licking the plate (although I would prefer the bread sliced thinner.) The fish sticks are super yummy too, fresh and light, and the fried capers are a touch of culinary genius! Central Station has quickly become my new watering hole and late night bite spot. It should become yours too!
