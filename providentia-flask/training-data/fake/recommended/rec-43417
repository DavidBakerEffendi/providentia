This place saved my ass on a late week day night. Flew in to LGA and made the drive to Princeton. Got in to town around 11:30 and not a thing was open except Starbucks?!? I hadn't eaten since breakfast and I was hangry. Then I drive by the shining window of Hoagie Haven, see a large crowd of people inside, and know I'm home. 5 minutes later I'm walking out with a delicious Italian hoagie, and a couple bags of chips. 10 minutes after that I'm at my hotel eating and deciding it's a damn good hoagie.
