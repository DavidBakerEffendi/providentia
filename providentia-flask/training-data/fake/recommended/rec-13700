One of my favorite food establishments in K-town... heck in New York City.  I guess the concept is "fast-food Korean," but it's so much more than that.  There's pre-made dishes (e.g. dduk-bbok-ee, bulgogi bab, kimbab) you can purchase for $3-4, a buffet bar where you can pay per lbs.(?), and even a small kitchen in the back with daily specials.  I actually bought a soon-tofu meal for $6!  It was no So-Kong-Dong, but it's probably the best bang for your buck.  Also, it's a great pre-party spot if you just want to buy some sojus or beers and drink hassle-free for cheap... oh, and korean snacks for anjoo too!
