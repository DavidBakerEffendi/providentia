this review is for the sandwiches / wraps, not the packaged goods / groceries portion.   the wrap i got (tuscan wrap) was pretty bad. first the guys making the dish didnt know the ingredients so they had to check the board - a bad sign. the grilled vegetables were cut into massive chunks more fit for barn yard animals then humans. the wrap ended up more like a C class burrito with soggy oversized vegetables in it smothered in what appeared to be mozerrella cheese.  Everything was really bland and flavorless which may explain why it was so over salted? i ate half of it and couldnt finish the rest and wont be surprised if i get some stomach troubles from the little i did eat.   with so many better options literally down the street, the cooked food at f&s offering is sub-par and will not last long if it doesnt improve.  plus half off sushi after 3pm is super scary considering how warm the coolers are at this place - sketchy but maybe good if you want to get sick and stay home from work
