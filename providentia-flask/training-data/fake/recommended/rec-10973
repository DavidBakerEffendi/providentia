I think everyone needs to relax and give this place a chance. I live in Carroll Gardens and love Red Hook so I've been very excited about this place opening. I think their business model is off but give them a few weeks and I think they will get the hang of it. The view is great, drinks are good (slightly overpriced), music was good and it has a nice New England feel. I will be going back.
