My coworkers and I go here for their lunch specials.  I'm a fan of the Chicken Marsala which comes with a salad, bread and a soda for $6.50.  Lots of other entree choices as well. I also enjoy the personal sized brick oven pizza lunch special or any other of their regular pies.  Buffalo Chicken Pizza is another of my favorites. Overall great place, great food, great staff and great prices!
