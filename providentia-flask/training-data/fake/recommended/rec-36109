I had one of the best sandwiches I've ever had yesterday night.  I ordered the fried eggplant panini with lemon aoli (I still don't know what this stuff is. butter? mayonnaise?). Clean ingredients, clean taste, but what made this sandwich A+ was the bread.  I don't know what kind of bread they use, but it looks like an elongated english muffin. It was rounded on the edges and white, and it had a really soft and slightly chewy bite. Most importantly, the bread wasn't overly oily.  In other places, such as my alma mater's cafeteria, the lunch lady would layer the panini grill with so much spray that butter practically forms on top the grill, and that would seep into the bread.  Glad it didn't happen here.  The whole sandwich was gorgeous and delicious, the waitress was really friendly, and I was with good company.  I had a good time. The reason why I subtracted 1 star was because the room was so dark that my Instagram pictures did not come out well. Just kidding. It was because some of the pricings on the menu seemed a bit off.  $6 for 2 pieces of bread with toppings? Really? $6 could get at least 2 loaves of bread, half a pound of good ham and we can go crazy all night long with ham and bread.
