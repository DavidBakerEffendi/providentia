This place is interesting in the sense that they've managed to really execute the pub and fine dining experience in one venue. The front of the restaurant has that Irish Pub vibe and the back of the restaurant has a fine dining space perfect for families on the night out. I've tried entrees, appetizers, and the Egan & Sons Beer - can't complain. Not something I would brag about but would definitely be my go-to-spot if I lived in/near Montclair. The food is amazing and I really think they execute their steaks exceptionally well.
