I'm not too adventurous with sushi, so I'm not one to rate places based on anything but the rolls. That said, the food here was really good. We missed happy hour by a little bit, but the prices were still very reasonable. Most of the plates on the belt don't run over $4.25 (a few are over $5), so at about four pieces per plate, it's not a total splurge: with a drink, I paid about $11.50 and left very satisfied. Pretty cool place overall, despite the fact that they played Glee and the Backstreet Boys. Nice liquor selection too, so this may be a place to try late-night.
