Say it's 7:00pm on a Sunday and you've been at the office for 11 hours.  And you're in downtown Hartford where only two places are open on a Sunday evening.  And you were in the office the day before for 16 hours.  And you ordered pizza then.  What you gonna do? Well in my case I went down to the security guard in the building and asked for his stack of menus.  My co-worker and I settled on New China House and made the call blindly. Big menu.  Lots of options.  Pretty nice folks.  BIG portions delivered in sturdy containers.  No chop sticks though. He thought his Special Combination ("shrimp, beef, and chicken cooked w. bamboo shoots, wood ears and water chestnuts in hot garlic sauce" for $8.50) could have been hotter, but he scarfed it down hungrily.  I noted the description of his dish and what arrived very different but his surprise broccoli sure did look good. My Spring Roll ($1.25) was lightly fried, crisp, and not greasy.  Kinda bland but I should have dunked it in the soy sauce and all would have been fine.  The menu we read from just said Ma Po Tofu ($6.50) and I ordered that.  The gal on the phone told me it had beef in it and asked if I wanted it without beef.  Yes, thank you for warning me (I had mentioned I was a strict vegetarian earlier).  On the menu that was delivered with my food it now reads "Ma Po Tofu (with pork)."  Okay? Anyway a thick brown sauce with a bit of a kick.  Diced soft tofu (not fried) with a few diced carrots and peas in it.  WTF?  He gets all that yummy looking broccoli and I get this?  Oh well its more authentic this way, right?  It was okay (though sitting kinda heavy now), but next time I'm stuck in the office all weekend, I'll invent something else from the various menu bits.  Like give me some fried tofu and broccoli in that same spicy brown sauce, and, hey, toss in some cashews.  Thanks!
