Okay I really want to give this place a 3, but the fries make it it a 4. My palate must be terrible because I was not a fan of anything but my fries.  We started with tater tots and I was so excited to have them.  However, when I had my first bite, I quickly realized these were not my wholesome tater tots from the freezer section. Please don't judge me! Then I had a plain burger and quickly realized, this was not my cup of tea.  However, when I tasted the fries.. Please and Thank you!  They were perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. This place is very small.  But the atmosphere is welcoming, that it didn't bother me one bit that my thigh and the person next to me was touching the entire time.
