The restaurant is family style dining so the portions are HUGE. It was crowded Friday night when we went and the wait for a table was 30-50 minutes. The salchipapas (chopped hotdog and French fries) were good and the various sauces were amazing. The tostones y amarillo/maduros were good as well. The rice and beans, however, were not enough for one person let alone four! The empanadas were great to me- smaller than I'm used to, but thicker. My S.O. Did not like them because there were olives in them and he doesn't eat olives. All in all a great experience- be sure to go when it's less busy, because it's impossible to navigate between tables if you're larger than size 1.
