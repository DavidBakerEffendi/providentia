Living in NY I've been to this cart a dozen of times. BUT lately I've noticed that they don't give lettuce anymore. If any of you haven't heard SHENDY'S HALAL CART has been bought out by the halal guys so they are "apparently" the same now. Also yes they are open at 7:30pm - 4am BUT THERE IS Â a lunch time vendor that is open on the sw or se corner (not located at the original location). and yes he is legit. We got confirmation from the guys at 7pm while they were setting up before we bought our food. Point being - halal guys are amazing, their white sauce is creamier than others, their hot sauce is super hot....but they've been cutting back on their portions. Used to be a 5 now it became 3 because of no lettuce and their sparing portions...Just expect long lines from 7:30-4 and expect smaller portions bc of the high demand.
