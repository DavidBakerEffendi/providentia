Heads up. I love Ippudo and have been there many many times. BUT, i just checked their health grade on nyc.gov and apparently they have major health violations! They scored a 40, which is pretty bad considering that an A is 0-13, B is 14-27 and C anything above 28. So yeah I don't know if we should be concerned, but people should be aware before slurping their noodles. That said, I was there again last night, and the Tori Ramen was on point as usual!
