Yelp saved the day on this one. After being turned off by the $20 minimum at Yakitori Totto, (which I'm sure is in a whole other league from Hagi), we found ourselves here. My friends and I were tired, hungry, wet from the rain and had just come in from LA, so this was a little piece of heaven. The wait was about 1.25 hours, which make sense since the place was so small and people were taking their time with huge pitchers of beer. We were on the cheap side that night so we ordered more substantial dishes vs. izakaya style: -Curry udon - simple, yet satisfying -Agedashi - very legit, came topped with daikon, bonito flakes and green onion -Ramen - surprisingly good...good sesame flavor and al dente noodles If I lived in NY, and I missed LA J-town, I'd definitely hit this place up even with the wait. On a side note, there is a $10 minimum!
