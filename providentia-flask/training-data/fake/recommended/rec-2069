I came across El Camino Real randomly. My gf and I we're wandering around the Piazza looking for a new brunch spot, and figured it was worth trying. The place has a distinct Southwestern/Mexican vibe, giving it a unique atmosphere in a city where many places are carbon-copied from each other. I especially liked the Cinco De Mayo themed artwork in the windows. First, a few minor service hiccups. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, but would sometimes take our coffee for refill before we were finished. I'm thinking of that scene in Coffee & Cigarettes, "...I just got it the way I like it." The wait for our food also seemed long considering how few people were there. I don't know if that had to do with the complexity of our food, but it did seem like others were getting their food out quicker. Finally, the eggs were not how I requested. I always like eggs to be runny when I eat hash, but mine were cooked hard. (Not that it killed the meal) Now, the food- excellent. We started with the Ugly Donuts, tossed in cinnamon - a sweet and satisfying way to start the meal. Mary got the chicken quesadilla, at the server's suggestion. Quesadillas are generally hard to screw up, but rarely do I have one that actually makes me take note and say, "Wow, that is really good!" Of course, I had to say this through sips of cold water, as the jalapenos are intense, but it had to be said. Finally, I recieved my brisket hash, with my eggs, corn and peppers. I still have my leftovers here and I'm enjoying them as I type this. And you know what else is great? The prices. All this for under $30. That made my day. This was originally going to be a 3-star rating, but now that I think of it, it was at least a 4-star meal. I would absolutely return here. It makes me want to tear down the local Taco Bell and put this in its place.
