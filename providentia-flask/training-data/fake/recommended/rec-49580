By far my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood. Beautiful interior and consistently delicious food. Often have a wait on the weekends, especially for groups, but always worth it. Love their guacamole and chips. The downside is how crowded it gets at peak times (it's a pretty small place), but the food and fun atmosphere make up for it.
