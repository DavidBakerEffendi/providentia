Visited for dinner on a Saturday night without reservations but received a table within 15 minutes near the front area. I had white sangria (deeeeelicious!!) and the Matador combo. Both delicious options that left me stuffed and happy. As others have mentioned, the combination of great tasting crispy peruvian chicken, fluffy rice and beans, plantains all seasoned to perfection was divine. The restaurant has a nice vibe, good music, good drinks and really cool decor towards the back of the restaurant. Great choice for a laid back dinner with friends!
