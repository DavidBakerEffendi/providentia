Preface: I am now more focused on quality and am always looking for a great deal (read: value). Less meat, no more 2 Chipotle burrito eating. A huge note - I didn't need to wait as my roomies got there before I did and put our names down. I waited at the most for 5 minutes, and that was just us loitering outside as we were waiting to be seated. Requested a medium-rare burger as recommended by the waitress - and decided to order The Royale ($15). It's a burger that basically falls apart when you bite into it, but in a good way, as it melts in your mouth. The burger didn't blow me away, but it was very delicious and tasty. A patty with braised short rib on top? Meat on meat? Top it off with truffle? Count me in. I couldn't quite taste the "umami" aka the 5th taste, but regardless, it was savory and tasty and not salty. The bun was lightly toasted on the outside but the inside was airy, fluffy, and not very dense at all. I thought it went very well with the burger. I also tried the thin fries ($3.5), mami style (+$3). Mami style is basically some kind of green pepper and deep fried onion and some tomato salsa-y type topping over the fries. I wasn't too impressed by it - I was expecting more of an in-n-out animal style type topping, but this was much lighter than that. Mami style wasn't anything special, but I did like the fries, so I'd probably order the fries without mami style the next time I go. All in all, an enjoyable experience. You won't be super full afterward, but you'll be very satisfied with a delicious burger. Good food, good company, you'll be pleased.
