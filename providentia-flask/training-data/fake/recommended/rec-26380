In the mood for a quick casual bite, I went in this little shop on a side street in Chinatown and ordered the pan-fried roast duck noodles - hand pulled noodles (you get a choice of various noodles such as flat rice noodles). I got this dish with what really tasted similar to your typical takeout Chinese lomein noodles, topped with several pieces of Cantonese crispy roast duck which were as good as one would expect from a good Chinatown butcher. There was a small amount of veggies in the dish like cabbage. A solid and delicious dish, although not spectacular. It is a small restaurant with four little tables, but hugely popular even on Sunday, with not just Chinese but a wider variety of people coming to eat - and all comfortable with the plainness of the place - old tables, Styrofoam cups. As people said, a hole in the wall with affordable and solid food.
