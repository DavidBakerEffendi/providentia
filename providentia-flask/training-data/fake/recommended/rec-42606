Brooklyn Proper is such a welcomed addition to the neighborhood. The decor is lovely and we'll thought out - I LOVE the mechanic's rags as napkins. The cocktails hit the spot because they are mostly vermouth-based, so I didn't feel too buzzed to enjoy my food. The food is so good. So, so good. All of the dishes were perfect to share. We ordered a bunch of things in order to try a variety and I'm glad we did. The highlights were the beef carpaccio and the zucchini dessert. The service was on point, staff was knowledgeable about their food and drink. I'll definitely be back for more!
