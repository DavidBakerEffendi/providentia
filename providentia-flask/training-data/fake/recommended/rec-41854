Bonafides:  16 years in Texas border area, ate dozens of authentic tex-mex tacos.  Comparison:  Nothing to see here folks, just move along, nothing to see, move on. Specifics:  tiny, under filled, bland (tried 3 different  types), over priced.  Good margaritas though.  Definitely not worth the schlep from west Bronx.
