The ambiance is a nice, and I appreciate the curtains keeping in the warmth in the winter, but the food is just good. Again, it's good, but I don't think it stands out that much from all the other Thai restaurants nearby. I had a spicy noodle dish, and my dining companion had the Pad See Euw, and both were good. No complaints, really; it's a bit packed at times, but they do a good job getting you in, having you order, and delivering your food promptly. A nicer place to bring friends for Thai food on 9th, but to me, the quality of the food is about the same.
