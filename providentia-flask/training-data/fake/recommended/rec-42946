My favorite pizza in Manhattan.  I always get the Margherita pizza, I've been to Naples a few times and this pie would not be out of place at all, which is saying an awful lot.  It is touristy and their salads could use a major overhaul, so I can't give it 5 stars.  But the pizza itself is definitely 5 stars, thin crust, chewey but crisp, San Marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella di bufala, basil.  Mmmmm.
