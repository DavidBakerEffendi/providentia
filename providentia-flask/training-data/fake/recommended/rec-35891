Went on a Saturday for my husband's birthday.  I had the organic salmon.  No complaints.  You cannot order from the dinner menu until 6pm.  The place filled up fast.  Nothing terribly special.  My husband enjoyed his frisee salad and but his steak au poivre did not meet his expectation.  The sauce was good, the cut of meat was not.  The tables were also too close together.
