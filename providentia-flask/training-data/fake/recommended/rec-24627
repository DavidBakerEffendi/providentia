What is there to say about the Corner Bistro that hasn't already been said here? Truly a New York City landmark, and it feels that way as soon as you walk through the door. Dark, old, and loud, its a perfect setting to grab a beer (or a few) to go with your Bistro Burger. I mean, that is the whole reason why you're there, isn't it? The Bistro Burger comes out, a beast of a burger, served with bacon and melted cheese. If you want a fancy designer burger (and don't get me wrong, I love those too), go elsewhere, because the Bistro Burger is as old school authentic burger as you can get. Meat. Bacon. Â American cheese. Beautiful.
