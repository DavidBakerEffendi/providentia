Wow I finally got to El Vez!! I cannot believe it has taken me so long, but it was well worth it. For drinks I had the guava mojito, which was made fresh guava juice, it was so hot out that it went down a little faster than I would have liked but it was absolutely delicious. My friend doesn't drink alcohol so she asked for a virgin pina colada and that was fantastic even without alcohol. We started out with the guacamole sampler, we had the original, Morales (with black truffle), and the indian red lopez (with spicy crab meat). For me the Indian Red Lopez was not too great, the crab was way too fishy. My friend liked it. The Morales was good, but the truffle flavor overpowered the avocado. My favorite was the original it was absolutely perfect! I cannot wait to have it again! Unfortunately the guac and chips filled us up quite a bit even though we had more food coming. Next we moved onto the ceviche, it was super hot out and the shrimp ceviche with watermelon and cucumber seemed like it would cool us down. It was good but it wasn't the highlight of my evening. Finally we had the enchilada sampler. I loved the black bean enchiladas and would have been perfectly fine eating just that. The shrimp enchilada didn't please either of us, but my friend loved the chicken enchilada, which I did not try. The downside was the bill, I feel like it was a bit pricey for what we had, but I hadn't expected a cheap bill from this place. I just have had better Mexican food at much cheaper places. Overall good experience, I'll definitely be back.
