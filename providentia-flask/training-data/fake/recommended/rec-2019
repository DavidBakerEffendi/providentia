You know something is good when you crave it later! I wish I lived in NY so I could go out and get some! It's great because it's open til the wee hours of the morning! I got the combo (lamb and chicken) so that I could try both. They were both pretty good, but I prefer the chicken.  Overall, it was a little greasy but was still pretty tasty! And the white sauce was great! Make sure to put lots of it on your  dish! NOTE: The hot sauce is VERY spicy! I tasted a little bit that I got on my finger and whoa! it was SPICY! You only need a couple drops to spice up your dish. Try it before you dump it on cause you could ruin it by making it too spicy. My only complaint is that I would've liked more veggies (but then again, I love veggies in my dishes). They serve it with some lettuce. But I would've like a little more, and maybe even some onions or tomatoes. But I get it, it's a chicken and rice truck so I shouldn't expect anything more than chicken and rice. It's pretty good; I can't wait til I visit NY again so I can eat some more!
