After trekking around Brooklyn in the sunshine all day we were ready to sit down somewhere and eat something delicious. Not just anything would do. Chez Moi hit the spot in so many ways. We started with the escargot, which, while they weren't served in shells (what was I expecting, honestly?) were extremely fragrant and we sopped up the garlicky oil with some spongey and flavorful sourdough bread. I has the Bisous cocktail: bourbon, melon puree, ginger. Delicious. Served on the rocks. I ordered the roast chicken, hoping I wouldn't be bored by it, and oh...my....god! I didn't know chicken could be so tender and rich. Maybe makes my top 10 favorites list. It was that good! And it was JUST CHICKEN! Was it covered in butter? Maybe. Probably. Who cares.
