Went here for dinner yesterday with a friend. Since they advertise themselves as a wine bar I would have expected a bit more selection by the glass but the choice I made was pretty good. We ordered five small plates for the table - tomato basil bruschetta (the pieces of bread were enormous and hard to eat. We both ended up cutting the roof of our mouths since it was rock solid), arugula salad with Parmesan (SO much lemon it was hard to get through), pasta arrabiata (yummy with big chunks of prosciutto, truffle fries and a white pizza with onions. I had a gelato for dessert with was basically vanilla ice cream. I was a little disappointed. Overall, the place and concept were cute but the service was slow and the food could have been better and more authentic to tapas style dining.
