I went to this restaurant for the first time with 3 other couples. I told my friends and co-workers that I was going, and they all had great reviews. The one piece of advice that I received from everyone, and that I also recommend.....GO HUNGRY. I wish I tried the lamb, the salad bar and dessert, but maybe I'll go again during lunch, when everything is half priced. What I liked: 1. The ambiance 2. The service 3. The Caipirinha (house drink) 4. The excitement of having unlimited amount of meat cut onto my plate. 5. The rolls, plantain, and polenta. 6. Valet parking What I didn't like: 1. The price for dinner. I'm sure this is not the most inexpensive Brazilian steakhouse. 2. The feeling of guilt and shame after eating until I couldn't breathe. It doesn't bother me but: 1. After awhile, all of the different cuts of beef start to taste the same. 2. You will not be seated until your entire party arrives (shame on them if they get there late) Also...after dining with a group, and spending over $500....we got two certificates for a free dinner. JACKPOT!
