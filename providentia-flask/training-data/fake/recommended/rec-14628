Good God, these were good dumplings.  Perfectly fried, crunchy, chewy, greasy, moist little packets of pork.  So freakin' good. Spent $3.  Walked off with 15 dumplings.  Didn't stay because yes, when you walk in you don't really want to touch anything.  Decided to eat on the street so we leaned on the wall half a block away and went to work.  I actually got a little sad after the last bite. Must go back again...
