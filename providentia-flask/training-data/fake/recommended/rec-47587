Food is good but delivery and customer service is horrible. I live honestly a 2 minute car ride from the store. I ordered delivery 3 times where they said it would be 30-45 minutes. Food came a house and 15 minutes later, cold and soggy. Had to call 3 times to remind them that the still haven't come. The next time i called it took a hour and 45 minutes because they forgot to even make my order. I never got a thing comped or money taken off or anything. I would say you should pick the food up and you'll be ok. Not the best in philly but it works for something to eat.
