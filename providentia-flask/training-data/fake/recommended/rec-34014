WOW. This place is amazing! Yes, it takes a little while to get your food, but that's what you get when you are NOT getting fast food (they make the chicken to order and locally source as much as possible). If you want fast, MSG seasoned, hormone-filled chicken then go to Kennedy Fried Chicken. What to get: - Fried Chicken Medium heat. I read quite a few reviews that claim the mild chicken is flavorless, but the medium heat chicken was great! -Their grits with BBQ Shrimp- OH MY GAWWWWD - the creamiest best flavored grits I have ever had!!! Such a wonderful surprise!!! I think this should be their featured dish. - Their hot sauce.....can they bottle it and sell it? PRETTY PLEASE? - Bourbon cake - SOOO worth the extra carbs :D
