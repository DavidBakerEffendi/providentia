Fantastic. If you can get in. It's tiny--maybe only 20 people can eat there at a time, so get ready for a 1 hour wait minimum on weekends. But you'll have an experience you'll remember for years. Intimate setting, warm atmosphere, personalize service from Heidi (make sure you talk to her!), and a simple menu to choose from that keeps things from getting complicated. We had the specials hangar steak and gnocchi, but were drooling at every dish our fellow dining companions ordered, too. My advice--go on a mon/ tues night when you can get Heidi to yourself. Enjoy...
