Fancy Mediterranean is the way to describe Ilili! The restaurant itself is modern with subtle lighting that makes the dining experience feel intimate yet spacious at the same time due to its higher ceilings and lots of diners! I have been to Ilili several times and each time the service has been excellent with the servers attentive and ready to help with suggestions. The food is always enticing and full of flavor. Review of a couple of things we have had in the past: - Brussels Sprouts- with fig jam, walnuts and grapes....so yummy. I know this sounds like the weirdest combination but it really works. My husband who doesn't even like brussel sprouts loves them! - Â Falafel- comes in little squares, they are always very crispy and crunchy so if you like softer falafel's then these aren't for you! - Batata Hara- fried spicy potatoes....whats not to love! I always appreciate the fact that after finishing the bowl of potatoes there isn't a little pool of oil at the bottom! - Mouhamara- I personally love this dish due to the sweetness of the pomegranate molasses and will order it wherever I find it! If you don't like sweet dips then I would steer clear, but I feel this is one dip one should definitely try! - Hummus- good hummus, I've had better but this isn't bad in the world of hummus's - Rkaykat- cheese rolls, yum! Fried to crispy perfection and filled with gooey yummy cheese :) - Chicken Shish Taouk- chicken is always tender and juicy! It can get to be an expensive outing here but that's why I called it "fancy" Mediterranean. It's a great spot for a date or just out with friends as they have the space. I have seen big groups here and plenty of couples! So if you're in the mood for dressing up and feel like having Mediterranean then definitely give this place a try! Its definitely worth checking out!
