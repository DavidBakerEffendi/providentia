Check out this place b/c of: fresh, hand-pulled/shaven noodles big portions unlimited condiments (gotta love my vinegar & chilli oil) cheap prices Stray away if you absolutely cannot stand: lack of ambiance tight space less than clean tables/chopsticks My verdict, I'd totally go check it out. You're bound to run into tight space/cleanliness issues in Chinatown anyhoo
