Miles Table makes a mean turkey burger. I found myself ordering at this new American food restaurant on South Street last week after meandering up and down the block, checking out prospective dinner options. And there are SO many options on this block. I love that about my neighborhood, but I suppose that, sometimes, I just want a dang burger. Plus, the inside looks really cute and cozy, even from the street. I ordered my burger to go and chatted with two members of the really upbeat and friendly staff while I waited. A Dad and his kid were dining up front where there is a framed poster of a cute baby hamming it up in a pot. During a rather quiet moment in the room, the child exclaimed "DO YOU COOK BABIES?!". Kids dine for free on Tuesdays. My burger and fries were perfection. The burger itself was flavorful, cooked just right, and the bun housed it well, all airing on the side of "generous" in portion. The fries were salted and flavored in a way where they didn't need ketchup, which is always pretty nice, in my opinion. The rest of the menu looked quite good as well, but I've definitely found my burger place! I'd love to return for breakfast and sit in that cozy booth in the front.
