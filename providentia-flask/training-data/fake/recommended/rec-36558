Balthazar is one of my ATF places to eat in NYC. I eat there so infrequently, bc I live in Florida, that I always order the same thing when I visit... the roast lamb sandwich with grilled veggies and harissa mayo.  for those who are not familiar with harissa, I know it as a Moroccan dish that is spicy.  The fresh baguette with warm lamb and spicy harissa mayo... yuuuummmmmm!!!!  I highly, extremely, in the strongest way possible recommend you head there for lunch.  Service was good and I enjoyed the hustle and bustle atmosphere.
