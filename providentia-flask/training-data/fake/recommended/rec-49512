Tasty is RIGHT! THPN has some of the most delicious noodles that I have ever tasted. They LITERALLY melt in your mouth. In the good way. There are a few vegetarian options on the menu, which is greatly appreciated. I may or may not be a creature of habit, because every time I've gone I've ordered the same thing - tofu and vegetable noodle soup with hand pulled noodles. It is just too good to pass up. Instead of a beef based broth for the soup, they use a vegetable based one. Mmm. The noodle options are: Fat Hand Pulled Noodles       Normal Hand Pulled Noodles Knife Peeled Noodle       Small Rice Noodles       Wide Hand Pulled Noodles       Chive Leaf Hand Pulled Noodles       Big Rice Noodles The staff are friendly enough. Each time I've gone, though, the tofu part of my dish has come out of the kitchen 5 - 10 minutes after my soup. I'm very happy that the tofu comes on the side by default, but would be even happier if both parts of my dish came out together. BUT, the waitress that suggested I mix chili paste into my soup totally made up for this ever happening. Um, best advise EVERR. The health department sanitation grade is a B. The seating is a little cramped. Both times that I've gone (by myself) I've been seated directly next to other folks. Or, more like on top of other folks. But, the food is so good that this can easily be overlooked if you're going by yourself or with people that you're not trying to impress.
