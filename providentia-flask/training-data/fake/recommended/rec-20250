Was here last week for brunch - my friend and I waited for just over an hour to be seated (I know - INSANE and unnecessary, but we really wanted to try this place).  The hostess handled the massive influx of people very well.   I ordered the lox scramble, which was very nice alongside its salad and delicious little hash brown.  The buttermilk biscuits were flaky and salty in the right ways.  My friend's pancake stack was cake-sweet and very good and his side of cheese waffles were delicious.  We definitely want to go back and sample more of the menu, which was able to balance New York's local food with classy Americana and down-home tastes.   I'd go back but I don't know that i'd wait another hour...
