Chop Chop opened 5 days ago after a renovation. It has been busy the few times I have walked by since the opening. It's a small space with 6 counter seats facing the street which is great for people watching. There is a nice display of pastries by the register but the kitchen is visible in the rear and the dish washing sink on the side (docking half a star for appearance). Friendly cashier who recommended the lobster roll and said a customer has ordered it the last 4 days. The menu offers breakfast, sandwiches, salads, dinner and sides. I ordered the Lobster Roll and the Duck Torta for my boyfriend to go. Although the food did get a little cold from my walk home of one block, the food was delicious. The Lobster Roll had great flavor and nice chunks of lobsters but not quality or quantity for the $12 price IMO (another half star). Not sure what kind of bread it was, but it was nicely toasted with a slight amount of butter. Dish came with side salad and fries which had a nice crunch. The Duck Torta consisted of duck confit with a fried egg on I think a brioche bun. Egg was cooked perfectly with the yolk running all over with the first bite. The duck was very tasty and tender. It also came with the same side salad and fries. Friends also got the Sausage Roll and the Cajun Club which were also delicious according to them. We were very satisfied with the food and not overly stuffed. Everything tasted fresh, was delicious and well cooked. I would highly recommend this place and hope it stays open longer than the restaurant previously located here. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. I definitely want to go back and try the breakfast and dinner.
