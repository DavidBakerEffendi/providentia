I was venturing around Soho, not exactly knowing where the hell I was, and got hungry. I was looking for the Museum of Modern Art, but that was a HUGE FAIL. Then I came across this cute small Italian Bistro called "Aurora". The place seemed like a nice restaurant so I went and ate, alone. Since I was by myself, I ended up just eating alone at the bar. (No shame, I was so hungry!!) The bartender was super nice, he had an Italian Accent and kept checking on me to see if I was doing okay. I ended up ordering a rock shrimp and Saffron pasta with an Apple Crush cocktail drink that had ALOT OF TEQUILA (I'm not complaining though!) The pasta was pretty good, a little too spicy for my liking, but good. Overall I enjoyed my time here, but minus 1 star for the slightly spicy taste of my entree dish.
