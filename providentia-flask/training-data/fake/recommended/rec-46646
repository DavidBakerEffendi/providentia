It's easy to be the best in your category if there's nobody else in your category.  That's kind of where Schlesinger's finds itself in the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood.  There just aren't any Jewish delis in center city anymore. There's Lattimer Deli, but it is so filthy looking that you don't even want to walk in the place. There are a few good delis in the suburbs, like Ben & Irv's, but in Center City the pickings are slim. So if you are in the mood for a gigantic corned beef sandwich or delicious pickled tomatoes, this is THE place. And they do it pretty well. The pickle bar is great. Everything from green to super sour to spicy to cabbage. And when it comes to the corned beef special, get over the guilt and enjoy!  It isn't Ben's Kosher in New York, but it definitely satisfies the occasional deli-lust.
