We visited Pat's and their nearby competitor based on a couple shows on a popular travel cable channel. Based on our experience, it is obvious the cable channel is not interested in eking out good food, but filming a location-based food story. The story? Pat's invented cheesesteaks. Pat's is located in a single lane, tightly knit, blue-collar neighborhood. The steak is chopped (my preference), but dry and lacking much flavor. In fact, that sums up the sandwich nicely: dry and lacking flavor. To Pat's credit, in contrast to their competitor, they provide access to napkins and a sloppy assortment of condiments. The do have a large number of sandwich options to choose from and the staff was easy-going and friendly, creating a friendly environment, opposite of the "other guy". They also nudged out their competitor in our informal taste test. In summary, they are a local mom-n-pop fast food cheesesteak eatery with a history and claim to fame, but not not much of a sober foodie destination.
