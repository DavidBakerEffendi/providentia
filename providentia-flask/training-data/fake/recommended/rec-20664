I guess the hype was over....It was crowed on any given weekdays last year...but this year, i went in 7 or 8 pm on a Sunday, its not even half full... One Sunday evening, my girl friend and i were both curving for Umami Burger, we arrived at 7 or 8 pm. we were seated immediately on the second floor. She ordered a truffle burger with truffle fries, and i ordered an original burger with regular fries... The burgers were just alright...The fries were not the burning hot type...they were at room temperature when served...The sauce on the truffle fries will become gluey after a while....which will bring down your appetite. After that night...both of us agree on no coming back anytime soon (like a year or so)...unless we have a SUPER DUPER curving on Umami burger...then we MIGHT go back...but other then that...NOPE!! THANK YOU!!
