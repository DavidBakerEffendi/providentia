Halal Cart was good but does not extraordinary.  I heard they own the surrounding Carts as well so you don't have to wait in the long lines.  Do I recommend this place, yes it's good and cheap.  I recommend this after clubbing or quick eats.  We got the Mix Plate Combo. Lamb is more flavorful than the Chicken but neither was dry.  $6 can't beat it.
