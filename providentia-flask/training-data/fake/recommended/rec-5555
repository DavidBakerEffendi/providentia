Went for the second time yesterday with my mother and a family friend.  We got there a little before five so we went up for a drink on the rooftop, which was not very crowded, before heading downstairs to be seated for dinner.  The rooftop was a good start to the evening, but dinner was the best part.  Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was extremely friendly.  We ordered the shoestring fries and the cheesesteak egg rolls to share for the table, which were both delicious.  I personally ordered the mushroom flatbread and the spinach ravioli, which even though they were small portions, I was unable to finish because there was so much food.  It was all excellent, but if I were to do it over I would say skip the fries, because they were kind of physically difficult to eat, and go straight for the egg rolls, which were AMAZING.  The egg rolls were exactly how I like my cheesesteaks...with mushrooms and peppers.  My mother got the bruschetta and the french onion soup dumplings, which she only lamented that she didn't have enough room to finish while at dinner, and our friend got the black quinoa and toubbouleh salad, and the Korean pork bbq tacos, which he also seemed to enjoy.  I will definitely go back, there were many menu items I would love to try (such as the udon), and I need those egg rolls again! For drinks I got the Melon Drop, which I had to slow myself down on because I could have drank like 5 of them which would have been expensive and dangerous.  My mom got the Violet Beauregard, which she seemed to have the same problem with. Overall, even though we left in pain, it was pain for a good reason.  Will definitely be back again.
