Lazy to cook and eager to try this new spot in my neighborhood- totally don't regret. Ordered something I had never ordered before... "Pad Woonsen" (made up mostly of glass noodles and vegetables- which I later learned are made out of soy beans) and it was delish with no leftovers to keep. Service was quick and painless, host was very sweet and talkative. Menu is extensive so be prepared for some indecisiveness. Would def return to try something else!
