Went Sunday for an early dinner. Walked in with my 2 friends, place was busy it took a few minutes for the hostess to acknowledge we were there.   Once seated our server came over for our drink order.   Brought them fairly quickly however we weren't ready to order.   No problem for him since he had plenty of other tables.   Lots of choices on the menu.  Finally ordered = Flaming chorizo was good but a little dry.  Seafood copper pot for 1, tuna steak and filet mignon on hot stone and stuffed tilapia with spinach.   Everything was GOOD!!  Nice portions 2 out of 3 had leftover to take home. Desserts =  creme brûlée, tres leche cake, and tiramisu again GOOD!   No complaints at all on the food. Would definitely recommend and go back.
