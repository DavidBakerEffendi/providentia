Great burger spot! My first order was their sunny side up burger with an egg and applewood bacon. I was hooked. From that point, I have tried most of their menu of burgers and made a few of my own. Its is a lot of fun to go their after a night of partying and challenge your friends to an old-fashion game of burger builder.
