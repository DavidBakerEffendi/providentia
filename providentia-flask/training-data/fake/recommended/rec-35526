This is maybe a bit biased as I live across the street, and even if it wasn't excellent I'd probably frequent it. But it's priced extremely well (all pastas in the $8 - $10 range), the menu was interesting and varied (~6 pastas, 2-3 mains and Fish of the day, ~5 apps, ~5 salads), a nice outdoor area right on Scholes, friendly waitstaff, and beer/wine coming in a week. Food was simple and delicious. Basically a perfect neighborhood addition.
