Barrio Chino is an inviting little hole-in-the wall that never fails to please. The cocktails are truly amazing, made with fresh and original ingredients that will keep your palate begging for more. While their booze gets the brunt of attention here, their food is also fantastic. We had seared ahi with mushrooms and also a delightful spicy shrimp with guacamole dish. The space is tiny, so be sure to go early if you want to grab a table for dinner. It fills up super fast, and there's no good place to wait around besides the sidewalk.
