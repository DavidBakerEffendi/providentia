We had the tasting menu and it was DELICIOUS. I would have never thought I would be full on five little dishes, but I was. Each item was very flavorful. foie gras, duck risotto, tres leche.... yum The ambiance is great. It appears loud inside, but you can hear your party without screaming. The staff are very attentive.
