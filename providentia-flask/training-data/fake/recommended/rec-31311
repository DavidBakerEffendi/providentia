Fantastic well-informed and pleasant service. Delicious appetizers with very generous sizes. Everything was presented beautifully and was even better than expected. I highly recommend the Seared Scallops and the Layered Avocado & Shrimp Salad as well as the Lobster Tacos. The Brussel Sprouts with Bacon were good too - just a little too heavy compared t the others. All of this served in a fresh, clean atmosphere.
