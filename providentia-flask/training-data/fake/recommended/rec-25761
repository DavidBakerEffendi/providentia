The Chilean SeaBass was amazing. My girlfriend had the eggplant and she thought it was really good, (which is high praise coming from a tough critic like her). The portion were large and the service was top notch. I would give it give five stars if it was not quite so Â loud. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.
