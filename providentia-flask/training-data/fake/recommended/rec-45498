Stopped by here randomly. We were looking for another Korean place but ended up here on my birthday. Nothing special, it was a plethora of Asian comfort food. The problem was the food was not so comforting. The sashimi and sushi was just okay (not so fresh). The Dolsot Bimbibap came out lukewarm when it should have been sizzling. The unagi (eel) don (eel rice bowl) had that gross sweet sauce rendering the eel distasteful. Overall, atmosphere was nice, drinks were great out of a bottle, but somehow food was lacking. The waitress was really nice but other than that, skip this place.
