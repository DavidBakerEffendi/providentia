This place has dumbed it self way down from the old days and now cooks for Â a "white" clientele. Nothing in our out take-out order had a scintilla of spice (heat) including the vindaloo (which I had specifically requested EXTRA spicy). Every dish was totally bland - could feed it to the cat. The nan must have been warmed in a microwave - no signs of a clay oven, NO butter (I requested extra, ha!), limp and tepid- gross. The chapati was damp. Threw it out. Looking for spice, I turned to the onion chutney - bland. Never, never again. India Palace's menu is more limited, but the food id excellent (make sure to have the lamb undercooked so it get's to your table still juicy).
