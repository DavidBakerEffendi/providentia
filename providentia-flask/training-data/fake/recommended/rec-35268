Ooooooooh, Dish! Love your fried green beans, your sassy yet sweet servers and your super-chic decor! A great place for both lunch, late-night eats and cocktails, I can see why this place attracts the crowds. I sampled the seared tuna with Asian noodles, gorged myself on their phenomenal grilled cheese (hello, bacon and tomato!), sipped a less-than-stellar gimlet (oh, well - they can't all be winners) and went to town on somma dem friend greener beaners. Holy hell, Hartford has hit a homer. Love it.
