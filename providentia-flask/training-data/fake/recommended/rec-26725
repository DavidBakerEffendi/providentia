Don't get fooled by the look of this place. I was expecting something with a little more character. The food was excellent. Probably the best meatball sandwich I have ever had. I had the one with prosciutto and provolone and loved every bit of it. As I said before, I wish it was a little more cozy or warm but the food really satisfied me.
