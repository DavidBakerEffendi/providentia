I've only had their tapas but everything I had was excellent. I especially recommend the "chicken lollipops" as the cilantro + lime combo is divine!! The entree portions I saw others eating looked very yummy but be warned: they're HUGE! You'll have two or three meals worth of food so plan accordingly. My final comment: get their sangria. It's fabulous, even if you drink it virgin. We had the asia de cuba. It was so delicious but we didn't realize it was BYOB or we would've had pure gold.
