My favorite place in the summertime. Bike up the bike path along the Hudson River and make a stop at Pier I just cross 70ths Street at the water. Plentiful outdoor seating and special events all summer long (concerts, movies, kid friendly activities, etc) Def make this a to do on your summertime list. Below a review of one of the best items on the menu, their classic burger. The steak salad by the way is also worth trying. Pier I Cafe (Upper West) - talk about bang for your buck! sit out in the sun, overlooking the beautiful Hudson River on a bright sunny day and nosh to your hearts content. paired w some yummy fries for $10.10. Â this dining experience has the whole package. it's super casz (casual) - order at the bar and pick it up at the window when you hear your number. no need to worry about how many are in your party or getting a bad waiter that will ruin your day. order a bucket of coronas from the bar and enjoy the afternoon in the sun!
