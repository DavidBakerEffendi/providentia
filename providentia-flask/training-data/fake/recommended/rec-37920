Along with a group of my 3 girlfriends, I headed to Melograno's for a first time visit with 3 bottles in hand. Melograno earned 4 stars as an affordable BYO that has a menu to please the 'picky eater' without breaking the bank. I think with a few more visits Melograno could be a favorite place to gab with the girls, I would definately go back. Reservations are taken on all days except Saturday, closed on Mondays. We were seated right on time from a friendly hostess who greeted me by name *bonus point! Appetizers and entrees came out in a fair time without complaints, just happy bellies. I ate my pork chop with creamy polenta & pomegranate reduction and had left overs to spare but admit, I get full kind of fast. The service was decent, maybe a little stressed at one point. The restaurant and bathrooms appeared clean. All in all...two thumbs up. Shout out to Michelle C for the suggestion.
