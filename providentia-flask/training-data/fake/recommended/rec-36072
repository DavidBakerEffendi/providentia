Randomly stumbled upon this gem when we were told we had to wait 30 minutes at Honey's.  All three of us ordered 5 entrees, just to get a taste of the fine food offered here, telling ourselves we won't eat it all, but we ended up eating everything because it was so delicious.  I strongly recommend this place, the owner and his wife came by to make sure we were enjoying everything.  Excellent service and super fine food.  Cannot go wrong!
