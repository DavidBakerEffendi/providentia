We were very excited to try this breakfast place because of all the good reviews. But it was a bit of a disappointment. It is one of those places u tried it once and never go back again. We waited an hour or so to get in the restaurant. We ordered salmon egg benedict, spanish scramble and blueberry pancake and coffee. The food was meh...it was edible and it was just not deserving all that good reviews. The place is full of tourists and when we went in the hostess asked us if we had U.S. phone numbers. When the check came out they added the tip to the total..I mean apparently this is a place for visitors. If u live in new york u know there are better places out there and this one was just not one of them.
