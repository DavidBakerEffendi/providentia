I just don't get it... so far I've had veggie pizza, margherita, and a sauce with no cheese pizza from here and all it tastes like is char... and NO other flavor whatsoever.  I would never, ever consider Pepe's for pizza, especially when there are so many places in nearby suburbs that do New Haven style pizza justice.  I just don't understand the reviews on here.  The only good thing people have to say is about the clams casino pizza, which I imagine to be plenty salty, because other than that, there is just no love in these pies.  Pass :(
