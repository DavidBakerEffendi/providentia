I'll start with these hot dogs are amazing!!! Very tasty and they are prepared in ways you would not imagine... I found this place on-line while looking for good food places in Philly.. When I read the reviews, I said I had to try this place.. And I am all smiles! My hot dog of choice, put me in a very happy place. I think its called the "Seattle Scrung". They freaking put cream cheese on a hot dog.. Who would do that? That sounds horrible. But because I love cream cheese, I gave it a try and its the best thing smokin! Even my boyfriend ordered one after he ate his chili and cole slaw hot dog.. I am so excited to tell everyone about this place :)
