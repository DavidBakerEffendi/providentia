Went there on Valentine's Day, there was a live band playing. It was a little loud, but enjoyed it. Food was great, Sangria was great!  One thing that set me off was the service. Seemed like we had to deal with 3 different waiters instead of one. It seemed like they were not organized. Menu is not too broad, but good enough. Everyone can find what they are looking for, from seafood to beef and veggies.  Prices are ok, not too expensive. But at the end, what counts the most is the food, and we enjoyed it a lot. Would go again, but not more than twice a year.
