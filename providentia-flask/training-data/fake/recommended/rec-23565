Two words, my friends. Pineapple Explosion. Yes. Try it. My boyfriends meal arrived in a halved, hollowed-out pineapple. It looked gorgeous and tasted divine. I had some type of orange chicken, and while I've never seen/eaten it crispy fried before I'm a believer now. It was delicately fried to perfection, and then coated with an orange glaze with flecks of red pepper. Yeah. The only gripe I have is that I asked for spicy specifically - and did not really get it. I mean, I understand. I'm a skinny white girl insisting for spice - and in most Asian/Thai places that means a meal will be sent back with a whine of "Tooooo spiiiiiicy. Owww. Can I get a replacement meal?" So no fault from these folks, really. Our server was a delight, the place was clean, and the food great. Get thee to Zen Gardens.
