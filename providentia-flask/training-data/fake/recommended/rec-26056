Beco is like a hug. It always seems to be open with a full menu -- whether 7am or 1am. Their Brazilian specialties are incredible and even their simple dishes like the omelette are exceptional -- fluffy and fresh. It's an often overlooked detail, but if you're a snob about well-dressed salads, you'll be happy with Beco. All the salads are PERFECTLY dressed and seasoned. No soggy greens. No bad oil-to-vin ratios. Best of all, the staff is warm and friendly. They'll move tables to accommodate my baby stroller on a Saturday morning, and they'll let me linger over a glass of wine on a Friday Night, while listening to live music. It is probably one of the best (kept secrets) in Williamsburg.
