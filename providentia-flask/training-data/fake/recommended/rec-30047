I really want to give this place 4.5 stars. I have been here several times for brunch, which is great. The brunch entrees are very good. They are a good portion size and very reasonable priced. And the free, unlimited sangria is wonderful! I finally had dinner here and it was very tasty. The service was very good, better than during the brunch meals. The staff was attentive and they gave us free shots and dessert. The meal was good too. I had the soft tacos, which was more than I could eat - very fresh ingredients. My husband had the duck dish and he said it was the best duck he ever had! Highly recommended. Great food, great service and very fun experience!
