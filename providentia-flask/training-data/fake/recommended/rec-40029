As part of my family's great American road trip, we stopped by National Mechanics after a long day of walking around historic Philly. We were group of 6, with only two English speakers (4 were tourists) and some restaurants had not been pleased with all the translating and awkward silences (see my review for a restaurant in Buffalo). However, our server at NM was incredible. Forget awkward silences! We so enjoyed our dinner that we didn't want to leave but alas, our road trip needed to go on. If you're ever in Philadelphia and want a good restaurant with friendly service, come here. Ask for the server that loves avocado and has bangs. The music selection was pretty varied and we really liked that the seats were old church pews. Try the soup!
