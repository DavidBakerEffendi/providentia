UPDATE 2/6/2013 - FINALLY had the burger. My friend got the Whaleys (premium ground beef, tomato, lettuce, beet, pineapple, fried egg& ketchup) and I got the Bronte  sans mayo (premium ground beef, tomato, lettuce, sweet chilli, mayo & cheese). HOLY MOTHER. The Bronte is SO good.  The patty is perfectly seasoned, the sweet chili sauce (OH MY) and the bread... It's not your regular hamburger bun. It's got that chewy texture that I love.  My burger was perfect.  They Whaleys was delish, but I'm not a fan of fruits and beets in my burgers.The flavors do work very well together though. Next time I come back (probably soon), will be getting the Bronte.  Also, dying to try the Shrimp pasta (spaghetti pasta, chilli oil, lime, fresh tomatoes and arugula).
