Spicy goodness! We ordered the first papaya salad on the recommendation of the nice server. Good call. The slightly sweet, tart, tangy, and spicy flavore made this our favorite dish. The chicken larb was really spicy and quite good. I wasn't thrilled with the grilled chicken, so I wouldn't order it again, but even it had good dipping sauces. The Thai iced tea was refreshing and satisfying. The prices were very reasonable, definitely on the low end of $$. I'd love to go back very soon.
