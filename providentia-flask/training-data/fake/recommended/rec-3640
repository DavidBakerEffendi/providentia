I've been here a bunch and while I'm sure there are places doing classic Italian American dishes better, this is my favorite.  The chilled house red wine is great.  I fear that it is really just Carlo Rossi or comes from a cardboard box but to be honest I don't care.  The host is a super nice guy and even gave me a side hug in front of my girl and made me look like a VIP.  I don't know him really but the effort was appreciated.  My favorite dish is the spaghetti with garlic and oil.  Simple, but delicious.  It's loaded with roasted garlic.  The veal Don Peppe is good, veal cutlets with a bruschetta topping essentially.  I really like the chicken with lemon and butter and a side of escarole.  I've never had the Chinese chicken here because it takes awhile to cook, but I'm looking forward to trying it.  The servers are all willing to give suggestions.  As you can tell I'm a big fan.
