I feel like this place is a total hidden gem. Where else in Manhattan can you get a reservation for brunch for 12 people, on a Sunday, in the patio at 12pm? Yes, this place. Great brunch here, super fresh and the servers offer opinions, which are spot on. They didn't have a full liquor license when we went, but that didn't deter us from getting drunkie on prosecco. =) Oh and the patio is this cute little garden with string lights and really its super romantic. So much so, that I took my husband back for brunch. I love this place, I'll def be heading back when I go to NYC in Jan, only I won't be sitting out on the patio in the dead of winter.
