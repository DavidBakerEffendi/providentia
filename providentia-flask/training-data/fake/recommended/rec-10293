OK, I just returned from my walk to Bear's new location in downtown hartford.  They are right next door to Arch St Tavern.  If you ware walking for take out, it is counter service.  Walk to the end, pick your meats and then your sides.  There are many choices.  I picked the burnt ends entree (meat and two sides).  For my sides cole slaw and fries; which are both tasty.  I foresee eating the cole slaw on a pulled pork sandwich.  It feels like half a pund of burnt ends; seven good size hunks of meat. The burnt ends are tender, pull apart with a plastic fork tender.  There is no "crunch" which I expect with brunt ends, but they were kept in a warming tray and had to walk back to the office. There is a nice heavy rub on the meat.  It has a little tang, but is not spicy. I wish the burnt ends had a crisp fat layer. The meat has a reall nice smoke flavor, nothing overpowering.  Soild smoke ring.  I did not try any of the BBQ sauces, but they have three sweet, medium, and a spicy.  One of them they call a Texas style.   I like to judge BBQ first without sauce.  Pulled pork to me is the test meat for BBQ sauces.   I will go back. Almost forgot, they have sweet tea.  It is wicked sweet, even for someone who lived in the south for too long.
