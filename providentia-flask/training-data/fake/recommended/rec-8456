Don't know how I didn't rate my pommes frites place before. Absolutely amazing. Here are the tips... -Always get it to go, you get more. -Get the sauce separate so you can dip and it doesn't make your frites soggy -You get regular frite sauce for free but try the special ones -I recommend pomegranate teriyaki my all time fav but also love parmesean peppercorn and the sweet chili After a late night of drinking, there's nothing better or more satisfying. Ok, a nice burger would be nice, but you can get that at a diner nearby. If you love to dip, try this place. You wont regret it.
