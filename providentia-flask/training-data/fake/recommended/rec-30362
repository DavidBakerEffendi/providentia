I wanted to love Prospect, but the food wasn't as wonderful as I had hoped. My husband and father had dishes they really enjoyed (cauliflower soup, surf and turf, and pork were really excellent), however, my food was a real let down. The beet salad was so acidic and tart I almost couldn't eat it, and the cod was just ok. The service was lovely and the cocktail were delicious, which made me want to give it at least 4 stars, but the food just didn't live up to my expectations.
