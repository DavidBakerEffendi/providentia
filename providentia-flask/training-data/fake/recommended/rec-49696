The best tilapia ever! This is a cozy restaurant within an ambience full of color and life. The service is wonderful, the staff answers to any need promptly. Food and drinks are delicious (considering that my senses have grown in the western hemisphere of the world). Their tilapia is outstanding. The Regular lunch special is good, Â however I would suggest to go for the chef specialities. I give 5 stars considering the overall experience for an affordable price.
