I am in love with this place. Who needs a huge menu when you can do something this well! The variations on meatballs were awesome, and their sauces, ranging from the classic tomato to the parmesan cream, were delicious. I must say though, I do enjoy the classics (beef meatballs in their zesty tomato sauce) the best. On top of it all, they make a killer ice cream sandwich!!! I had the snickerdoodle cookie, which was incredibly gooey and soft, with their vanilla ice cream. I know it sounds boring, but that was one of the best vanilla ice creams I've had in a long time. My boyfriend had the chocolate mint ice cream with his sandwich and you don't find fresh mint ice cream very often, but the Meatball Shop does it!!!!
