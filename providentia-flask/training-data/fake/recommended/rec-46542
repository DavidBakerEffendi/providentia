I've had two very great and very different experiences at Perilla. 1. My roommate and I stumble in, wearing t - shirts (mine, a Tang orange University of Illinois shirt) and jeans, after a day of Essex brunch and drinking (they go hand and hand).  Soberer minds would realize this is inappropriate at a fairly nice restaurant. But, sober we are not and, determined we are to have their famed duck meatballs.  After plopping ourselves at the bar, we're greeted by the bartender. And, in full disclosure mode, we express our embarrassment to the barkeep.  She just smiles, says "don't worry guys. I'm the only one looking after ya...plus...you look great," and brings us two pints of beer. Hospitality and, I can only assume Perilla, at its best. Fast forward two months... 2. Needing to know if Perilla's duck meatballs and sense of humor are as good as my fuzzy memory , I return.  This time with a reservation, a date and appropriate clothing. Nothing changed; the service was great, the food was well prepared and the duck meatballs are one of the most comforting appetizers in all of New York City. O yea, the bartender smiled, said hi and said that she liked the t shirt better. This place is a winner.
