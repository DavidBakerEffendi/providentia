First time I went, I would have given it four stars. Went during the summer for the free bbq deal. Service was slow, but it really was very busy out on the patio and our waiter was great so no problem there. Plus it was such a good deal for good food and a lovely atmosphere. The last two times I went, we ate at the bar inside and service was still slow, even though it wasn't busy. There is one bartender in particular that I officially dislike as we've had him twice. Inattentive, snarky, rude. My friend asked him to explain the drink specials and he was very vague and almost tricked us into paying full price. She brought it up to him jokingly and he did not apologize and was condescending and again, rude. Another time we had a server at a high top in the bar area and he completely ignored us for almost a half hour. Same friend hunted him down all the way at the other end of the restaurant and his excuse was that we looked busy talking and he didn't want to disrupt. .....Our water glasses had been empty and our drinks cleared ages ago. The people who work here seem so spaced out! Most foods are meh, but some are pretty good, like the pulled pork sandwich and the raviolis. So... OK food, less than stellar service. Overpriced. There doesn't seem to be another place like it in the area, though. And it seems like it can be fun with the live music some nights. Nothing beats the summer patio bbq deal though! Too bad it doesn't go on year round inside.
