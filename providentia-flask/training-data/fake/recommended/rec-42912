Had my birthday dinner at this place this year and the food was delectable. The service was good I think largely in part to their small dining area. So few tables meant the wait staff could really keep up. The bar area was packed since it was a Saturday night. My only complaint with the place is that they only had one bathroom for the entire place so there was always a line. But upon getting into the bathroom the almond scented hand soap made up for the line.
