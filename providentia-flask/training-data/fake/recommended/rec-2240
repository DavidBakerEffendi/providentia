In my heart of hearts, I knew we should have ordered more than just the two pizzas for 5 hungry, semi-drunk people. Never under estimate the deliciousness of sweet sweet Adrienne's. Shuttling back and forth between Chicago and NY, arguably two of the biggest pizza cities in the country, I think I know my 'za. I've been continually disappointed by pizza in NY (see my review on Lombardi's) and Adrienne's was the white knight to my pizza-deprived damsel in distress. We kept it simple - just a cheese and a pepperoni, which was more than enough to tingle and tantalize my taste buds. The sauce is scrumptiously seasoned, the brick oven crust crispy, and the cheese fresh and flavorful. The five of us moaned and groaned like we were in the midst of some kind of pizza orgy and after wards, declared that it was the best pizza NY had to offer. Blasphemous you say? Don't poo-poo it until you've tried it. Post-feast, I noticed there was one piece left...did I feel bad about taking such piece? No. Lesson learned. Always order more Adrienne's than you think you can eat - the leftovers won't be a disappointment.
