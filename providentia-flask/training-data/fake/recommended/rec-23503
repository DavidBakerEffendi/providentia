This is a belated (!) review update. I went to Cloverleaf for their St. Patrick's Day brunch. It was absolutely amazingly delicious and so much of it. Huge choices. I have been to Cloverleaf Tavern many many times and of course I highly rate it. Why 4 stars and not 5? It gets VERY crowded and VERY noisy at times. I strongly urge you to call ahead. Parking in rear gets filled quickly. Park on a side street. It is handicapped accessible except the door in the rear has a bit of Â height and the door is heavy. Request help which the staff will happily provide.
