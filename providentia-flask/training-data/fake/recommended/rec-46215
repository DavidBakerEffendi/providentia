So, so, so good. And not that expensive! The stand opens at 730pm and we got there around 715 in anticipation. THere was already a line halfway down the block. People will and have killed for this place. It's that good. Tips: Always ask for an extra thing of white sauce. I went back later to get more and they accused me of stealing (I wouldn't blame people who are tempted to steal this stuff). And the red sauce is HOT (something akin to sriracha, but stronger), so add a little at a time. I learned that the hard way. I'd buy one and eat it there and buy another one for the road, but that's just me. And I got the "combo" with gyro and chicken. If you don't know what you want, you should try that one out first.
