Potatoes, toppings, sauces.. What more could you ask for?  What a great concept.  I love this place.  I've had the build your own shoestring fries, smashed hit, and build your own mashed potato bowl.  The sauces really make them all.  The roasted pepper sauce is my fav.  I live in the East Village but venture over to the West side on a fairly regular basis, specifically to indulge at Potatopia.  Obsessed.
