My husband and I had two totally different experiences - As the others indicate service is hit/miss.  Our service was fine, my husband loved his dish (brocolli and chicken dish) and said he would for sure go back and he would rate the place with 4 stars. I had the needle noodle shrimp - it tasted good, but did you ever start to eat something and something just doesn't feel right or taste right?  I ate about 4 forks full, and the shrimp were tasty, the noodles ok, I thought needle noodles were really skinny noodes but they are really thick like worms (maybe that turned me off too). I barely made it home ..if you know what I mean! I may try again just not sure.
