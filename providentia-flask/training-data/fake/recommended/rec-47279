Great place to have brunch, and their regular menu is pretty impressive as well. Even though the waiting time (without booking a table) can be really really long, the wait is worthy. Their egg benedict are pretty awesome, the sauce was really well prepared. Their Goat Cheese Omelette tasted pretty good too. On the other hand, from their regular menu, its ravioli pasta was the only thing I tried but it was pretty good. Isabella is known for being a brunch place, so I didn't expect much of its regular menu, but the pasta entree blew me away. As for their service, hostess and waitress/waiters are very nice to people and caring. Overall this is one of my favorite brunch places in Manhattan, every time I go, I enjoy the food more and more. Highly recommended!
