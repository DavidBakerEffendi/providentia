My friend suggested that we stop into the Mood Cafe and even though I had no idea what a lassi was I decided to give it a try.  My friend wasn't sure if she wanted peach or blueberry but the owner told her that he'd make it for her and if she didn't like it he'd make her the other one.  She ended up loving the peach that he made for her.   When it came to my turn I went for the strawberry and whenever I told him that I'd be splitting it with my girlfriend he added more into the mixture, making enough to fill both of our glasses because, as he said he "didn't want us to fight" over one person having more than the other.  The lassi was reasonably priced and tasty and he is just such a nice guy.  I would definitely recommend it!
