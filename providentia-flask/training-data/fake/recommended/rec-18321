OMG, THIS Place Has AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD!! We left Completely Satisfied! And Full! If You Are Craving Mexican Food--give Los Gallos a try! After my Mom & I had Lunch, we were looking for Someone to take with us to go back for Dinner!! Yep! It was THAT GOOD!! The owner came and talked with us. We had a great conversation that made us feel like he would do any & every Thing for us to Enjoy his Hard work and Love that he puts into his 15hour days to make Us & Every other person Enjoy his Food! Thank You for Making My Mom and I feel Welcomed, Giving us HOT Delicious food, AND Giving BIG PORTIONS of well flavored Food! We were planning to visit family in the area, but since the Food was SO DANG GOOD, we went back to New Jersey and shared our leftovers with my sister & her family. Word of mouth is a powerful thing in My Family! Ummm by the way, I should have gotten the owners' name. Not only will this restaurant develop into an Amazing "Go To" Place, but it will get BUSY!! So.... You MEXICAN FOOD LOVERS, Go Now! Get Your Mexican Fix!!! (For the owner..... I tried to get in touch with you tonight. I will call you tomorrow. Something I need to talk to you about.)
