Savas is a little better than your run of the mill college pizzeria in some ways, and in some ways - much, much worse.   Lets start off with the good. The beer selection at Savas is really really good.  A great variety that all types of beer drinkers would be able to enjoy.  The same goes for the bar, a good selection with nice beers on tap, not too much to complain about.   The panini's are awesome; always nice and crispy with plenty of gooey cheese if thats your fancy.  The pizza slices are pretty huge which is always a plus with the college scene.   The atmosphere is pretty spot on for a college aged customer base, that still sometimes needs to take their parents out to eat.  Music + TV's = a nice atmosphere. Now for the bad. The pizza slices may be big, but they are just sort of meh.  Nothing really is separating the pizza from Savas from any take out pizza place, and for a joint that sells so much pizza - thats a bit of a surprise.  Savas also tends to be a little pricey, the taste never quite measures up to the cash you dish out.  But the worst part of Savas HAS to be the servers.  They always seem to have an attitude about them, get distracted really easily, and you and your food are always seemingly at the bottom of the priority list.  Now, I am not talking about when they are behind the counter for take out orders - then they are fine, but as soon as they go from there to the dining area, you get the feeling that they think you are wasting their time by eating in their establishment.  In addition to the lousy wait staff - when you are ordering for take out - best call before you get there to expedite the process, because when I say they are slow, that is an understatement.
