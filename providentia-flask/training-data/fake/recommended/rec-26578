Wanted to try this as it looked the best out of places I could see online that delivered. Since I'm out of town and staying in a hotel for work, I found out they do deliver, but that their bike-delivery person won't cross the bridge to 'another city,' even though the hotel is only 1.3 miles away from the restaurant. I walked the route earlier when I was looking for places to eat. No hills, no issues. Didn't get a distance answer either when I asked what the minimum was. Regardless, the woman on the phone was super helpful and nice, and I appreciated her recommendations for what to order.... Standards for catering to visitors with delivery - pretty sub par.
