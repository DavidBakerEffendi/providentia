Excellent atmosphere, awesome food, friendly staff. I don't have any particular comments to make, I simply felt they deserved a positive rating for my first experience there. EDIT: I've been back a few more times since my initial visit. It's always just such a great place to eat. The atmosphere, food, A++++
