Definitely  a let down.  The sushi here just isnt good.  None of it.  The beef negimaki was essentially overcooked steak-ums around over cooked scallions.  The only redeeming factor here is that it is a BYOB.   If you dont trust my judgment and decide to check it out, make sure they dont seat you next to the open flames of the kitchen.   I roasted for an hour and even the a/c vent on me could not cool me down.
