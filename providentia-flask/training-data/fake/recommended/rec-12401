The food was VERY good! The service: not so much. We got the Cuban sandwich and the avacado BLT and they were great! Prepared and cooked perfectly. My wife got the Yucuajito cocktail (coconut rum, pineapple juice and mint topped with larger slivers of coconut) and it was excellent!! Highly recommend!
