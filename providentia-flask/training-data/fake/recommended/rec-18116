Local 44 is one of the places I miss the most and the least about living in West Philadelphia.  The beer selection is fantastic, and every bartender and server I've had is always able to make good recommendations.  I also have a giant soft spot for the Philly gastropubs (the word is here to stay) where vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores can coexist in peace.  Booze helps. What do I not like about Local 44?  Service can be really slow, especially weekend brunch.  The groups awaiting tables look like hovering buzzards, and once seated it can take over an hour to get food.  Service isn't bad; I just get the impression that they're understaffed and prefer not to rush.  When it's not super-busy, service is fast, especially at the bar.  Also, the vegan scrapple tastes like really dense moist bread.  Is that really what meat scrapple tastes like?  (PS - Sorry about using the word "moist," but it's true.)
