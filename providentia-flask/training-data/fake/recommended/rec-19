I was completely blown away by my meal here for my birthday.  I don't even know where to start.  The wait staff was very attentive (I wish I could remember our server's name so I could give them a shout out).  Their beer list, while small, featured some pretty amazing brews; it apparently rotates appropriately throughout the year.  The wine list was more extensive and the server was well-versed in making suggestions.  The crudo appetizer was fresh, the halibut with strawberry gazpacho was surprising and delicious, and my husband was a huge fan of the oyster appetizer and the duck breast. I will admit that the restaurant can get loud as it fills up (I recommend grabbing an early reservation), but everything else really makes up for it.  I was pretty charmed by all the nuances of our meal and I hope to get back to Fitler Dining Room soon.
