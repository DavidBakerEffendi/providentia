Stopped here because they had a huge sign in the window advertising their new frozen yogurt. When I went in, the guy told me there wasn't any frozen yogurt- weird and basically false advertising! I got a few bagels to take home and a tub of the plain cream cheese they make in-house. Both were good and the guy gave me more cream cheese than I paid for (his mistake) and didn't make me pay extra for it. I haven't been in there again though and as other reviewers have said, there is never anyone eating in here.
