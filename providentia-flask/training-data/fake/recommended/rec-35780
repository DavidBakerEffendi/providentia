So..after reading the reviews And visiting last weekend.. I must say I am a little disappointed. Visited Philly w the girlfriend from Charlotte and both our entrees were extremely salty, the portion sizes are small, and the tuna I warn u is cold even our appetizer was cold. The only silver lining are there drinks which is prob the best mojito I've had. Great place for socializing etc not the best Cuban food seek elsewhere
