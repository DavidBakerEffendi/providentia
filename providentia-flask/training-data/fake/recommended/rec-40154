Pros: Good beer list, neat atmosphere, good for groups (if you get there early enough), cool bathrooms, great brunch. Definitely a place to take people when they're in town...it's a one-of-a-kind of a spooky, funky, strange place. Cons: Gets REALLY crowded. The dinner menu is totally disappointing, I've had the calamari, fish and chips, crab cake sandwich and one of the salads. Just blah...nothing special. The service is just OK...not the friendliest or warm and fuzzy people but they seem to get the job done. Overall: I would much prefer this place for brunch than for dinner. The brunch crowd was chill and the do-it-yourself bloody mary bar is pretty neat. However, the dinner food and service (as well as bartenders) could use some help. Interesting bar scene if you can find a place to sit.
