Let's title this post "Dirt Salad." We tried this place despite the mediocre Yelp ratings because it's nearby and looks appealing from the street.  Plus, we thought the slow service issue might be mitigated by going at lunch, when we were the only customers in the place.  No luck.  It still took a surprisingly long time for the good to come out.   My husband liked his burger but said the fries were only OK.  I ordered the quinoa & arugula salad which LOOKED promising, but every few bites contained grit.  Not just little bits, but large grains of sand.  For some reason, I couldn't spot it with my eyes, but the crunching was so loud my husband could hear it.  I was actually afraid I might damage my teeth.   I probably should have sent the salad back, but I was so hungry and they were so slow.  Plus, because I have a gluten allergy, there wasn't anything else on the menu for me to order anyway.  A replacement salad might well have been as sandy as the first. I told the (very nice) waiter about the salad being gritty before we left in hopes of sparing future customers' teeth.  He did not offer to take it off the bill, but I wasn't really expecting him to. I doubt I'll ever go back.
