Casa Mono sits quietly on a corner in the East Village and is truly a Spanish gem - and Michelin star - in the neighborhood. What first made me excited was the fact they feature Estrella beer - a local Barcelona favorite - which I thoroughly enjoyed drinking when I lived in Barcelona years back. Definitely get anything with pork!  Divine.  We also tried the scallops, Bacalao croquetas, and confit goat.  The goat was surprisingly the take-away. The best plate?  The bread pudding.  Get it!
