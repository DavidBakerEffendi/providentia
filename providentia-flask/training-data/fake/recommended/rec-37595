Nice selection of craft beer options. Well balanced. Food is decent enough. Nothing making me run here with so many options in the surrounding area. Service at the bar is always friendly. Place is a bit dark and I have always been bothered by the amount of flies that are inside the place. Still, great beer at a reasonable price with growlers to go.
