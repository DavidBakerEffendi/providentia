I came in here with my girlfriend after seeing so many rave reviews, and the experience was a huge letdown to say the least. We ordered the Spicy Basic with thin noodles and chicken and Miso with wavy noodles and pork, and bland is the word that describes everything. Bland broth, bland meat. Even the bamboo shoots and eggs had no flavor. And the noodles don't quite taste like ramen noodles should. Granted they do allow you to mix and match different broths and five different noodles, but Hide-Chan offers the same variety and yet tastes much better. In fact I'd say every other ramen place I've been to in the city tastes better than this. Yet this place was packed. How did it become so popular?
