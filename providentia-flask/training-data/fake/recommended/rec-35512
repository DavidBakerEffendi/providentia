The pizza here was okay, but the cocktails and bread and butter are out of this world!!! I could sit here and drink Bloody Marys and eat their beautifully crispy and soft bread all day. The salted butter is bomb, bomb, bomb. We also received excellent service from Emmanuel who happens to be a five star server from back home in the Bay Area (see his reviews at Nopa)! The rest of the waitstaff was also very accommodating, considering we had all of our bags with us, as we were about to shuffle off to the airport. Apparently this is commonplace at lunch, as there were at least a dozen other people with wheeled luggage rolling around in there. Worth the visit.
