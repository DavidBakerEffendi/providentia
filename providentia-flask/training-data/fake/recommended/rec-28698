I was very disappointed during my recent trip to Kefi. I'll start off by saying, though, that the octopus appetizer was very good as was the "spreads" appetizer. Unfortunately, my main course, the braised lamb shank with orzo, was terrible. There was so much salt in this dish, I wasn't able to eat more than 3 bites. And the orzo tasted like it had been cooked in butter. 1 of the worst dishes I've had anywhere in quite a while. And when I told my waiter about the salt issue, he just said something like "sorry, maybe they put in too much salt".
