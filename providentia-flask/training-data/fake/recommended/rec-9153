There is a reason the line here starts before the cart oven is even turned on. There is a reason that even the cart down the block is virtually line-less. This is the best Halal cart in the city. Perhaps the best anything-cart in the city. And if you like to cry while you eat (as I do), then ask for extra hot sauce. It is excellent. I have traveled up and across town just to eat here. Note: Be sure you're at the right spot: yellow shirts with the name on the back, yellow plastic bags, often long line, only open 7:30PM - 4AM. Beware impostors...
