Try their crispy chicken people! Crispy chicken over pork chops!   i think the way a restaurant cooks chicken tells you a lot about the caliber of the restaurant's food in general.  Other meats are easy to make well.  Chicken is a little more difficult.  And damn they made a good chicken for me that night.
