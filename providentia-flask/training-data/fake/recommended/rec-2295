I like this place compared to other ramen places in Philly (nom nom, hiro) because of the more versatile menu that includes curry and donburi. I like the miso ramen and the spicy ramen but not the terakawa ramen (which is their tonkotsu). The only thing I don't like about their ramen is that their meat isn't as thick cut and sometimes not as soft as other places. So if meat is really important I would suggest nom nom which I think does better job.
