Astonishing that so many Yelpers are gaga over Balthazar.  My  wonderful husband and I arrived at 6 pm, the only time we could get a reservation, and the door was chock-a-block with tourists.  The pretty young woman behind the reservation dias was on the phone and completely distracted and everyone waited around for a while.  When we were finally ushered to our table, the meal was a blur. Once our polite waitress took our order, our appetizers were out immediately.  Several wait staff hovered while we ate.  The moment we were finished, our entrees, which had been on a buffet near our table, were presented.  We were interupted numerous times during romatic conversation with an obligatory "is everything okay?"  The food was decent but I've never felt so pushed through a meal in all of my dining experiences in New York.  Balthazar is clearly about "turning the tables."  And as to the "scene," well, great, but you can see a lot of these tourist prowling around 5th Avenue and SoHo.  It's all about the money, baby!
