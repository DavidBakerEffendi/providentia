amazing food here! Â i've been to ilili 3 times now and each time i love it more =) these are items i always get... 1. fresh meadow cocktail - omg this stuff is soooooo good, refreshing, a little sweet, and alcoholic! 2. hommus - you can get a combination of little bit of everything, definitely a great starter with the bread they also give you 3. kebab kerez - this is a combination of lamb and beef meatballs, the cheery sauce is amazing 3. lamb chops - lets just say that they know how to cook their lamb =) 4. lobster hommus - unique and very good for seafood lovers, comes with oyster mushroom on the side i am definitely going back soon =)
