My Fiancee and I had the pleasure of patronizing Do or Dine last Friday.  If first impressions mean anything, we walked in and immediately commented on the decor, which was very eclectic and pleasing.  We both loved the subway tiled kitchen area and though the bar was a bit small, it was really cool.  Kudos to the person who designed the space. The drinks list was really great.  It is one of a handful of places that serve Highland Park Scotch, so I was a very happy boy.  My fiancee opted for a specialty drink that included jalapeño.  Her drink was very tasty; and I must say well imagined executed.   We ordered 3 small plates, the lamb breast, the e666gs, and Jalapeno popper type thing ( name escapes me). Lamb breast was perfect.  Fatty, a tad gamey, and spiced perfectly.  if you like lamb you will more than likely love this plate. E666s were great.  Deviled eggs with Mentaiko.  It was really tasty.   Jalapeno popper type thing...really good.  I believe that they were stuffed with mascarpone and tempura fried.  The mascarpone and bit of the jalapenos were really complimentary.  It was hot enough to please the desire for heat, but one could actually enjoy the flavors of the mascarpone and jalapeno. On another note, I believe that their pricing is fantastic.  it is a real bargain if you want to experience unique flavors that would cost you twice as much in Manhattan.  I am definitely a fan.
