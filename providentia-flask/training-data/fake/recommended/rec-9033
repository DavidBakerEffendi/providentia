Best. Pasta. Ever. Had one of the specials...farfalle with pesto.  You can tell it was freshly made, and the ingredients were flavorful without being overbearing.  Also tried the Tagliatelle per our server's recommendation, and we were not disappointed.  Plan on revisiting again soon just to experience more of the pasta dishes!  If you go here, and while I have not sampled any of the appetizers, I would forgot the appetizers and get some pasta dishes as starters instead.  Judging from our neighboring patrons, we weren't the only ones to order pasta as our appetizers. Also had the cuttlefish special, stuffed with crabmeat.  I've never had cuttlefish before...the texture is similar to octopus...but it's pod-like so perfect for stuffing.  :)  My boyfriend had the Petroniana.  It was perfect. The decor is quaint and rustic.  I will, without a doubt, return...and recommend this place to anyone craving pasta.
