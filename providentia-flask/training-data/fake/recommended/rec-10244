This place has the best "Halal Street Meat" in the cit This title obviously encompasses both PROS and CONS. On the positive side, the portions are hearty, the turnover is constant (the less time for the food to sit there, the better), and the staff is rather friendly. The meat is cooked to perfection (as perfect as street meat can be lol) and the rice perfectly absorbs the sauces (white sauce, hot sauce, bbq and/ or mustard) and the flavor of the chicken and/or "lamb". The price is also a selling point. Depending on how much you are willing to pay or actually have in your pocket after a long night of drinking or a rough morning at the office lol you can either pay $5 or $6 for a plate. The plates also included chopped pieces of pita bread that mix in perfectly. CONS: As with any form of street food, your stomach may not be entirely pleased with you after consuming this meal (especially when mixed with alochol) but overall I would definitely say that the satisfaction outweighs the mild regret. The lines for this place can be absurd especially on Th Fri and Sat nights after everyone leaves the bars for the mass exodus to 53rd and 6th avenue. I would recommend getting here early for lunch or at a reasonable hour if you're looking to stuff your face real quick. Oh yeah and one more thing, PLEASE DONT FIGHT ANYONE IN THE LINE WHEN YOU'RE HAMMERED AT 3 IN THE AM. IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT lol.
