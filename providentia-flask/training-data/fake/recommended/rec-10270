Starting off with signature cocktails in the bar area, we were hooked...elegant and classy... ask for a tour of the restaurant ..this place is awesome ! There is the "snug room" ask about the history behind this..upstairs is quite unique as well as the downstairs whiskey room. On to the food.. great breads from a local bakery, the olive one was great! The kale salad was awesome and the crab cake and chowder Â were pure fish, . A number of different dishes were sampled in our group..salmon, braised short ribs, and risotto with shrimp; all delicious. A few creme brulees, pumpkin ice cream and apple cobbler..we were done! Great wine selection, attentive service..we will return on the next venture into the city!
