Went here for a late breakfast. Great location and good interior. Different kinds of seating depending on what youre looking for. Small but complete menu with coffees sandwhiches salads smoothies and other snacks. My egg sandwhich on wheat with veggies was cooked perfectly and didnt have too many of each ingredient (spinach tomato onion cheese) so nothing was falling out. My iced chai latte was very watered down with milk so it didnt really have that chai kick. Took just under 20 mins to get the sandwich, the chai was right away. I will go back for food/friendly customer service and location.
