I live across the street so I pop in quite often to have one of their new draft beers which is on a rotation or expand my beer prowess by trying one of their litterally 100's of bottles. The food is great the pork schnitzel hits the spot every time when Steve is bar backing with Marlena good times will be had by all definitely worth checking out if you're in the fairmount area!
