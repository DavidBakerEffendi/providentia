My restauranteur friend says negative yelp reviews suck, since no one tells them in person. She said leave 10% and talk to the manager. So I did, but the manager's response was worse than the service that I received, so I have to write this. To sum: Sat outside, 15 minutes to order, beer order was messed up, after I got my food she never came back , water ran dry. After a long time, I had to give my credit card to the host, since my waitress was MIA. All SHE came back with was the charge slip, no bill, so I have NO idea what I paid for. I talked to the manager. Her response:   "I'm sorry, I hope that doesn't deter you from coming back."  Awkward silence. Um, it  does deter me, that's why I'm coming to you. I'm not sure what I was expecting but something different. "Oh she messed up your beer order? Your next one is on is."  Something. A pulse. An eye twitch....
