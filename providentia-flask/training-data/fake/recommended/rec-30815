I am so picky it's disgusting. When people talk about the sauce there is a VERY good reason. The sauce is made from the tears of Italian unicorns and blessed by the hands of a million nonna's. If all I had was the sauce and nothing else I would still give this place 5 stars. What we ate: Caesar salad- THE CROUTONS WERE AMAZING!! How do they make the croutons so damn good?!?!? They took the time to make melt-in-your-mouth croutons. Bless them! Rice Balls with crack sauce - Get them, don't think, just order Rubirosa Supreme Pizza - we ordered a small. The small is definitely enough for two people (probably not two men) another great choice. I'm going to just say Â this as a native new Yorker: best pizza in New York. There was a bit of a wait but who cares it's worth it. Last bit... I can't remember our waiters name because I had two of the Apple Brandy Sazerac (if you love a good STRONG, well made drink this will please your palate) but he was the BEST. Tall, skinny, jovial WONDERFUL!!!
