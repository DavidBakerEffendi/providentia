This has recently become my new go-to pizza place. I love the fact that they deliver and the service is fast and friendly. Their pies are authentic NJ fare, with great tasty crust.  I love their garlic knots which I always get and are awesome.  I've also had good luck with their subs which were large, well made with quality meats and great tasting rolls.  Lastly, they've been kind enough to throw in an item as a freebie from time to time which I thought was an awesome gesture and has won me over as a return customer.  To be honest, there are a lot of good pizzerias in the area, but Cafe Antonio's good, honest food and fast delivery.... keeps us coming back for more!
