Totally lived up to and surpassed the hype! Friends always rave about the food here, and I was just thinking how good can it really be? We got the chicken and gyro combo over rice plus two falafel balls for $1 extra. The food is great, and it tastes even better with the spicy and yogurt/tzatziki sauce. The spicy sauce -- you only need a little bit. All of us went back for more of the yogurt sauce! I'd love to go back for more.
