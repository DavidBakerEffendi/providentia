It's our first time coming here, and the service is excellent and friendly!! The ambiance is really nice.. Empanadas, DELISH!!! Especially the guava and goat cheese wheat empanadas.. the drinks are good too!! We had the red sangria, white sangria n strawberry caiphirina!! The pork chiccharones were really good too!! Definitely a place to come back to!!
