BEST EGGS BENEDICT!! Seriously if you come here for brunch (like I did) you must get the eggs Benedict which are perfection! Everything about this dish is awesome, the biscuit is flaky and buttery and the home fries are AMAZING! I replaced the bacon with spinach and it was still fantastic. Their mimosas are also pretty good as is their coffee. The service was really good as well, we were seated pretty fast and the server was nice and helpful.
