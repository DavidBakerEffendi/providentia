Decided to switch it up and go here for my morning coffee instead of my usual downtown Starbucks. Ordered a large regular coffee. Horrible. Tasted burnt and flavorless and cost more than Starbucks! I tossed it after one sip and walked across the green to get my venti pike. Can't say anything about their food or espresso but the regular coffee is just not worth it.
