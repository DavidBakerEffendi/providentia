You need to eat here.  It is seriously the best restaurant in the Baltimore Ave area.  My boyfriend and I live about a block away and eat here at least once a week.  Hassan is very friendly and will make something special for you.  If you ask questions, you will get exactly what you want.  I'm vegan and he is very good at accommodating.  Everything, including the lassis, can be made vegan.  If you order Indian hot, be prepared, it's a heat that builds over time.  You'll be happy that you bought that lassi on the side (or got a free one for being a member of his facebook group).  Food is inexpensive and pretty fast.  Comes packaged in a nice plastic tupperware type thing that I now use for all my leftovers.  Seriously, though, this place is outstanding.
