I ate here after a late night show at the Tin Angel.  It was right next door and I felt sorta safe going there... kinda worried about walking to my car but luckily some other people I know ate there too.  I was glad that it was open late on a Sunday night and they still served food because I was hungry.  I was stationed in the Navy, up in Willow Grove PA, so I went back for a visit.  I had a cheese steak here and it was with provolone which is how I like it.  The water was great!  Course the water in CA is crappy. Parking is near but expensive.
