So amazing!  Playing the tourist on a foody trip to NYC, one of the Momofuku establishments had to be on my to-visit list.  As part of a group of 11, we just missed the cut-off number to make a bo ssam only reservations.  No problem, instead, I inquired about the prix fixe menu which is required for any groups larger than 10. Best deal/meal ever!  At $55 before tax and tip (about $70/per person after), the five course meal so so worth it.  In order to make the reservation, I had to sign a contract and pay a 50% deposit (before tax and tip) upfront, which I've never had to do before.  No issues though. Our group arrived a few minutes before our 8pm reservation and the beautiful, empty table was just sitting there, waiting for us.  I say beautiful, because it's hard to imagine open space in a popular restaurant in New York. The food - simply, creatively, great!  The unexpected addition of peppercorn in the corvina was a very nice touch.  The country ham had a nice, salty depth.  The steamed pork buns.  So much has been said about those, I really can't add more rave reviews for it.  The pickled veggies was kind of odd by themselves as we weren't 'beering' it up with that as a side in an Asian pub.  A bit much, but tasty.  The star of course, was the bo ssam.  Even between 11 of us, we couldn't manage to finish the monster chunk of meat. A bunch of satisfied customers!
