DiNic's is about as good as it gets for a roast pork, provolone and rabe sandwich.  The line can be slow at lunch time, but that's due to the tourists -- you can sometimes get lucky with a counter seat though.  The counter service is very good, the waitress has been there for years and she's extremely attentive and friendly.  It might not be the best sandwich in the world, but it's reallllly good.
