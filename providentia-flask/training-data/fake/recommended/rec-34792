Despite the hype and touristy quality, this was pretty decent pizza. We were seated within 30 minutes and were taken to the downstairs dining area. We ordered a large margherita with sausage and pepperoni on half. The dough was deliciously crusty and chewy. Though I'm not a fan of sausage on pizza, the homemade sausage had good flavor. The four of us easily finished it. A little too easy since we decided to order a medium white pizza. For a regular meal, this would have been stupid but since we were visiting and wouldn't be back, we had to try it. Totally worth it. The white pizza was chock full of cheese, stringy and delicious. Definitely not a pizza you can have every day but worth trying. If I go back, it'll be to try the clam pie.
