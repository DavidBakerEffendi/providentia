This place is ONLY cash. As for the food we ordered chicken tika boti... Which came with basmati rice. I must say it was mediocre at best... Charcoals pieces of chicken which was juicy but too charred! The decor could use a lot of work. The appearance of this place is not exactly inviting. But I was desperate I had no wheels waiting on service it was either this or McDonald's!
