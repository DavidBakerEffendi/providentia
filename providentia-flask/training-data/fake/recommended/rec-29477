I love everything about this place and go back again and again. I go just to get a beer, I go for dinner, I go on Sunday nights to watch the movie... I did go once for brunch and probably wouldn't do that again. Not that anything was wrong with the food but I learned that I don't really crave heavy, gravy covered, Teutonic food first thing on a Sunday. Maybe you do, I dunno. I love the pork Wiener Schnitzel with roasted potatoes and cucumber salad. Potatoes as a side tend to be a throw away at most moderately priced restaurants, but I really like theirs. The Bratwurst or Kielbasa with Sauerkraut is also a favorite.     I don't know if the other reviews have mentioned this, but the restaurant seems to be especially gay friendly. At dinner last night, of the six two person table surrounding us, three were lesbian couples and there seemed to be a scene going at the bar too.
