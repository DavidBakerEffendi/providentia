This place has a great happy hour! Their amazing tuna tartare, which is normally $14, is only $5 (and didn't seem any smaller in size, or less delicious). Such a deal. I also tried bison for the first time here in the form of their bison sliders and they were soo good (and also only $5). Their burgers were huge and looked yummy, too. They have a nice beer selection that's half-off during happy hour, which translates to somewhere from $2.50-$3.50 each. ---- The first time I came here was actually for a real dinner, and I had the tuna tartare (which was amazing then, too, just pricey) and a pesto pasta dish which I can't remember the name of. The dish was okay. It seemed to be lacking in flavor to me, which is strange because I normally love pesto. It wasn't bad by any means, just bland. Salt helped a little, but it was not something I would order again. I will note that my roommate seemed very satisfied with her dish. I tried some of hers as well - it was very good. I don't know how often I'll be coming here for dinner (read: not often because I'm a poor student), but their happy hour is definitely something I'll be coming back to. But I've heard their brunch is bangin' as well... may have to check it out sometime.
