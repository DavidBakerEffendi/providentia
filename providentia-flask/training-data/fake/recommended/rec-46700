Very good food and fresh. The quality of all the food is some of the best you will find anywhere. Customer service is EXCELLENT and fast. Almost too fast. We like to take our time and enjoy and linger longer than some in between bites. And sometimes you get the feeling they are trying to push you out the door. We have been there over 30 times so it's a regular on our list. If you eat in be prepared to leave smelling like your eating in the kitchen LOL. But you don't smell it while your in there.
