It was a dark and stormy night....Truly it was.  I walked a few blocks to the restaurant. I was cold, feeling a bit run down and extremely hungry. The place was full. I took a seat at the bar. (thanks to a good friend)  Great bartender (professional and personality) Enjoyed a nice glass of vino to warm my body. I ordered the red snapper creamy grits, roasted brussel sprouts. Oh Lawdy. It made me forget about the weather outside. Every bite of the meal was delicious. It was a perfect portion. The fish was perfection. The grits warmed my soul. The brussel sprouts were the best I have ever tasted. I am looking forward to going back to The Red Owl Tavern. The architecture, the bartenders and the yummy dinner. I will try something new. But I must say I have to order the the snapper, grits and brussel sprouts as well. Note: My good friend swears by the freshly made desserts. I was so happy about my meal I forgot to try them. Highly recommend this place
