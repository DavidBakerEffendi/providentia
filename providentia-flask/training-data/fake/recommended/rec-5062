Great Mexican food. Generally I don't think New York has good Mexican food but this place is actually very good. The brunch menu is awesome. They got rid of 2$ sangrias and 3$ margaritas on weekends which is why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4. The hosts can sometimes be a little spacey and slow. The servers are generally really good. The food is consistently reasonably good.
