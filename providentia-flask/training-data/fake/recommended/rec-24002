The veggie burger with everything on it is just wonderful, and they have a huge selection of produce for such a tiny store. They are super nice in here and everything has a price tag on it so you don't have to ask. I luv Palm Tree. Also they have a nice selection of seaweed snacks if you're into that kinda thing!!!
