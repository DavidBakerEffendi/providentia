Oh Momofuku how I love thee but I do not love how you take all of my money! So here's the lowdown. Hubby and I decided to spend an entire week eating our way through NYC. Naturally, we had to make a stop at one of our favorite restuarants: Ssam bar...well maybe 2 stops! We had been here on our last NYC trip 2 years prior. On our first visit we had the WHOLE Rotisserie Duck...yes, you heard me right. the WHOLE duck at $140 for a measly 2 people. Everyone dining there during lunch that day thought we were crazy. We were. Truth be told there were supposed to be 4 of us but our friends were feeling under the weather. The policy at Ssam is that you have to have a minimum of 4 people for the whole duck...we were nervous that they would not let us keep our reservation now that there were only 2. The hubby calls and leaves them a message telling them that our party is reduced to 2. They call us back and ask if we want to cancel or if we still want to keep our reservation. UM, NOOOOO we will not cancel. Hubby has been looking forward to this meal for weeks -- no way is he canceling. So we showed up. I ATE and ATE and ATE...that pan did not look like it was getting any smaller. I can honestly say I am DUCKED OUT. It was effing delicious. Just as good if not better than the first time. Worth every penny! We ended up eating the leftovers for lunch the next day too! Anyway, they now have a lunch portion of the Rotisserie duck for $15. You can add lettuce and the chive pancakes for an additional fee. Not sure if the fried duck fat is part of the lunch version or not but all I can say is $15-20 is much more affordable than $140! We will definitely be back for lunch :-)
