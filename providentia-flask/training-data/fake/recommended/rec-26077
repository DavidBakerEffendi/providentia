Went opening night, and the house was packed with a celebratory mood.  Got 2 pans of cornbread with bacon and jalapeños for the table.  Four of us agreed if we could only eat one thing for the rest of our lives, it could be Brooklyn Star cornbread!  Entrees on the table: Pork shank, bacon wrapped trout and country fried steak.  It was all incredible.  Not a single mediocre point to the whole meal!
