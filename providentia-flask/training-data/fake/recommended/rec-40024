I LOVE this place!!! Dinics has the best italian pork sandwich and it is a huge portion for 8.50! I like it w roasted sweet peppers and provoline. Their provolone is right on point, it is so sharp! I only ever eat half of the sandwich and then get a canoli from the bearby bakery in the market. You will not be dissapointed at Dinics. If you are lucky ebough to get a seat sitdown and enjoy, otherwise the takeout line may look long (and this discourages some) but it moves very quickly and is worth the wait! It is peobably quicker toget food in the to go line than if you sit down.
