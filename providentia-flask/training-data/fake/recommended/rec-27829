Exceeded our high expectations. On a very busy Friday night, we accidentally arrived about 45 minutes early for our reservation. While we would normally have expected to sit at the bar and wait (as I was the one who had forgotten what time our reservation was), the host was extremely accommodating and had us at our table in under five minutes. The waitress was attentive and helpful. The gnocchi was absolutely perfect. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The lobster boil was very well done. No complaints at all. We'll definitely be back.
