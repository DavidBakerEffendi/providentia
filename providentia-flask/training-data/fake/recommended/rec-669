American Sardine Bar is a delight. I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal there. Last night I ordered the spaghetti sandwich and the onions rings. The onions rings are a must have but the spaghetti sandwich is everything you get out having spaghetti with garlic bread. Not to mention they now have outdoor seating and the staff is very friendly.
