Mogador is def top ten fav spots in ny! My boyfriend and i get there right when they open and go every other week. We wont go to any other brunch spot!Awesome staff, great food... New location looks beautiful. Only thing I'd change - please add more wines by the glass and potatoes and turnips to the tagines!!! ;) oh and if you love the harrisa as much as I do u can buy it to go!
