It is with GREAT sadness that I write this review :( In true Yelp fashion, I looked at all of the Little Italy restaurants for days online before deciding on Pellegrino's. It seemed well-received and worth the hefty price tag. I am here to tell you - ITS NOT!! I came here during San Gennaro, so the place was maybe busier than usual, but the service was just BLAH. The waiters were friendly enough, but not overly accommodating. As for the food, we started with rice balls which were SOOO disappointing. I couldn't even bring myself to finish them and I would eat a fried piece of leather (Hehe, just love junk food) They were FAR too doughy and tasteless.. and for a $15.00 APPETIZER you just expect more. For main courses, we both had the Fettucine Giovanni which is like an alfredo sauce with asparagus. It was very good and we enjoyed our main courses - but overall felt that this place is nothing to write home about. For one app, 2 glasses of wine (1 each) and 2 pasta dinners, $100 is just too much to not be blown away. Sorry Pellegrino's - I hoped you would be so much better!!!!
