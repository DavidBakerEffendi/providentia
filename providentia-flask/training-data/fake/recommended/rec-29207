We thought our meal here was fantastic.  I had the Cannoli French Toast and this was the most incredible french toast I've ever eaten.  I will warn if you're not into sweet food this probably isn't for you but otherwise it's great; go for it.  As as side I got the spicy fennel sausage which was also very very good.  The side portion is only for 1 as it is only a couple of links but its not really expensive so its no big deal.  Friends of ours who we were eating with us got the Potatoes as a side which I tried and were also very good.  Only downside, no reservations and it is pretty busy so you're likely to wait which, in a sense, kind of speaks to the quality of the food.  Cafe Lift is fine for groups but it is a tight space so I imagine anymore than 6 might be tougher.
