This place is completely overpriced, especially considering you have to order your food one place and then order your beer another place, all while waiting in line with popped collar douchebags. I want a discount already for having to even tolerate the losers who take ping pong seriously here. Had I never been to a German style sausage beer joint before I would have been clueless what to do when I walked in to this huge unorganized space. I don't want to go out to eat somewhere and feel like my patience is being tested the entire time that I am left waiting in lines to get some food and a drink. Like I said overpriced for having to do all the work myself. Just to have some scared looking 16 year old bring me my screwed up order because the young girl behind the counter was too busy flirting with the cook. Oh also I don't want to see kids running around a bar, ever. I know it has an outdoor space but it's not a freaking playground.
