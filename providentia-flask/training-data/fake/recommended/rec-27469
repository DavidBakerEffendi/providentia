OMGTHISISTHEBESTRICOTTAIHAVEEVERHAD. ...and I've had homemade from my family and from Italian deli's in NJ and NY but for some reason this sheep's milk ricotta was just sooo friggin good!! I think the way they use sea salt and a little bit of olive oil helps bring out the flavors of the cheese.  The bread that comes with it is standard Italian bread so the cheese is the main event.   Anyway, I had a ricotta flashback, I've composed myself now.  Went with a friend for brunch/lunch and had a great experience!  I wish it were summer so we could have sat outside but the place was decorated very pretty for the holidays and it was so cozy inside!  I had the lamb sandwhich and it was delicious.  Very Greek tastes to it and the lamb was soooo tender.  The lamb had so much flavor to it, it didn't need anything else but the sauce on it was very good and the bread it came had great flavor that complimented the meat well. We got the gingerbread for dessert and could have had 3 plates of it if they would have let us.  It was nothing fancy, just a basic dessert of gingerbread came with sauteed apples and a marscapone gelato but the flavors were so delicious and strong.  I wish there were more apples though because that may have been my favorite part. Didn't try any drinks because we were still finishing up our coffee (which btw they let us bring inside with us, very nice of them, I don't think most places would let you do that) but the drinks did look good and the bar area was packed. Had reservations but there wasn't a table ready for us yet - no biggie though, it happens and it was worth the extra wait.  Would love to enjoy this place outside in the summer!
