Roast pork v. pulled pork.  That was the big decision for me one snowy Saturday at DiNic's. Of all the kiosks at Reading Terminal, the line for DiNic's snaked longer than any other. But the line went fast (maybe 15 minutes) and impulsively I chose the roast pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe. Before taking a bite, I noticed that the sandwich seemed to have been dunked in pork jus. Now I generally don't like sandwiches that are dunked in jus b/c it makes the bread soggy and the sandwich sloppy. But here, the bread held up to the pork juices and still maintained texture. The combination of the roast pork (sliced like roast beef), sharp provolone, greens, and the bread was a wet, juicy, dripping good time. It tasted a lot cleaner and not as oily as I expected, probably due to the rabe, but the porkiness of the meat did get lost in the more powerful flavors of cheese and garlic from the rabe. I then looked over at my friend's pulled pork sandwich with provolone and hot peppers, and sneaked a couple bites.  Here, the pork definitely came through. I had expected chunks of pork in a sweet bbq sauce but I got moist, porky, flavorful, and savory. It exceeded all my expectations. Combined with the cheese and peppers, the porkiness still came through. In the age-old debate of roast pork v. pulled pork, my nod goes to the pulled pork.
