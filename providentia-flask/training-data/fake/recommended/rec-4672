The food was phenomenal-- from the jasmine tea to the crispy orange beef and the lighter General Tsao's chicken.  The vegetables were fresh and the pork fried rice had a decent amount of pork as well.   The ambience leaves something to be desired-- it's very quiet, which is relaxing, but if you're not in the mood for quiet conversation this isn't the spot.
