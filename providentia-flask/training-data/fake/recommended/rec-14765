Late night snack and the best bang for your buck here in midtown is what you want then this is the spot to be! Open from 7PM to 5am on Friday and Saturday, it's perfect for late night snack or just a really late dinner. Just be sure to go the one with the longest line as they are the original cart and the chicken, lamb or chicken/lamb and rice are always hot and fresh.
