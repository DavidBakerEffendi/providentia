Rarely am I out up in this neck of the woods, but I was definitely impressed and would easily recommend. Portions are on the side of massive, so order wisely and expect to share. I had the pasta sampler and would definitely recommend it if you are a first timer... oh, and if there's still room, feel free to share the dessert sampler. Next time I'll... go for an early dinner and a show... go with a few people to share
