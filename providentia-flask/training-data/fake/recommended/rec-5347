I went here for brunch last week and I was not disappointed. My friend and I started with a pitcher of sangria. It was a seasonal sangria and I believe it had blueberries and peaches in it. It was so good. We devoured the pitcher. I can't say it was very strong but it was tasty. For appetizers, we got the French onion soup dumplings. They were good but they were not my favorite. They seemed to more doughy in my opinion and not enough flavor. Not bad though. We also had the seared tuna on a bed of mushroom risotto. This was outstanding. The tuna was seared to perfection and I could have eaten the mushroom risotto every day for the rest of my life. My friend ended up getting the turkey burger blt which was huge. She enjoyed it. I was afraid to get the curry chicken naan-wich. You never know how strong the curry will be and I knew I was going out that night with a friend. The waiter who was also pretty good assured me that it wasn't a strong curry and tasted kind of sweet. I decided to get it and I am so glad that I did. It was delicious. Everything about it was perfect. I had a great meal here and will be coming back.
