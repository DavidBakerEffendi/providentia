On a tourist kick we went to the bar from "It's Always Sunny"  and was expecting a experience like the Bull and Finch Pub   but was greeted with a regular  close to dive bar.  Great Beer selection of locals and micro-brews from all over the US, not as many as other brewpubs, but a great selection across flavor profiles. Seemed like mostly college kids/ hipsters. It was quizo night, but we saw the quizo girls stop by a few time before a waitress showed up.   Food and Apps arrived.  Hummus was ok, didn't taste like it was made there.  Fish Tacos had some great heat and nice taste.   I'd rate it a little better that regular bar food, and their fries were great!
