Ever since I studied in Greece, I have always looked for a decent Greek place no matter where I happen to be traveling. Now that I live in NYC, I had been pretty disappointed in terms of finding a quick, tasty and legitimate Greek menu. Sure, you could go to Thalassa or the like to have a real sit-down meal, but what about the quick occasions that you need something hearty and fast? Greek usually perfectly fits the bill, but I hadn't had much luck in the city until this place. Cozy little space with a very legit Greek menu, with all the favorites: moussaka, souvlaki, spanikopita, baklava and even a couple of Greek beers (though no Mythos, my hands-down favorite). Went there 2 days in a row after I discovered it, and been pleased both times. I particularly recommend the garlic potato puree with pita and the warm chicken pie with mushrooms for lunch, and the deliciious eggplant stuffed with ground sirloin and bechemel sauce for dinner, though it is a special. The baklava serving size is HUGE and it is really very good, certainly comparable with some of the best homecooked stuff I've had. All in all, very dependable and authentic Greek cooking, reasonable prices, good service and good atmosphere. Certainly worth checking out, whether you need a quick snack while wandering SoHo or want to come out for a casual but romantic dinner.
