This is more like 4.5 stars, but in honor of the best ramen shop on Earth (Keichan's Ramen, near my house back in Japan) I have to round down. I've been here several times, and will go back again. Its cute, and tiny.  There are a few hard window seats, a ramen bar with perhaps 8 seats, and a couple tables.  One table can seat about 7 ppl.  The other can seat 4 ppl. Service is typically Japanese and all staff are Japanese. The ramen is the real deal.  The trick to miso ramen (should I say it...?) is to put peanut butter in the broth.  Some days they put more than other days, and it can be overdone, but it doesn't change the delicious factor.  Their pork is perfectly done, and their noodles are chewy just the way they should be.  I recommend everything I've had there (miso, soy, and miso skamen).  Man, just thinking about it makes me want to go over there right now! Ramen bowls are typically pricey (compared to Japan) at about $10-13, but you won't find anything this good for any cheaper in NYC. The service is fine, but it's a ramen shop - it's supposed to be about the ramen and your company.  Revel in the goodness.
