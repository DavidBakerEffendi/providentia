This is one of my favorite bars in the city. One can always be sure to find great craft beers, excellent food, and a fun crowd at Standard. The food ranges from burgers to much more exotic fare, yet they all seem to be executed well unlike some "gastro-pubs" that can be a little too ambitious and fall on their face. It is also really nice to have 5 different seating areas, including a roof deck, that provide a variety of different settings depending on what you like and the size of your group.
