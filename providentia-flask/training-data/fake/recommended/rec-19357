Wanted to love this place, but poor service left an overall bad impression. I came here with friends and they forgot the "b" in our lobster blt's!! When we asked our server for bacon, he brought out one serving right away but waited 20 minutes to bring out the other bacon. Seriously, 20 minutes for bacon?! They were not apologetic and only offered dessert when we complained. We were too full so we declined, but a deduction from the check would have been appreciated. Food was very good, but I am in no rush to return.
