What an awesome space! I LOVED the decor - feels super trendy and cool. Girls behind the bar were in sparkly sequin attire which made me feel like i was in Vegas. Totally awesome. I'd only previously been to the Chelsea location but this one's quite bigger. It's also a lot noisier. We were so close to the tables on either side of us I could've leaned over and eaten from their dish. Wasn't easy to have conversation but once food made it to the table we had nothing to say - we were too busy eating! Variety and selection for veg eaters was limitless and they'll modify anything for you according to diet or allergies. I think if I came back I'll do a weekday late in the evening so tables are not so on top of each other. Staff was hustlin' though so food came out: PRONTO!
