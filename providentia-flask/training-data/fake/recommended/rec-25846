If you love Lebanese food to death - then you are either going to love or hate this place. The typical lebanese mezzes found in any middle eastern restaurnat, like hummus, falafel and baba ghanouj are nothing to write about - very average, and I would even say Persepolis does a much much better job. So if you are looking for the "usual" - don't bother. But be more adventurous and try some of the other unique dishes and you wont be disappointed. The brussel sprouts - an explosion in my mouth that I couldn't get enough of! Out of this world! If you get ONE dish here - let it be brussel sprouts! Phoenician fries - I would have loved it even more if the dip was the main course and the fries were the side (as opposed to the other way around) Labne - perfect texture, yummy zaatar sprinkled on top and divine olives! Ashwat - the lebanese clotted cream dessert with orange maple syrup and pistachio shavings - holy cow! Arak - great drink to have all through the meal. It's anise-infused and has a fair amount of fennel flavour - so it almost tastes like an Indian digestif...but that's what made it so sweet! Best of all - the service! We had made a note on the reservation that it was a birthday dinner, but I never thought they would do anything special or even pay attention to that. Yet, the waitress brought out the dinner with a candle planted right in the middle of our 3 scoops of lebanese clotted cream for dessert! What a nice touch!
