Great new addition to the neighborhood! Staff is super friendly and the interior is tots adorable.  They have a wide variety of food to choose from, and serve breakfast all day! This is my new go-to spot for late brunch on the weekends and lunch or dinner during the week.  Prices are pretty reasonable, too. Also, if you are gluten-free, they offer gluten-free bread and buns for their sandwiches/burgers!!
