Just amazing!  I've been for dinner and for brunch.  The service is fantastic.  We didn't have a long wait at all.  My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her buckwheat pancakes with a yummy strawberry rhubarb jam.  My husband and I loved the lobster and egg dish served in a siracha sauce.  Also the Bloody Mary was good.  For dinner, we all shared a few dishes, all of which were delicious!  The Manhattan with strawberry infused bourbon was probably one of the best I've ever had.  We will definitely be back!!!!
