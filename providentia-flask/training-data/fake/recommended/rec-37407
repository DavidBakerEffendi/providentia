After receiving an apology from management that was much appreciated, I gave this spot a second try. Service was excellent, super friendly and helpful. Our waitress gave us a little sampling when we couldn't decide which wine to get. Spring rolls were bigger than last time and perfectly fried, so definitely an improvement. The pumpkin curry was delicious, albeit a little salty. An expanded new menu also gives me more reasons to come back!
