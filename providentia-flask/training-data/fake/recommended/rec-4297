I don't really like hamburgers too much unless I'm in the mood. I hate cheese and I hate shakes...or at least I thought I did until I came to this place. I came here to meet a date and a few of his friends. We basically ordered everything on the menu...lol. Most of the burgers were good though a bit too much cheese. I didn't like the shroom burger too much. I got a fair trade shake(coffee). I was expecting the worst but it was pretty effin good. I will definitely come back to this place when I'm in the area
