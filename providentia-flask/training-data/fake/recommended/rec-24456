Sadly, another bad brunch experience today. We had the same waitress as last time - this in and of itself should've been a sign.  We got a bread basket for the restless 2-year-old in our group, then waited and waited and WAITED for our food.  In the meantime, a table seated 15 minutes after us got their food and were almost done by the time we got ours (40 minutes after ordering). The waitress actually came over at one point and explained the reason it was taking so long was because we had gotten a "first course" i.e. the bread basket. I'm sorry, but are you kidding me??
