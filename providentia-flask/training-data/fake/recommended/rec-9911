Naked balls, bitches brew, awesome, milk bottle water. I was teaching a class in the city and I asked my students where to get dinner. I told them I wanted something casual but memorable. This is where we ended up and I loved every minute. The spicy is amazing and so is the cauliflower. Great place. Don't be scared by the beer in the bitches brew, its such a good take on sangria.
