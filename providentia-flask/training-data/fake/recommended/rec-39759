Great soups, great value.  $4.90 gets you a large soup, bread and a piece of fruit.  It is enough to fill me up for lunch. They usually have about 14 soups per day, and a good variety so there is something for everyone.  I believe they close once they have run through their supply of soup for the day.  I've always dropped in between 12 and 2 and haven't had a problem getting what I wanted yet.  I've been coming here throughout the summer so I haven't experienced any long lines yet.  We'll see what happens when fall and winter roll in.
