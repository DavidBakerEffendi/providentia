Big Thai fan. Frequenter of the Fort Greene location so was expecting this spot to be the same. Lovely outdoor space, attentive waiters, and a hair in your food. My friend and I ordered a curry and noodle dish to split. The noodles were tasty as usual (Pad Thai - don't shoot me. I know it's the spaghetti of Thai food, but I love it). My friend was scooping out some more of the curry she was enjoying then BAM! Hair spotted at 2 o'clock in the bowl. Cue loss of appetite. Waiter replaced it but by then appetite had hit the road. I wound up taking home the new order. Thought they'd refresh the rice - nope. Thought they might knock a couple of bucks off the order - haha silly rabbit. Nope. I'll probably stick to my Fort Greene spot but am bummed that my friend was scarred by the case of the hairy curry.
