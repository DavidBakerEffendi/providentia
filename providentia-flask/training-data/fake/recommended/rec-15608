This is my favorite restaurant in New York City. I know, that's a bold statement. But I truly feel that everything they do here is understated perfection. It's fine dining without going over the top. It's not cheap, but it's not unaffordable. It feels like home here. You don't feel like you're in a super pretentious white table cloth place. You can wear jeans and be casual but you could also get dressed up and come here for an extra special evening. The ambience is just perfect. Service is super friendly without being too friendly. I also love that walk-ins are very welcome. I hate making reservations. I never know what I'm going to feel like eating weeks in advance. Actually, I've never made a reservation here and the longest I've waited was 30 minutes. It's never been an issue. Now, the food. The bread and olive oil they give you to start is amazing. When I'm extra hungry and they offer to bring more it makes me very happy. Every single pasta I've had here was absolutely delicious. The ideal portion size, too. Some places like Bar Primi (no disrespect) give you the tiniest portion of pasta. This is a happy medium. My favorites are the bucatini and the tortelli with pork and chicken liver and balsamic. The best one I had was a Spaghetti special, with lobster. It's not on the menu but apparently appears quite frequently on their daily specials, so if it's there, you have to try it. It's in a rich, buttery tomato sauce, with pieces of poached lobster tail. Enough said. I also love how seasonal their menu is. I feel like many Italian restaurants don't incorporate seasonality into their menu enough. They do it in a very elegant, not over-the-top trying to be a farm-to-table restaurant way. Maialino is effortlessly perfect! They are more than deserving of five stars.
