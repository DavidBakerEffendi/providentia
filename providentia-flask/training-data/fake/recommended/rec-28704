Came here for a late dinner and got the short rib steamed bun, the miso cod steamed bun, the nasu eggplant, and the silken tofu. Short rib steamed bun and silken tofu were both excellent and highly recommended.  The miso cod was kind of disappointing -- it tasted like a McDonald's fish fillet sandwich.  And the eggplant was covered with some kind of sauce that was overly sweet and completely unecessary.  I love eggplant, so when I order it, I want to taste it! The atmosphere and the service were both pretty good.  I'd come back here for the short rib steamed bun and maybe to try some other things on the menu.
