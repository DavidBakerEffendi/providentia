This place never lets me down.  The service is quick and attentive, the food is great and the prices are insanely cheap.  $7.50 for a Thai curry!  The decor is modern and cool.  Not surprisingly the place is always busy, so there is usually a short wait for a table.  The only complaint would be the cocktails were always a bit weak, but I just switched to wine, which is better value....nice large glass of pinot for $7, not bad.
