Having just been transplanted from Brooklyn to Los Angeles I've become a big fan of the Gorbals on the west coast. Thus there was no other place I wanted to try with my guys on a recent trip back home than this place. We made a reservation for the 6 of us last minute and they were very accommodating. They even gave us this really cool table in the back where we could have some privacy and really catch up. Now onto the food and service. From the start the waitstaff explained how much we should order, what goes best with what...etc. Very well versed in the menu and wine selection and what we should order. I wont go into one specific dish in particular but needless to say we tasted and tried everything and the culinary flow was refreshing and exciting. Each dish matched well with the next and gave us a full transition through the menu and Ilan's culinary point of view, which we all appreciated. I recommend this place for not just the food but the atmosphere. If you want a fun place to go out and eat with your friend in the Burg and try some new things that you normally don't have a chance to I suggest putting this at the top of your list. Extra points for the wine by the glass list that matched perfectly with the food & don't forget the famous toffee pudding... a Gorbals classic.
