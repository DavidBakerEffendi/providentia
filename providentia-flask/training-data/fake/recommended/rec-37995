will not be back again. Once a favorite sushi restaurant of mine, over the past year the service and food quality have become unrecognizable, after the meal last night, I have officially given up on the place. Did not receive any sort of utensils/chops sticks, napkins, plates for sharing, or soy sauce.  Had to ask for all of them specifically.  Our waitress was one of the kids who once would just be studying in a corner, now it seems they've let go of most of the staff and are making the kids serve. Appetizers of vegetable medley and green seaweed salad were OK.  But the fish, which I went for, was terrible.  Two different special rolls that were almost inedible and made with poorly cooked/old rice and poor quality Fluke sushi.
