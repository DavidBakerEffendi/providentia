From all the hype I was hearing about the Star's reopening, I was really pumped to head out to Williamsburg for some good eats. The previous time I tried going, I didn't know they burnt down, so I was anticipating greatness! Instead, I was met with a bit of disappointment. The renovated space looks GORGEOUS and I like the use of picnic tables and Mason jars. Having said that, the food didn't meet the impeccability of the decor. The best part of my meal was definitely the fried brussel sprouts with the caramelized ham and apples. The flavors mixed very well together, and I dug the suble spiciness of the sprouts. Also, they make a MEAN Pimm's cocktail that brought me back to my days in London where I would drink Pimm's all the time. Sadly, the rest of my food didn't really match the caliber of the sprouts. The mussels I had were way too fishy, and the biscuit was tragically doughy in the middle. How can you destroy such a delicious carb product?! To future visitors, prepare to be slightly underwhelmed. Thinking back on that dinner makes me sad.
