The food at this restaurant is outrageously delicious. Thoughtfully, beautifully presented plates in moderate portions, and so tasty. We tried for appetizers the oysters (clean, fresh, completely delicious), octopus (I highly recommend this dish. We could not get enough of it), squash fritters (yum), steak tartare (perfect) and beet plate (delightful). -- In other words, a perfect first course. For entrees, we had rabbit leg (surprised me as I though rabbit was dark meat but this was tender white meat, with a yummy sauce and root veggies accompanying), steak (excellent) and a white fish, which was light, airy and yum. Drinks: delicious, a varied and unusual cocktail selection - something for everyone. Service: wonderful - fast, attentive, knowledgeable. Ambience: Cozy / classy Vermont-style restaurant; you feel like you are in an upscale lodge-dining situation on the top of a snowy mountain, with the warm lighting, fire in the corner, and natural decor. Excellent spot. Thrilled this VT classic has found a new place to grow in Burlington.
