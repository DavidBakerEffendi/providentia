Holy Panini, Batman! This place is good. Il Bambino is an adorable hole-in-the-wall type panini and crostini joint in Astoria. The restaurant offers a wide array of paninis and crostinis with Italian meats and cheese many have never heard of (thankfully there is a guide to the strange names on each table). I tried my luck with the Italian Meatloaf Panini, with Italian Meatloaf (duh), onion marmalade, provolone, and spicy mayo. Despite the fact that it is one of three of the most expensive paninis on the menu, when I read this panini's description, I knew it was made just for me and the choice was simple. The sandwich was delicious!!! The onion marmalade brought a spectacular onion-y flavor, and the spicy mayo was a nice touch and was not overpowering. The service was also really great. Our server was awesome and very knowledgeable, and did not seem to be bothered by the fact that we sat there for a half hour after finishing just talking. If the Italian Meatloaf Panini sounds like something you may enjoy, I STRONGLY recommend it. I know I will not be adventurous next time and I will get that one again for sure on my next visit to Astoria!
