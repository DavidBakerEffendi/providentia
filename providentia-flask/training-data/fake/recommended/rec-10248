I went for dinner. They have a solid wine list. Caesar salad was good. I had the fish special of the night, breaded fluke over mashed potatoes, topped with asparagus, which I enjoyed. My friend had Osso Bucco. She felt it was a bit dry, but said it had good flavor. We also tried the 3 pasta samples for the additional $9. The Bolognese was the best of the three, but all were good. We had the chocolate mouse cake for dessert, which was fantastic. Unbeknownst to me, my friend had included that fact in her Open Table reservation that it was my birthday. My friend felt a bit cheated that I didn't quite get the birthday greeting that the older woman two tables over got (she had 4 employees stand around the table singing "Happy Birthday," whereas our food runner delivered the dessert and quickly escaped), but I didn't mind at all. I don't need a song, just a delicious dessert. Â  The atmosphere isn't anything spectacular, but I found it quite comfortable. The service was very good. I would recommend.
