This place has the best Thai food I have ever had!! It is a must!! The sticky wings are to die for and try anything that has pork belly as the main. Anything on the menu is delicious!! It's a little out of the way but it certainly is well worth the trek. There could also be a ridiculous line but again it is well worth the wait.
