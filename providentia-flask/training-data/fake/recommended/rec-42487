I've stopped going here. Â I've taken food out Chinese food from here for over 5 years. The dishes contain very little meat. The last time, I took out Chicken Chow Mein. It had afew skimply little pieces of chicken, hardly anything and was all shredded vegetables in a sauce. Another time took out Garlic Chicken, the same thing with hardly any meat. The Hot and Sour soup was too thick (too much starch) and wasn't spicy. The Won Ton soup isn't that good and had few wontons. Why don't they just raise the takeout prices and add meat to the dishes.
