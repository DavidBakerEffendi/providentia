My review: The Soup - Easy 5 stars; really solid soup here. For all the frozen bags of soup a manger in the neighborhood, it's great to have this place in the mix The Value - Great. $6 for a large soup, apple and huge piece of bread. $9 and you can add half of a sandwich. Although the sandwiches are kind of... The Sandwiches - ...kind of like something you would be served in one of those pre-made lunch boxes you get on JetBlue. It's not a major offense because the reason you're coming here is for the soup, but basic doesn't even begin to describe it. Bottom line: Come for the delicious soup, skip the mediocre sandwich, leave happy.
