We stumbled upon bistango searching yelp for nearby restaurants. They were able to take us as a walk in on Saturday night before the Knicks game, we were so grateful especially since we were on a time crunch. The food was amazing and they graciously mixed and matched my request of their menu items. I ordered the Cavatelli but asked for them to sub in tortellini as my pasta. The food was so amazing, the spicy sauce absorbed into every bite of spinach, the tortellini tasted home made with cheese bursting out, and the calamari we ordered as an app was fresh and amazing, no disguise of breadcrumbs and swimming in a spicy garlic sauce. I swear if my boyfriend had a spoon in front of him he would have scooped up every last bit of the sauce. It was so amazing that I was genuinely surprised the restaurant offers a significant amount of gluten free options, would have never suspected it. Very happy with our meal and would recommend this place to everyone.
