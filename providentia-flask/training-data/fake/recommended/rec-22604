This place has an adorable setup (some 70s cop movie projected onto the wall as we ate), friendly wait staff, and a countryish feeling that is very refreshing and homey. I got the thick cut (and it is VERY thick-cut) french toast. It was amazing. It came with cinammon butter and real maple syrup. Most places will not give you real maple syrup. I can't overemphasize how delicious the french toast was. I couldn't finish the french toast and had my leftovers for dinner last night... still delicious, even when old and microwaved.
