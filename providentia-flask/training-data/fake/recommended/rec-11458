I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while.  Sadly, their service has gone way down hill since my first visit there.  If I had written this review after my first visit, I would have given 4 or 5 stars.  The service and meals were great then.   If you brave this place, I'd recommend sitting at the bar if you want to get service.  Also, the pecan pie with sweet potato ice cream is AMAZING! My most recent, and probably last, visit was horrible.  There were four of us, and the place wasn't very crowded, but it took around 5 minutes to get someone's attention to get a table.  Once we were seated, it took another 15 minutes or so for our waiter even acknowledge us.  I noticed he had a black eye and as our stay progressed, I couldn't help but think he got whilst at work.  He dropped off some water and said he'd be right back.  My friend said, 'I have a quick question for you...'   the waiter cut him off mid-sentence and replied 'You'll have to wait, I'll be back'.  It was then we considered leaving.  (By the way, the quick question was if root beer on tap was alcoholic or not.)  Instead, we waited a good ten more minutes for our waiter to return, while watching him cheerily chit-chat with a table outside.  The rest of our service was just as horrible.  After our initial round of drinks, we couldn't get anyone to stop by long enough to order more. The only reason they got two stars is because the food was still decent and a waitress in training noticed we were being ignored and saved the day.  The waiter was so horrible, we gave her the tip for our bill.  I sincerely hope that awful wanker wasn't the one training her.  If I knew his name, I would have called the manager and complained.
