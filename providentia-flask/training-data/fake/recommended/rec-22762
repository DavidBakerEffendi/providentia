I went there once for my sisters surprise party last year and I had some of their vegetable samosas which were pretty good. I got a craving for some Indian food not too long ago and I was going to go there for lunch and I saw not one person in there employee or otherwise. I recently saw that they are open again. I have to make a point to stop there so I can make my full assessment.
