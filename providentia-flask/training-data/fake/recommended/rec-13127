My boyfriend and I shared an order of the chicken/lamb and rice dish.  We sadly were not that hungry when we came (we had eaten at the Biriyani Cart for dinner, watched Lion King and then ate here), but I had to try the food since it was infamous and I had no other meals available in which I could give it a taste. I made sure to stand in the line with the guys giving out food in yellow bags.  It actually wasn't that long of a line and it moved pretty quickly.  When we got to the front of the line, we opted for the chicken and lamb combo, got a Diet Coke from the beverage cart and then sat at some bench.   I was ready.  I was excited.  I was...disappointed...I mean the white sauce was good.  The hot sauce was good.  But I think that's what made the food good.  Actually, soaking the rest of the dish in the sauce so that the sauce masks everything else is what makes the food good. The secret's in the sauce, not the rice or lamb or chicken or onions or whatever.  The food quality itself is not anything to rave about.  I guess it is food coming from a large cart. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about street food.  Perhaps it was too hyped for me and I expected too much.  Perhaps I should've come starving.   Maybe next time...
