Went here over the weekend. There was a 10minute wait although reservations were made. Nevertheless, the time went by quickly. The atmosphere was lovely. Had a deliciously made mojito, tasted like ones I've had in Miami. All the tapas ordered were amazing! Really loved the short ribs, duck, mushrooms, and assorted cheese. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and also chose an amazing bottle of wine. All of the employees were extremely hospitable and continuously checked to make sure that our food came out ok. Will definitely go here again!
