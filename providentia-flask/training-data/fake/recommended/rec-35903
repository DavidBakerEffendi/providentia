I'm not one of those people who appreciates something just because it is popular or just because it is expensive.  So I wasn't sure I was going to like ABC Kitchen, but holy smokes!  Everything I had, I loved.  The tomato and peach gazpacho...so good.  The eggplant appetizer....insanely good.  The mushroom pizza was incredibly tasty and the lobster was simple and ridiculously delicious.  I would go back.  Everyday.  I loved everything I had and it was worth every penny.  Yum and Yum.  And the decor is lovely and it has nice energy.
