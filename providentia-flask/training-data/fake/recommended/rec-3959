Not to beat a dead horse with how good a brunch place this is...but seriously, it's great.  As suggested I went early (for a Sunday) and when I got there at 11:00 it was just starting to get busy.  There was a short line but I still got some coffee and a bit of sausage with lemon.  So nice!  The food was home-y and fantastic,  the decor was entertaining and the staff was very nice and helpful.   The overall experience was great - but I definitely suggest getting there by 11:00 because the by the time we left there was line around the corner (although I hear it moves pretty quickly.)
