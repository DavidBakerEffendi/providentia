You go to Simon Pearce for the view. The food makes the drive where you got lost in the dark on narrow, curvy VT roads worth it. (However, when you get lost on your way back to your hotel because it's still dark and you have no GPS reception, you may have a moment of questioning your choice. Regardless...) The dining room is beautiful and serene. It's built so you feel as though you are almost suspended on top of the river below. The best tables are the ones with the view of the water, obviously. The food is equal to the atmosphere. Like so many businesses we encountered in VT, Â Simon Pearce is a big supporter of other VT businesses. You will see Cabot and King Arthur, among other local favorites, featured prominently on the menu. I ordered a beef entree and realized at the end of the meal, I hadn't needed the steak knife provided. The bread was delicious; we asked for more. Dessert was solid, but not earth shattering. Service was unobtrusive but almost always attentive. The night we dined here, it was very quiet and only a few tables were taken. I don't know if it was the day of the week, the season, the time, or something else. Our experience was very quiet, calm, and laid back. It was a great place to linger over coffee with a friend after a fantastic meal. If you're in the area, it should be on your itinerary.
