This is the best pizza in Philly.  I usually get one with pepperoni and green peppers or mushrooms.   Everything about this pizza is right: the ratio of sauce to cheese is perfect, the crunchiness and chewiness of the crust are in a delicate balance, and the distribution of the toppings is pleasing to the eye.  Francoluigi's has it down to a science.  The only bad thing I can say about them is that they are closed on Mondays. For pizza lovers on a budget, the tomato pie is fresh, delicious, and cheap.
