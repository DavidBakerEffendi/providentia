We had a great meal here. We came with 2 of our friends from out of town. The wait was not long at all and the service was very good. They served us some bread and spiced carrots while we waited for our food. My wife and I split the home-made ravioli. It was amazing! Our friends got the baked ziti it looked delicious and they enjoyed it as well. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is nice. It's a quaint spot but they utilize the space inside well. The servers were all very friendly and the owner even came by had a chat with us and took a picture! This is a great restaurant and you will not be disappointed if you chose to eat here.
