My wife and I spent a weekend in NYC and had brunch in Williamsburg twice. BeeHive Oven was one of the highlights of our trip. We arrived around noon last Sunday before heading to a Broadway show and then to the airport, so we had our bags with us. There was a slight wait, less than 30 minutes. One of the owners, John, offered us coffee and cider lemonade while we were waiting for a table, which was very much appreciated. He took the time to chat with me for a bit, and also pointed out a spot by the door where we could put our bags during our meal. We both love deviled eggs, so those were a must-have appetizer. I had the Tex Eggs Benedict, and Rose had the Build Your Own Biscuit Sandwich option. Everything was phenomenal! We had enough room to split a dessert, so we went with the fruit biscuit pudding, and it was a great way to finish the meal. We felt welcomed from the second we stepped in the door. Take the time to stop in here for a great Southern meal. You won't regret it!
