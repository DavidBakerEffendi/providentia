This was a great find here. I had never been in Morrisville Â before and had no clue on what or where to eat. So I decided to play it safe and find some pizza. I found La Villa with my Yelp app. It's located in a shopping center with a hod dog business and a liquor store. Didn't look too promising from the outside. But once you step in, you'll see that this is a quality restaurant. For lunch, you can order 4 entrees from a serving station behind the counter that has quite a few items to choose from. Very large servings of each, all for $8.95... Their pizza here is the grandmother style of pizza. Square and with plenty of garlic and olive oil to go with the cheese and other toppings. The dining room was very nice, and so were the waitresses. For a man starving to have anything for lunch, it was just by luck that I found this place....
