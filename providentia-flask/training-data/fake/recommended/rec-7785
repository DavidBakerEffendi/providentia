I came here for lunch before heading out to the Armory Show. Bouley is an interesting french restaurant with a French countryside feel to it. Right when you open the front door you get hit with a strong smell of ripe sweet apples in the waiting room. In this room, REAL apples are displayed along the wall from top to bottom. Bouley has possible the best value prix fixe 5 course menu for a Michelin star restaurant in NYC. The service is attentive without being overwhelming. Most of the diners were wining and dining business clients. I really enjoyed the bread cart with some very interesting ingredients. NEGATIVE 1 STAR (David Bouley PLEASE READ): I overheard a threatening conversation where the bald "white" waiter in the suit told one of the Hispanic back waiters "...I'm going to fuck you up!" Seriously is this really necessary for the bald guy to be a douche? The back waiters work very hard and the pompous bald guy in the suit walked around as if he was too important to lift a finger. Please get rid of this bald guy in the suit and get someone that is able to work at your restaurant without causing drama in front of the customers.
