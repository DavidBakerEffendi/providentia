All I can say is, Holy Shiite: the cornflake fried chicken with papaya, yucca, and hot sauce had a crunchy exterior that gave way to a most succulent interior that had me mouthgasming. Hot damn it was good. The menu changes daily but our friendly and attentive server suggested this dish is popular enough to make regular appearances. My appetizer of Caldo de Gallina (free range hen in tomatillo broth) and dessert of Raisin Apple Crisp were both also very good - and great value at $27 on the prix fixe menu. Palo Santo also has a decent selection of wine and craft beer, and a modern yet cozy ambience located at the foot of a Brooklyn brownstone. I've only been once, so this isn't a definitive review, but my friends and I had an excellent experience and will definitely be back when we're next in the neighborhood.
