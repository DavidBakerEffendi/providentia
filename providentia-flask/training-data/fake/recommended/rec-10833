I figured I might as well rate all the Momofuku at this point being that I am a huge fan of the EV empire. Started off with the addicting Pork buns to get our palettes going and for our meals we had the mussels and roast lamb. These were accompanied by some cocktails that I found to be too sweet for me but still delicious.  I have not yet had the Bo ssäm, or else perhaps it would have been 4 stars.  Actually f*ck it, I'm giving this place another star just for the fact that they serve pork buns!
