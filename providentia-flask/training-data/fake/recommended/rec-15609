It's a deli. But sometimes that's what you crave. A nice thick sandwich with cole slaw, pickles, and dr. pepper soda. A perfectly simple meal before a show. I don't know about their cheese cake, but I can guarantee that you'll be satisfied with their deli fare. Â And you'll get seated quickly so you'll get out in time for your show !!!
