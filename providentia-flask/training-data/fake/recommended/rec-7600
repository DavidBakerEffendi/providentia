I work in the area, and I was craving some good sushi.  Based on the online reviews, I decided to try Sushi Cafe.  All I can say is, WOW!  I got the lunch special Bento Box, which included a Cali Roll, four pieces of sushi, two dumplings, a little ginger salad and some miso soup.  Everything was tasty, and as another review mentioned, the sushi is really fresh. They have a small parking lot in the back, so it's easy to run in and out at lunchtime.  The dining area is small, which is a drawback.  I think it would be a nice place to go and sit down with some friends if there was more space. Bottom line- I can't wait to go back.
