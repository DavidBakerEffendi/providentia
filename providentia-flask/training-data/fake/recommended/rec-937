I live a good thirty minutes from here but worth the trip. Met some friends here that live nearby and I really enjoyed this place. Fantastic beer selection! The burger was good. waitress was super kind and atmosphere was a plus. Parking is off street so can be tough but not a big deal. .bathrooms were nice and clean. Love the mouthwash dispenser in there. Would love to go back.
