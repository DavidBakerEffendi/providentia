After reading countless reviews on this place, I was very happy I tried it. My friends and I shared the Market Salad (yummy) the grilled calamari (beware of tentacle's-but the one piece I tried was good) and the roasted artichoke-not to be missed. For our entrees, we had the lobster and shrimp pyramid pasta, and the fillet. The pasta was like eating a steamed dumpling filled with ricotta cheese, and a touch of shrimp. For $24, it could have had more seafood inside, but it was still delish. The filet was tender and soft and full of flavor. The chive mashed potatoes were excellent as well. For dessert, we split the mascarpone cheesecake which was absolutely spectacular. I will be coming here again.
