Why would people sit at the sushi bar here and NOT order omakase? So stupid. I sneered at several parties ordering sliced sashimi sets for dinner. Yeah, I'm a bitch. Of course, I had the omakase, which is the best (and right) way to experience the supremely fresh quality of the fish selections. The uni and otoro were undeniably top-notch, and I loved how the chef presented the same fish from different geographical regions in duos and trios for side-by-side comparisons of flavor and texture differences between the variations. The squid was unbelievable! I watched the chef painstakingly score the small white flesh in all different directions for several minutes to produce an extremely tender and texturally-impressive bite. I even tried the tamago, which I typically abstain from since few sushi restaurants can make it correctly, and it was amazing - like sweet flan. I can unequivocally say this was the best sushi I've ever had.
