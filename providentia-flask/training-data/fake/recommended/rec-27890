will visti again. they were happy to serve us w/ 4 kids in tow. The place is chill, lovely decor w/ exposed brick wall, mismatched antique large mirrors. Their garlic sauce that came w/ their Plantanos was amazing. their cuban beef stew (Ropa Viejo) was not something I would order again. we also tried the pollo empanidazo,which came w/ rice and beans (beans tasted almost like from a can) the pollo was good. Lots of plantnos w/ our order. Portion size is not great. I gave this place 4stars coz of the service and the decor. nice place to just relax, take your time and chill. even w/ kids
