I adore this place. I want to eat there every day.  The grilled organic polenta with wild mushroom Fricassée & Val d'aosta fontina cheese I have to have to get every time I can. The gnocchi of the day has never missed. The customer service is wonderful and the bread and pastas cooked in house. Don't pass up the desserts either, so delicious!
