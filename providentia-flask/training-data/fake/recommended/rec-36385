I spend Christmas each year in the City. Decided i would try Balthazar last year...could not get a reservation.  Tried again this year, and got one at 6 pm (only time available for the night I wanted).  Guest and I get there at 5:55 and check in.  They tell me that the seating does not begin until 6 and to have a drink at the bar (small space).  Right at 6, chaos ensues....50 people (I assume all tourists like myself) flood through the doors wanted a table.  If I had not pushed my way back to the front, I would still be waiting for my table. We are seated and the service was excellent.  The waitress was nice and well informed.  The food was a strong B+.  I had french onion soup and steak au poivre. At the table next too us was a couple who decided to break up that night...and I had to listen to it....really?   I will go back if I can get a reservation at a time that is more reasonable...even though this is really a tourist place....
