Filthy! Disgusting! I ate there last night and their were rat droppings in my plate, and hair in the food. Yuck! I complained to the manager and nothing. He gave me another plate, i chucked everything to the floor and walked out. This place needs the health department down here asap. An these people just stare at you like your some kind if a stranger. I felt so awkward when i walked in, and you have to somehow get their attention, otherwise you could be standing there for quite a while. I will never return again, but don't say i haven't stopped you. All of this owners locations should be checked thoroughly.
