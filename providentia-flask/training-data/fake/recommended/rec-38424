Stop what you are doing and immediately go to Sandra's !!! Our crew came through on a road trip and had an AMAZING experience! We each ordered something different and love each item. We even got to meet Sandra herself who is just the sweetest lady ever :) Let's start with the cornbread...O_O... It was so delicious. Currently salivating thinking about it. I watched Sandra brush it with butter before serving it so you already know it was to-die-for. Very moist, slightly sweet, and had a flaky-ish crust. How does a crust like that even exist for cornbread?? I'm still shocked I got the church plate with BBQ chicken breast with Mac and cheese, fried plantains, candied yams, and cabbage. It was perfection. We tried to ask her how she keeps the chicken meat moist while the outside was crispy (even which drenched in homemade BBQ sauce!) and she said it was a secret! I need her to write a cookbook ASAP. Everyone else at our table was just as in love with their food as I was and the portions were fairly large so we all left completely stuffed (like pregnant ppl waddle on the way out). Surprisingly that didn't stop us from ordering dessert to go lol I know this review is long and I actually still have PLENTY more great things to say but I will just end it at: go to Sandra's NOW
