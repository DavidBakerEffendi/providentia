I went tonight, the second night that this amazing new place has been open. All I can say is, GO. The food:  All of the items on the menu are what I will call "polished Greek classics."  All of this food could be in a top-dollar Manhattan place, but instead, it's fairly priced, delicious, and in generous portions. I had two of the mezzes--I had planned on 3, but the portions were so great and the flavors so filling that I only needed 2.  I started with the eggplant dip, which is a no-brainer share for 2 or even 3 as part of a selection. After pigging out on that and the wonderful, in-house-made pita bread, I moved on to the gyro-spiced beef sliders.  3 intense little sliders came with 2 dipping sauces and a side of home-made potato chips. What to wash this down with?  You're spoiled for choice.  Every single wine on the extensive list is available by the glass, half-glass, half-bottle, and bottle.  In addition, there is an entire spirits menu, which is insanely well-curated; it's like raiding your own local branch of Astor Wines and Spirits.  Finally, there is the amazing beer selection--both tap and bottle lists boast items rarely seen.   The staff was polite and very well-informed regarding what was on the menu and available at the bar.  All of the food coming out looked amazing, and everyone was sharing opinions and ordering advice with each other.  I plan on a return trip soon to try some of the entrees and more mezze, and you should also. FYI, I also got a few words in with owner/head chef Michael Psilakis.  Apparently, after Greek Easter (weekend of May 5th), they plan on starting a brunch and lunch service.  Count me in! PS--First review, I can't believe it, but here I am...
