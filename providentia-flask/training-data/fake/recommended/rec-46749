Was invited to try this restaurant by a friend which loves it, the place is eclectic and has a very colorful decor, the wait staff very friendly, was seated right away.  It took more then ten minutes to get our drink order ( margarita classic very good!), but then it was more then half hour to get our food order, the food took another half hour to get, the food was good and abundant but NO WOW factor.  Our waitress Nancy kept apologizing and was as nice as could be and finally offered us free glass of wine, THANK YOU, but being from White Plains, NY going to Milford, CT for a Nice meal is just not worth it.
