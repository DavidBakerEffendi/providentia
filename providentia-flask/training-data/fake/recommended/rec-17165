In my opinion they have the best sushi in town. Not great service and it is a bit pricey. For some reason it disturbs me watching their fish tank with huge fish swimming while I eat sushi...but that is just me. Hours are a little odd so call before you go to make sure they are open if is it close to between lunch and dinner.
