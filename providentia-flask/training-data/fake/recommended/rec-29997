My only regret about this restaurant is that I did not try it earlier.  I went there for the first time this past week, and loved it.  My mixed green salad was excellent.  The fish was very good (but not spectacular).   The waiter was excellent, without being annoying.   One of my pet peeves with elegant restaurants is that the wait-staff is constantly trying to push product--constantly picking up the wine bottle and  refiling your glass so you will buy more--that sort of nonsense.   Mediterra, another local restaurant, is constantly doing this.  My fantasy is to super-glue the wine bottle to the table. There was NONE of this at the  Blue Point Grill.  The restaurant is BYOB, so there is no incentive to keep filling the wine glasses. My other pet peeve with elegant restaurants is their desperate attempt   to differentiate themselves but trying to serve more bizarre food.  No, I'm not interested in eating organic lizard's tongue in an Asteroid feces reduction.  Just serve fresh fish, a decent salad, good bread, and be done with it. Blue Point Grill is a breath of fresh air:  very good fish served by an attentive wait-staff. I can't wait to go back.
