Aside from awkward seating on the first floor, Govinda's is a shining star among vegan restaurant options (please keep in mind that my opinion is based on a deep relationship with NYC veggie spots). My fellow diner and I started with the "Ginger Soy Chicken Satay with Balsamic Strawberry Sauce".  This, I highly recommend.  If not for the simple soy chicken tasting so delicious, at least for the strawberry sauce that you could lick off the plate if it wasn't considered so inappropriate.  This was followed by the most expensive salad on the menu... which was actually a very generous portion.  The plate overflowed with pomegranate, walnuts, and other lovely seeds and greenery.  And although we had to wait a good amount of time for the entree, the "Grilled Spanish Mackerel with Chickpea Mlange, Walnut Orange Sauce" was well worth the wait.  This seaweed based dish is beautifully arranged, with just the right variance of goodies to accompany fo-fish. And finally, the item that deserves its very own paragraph... the "Peanut-Butter Bomb".  This is no ordinary baked veganess.  It is just perfect in texture, taste, and presentation.  To ensure that this is hands down one of the greatest vegan desserts I've tasted (ranked highly next to Candle Cafe's infamous Carrot Cake), I admit that our sincere devotion to the cake led to an obnoxiously aggressive and intense eating behavior until every crumb on the table was eaten. it was just so damn good...Govinda's is banging and their service is good too.
