Came here on a sunday for brunch with a bunch of people because we couldn't go to Penelope. This place also doesn't take reservations but they told us the wait would be a hour compare to Penelope which was like a 3 hour wait. anyway that one hour wait turned into a hour and a half almost and most of us were freezing just waiting outside than we finally were able to get in and we were all starving by than. The food was great and I loved their breakfast sandwich! everything was perfect in that dish and wasn't greasy for me. Their spicy tomato soup taste great, just like spaghetti but without the noodles haha and their chai latte is delicious too! Even though they don't take reservations, they deserve 5 stars for the service, as long as we waited out there, they were nice enough to have one of the waiter come out with cups of hot apple cider to warm those who were waiting outside. That effort and service they give to the customers was amazing and thats why they derserve 5 stars. I say it's worth the wait if you want to eat here, great food and great service!
