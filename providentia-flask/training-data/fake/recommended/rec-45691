Great place- the decor & ambience of this restaurant is just beautiful for Bayonne. Came in with my boyfriend and some friends, we decided to get some hibachi. Though they only have 2 tables- it really doesn't matter because there's really no wait. I got the steak & salmon dinner hibachi with fried rice & veggies also comes with soup & salad Â was pretty damn good! Next time I definitely want to come back for the sushi though! They've got an extensive amount of rolls!
