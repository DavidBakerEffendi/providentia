This place is wonderful. We had just gotten in town and wanted to find a dinner place close to our hotel. We came in at 6pm on a Friday and all they had was seats at the chefs counter, but we took them and I'm glad we did! I actually really liked watching the chefs make the food. I would definitely recommend getting a couple small plates and the paella, which takes about 40 minutes to make but is worth the wait!
