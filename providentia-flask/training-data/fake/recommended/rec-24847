A group of us stopped into El Vez on a recent training assignment in Philly, the day being rainy and nobody inclined to walk farther. A good stop as it turned out. El Vez is a modern mexican restaurant centered around the idea of a spinning tequila bar at the center, topped with a glam bicycle in an odd, but somewhat workable touch of color and lights. The restaurant portion, arrayed around the bar, features the usual collection of upholstered booths and white table cloths. As to the menu, it is quite extensive, listing a variety of different mexican fare including enchiladas, carne asada, guacamole, and other traditional fare, as well as a good selection of tequila and mexican and domestic beer. Overall a good selection. One note on the food, other than that it was good: The portions vary largely in size. I had the enchilada trio of beans, chicken, and shrimp, and it was a massive portion, while some of my colleagues ordered from the same section of the menu and received something akin to an appetizer portion. Odd, but that is fine dining for you. Very good overall.
