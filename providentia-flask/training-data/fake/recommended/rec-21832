I had a wonderful night at Miriam's tonight. I have had a hankering for their moussaka I had had at Miriam's maybe 2 years ago. I emailed them yesterday to see if it was still on their menu, as I really wanted it today. They responded that it wasn't on the menu, but that they'd make it as a special for me tomorrow. I just had to let them know I was there. My friend canceled last minute tonight. But I went anyways. Tonight ended up being wonderful because of Miriam's staff, and food. I walked in letting them know I was there for the moussaka. They all smiled knowingly, and immediately put my order in. The bartender remembered me from 2 years ago (I know, how is that humanly possible?! I don't know, but he remembered where I worked then, even!)!! I also asked for a side of grilled haloumi, as I didn't want the whole salad tonight. Not a problem. The waitress even had a pleasant conversation for a while with me, until I wanted to get to reading my book. The Italian wine was delicious. The haloumi was perfect. And the moussaka was as good as I remembered. And the staff made me feel like an absolute queen! I love this place.
