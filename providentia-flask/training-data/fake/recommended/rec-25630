Ok if you are looking to roll the dice on whether your lunch will suck or only turnout half bad, this is your place. The staff is fast but just plain nasty. Just had my last cheeseburger here. Cooked rock hard. Asked for mustard and ketchup and the guy looked at me like I was pulling teeth. Fresh cut French fries suck if you don't cook them. Soggy and raw, even lots of salt won't help . Want a burger? Go elsewhere this place sucks!!
