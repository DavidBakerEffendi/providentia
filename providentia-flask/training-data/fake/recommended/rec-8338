The hospitality in terms of staying in was questionable. Can I take my time when Im ordering and not be rushed and there's hardly anyone else in here? Besides that, when I first came here with some friends we ordered and the service was quick. I fell in love with their congee. Not overly oily and lacking in flavor. it was thick and flavorfull. I got the one with pork meatballs in it. I wasn't a fan of the meatballs as they were super chopped up like the consistency of fish balls. But I knew I would be back. I went today. The take out counter was really friendly, they told everyone thank you twice. "thank you thank you, come again". I got shrimp lo-mein and plain congee with the fried stick. Quick service. Nice people, great cheap dinner. Totally recommend it to others. Also their women's bathroom was a surprise. I was honestly expecting something that would be Â sort of gross but it was 2 stalls, fully stocked with tp. So I was happy about that. I wasn't a big fan though of all the "water" on the floor but besides that a good bathroom so don't worry about going in there.
