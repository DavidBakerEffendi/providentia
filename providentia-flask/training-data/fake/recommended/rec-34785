Other than the price and gluten free options this place is not worth going to. I don't understand why the service is being commended, it was standard at best.  I'm kind of at a loss as to why it's getting such high ratings as the food was bland which matched the decor (also bland).  I can cook up better Italian dishes at home.  Seeing the 4 and 5 star ratings for this place really speaks truth for the saying "Different strokes for different folks".  Let's just say that I probably would've enjoyed, dare I say, a visit to Olive Garden more than this place. Of all the reputable Italian restaurants in NYC, why o why did i come here!?
