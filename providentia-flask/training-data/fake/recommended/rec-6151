Went here for a quick dinner during the week.  Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table and got attended to quickly.  Ordered a chicken sandwich and fries which filled me up and left me with a good aftertaste.  Would definitely recommend this place if you want a quick sit down meal with good food.  I haven't been here for brunch but I look forward to trying it.
