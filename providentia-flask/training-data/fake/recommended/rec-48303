Stay away from the turkey burger is my best advice. It was cooked fine, but the amount of bread (or panade or whatever they mix with the turkey meat) gave the burger a very pasty, unappetizing texture. Beef on Weck. I ordered to go a few months back. I got home to find the jus/sauce already on the sandwich, rendering the bread into mush. The sandwich tasted fine, passable. Good fries, good chicken wings. I think if they were a little more thoughtful about the food, they'd be a place I would return to.
