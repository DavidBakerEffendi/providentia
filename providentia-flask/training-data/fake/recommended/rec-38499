I've had a lot of teas, desserts, & sandwiches here. Nothing I wouldn't want again. One of the best places to get vegan dessert in the city (ever-changing selections). They always have the best Vegan Treats choices, and I think they charge less than Govinda's. Staff is cool. Music is good (a lot of punk-influenced hardcore). Local art is a plus. And they have an interesting library in the back - lots of unique books to pick through while melting into the couch with coconut-cream-spiked coffee and vegan peanut butter cheesecake.
