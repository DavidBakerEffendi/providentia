I think this joint was over-rated, I've had plenty of great shawarma & halal places back in California about the same price.  I'd even dare say I like the other joints back at home even better.   The food here was good, had the chicken and lamb plate, the line went by really quick and the food was cheap.  Great thing is that it opens really late at night, so after drinking a great place to drop by. I think its only great cuz its open late, otherwise there are other better halal places to eat for sure.
