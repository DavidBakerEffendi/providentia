My hubby has been here a time or two. This was my first time here. He asked if to stop here or another famous soul food restaurant nearby. We chose here since it was on the way. We both ordered the Barack Obama (fried chicken - white meat - which is an extra $1) Â mine with Mac & Cheese & Collards, his with Mac & Cheese & Yams. The Mac & cheese in my opinion was a bit too salty, possibly they OD'd on the cheese, hubby agreed and said he had better. My collard greens were delicious, like really really yummy. The fried chicken was crispy, and the breast was large and full of meat. The chicken was lightly seasoned and moderately flavorful. No clue how my hubby's yams were, I'm assuming good since he inhaled them. We both had half and half (sweet tea & lemonade) hubby described it as 90% sugar & 10% limeade We ordered our food to go, it was around 8:30pm on a Monday and we did not wait too long and the server - Renee was not rude or short with me. $40 and change for our meal, while the portions are large, I'm certain there are more flavorful soul food options around Harlem.
