I went here for the fondue because I had a groupon. We ordered the bang bang chicken to start. It was a scoop of cold shredded chicken with a weird glaze slopped on top. Made me a bit worried for what was to come. The service was great. It made up for the less than stellar tasting food. The shrimp balls and dumplings you get were great. The scallops, though they were small, were very tasty. I was too weary to try the chicken, it had a funny color and looked very slimey. Overall, I would not go back, which is a shame because the atmosphere really is great.
