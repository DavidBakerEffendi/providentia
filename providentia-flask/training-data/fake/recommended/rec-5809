Tasting menu was fun and the white fish carpaccio was outstanding. Miso soup with mussels accentuated the miso flavor. The house wine was $25 per bottle and very drinkable. The seating is quite snug and the people sitting next to us raved about the duck roll which is not to be missed. The sushi is fresh and very well done. I would highly recommend he sushi and come back again.
