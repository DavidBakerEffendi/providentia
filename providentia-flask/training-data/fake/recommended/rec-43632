The environment is a typical quiet trattoria, this one that Romans or Tuscans would have their everyday lunch or dinner. No unnecessary fancy details. The service is on the level "None Professional+Friendly=Great"! I share a Â Portobello Mushroom salad as a starter that was excellent. For some reason I choose a poor dish for Italians. Chicken Milanese. Well cooked but nothing super special. The oven potatoes and the marinated vegetables though, they made the difference. Tiramisu it was a killer! 3 stars but next time I will be more "tough"!!
