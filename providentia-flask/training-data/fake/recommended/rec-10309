My friend and I went recently for a Taste of Hartford.  We went during the week.  The restaurant has a very upscale feel. It was nice to see the cooks making the food from our table.  We each had an arugula salad as our appetizer.  It was delicious and the salad dressing was great.  I had the scallops and risotto, which I thought was tasty but needed salt.  My friend had the hanger steak which she thought was a little too rare but very flavorful.  For dessert I had a panna cotta that was very rich and decadent.  Our server was attentive but not very knowledgeable about the menu and could not answer our questions about the food.   We both felt that the food was very tasty! The usual menu is very pricey so we were glad we could enjoy the food for less!
