Apparently this place was opened up by a bunch of guys from New Zealand and the food really reflects it. They focus on quality of the food source but it is lacking a little in creativity and taste. I must say that over all the meals and well executed and the kangaroo meat ( for me it's more of a novelty than a delicacy) didn't taste as tough as it's to be. The ambiance and the service was pretty decent, overall a pleasant enough dinning experience
