Empanadas, empanadas, empanadas get in my belly  -- I love me the little savory pockets of deliciousness!!!  Empanadas Cafe is an adorable little shop with super friendly service and many selections.  You can tell the owners take extreme pride in their little cafe -  really clean and presentable. They have various empanadas in either corn flour, organic, or white flour.  IMO the corn flour is the best and completely changed my mind about empanadas.  It was light and crispy which was perfect with the savory fillings.  The organic tasted a bit burnt and the white flour a bit doughy.  Regardless, we happily chowed down on 10 difft types and finished off with amazing homemade ice pops.  Mixed berry ice pop FTW! Hands down, amazing take out place (seating is limited to 2 tables & they're mostly filled with people waiting for orders)!!  I'll def keep their 50 empanadas party platter in mind next time I need to feed lucky hungry bunch.
