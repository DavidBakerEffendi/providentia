A point for the quaint decor and homey ambiance, and a point for likely being the best brunch option in the Kip's Bay / Midtown area. Other than that, not quite sure what all the fuss is about. It sure can't be over the food, which was decidedly average. Thank goodness we didn't wait too long to be seated (granted, we arrived at 2:30 for brunch), or it would've been an even bigger letdown. My nutella french toast didn't come with near enough nutella, and what was there was unevenly distributed (a clump in the middle, desert everywhere else). The highlight of Brenna's penny egg sandwich was the pesto sauce, which they also could have been more generous with. Worth a visit if you happen to be in the area for brunch, but nothing to go out of your way for.
