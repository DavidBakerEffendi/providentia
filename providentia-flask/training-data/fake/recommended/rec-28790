Where is the Bald Man so I can kiss him on the mouth? First things first: if you're thinking about going here for Restaurant Week: don't. Skip it. Come back when those hellish two weeks are over so you can enjoy better service. What to order? Anything, really. It seems they've altered their menu a bit since my first few times there, but the staples are as good as ever. Of course, the best part is the dessert menu. The S'mores Concoction is my go-to, but anything will be wonderful. What I really love about their desserts is that they strike the right balance between too rich and not rich enough, creating a little party in your mouth that you never want to end. It IS true that the restaurant packs you in like sardines. The same is true with their Union Square location (but Union Square is much worse than Philadelphia). If you're willing to get cozied up a bit, and if you're fully prepared for a chocolate hangover the next morning, it's definitely worth a trip.
