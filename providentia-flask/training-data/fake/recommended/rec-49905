I have been here a couple of times and I have had negative experiences each time. The latest was yesterday when I ordered the chicken panini. The boneless thigh meat was severely undercooked and pink. I discovered after a few bites in, and the waiter took the plate away and offered to get me something else. Too bad I already had a couple of bites. I am now home sick thanks to food poisoning. Poultry needs to be cooked thoroughly and NOT MILDLY seared like steak. I have been sick all morning and can't believe I paid that much to miss work the next day and now be sick all day. Never again!
