I hate giving a place like this low stars because I'm right there with them on politics and they gave me a bumper sticker and pen. The service was friendly but people go out to eat for good food first and foremost. I felt this sandwhich that I got was BLAND to the max. Oh lordy, it was too bland. Being from Texas when they said "steak" I thought it would taste like steak. Yes, I knew that it doesn't look like a hunk o'steak, that it's shaved like meat but it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Â I really wanted to like them, I really did.
