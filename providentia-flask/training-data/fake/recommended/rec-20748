Couldn't think of a real reason not to give five stars to Buvette. The atmosphere is enchanting and inspiring, the food is small, pretty simple and delicious. The prices are fair considering how lovely the food and experience is. The service is friendly and relaxed despite the swanky feel. Buvette is so romantic and great all around, wish I could live there.
