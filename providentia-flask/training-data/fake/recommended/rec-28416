I moved to Sunnyside South this summer. What was the first thing I tried? De Mole (thanks Yelppers)! I have tried many Mexican places in New York City, and I'm happy to say the one that is only a couple blocks away from me is my favorite. I've been here a few times and gotten take out from them. I am a creature of habit, so I always get the same delicious burrito: de pollo con mole poblano. The guacamole is also great, and a must if you are dining in. It is pretty small, so you shouldn't go there with a party of more than four. On Friday and Saturday night, be prepared to wait 5-15 minutes. BYOB, they sporadically charge for glasses. Of the three times I dined in, I was charged only once. I am quite cheap, so the next time I go, I will try to bring something that I can drink from the bottle.
