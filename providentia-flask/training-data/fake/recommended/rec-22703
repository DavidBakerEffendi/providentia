My favorite local place for good Mexican food. Try the Pork Carnitas taco. The quality of the food is so much better than many of the other Mexican restaurants in the area. Even the rice and beans which are afterthoughts at many other places become something to savor here. It's not fancy. If that's what you want, you won't find it here. Cisco tries hard to deliver a really good meal at reasonable prices. Cisco's is open from 5pm to 9 pm on Friday and Saturday nights with BYOB encouraged. It's a great night out on a budget. This is a place that deserves your support. Come on out and give it a try!
