Wow now that's what you call delicious. I eat shin ramen (gotta have it with kimchi) in my house, i've had pho at Pho Cali, and now I've had hand drawn noodles here. I like my food like I like my dramas- gotta keep me coming back for more. The food here is some of the best I've ever had. The stock was my favorite part of the meal and hours later my stomach is still full and satisfied. I got the sliced beef noodle soup and it was fantastic. I will say that the next time I will come here I'll get the fried egg instead of the hardboiled. With so much in the bowl, that ended up being pretty much left alone and Â since I don't even eat the yolk, it was a bit of a waste. My friend got the duck and he said that it was really rich and delicious but bony. So if you don't want to deal with picking bones out of the soup, go with something else. The tea was also delicious and perfect for my sore throat. The meal is perfect for a rainy cold day or even just something delicious on a hot day. I would say that most of the customers eat pretty quickly so even though it is a small place you don't have to wait too long for a table.
