Let me start off with the fact that I'm not a Mexican food aficionado so some die-hard Mexican fans may disagree with me. When we sat down our very efficient waitress Julia the waitress brought us a basket of tri-color chips with both green and red salsa which were all obviously FRESH and I thought yummy! I never know what to order at a Mexican place so I looked around and saw what other people were having that looked good and, voila, I ordered the ground beef chili relleno. It was absolutely delicious and the re-fried beans they served with it were awesome (the perfect comfort food after my crazy day at work). Â I also had a delicious margarita (simple, basic, delicious and on the rocks - not one of the crazy and over construed yuppie versions that have recently been forced upon me). The decor had a Southwestern/Mexican vibe. It was not upscale by any means, but was a cozy and homey place to kick back and enjoy some comfort food. I will be going back soon. Thanks for the great meal.
