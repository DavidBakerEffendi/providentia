I'm not a fan of sharing a table with strangers, but the couple at the end had their champagne and eyes only for one another-- and once the first plate was put in front of us, we quickly turned our attention to one delectable dish after another. I may not remember everything we tried, but here are the highlights: Fried cauliflower--so very tasty, light and crisp with a raisin puree Crispy brussels sprouts made different with apple slices and a light creme fraiche Pulled pork empanadas were one of my favs-- served with a cilantro dipping sauce Beef slider in Turkish Yufka pastry with a tasty spiced ketchup Crunchy roasted chick peas--simple and delicious My husband enjoyed Roasted Bass North African with a spiced yogurt, basil oil and butter fried shallots. And, finally, something called "Spaghetti Pepperoncini Bottarga di Muggine, dried bonito & shrimp oil & radish sprout" (from their menu)-- it was DELICIOUS and sooo tasty. All in all, every single dish was delightful... consumed the moment that it hit the table. I was impressed with the diversity of the offerings and the speed, food presentation and general dining experience. American Express or Cash ONLY!
