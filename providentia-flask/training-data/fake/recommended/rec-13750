it's so funny how we found this place. we were craving ramen and found an obscure address to a ramen joint. i started to ask this random guy on the street about ramen, then i saw his shirt "I heart Ramen" and i said, HEY! that's what we wanna eat, and so he pointed us in the direction to Ippudo. Like most NYC restaurants, you have to wait. i like the noodle choices. definitely get the soft boiled egg and a side of braised pork. who doesnt love braised meats?? AND, if you still have enough broth left in your bowl, you can re-up on noodles!!! who does that?? they will give you another "ball" of noodles to help you finish off the broth. awesome!! the entire waitstaff likes to yell at incoming guests. i guess this is japanese tradition to yell "welcome!!!!(!@#*^!*@#^!!!!" when customers arrive...or when an order is up...or maybe just whenever they feel like it, so the place is kinda loud. but it's a noodle joint. no need for ambiance.
