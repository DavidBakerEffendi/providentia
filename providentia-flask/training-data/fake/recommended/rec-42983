the MataHari cocktail makes me very happy, and is immaculate - as are all of EE's artisinal cocktails.  But this one has tiny dried rose buds - and oh my, it's pretty, aromatic and potent as hell.  I adore the roasted cauliflower side dish and always try to get there late for the "staff meal" always a delicious surprise full of wonderful bites. the owners, former restraunt and bar employees all - are cool vibe-wise and hospitable as well as incredibly skilled at managing the crowds and making each guest feel welcome. I love the seating area up the coule of steps - anjd also the enclosed outdoor room.  I do question the outfits that waitress wear - as they seem to belong in East Germany - before the wall came down, but maybe that's what they were going for. i only wish - for my own sake and that of my besties - that this place really had remained a secret place for restraunt people to gather and drink and eat together.  it's just too damn cool.
