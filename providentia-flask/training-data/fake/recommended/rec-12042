This place.  Is cool.  Like, seriously cool.  It's in an abandoned train station, which makes it visually stunning.  High ceilings, exposed brick...and they have a seating area outside on the platform!  The food was ok, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was really chill.  I'm not a big dance club girl, but they have a game night (I think they said Mondays) and trivia on Thursday, which is what I was there for.  Had a great time, and I can't wait to go back when it's warm enough to sit on the patio!
