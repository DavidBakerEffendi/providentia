Whenever I'm in Burlington this is my first stop. My last two visits have been absolutely spectacular with food that should have a Michelin star. The chef has experience at Danielle and Per Se and he's been able to combine that with Burlington's farm to table atmosphere to produce dishes that are simple in ingredients but sublimely complex in flavor. The menu reflects what's usually in season and you can get a sample of several small dishes or enjoy a large entree that's a perfect portion. The bartender also works at a local wine shop, so feel free to ask about the wine list and what would go well with you table's dinner choices. The prices are incredibly reasonable with dinner entrees starting around $20. This should absolutely be a stop if you're in Burlington!
