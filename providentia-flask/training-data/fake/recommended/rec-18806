This place has some of the best Greek food in New York City.  I'd have to say it's on par with Taverna Kyclades out in Astoria.  There are a few things that Taverna does better and a few things that Kefi does better.  I've never had anything here that I thought was bad.  I think their octopus could come out a little less chewy, but that's about it.  Everything else is delicious.  What I also love about this place is that it's totally affordable for a night out.  No main course is over $20, unless you're getting one of the specials for the evening.   My favorite things to get here are the sweetbreads, the lamb shank, and any of the pastas.  They also have a pretty good wine selection. Also, side note - all of the waiters here are really muscular and attractive.  It's as if those features are prerequisites in order to work at Kefi.
