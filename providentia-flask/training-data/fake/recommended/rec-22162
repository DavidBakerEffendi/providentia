My girlfriend and I visited on 30 December 2014 around 6PM.  The restaurant was empty at first and stayed mostly empty which was surprising since the food was INCREDIBLE.  Let me reiterate...INCREDIBLE!  I have loved Indian food for a while and this was by far the Best I've had at a price that doesn't break the bank.  My girlfriend and I loved the atmosphere: walls were adorned with unique and culturally appropriate decor and the ambience was calm and romantic.  Service was terrific!  Ask about their Bengali dishes and naan!
