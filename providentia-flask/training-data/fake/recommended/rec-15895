I had diner with the family. Food was great service was excellent. My daughter's flipped over the gnocchi. The Salmon was excellent. My wife had the vegetable appetizer which was big and very tasty. My only complaint was my chicken breast stuffed with cheese was well prepared but tasted flat. It needed more flavor.If it was not for the chicken dish I would rate it 5 stars..I would go back.
