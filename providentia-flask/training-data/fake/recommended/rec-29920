Completely no frills, simple but yummy. This is a hole in the wall, literally. But the food is good. We got the family style (everything on the menu) and for four people it was a good choice. The sausages are great, the salads good and the bread was delicious. I wouldn't take a date here but if you are in the mood for some beers and some sausage I'd definitely come here.
