Like previous poster said, this place doesn't really need anymore reviews, but I just wanted to add that I went to Tom's for the first time last week and it definitely lives up to it's name. Too bad it's always so packed. The staff is really friendly though, and they gave us cookies while we waited for our table to be cleared. So sweet.
