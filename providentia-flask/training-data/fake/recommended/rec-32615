I'm quickly becoming a regular at BXL East.  Food is pretty good - as long as you aren't a vegan.  The croques are tasty and I heard the mussels are great.  I've had the chick caesar a few times (when needing something lighter) and was more than satisfied. The beer selection is great and the staff is awesome. Fave bartender is Tatiana - she pours 'em cold with a smile.
