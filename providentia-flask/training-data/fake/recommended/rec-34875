It's slightly too hipster for my decidedly yuppie tastes, but the nearly militant anti-vegetarianism makes up for it. My first trip here I sat by my lonesome at the bar and devoured the pork belly ssam.   Any place that features pork belly is likely to get high reviews from me, and Ssam bar really works it well. I've been several times since and each visit has been a great meal.   Last weekend I had the buttermilk biscuit with gravy for brunch and then popped over to the Milk Bar for some cereal milk soft serve.  Now THAT is a decadent lunch.  Even though this place is one of the more hyped places in the city, I somehow feel as if it's underappreciated.
