I stopped into Toast on my way to work to use my pc  and decided to try  the eggs benedict  as i was hungry and had some time to kill....What a surprise !This was by far the very best EB"'s  I've had in this city so far. They use real baked  ham and have a wonderful salad rather than the usual home fries as the side..  Ive been back many times since then and have not been disappointed yet.  A+ ps - the  english muffins are home made too boot!
