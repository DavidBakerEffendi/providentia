What happened last night? All i remember is the 4 dollar special during happy hour. 4$ for a Tecante and a shot of tequila. I must have had 4 or 5 and then we sampled a pitcher of margaritas. We had some steak nachos and those were hella tasty. but they didn't sober me up at all. All i can say was it was a rough day at the office today. I'm gonna have to go back and scope this spot so i can remember it for reals...
