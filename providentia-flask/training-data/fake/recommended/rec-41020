OK- Let me start by saying that I'm no stranger to gluten free.  I have eaten at just about every "GF friendly" place in NYC and LI.  I'm beyond "this is good for a GF restaurant."  GF food can be just as good as wheat containing food.  Although I eat gluten, a few in my party don't, so I got a good feel for the menu overall. Risotteria isn't that good. The Risotto is COVERED in cheese.  Like to the point that it's barely inedible.  The restaurant can't deliver its namesake.  Case closed. The flatbreads are decent.  Drinks are WAY overpriced.  The menus are obnoxious (seriously- I have to pick out my dish/drink by looking at a wine bottle with a menu taped to it?) The restaurant is a shoe box (not a big deal) with too many tables (big deal).  I'm not a big guy and I needed a shoe horn to get to my table.   There are many many better places around the area- your time/money is best spent elsewhere.
