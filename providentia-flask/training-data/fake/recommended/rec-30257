I don't eat things with four legs, so I can't speak to the burgers that everyone raves about.  What I can tell you is you must absolutely start with the Brandade de Morue appetizer.  Salted cod, potatoes and shaved truffles = yum.  We also shared a salad off the night's specials - endive and summer stone fruits.  Delicate and refreshing. For entrees, we also went with a special fish.  Expertly prepared cod, but I don't remember what the preparation was, just remember that is was enjoyed.  Also had the Grilled Whole Daurade - they filleted it for us.  Simple and perfect with a side of spinach.  A bit pricey at 10 bucks for the spinach received, but no surprise. We had a beautiful bottle of wine, but I started with the Pistachio De La Rosa and I was not a fan.  The pistachio "salt" was far nuttier than salty.  I also felt the pistachio syrup didn't add to the flavors found in a traditional margarita.  Nice idea, but then again, maybe not. Service was attentive and professional and while we dined for some time, never felt rushed.
