Great for take-out.  Their rolls consistently have nice sized pieces of fish in them and are tasty and fresh.  We have their sushi about once a week or every other week. We've dined in with our baby.  They were friendly and sweet.  The atmosphere is relaxed and very casual.  It's good as a dine-in lunch spot.
