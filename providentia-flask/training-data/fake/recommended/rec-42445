I would actually give this place 4.5 stars just for the Red White Blue deal!  I was soo happy to come here and snag the last 2 top at 7 pm Friday.  It's a small restaurant with a bar, TV, and not too loud.   We were also really happy to find the RWB deal goes not just till the end of happy hour so we got to enjoy 6 Bluepoint oysters and a Pabst $8.  They were delicious--slightly salty, cool with a touch of lemon, some spicy sauce, and something that looked like creamy mustard. My bf tried the Pot of Bass (sea bass, tomato, onion, potato, white wine $26) served with buttered french bread.  The broth was very clean tasting and the fish was cooked just right.  I don't know if I would get this again but it was different in a good way. I opted for Eric's summer salad (grilled tuna, tomatoes, mixed greens, bell peppers dressed in balsamic $13).  SUCH a good deal--they give you tons of tuna but I woudl ask for the dressing either light or on the side next time.  I also tried te fish market soup which was tasty with chunks of fish and shrimp.   All in all a lovely dinner and the RWB is the perfect deal if you want to sample the raw bar.  Oh and service was spot on--our waitress gave us recommendations, came back to check on us often and was super sweet.
