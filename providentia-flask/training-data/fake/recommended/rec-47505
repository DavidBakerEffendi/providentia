The restaurant is diverse from Japanese to Thai. I highly recommend the pineapple beef fried rice and general tso chicken! The girl behind the counter made my experience even more pleasant. The last time I ate here I had it delivered. The delivery was extremely fast. I will definitely be ordering here frequently!
