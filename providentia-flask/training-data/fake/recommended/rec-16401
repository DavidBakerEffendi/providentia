Very surprisingly this vietnamese restaurant is very clean and pretty nice inside considering its in Chinatown. Pho was good, had the extra large with everything in it. Spring rolls was very good but their buon chuon is just average. They have extensive vietnamese menu, definitely will come back for the pho and spring rolls.
