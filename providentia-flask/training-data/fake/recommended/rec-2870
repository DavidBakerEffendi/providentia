Good looking food menu. Better draft list. Best atmosphere- we ate outside on the front porch. We got veggie wings (my fianc√© is vegetarian) and she loved those. I got pulled pork sandwich with fries which was decent. However, we got the Mac & Cheese which essentially had no flavor (had to ask for salt/pepper). Also, she got a salad which was over priced and not that good. Overall, really nice place to sit outside in the nice summer weather and have drinks. But their food was only average and significantly over priced compared to other places in the city.
