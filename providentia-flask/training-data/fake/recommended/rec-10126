Ya know, I think Corner Bistro is a bar/restaurant simply crushed by the weight of its own expectations. Many people rave about how it's the best burger in New York, and you know what? For them, it probably was. However, all the times that I've been here, the burger has disappointed. The first time I went to the Corner Bistro, I was told to try the bistro burger and fries. The burger was thick and cooked to a what it looked like a medium rare, but the meat itself was a bit dry and under-seasoned, so we had to pile on the ketchup mid-way through the burger. The bun got soggy real fast, and the lettuce/tomato/pickles just seemed to add useless texture. However, the fries, while pretty standard, were great and not over-salted. Yet overall, I was thoroughly disappointed, but my friend kept telling me that it was an off-day for them. Okay. So a few weeks later, I came back with a friend visiting from out of town. Same result for both of us. Sad. We quickly ordered mugs of Yuengling to drown away our disappointment. At $3 for a 10 oz mug, we were inclined to keep 'em coming. I've been on the quest for the best standard burger in New York (just meat, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and bun), and sadly, Corner Bistro did not live up to the hype. Overall, the food and beers at Corner Bistro are cheap(er) compared to those at other burger places, and it's a good comfortable, divey place for small groups or dinner with a friend. The place is open until 4 AM, so you can enjoy a beer and a burger late, after going out in the West Village. Just remember to temper your expectations, and enjoy your burger for what it is. From personal experience, you can hit up BLK MKT in Alphabet City for a consistent, no-frills burger.
