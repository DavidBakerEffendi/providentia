My favorite place in the neighborhood. I was so happy when this place opened back in the winter, I live just around the corner and had been trekking down to Smith Street in Cobble Hill to find a cafe to work or read in. Henry's Local is a really great addition to the neighborhood. The owners and staff are very friendly, I love the decor and atmosphere, and I am thrilled that they have decaf espresso. May sound crazy, but I can't have much caffeine but I love the taste of espresso, so I am so happy that they have something I can enjoy. I also love the butter scones and the fig and goat cheese sandwich.
