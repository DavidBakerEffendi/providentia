Recommended by a trusted friend, I was looking forward to Frank Pepe's and it did not disappoint. After visiting Yale, it was the perfect treat... the only thing more perfect would be getting INTO Yale, which has about a .00001% chance of happening; however, you will get a good pizza here 99.99999% of the time, according to my calculations. The service was not the best, but not really anything to complain about. I loved how one could see straight into the kitchen and see them making the pizza from start to finish. The pizza was not too thin-crusted, but not thick by any means either. The sauce was delicious and the toppings fresh. The broccoli was a great topping. A small was the perfect size for a nice snack for 2 before dinner. I'll only return on one condition: I get into Yale. ...for my sake people, tell Yale to accept me so I can taste the goodness that is Frank Pepe's pizza again!
