Love this place. The #6 Ani Ramen with an egg is perfection.  Love the pork buns and the shrimp tempura buns. Could easily make a (small) meal of either of these.  The gyoza with wonderful crispy crust is my new favorite. Noticed a lot of kids enjoying the chicken wings. Guess I'll have to r rye those next.
