Plate after plate after plate of tapas made their way onto our table during our two-and-a-half hour dinner at Tia Pol. We ate, in no particular order: patatas bravas garbanzos fritos navajas y almejas pinchos morunos croquetas de jamón y croquetas del día gambas a la plancha espárragos navarros con caviar mujol huevos rellenos al pimentón de la vera plato de queso variados leche frita torta de santiago We washed this down with four bottles of a lovely Rioja that left deep red sediments lingering at the bottom of our glasses. Each of the dishes were portioned for everyone (6 people) to have a bite and each bite was absolutely full of flavor--some spicy (as in the patatas bravas), some rich (as in the asparagus topped with light mayo and caviar) and some just perfectly cooked and juicy (the head on shrimp). The Tia Pol experience was all encompassing: the wine, the food and the service was perfectly matched at a level that lets you enjoy your conversation, food and drink without ever having to worry about your glass being empty or why your next dish was taking so long. The table was always clean, plates cleared and fresh silverware presented in a timely manner. For 6 people who ate extremely well and drank four bottles of wine, the bill was around $500, with a generous tip. Well worth every dollar spent, both in terms of food quality, quantity and gracious, expeditious service.
