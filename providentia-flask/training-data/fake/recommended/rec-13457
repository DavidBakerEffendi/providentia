Get. To. This. Restaurant. I did, and I cannot wait to go back. A few things you should know: 1. Not your Grandma's soul food. Joaquin Baca's soul food. He brought the vixen out of soul food by giving it a makeover. The final result is sexy as hell and you're going to want to take pictures of it. If you're craving traditional soul food, this could be a bad thing, but at the very least, you're going to get a great meal, even if it's not what you expected. 2. You can share the portions. You should share the portions. Yes, even the "small" plates, in my opinion, can feed up to three. Or, do what I did: Have dinner for two. Take home the leftovers. Eat them for breakfast the next morning. #Don'tJudgeMe 3. Order at least one cocktail. I had the Fallen Captain and he had the Spicy Margarita. Order those or something else. I don't think you can go wrong. 4. The cornbread is irresistible on the menu, but it was not my favorite thing. I don't know if this is because everything else I ate was so good, or it just was A-Ok. If I could do it over, I would have ordered the fried brussel sprouts instead. 5. You must have the Mac and Cheese. You must. Take it from someone who normally could take it or leave it: this one is a take-and-inhale-it. It was creamy, the noodles were done perfectly and there was either crumbled crispy bacon or breadcrumbs on top that added a texture to the dish --the most memorable part. 6. Most importantly: GET THE SPICY FRIED DUCK WINGS. I could write a thesis on this dish, but I think this is better: Order it. Eat it. Enjoy your mind being blown. Write it down in case you ever have to create a last meal (Goddessforbid). Thank me laterz.
