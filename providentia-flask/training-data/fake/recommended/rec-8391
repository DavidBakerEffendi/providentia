Terribly rude staff! When you have to order from a lady, who hardly speaks english, and who ends up yelling and belittling you because of her language barrier, should have known better to hang up and cancel the order. Oh well I didn't. Food took forever to come, and it was average at the best. I admit that the lady's attitude tasted in the food. But nevertheless, there are much better Indian restaurants in the hood, so better to stick with Bay Leaf.
