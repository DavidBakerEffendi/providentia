I've never had a bad meal at Geronimo.  First of all, they have the best tequila menu in town, and make tremendous drinks.  We often order tapas and appetizers and share - and we've brought everyone from carnivors to vegetarians - no complaints. Some very clever options, too!  Go. Drink. Eat.  A very handsome restaurant, with whimsical, tasteful decor and lighting. The only drawback is that it can get quite noisy - but I'd overlook that for the food.  Just reserve early!
