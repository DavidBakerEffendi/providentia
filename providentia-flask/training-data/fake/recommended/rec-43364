I love cheap. "Cheap, cheap, cheap" pretty much runs through my head any time I contemplate pulling out my wallet. And being able to have a cheeseburger, huge plate of fries and a McSorley's for $10 definitely screams "CHEAP." Despite all the glorious cheapness, I would never wait in an hour-long, out-the-door line here. My friend and I came at 6pm on a Wednesday and waited about 15 minutes. I love no-frills burger joints because they usually have the best grub. But I found the cheeseburger here to be pretty lackluster and the fries were nothing to write home about. We sat in the back and it was FREEZING. I kept my scarf on and had to fight the urge to pull my coat back on. When we left around 7:30 the line was to the door. I wanted to tell them all to save their monies, but I just pushed through and prepared to go back out into the cold.
