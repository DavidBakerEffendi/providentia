My friend and I went here late one night due to stress and depression, in search of delicious margaritas, which is exactly what we found. I tried the elderberry and he, the lychee. Both were good... but it wasn't until the strawberry vanilla ($9) that we wished the place was open 4 hours longer. They are not too sweet, just sour enough and have the most incredible aftertaste.. I die! We ate a salad (also $9) which was fresh, though a little too small and the cactus was way too salty for my tastes. The ambiance was super cool, dark and calming with good, nondescript music as a backdrop. And, they let us stay and drink our misery away until no one was left in the restaurant... thanks guys!
