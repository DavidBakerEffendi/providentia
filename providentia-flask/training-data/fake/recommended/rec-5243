I'm writing this review because a) I had a fantastic experience here a couple weeks ago and b) my mother had an extraordinary meal today. She and her friend went to eat here to celebrate a birthday and to have breakfast. The food and service was quite good (according to my mom, who I agree with) but what really elevated the experience was the conversation that the two of them had with one of the chef's. While they were eating, the chef came out and they struck up a conversation. He was incredibly kind, and talked to them for a long time about a variety of topics (from his work in the restaurant to my mom and her friend's work). My mom told him that they were here celebrating their birthdays, and he left for a second. A few moments later, he came back with a piece of pecan pie with a candle in it (2 spoons) and wished her a happy birthday, free of charge! My mom said she was so surprised and touched, and said she will never forget that experience. This place has been incredible in food, service, and overall appeal, and I STRONGLY recommend coming here! A+!
