I checked Yelp for restaurant recommendations in the zip code, and SPANISH TAVERN came up at the top.  My colleagues and I stepped in about 8 pm after a long day of work and travel.  The fantastic aroma welcomed us as soon as we stepped into the restaurant.  The charming bar, and warm staff immediately set the stage for the evening. The dining room is elegantly set up, with white linen, in a cozy environment, soft lighting, and lovely paintings on the wall: a large stock pot overflowing with cooked lobster; a bottle of wine with a glass awaiting to be filled with the ruby fluid; and other "nature morte" to whet the appetite. We were seated and a bread basket was promptly delivered to sustain us, while we were perusing the menu.  We skipped the apps, and went for the good stuff: I got the boiled squid with oil, paprika and potatoes - Pulpo a la Gallega  [remnants of my summer vacation in Iberia], my colleagues requested Salmon al Horno, Filete de Solomillo and a bottle of fantastic VML coleccion privada rioja wine, promptly followed by a second serving, as it was really enjoyable. I must make a point of noting that this is the only restaurant where they serve a delicious soup, a gratis,  prior to presenting the main courses to their customers -- a very nice, "old world" touch. I can go on and on about the flavors, textures, aromas, presentations, the continuous praise uttered by me and my dinner companions, but it's very late and I'm very tired {I rushed to post this review while the experience is fresh in my mind] - suffice it to say that if you are in the area and want a fantastic meal, superior service, all at reasonable prices, make your way to the Spanish Tavern.
