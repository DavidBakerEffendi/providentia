I like to go to this restaurant with my friend N. because she is the kind of person whose eyes roll back into her head, and who moans, when the food is good. At Applewood, she put on quite a show. Dinner starts with a dish of three spreads (I've had pate, bright green pistachio butter, whipped salty french butter, and a satiny white bean/garlic mix). I didn't know I liked trout until I ate it here: fresh and meaty. The suckling pig is to die for. Mushroom appetizer is to die for. Sweetbreads, yes, you guessed it: to die for. Yes, you'll spend $60 a person, but I've never been left hungry. Â Comparable in Manhattan: Savoy.
