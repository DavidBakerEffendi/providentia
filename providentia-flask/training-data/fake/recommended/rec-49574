This place is DE-LISH! the flavors were amazing, i am so impressed by the creativity of these chefs, and the surprisingly good ingredients that go into the rolls. Not only is the flavors carefully chosen, the dish is so carefully prepared and set for you on the table, it really is an eating experience of both sight and touch at an affordable price. I especially recommend the chia seed pudding. It is like tapioca but with coconut milk and chia seeds topped with delicious baked apples and cinnamon.
