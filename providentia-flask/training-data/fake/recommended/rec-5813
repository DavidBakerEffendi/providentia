I've been to Peppercorn's twice now and had two very different experiences. The first time, a friend of my boyfriends was in town visiting and I met the two of them after work. The guys were in shorts and sneakers, since they had been walking around all day and we decided on PG very impromptu. We were greeted by a less-than-thrilled host who looked disapprovingly at the guys' outfits. The sheer look of disgust made me want t o share a few choice words with him. Fortunately for PG our waitor was extremely attentive and knowledgable of the wine and dinner menu. We tried an antipasto with cured meats and cheese, which was overpriced considering there was about one piece of each  thing on the dish. We had the gnocchi with roasted eggplant and mozzarella, which was good but nothing exceptional. The steak was good. The second time we came was for my boyfriend's birthday. This time, we were dressed accordingly and greated with a smiling face from the  same host as the first time. However, this time our server had very little knowledge about the menus. We had the gnocchi again and I don't remember what else we ate since it obviously had no impression on me. I don't think the menu is as revolutionary as the owners want to pretend it is. Nor is it really modern. The verdict: not worth it.
