I'm not really a fan of this place, but when it's late and I don't want to eat pizza or a deli sandwich, I come here. It's expensive, and the food isn't anything to write home about - but - they have a big menu and the ingredients are fresh and they are always very polite and the restaurant is clean. Just nothing too special about the food.
