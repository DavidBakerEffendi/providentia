I had some of the best tacos I've ever had in my LIFE here.  And I live in LA, so this is very high praise!  I tried the calamari tacos, and my guy had the sweet potato and cactus tacos.  Both were absolutely phenomenal.  Calamari is a gamble; it's sometimes fantastic, but sometimes chewy and uneatable. The calamari here is fantastic: tender and lightly breaded, with delightful sauce on top of the tacos. However, I give El Camino Real only 3 stars for two reasons.  First, the price: the tacos are 3 tacos for $10.  That's not a bad deal, since the tacos are fantastic, and filling.  But they charge you $5 more to make it a plate by adding beans and rice.  $5 for beans and rice?  Are you KIDDING me?  I suspect they'd have more happy customers if they charged half that.  Also, they charge a buck a person to have chips and salsa at the table. I don't think I've ever been to another Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa.  Everyone gives that away for free, from hole-in-the-wall taquerias in LA to trendy hipster places to chain Tex-Mex places. Second, the service: this was perhaps the worst service I've received in a restaurant of this sort.  We were there midday on a weekday, and our waiter appeared to be doing double-duty as bartender.  But he basically abandoned us after delivering the food -- didn't offer to refill any drinks, check in about the food, or ask if we needed anything else.  I was chatting with some old friends I hadn't seen in a while, so didn't mind too much. But you shouldn't have to track the waiter down behind the bar thirty minutes after you're done eating. Bonus: we were able to find free street parking a few blocks away!
