Was wandering around in my hood and happened to see this spot out of the corner of my eye. I peeked in through the window and saw a very cozy looking bar/restaurant with muted colors and decorated with a handful of tables and stools.  Absolutely loved what I saw so my friend and I entered to check it out some more.  Much to our delight we were greeted by the owner who welcomed us warmly and boasted about the delicious food and wine.  Of course we had to take a seat after all that enthusiasm. While we wait for our small plates of food (hummus & warm pita, and Mac & cheese) we are sampling wine from their decently sized collection.  The homey atmosphere, friendliness, and good conversation makes me think I found my new neighborhood spot! Will have to update after eating!
