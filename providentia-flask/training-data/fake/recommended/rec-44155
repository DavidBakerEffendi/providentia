Great views! The food is well prepared and the portions are generous. If you're tired of the standard New England diner fare, this menu will be a nice change because there are several Greek-inspired choices. The corned beef has was excellent--made with real corned beef, not some sort of canned, pressed meat product. Our server was very friendly and the service was fast. This is a great place, especially if you want to get away from the crowds in Burlington on a busy fall weekend.
