Um, wow. The banana flambe crepe here is the best dessert crepe I have ever eaten in my life. Totally blew my mind. The Moroccan mint tea was spot-on and took me back to Morocco. The service was friendly, polite, and heavily-accented. In a really cute way. The dinner food was quite tasty too, and fairly-priced for food of this caliber. The veggie pasta and the savoyarde crepe were highly enjoyable. This place gets the full 5 stars for the great prices in addition to very good food, plus the best dessert crepes ever.
