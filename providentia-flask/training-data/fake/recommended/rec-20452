This is the best pizza I've had in New York. So, if you ever find yourself in Midwood, go wait in line here. Yes, it can take forever. The guy makes each pizza, one by one, slowly. But it's worth it. The sauce is perfection, the mozzarela is flown in each week from Italy, the basil is fresh, the parmeggiano is grated on right before you get it, the crust is too good for words. Don't wear clothes you love. You will leave covered in flour and ash. The whole place is covered in it. And it's hot in the summer. Sweltering. I could care less, though. Really, the pizza is that good.
