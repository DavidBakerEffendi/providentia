Good food--small and dark, gets busy so you may have to wait, but you can do that next door at Against the Grain.  The beet salad is highly recommended, as are the beer sausages.  Our pizzas were good, not mind-blowing, but good.  My main complaint is that the beer list is SO small--why not offer everything you have next door at your bar, Against the Grain (which I highly recommend)?
