Another food adventure for me. I went here with my friend to try out some Serbian food for the first time. This place turned out to be a pleasant and authentic spot that is great for those with a curious appetite. We ate the following: -Lepinja Sa Kajmakom - Traditional Serbian bread. This bread is a flat bread with butter in the middle. It was a perfect appetizer for the meal - served hot and fluffy. -Zeljanica - This is a Serbian spinach pie. It is similar to the Greek spinach pie, but it was denser, drier, and harder as well. It tasted a little old, though maybe that's how this item normally is. -Cevapi - This is one of the national dishes of Serbia. It was a bunch of little grilled sausage links, with a side of chopped onions. I ignored the onions, because I don't like onions unless they are grilled. The sausages though were excellent. They are very similar to breakfast sausage links in size and texture - very juicy and soft. -Prebanac - The menu calls this vegetarian dish "baked beans", but these are far different from American and English baked beans. They use Great northern beans, which are similar to lima beans. The beans are boiled and a dash of garlic and tomato sauce is in the dish. -Zito Sa Slagom- This hard to pronounce item is actually a traditional Serbian dessert. It was a cup filled with an oatmeal like pudding, with sugar added, and whipped cream on top. It had a nice, sweet taste and was a good way to finish off our meal. Recommended.
