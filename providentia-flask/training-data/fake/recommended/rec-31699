My boyfriend totally loves seafood so it was his suggestion to come over here. The place was pack yet I felt like I was on the beach. The service was really good and the specials are not too shabby either. For $8 bucks you get 6 oysters and a glass of wine or beer. (I'm down for that if I was a shell lover.) I had the fish and chips which was quite tasteful. Overall I give it a tumbs up!
