Visited Joseph Leonard for Sat. brunch. Had an egg and sausage breakfast, an avocado toast breakfast and some pork belly special.  We shared everything.  It was all delicious.  The coffee press was very good.  The ambience of this place is really charming.  I will definitely be back. That eggs benedict is on my list...
