The food is really good. A very nice place to eat, drink(BYOB), and chat. When you walk in, the atmosphere smell like delicious food. The waiter is friendly and attentive. The decoration of the restaurant is simple but you will feel spacious. The dessert (warm chocolate cake) is delicious. Definitely recommend this place for people who enjoy a relax and delicious meal.
