First off, this place is a very cool looking, cozy spot.  They designed it in a way that you feel transported to a Thai style food shack.  The ceiling has galvanized steel and the wood tables and metal chairs are very simple and perfect for the vibe they are going for. The food in this place is so delicious!  I had the Pad-Kee Moa with Calamari.  The noodles are really good, wish they used some more veggies in the dish.  Hands down, you have to get the "fish sauce", you'll end up putting so much on your food.  There is no fish in it, so don't be turned off by what they call it.  Everyone I went with was dousing their food with it.  Make sure to ask for that.  Warning, it can get hot because of all the chilies, but just try the liquid and you'll be hooked.  Also had the Veg Dumplings, very different, lots on peanuts, yummy. The food can get a little oily, so see if you can have them go light on the oil.  I haven't asked them yet, but I may ask the next time I go. They also have interesting dessert specials.
