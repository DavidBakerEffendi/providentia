I am not a fan of Soul food restaurants. Why? Cuz I come from the south. Best soul food I've eaten is while sitting on a porch or in the added on room to the house or in the back yard of my auntie or "grandma an dem's" house.  It's never fancy, but its good and full of love and soul. After the meal, someone always says, "Mmm! She put her foot in those (greens, Mac and Cheese, etc)!" Needless to say, this lowers my expectation at dining out on soul food. OK, so that being said, I was there last week with some work folks. We did a set menu of greens, fried chicken, candied yams, mac and cheese, cornbread, ribs, banana pudding and peach cobbler. The chicken was wonderful. Well seasoned, hot and delicious!  Greens and cornbread were good, as well. I give mac and cheese a B, just because noodles were overcooked. Peach cobbler was a waste of my calories! I will say the staff was friendly and overall the experience was pleasant. Will I return?  For the fried chicken...ABSOLUTELY!
