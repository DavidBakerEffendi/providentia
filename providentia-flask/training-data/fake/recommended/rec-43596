The Jolly Goat is SO worth a visit- though small, it sure is mighty. Turkish owner Murat prides himself on everything he sells- from the amazing bagel sandwiches to the mouth-watering vegan ice cream (yeah, I totally just did use mouth-watering and vegan to describe one thing), to, of course, the excellent espresso. Â  Baristas know their sh*t, and as previously mentioned by other Yelpers, the almond latte is perfect. Have a visit. Do it. 'tis the season to be jolly! It's warm inside, and you'll feel right at home.
