We stopped in Philly on the way to DC last may.  We only came there for steaks, the lights, pictures and police patches tipped the scales in the favor of Geno's over Pat's. I got "1 wit" that comes smothered in cheese whiz, then I had grilled onions and no mushrooms.  Fries and a drink. One of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever tasted.  A couple guys went over to Pat's but I couldn't make the trip after the sandwich and fries. I'd go again but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there from Chicago.
