Ordered a cheesesteak through GrubHub, and it took 1 hour and 25 minutes for delivery. This is the second time my delivery took 1+ hours. Had to heat it up in the microwave. The sandwiches are delicious, but pick it up yourself. No point in getting a hard seeded roll if it's soggy and you have to nuke it.
