Easily the best fresh cocktail program in Sunnyside at the moment.  Not that that was a high bar to pass, but I think these guys are going to be rotating out drinks and ingredients seasonally, which will be a very nice addition to the neighborhood.  We tried all 4 cocktails on the menu right now and they have a nice variety of fresh summer drinks, all of which are very well balanced.  The lemoncello/sage cocktail definitely stood out, as did "The Rose" which is a plymouth gin/citrus/angostura/egg-white drink. As far as the food goes, I think they have a nice selection here as well.  Putting a poached egg on the caesar salad is a nice though, thought I can't say I care for the shredded lettuce with the caesar.  Personally I'd rather see whole romaine spears like you get at Quality Meats (IMHO the best caesar salad in NYC). The stracchino pizza is great, and I love the very thin/crispy crust.  Very neopolitan. I also tried the sea bass, which was perfectly prepared (I love a nice crispy skin on top) and with a sweet orange reduction over the top and over the string beans. For dessert, we had the rice pudding arrancini, little balls of rice pudding with raspberries in the middle, breaded and very lightly fried, on top of a lemon curd sauce.  Really wonderful light dessert considering it was fried. The pasta looks amazing as well, so I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu, and also to see how this restaurant evolves over time.
