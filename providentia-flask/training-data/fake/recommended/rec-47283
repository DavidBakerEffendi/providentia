After waiting for an hour on a Saturday evening, it started pouring but good thing my friend brought a umbrella before-hand from a nearby gift shop. Even though the rain was heavy, people insisted on standing on the line so I was assuming it must be good. To disappointment, this place was definitely not worth the hour and plus wait. I could have gotten better pizza elsewhere. The only good thing about this place was that it wasn't over priced considering it's a "must go to tourist spot"
