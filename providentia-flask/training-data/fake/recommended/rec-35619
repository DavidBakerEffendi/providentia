We made an early reservation (5pm) on a Friday night as we had theater tickets at 7pm. The place was absolutely empty when we arrived, but had filled up some by they time we left at 6:30. We ordered a pitcher of white sangria to start. It was good, but not $32 good. I think we would have been better off ordering a bottle. For food, we ordered the cheese mixto, the duck canape, the crab canape, the octopus, the green beans, and the scallops. The cheese was great. We didn't specify which we wanted, I just asked for one soft, one medium, and one hard. We enjoyed every bite, and appreciated the accompaniments, too. I wasn't too impressed with the canapes. My husband really liked the duck. The crab didn't really taste like crab. I could tell it was seafood, but if I hadn't known it was crab, I wouldn't have thought it was crab. The octopus was very tasty and so were the green beans (though they did have a bit too much dressing on them). The scallops: YUM! If I hadn't been so full by the time we finished the scallops, I would've ordered another plate. They were that good. For dessert we decided to share the custard, based on the many positive reviews I'd read. Neither of us was too impressed. It was good, but I wish we'd gotten the apple gateaux instead. The service was very good. Attentive, but not overly present. The decor is a little spare. Especially the bathroom--it could really use some. Bottom line. Very good dinner.
