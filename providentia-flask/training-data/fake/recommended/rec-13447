Straight up hole-in-the-wall bahn-mi joint.   I chose the vegetarian pork (don't ask why), which I will never do again.  The bread, though, was good as were everything else.  My date's classic was also delicious.  Not my favorite Vietnamese sandwich shop (Saigon Shack on MacDougal), but a worth a drop-by if I am in the area.
