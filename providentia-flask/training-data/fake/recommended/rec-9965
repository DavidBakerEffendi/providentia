My company ordered from this place. I have been a vegetarian my entire life. I have nothing against the act of eating meat, but I choose not to. I recently consumed 1/2 cup of "vegetarian lentil" soup before a coworker opened his, took a sip, and informed me that some of the disgusting little chunks in the soup were meat. Tip to restaurants everywhere: if you're going to serve "vegetarian" anything, do NOT include meat in it! On another relevant note, the soup and sandwiches were awful. According to coworkers, the chicken was dry. The bread is days old, and the tomatoes are absolutely not ripe. Soup spot, you lost good business. Vegetarians: be warned.
