Came here for Friday morning brunch and ordered the orange juice, buttermilk pancakes with banana, and homefries. The orange juice was tiny but delicious, very fresh. I don't think it was worth the price but I did ask for a small. Â The pancakes were delicious and absolutely mouthwatering. I didn't use too much syrup, the banana and buttermilk were an excellent combination on its own. The homefries were a bit average, but not bad. Service wasn't bad. The place is a bit small so it's not ideal for groups. It's nice for 2-4 people.
