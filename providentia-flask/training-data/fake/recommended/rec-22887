Went there for a later-than-usual dinner as its kitchen is open until later than some of the other restaurants and really liked it. The price is fair for NYC, but the price fix menu doesn't seem worth it. Instead, we only ordered two entrees (which also come with the free and delicious just-out-of-the-oven bread). I ordered the pork chop and my girlfriend ordered the lobster ravioli, which were both delicious. The ravioli is a small portion, though it was enough for her, it wouldn't be enough for someone who eats a lot. It was a bit weird as we were on the first floor all alone, so the waitress would just stay there looking at us (as the place is fairly small and basically there was nowhere else to look at). It seems the bar upstairs is where all the fun really goes on, but we just wanted to have a nice dinner and go back to our hotel. Maybe New Yorkers won't enjoy this place, but we loved it. And the price is definitely fair. PS: we're Brazilian tourists in New York
