Was expecting big things after the hype from friends and via yelp. The Halal Cart on 53rd and 6th is super famous and has been recommended to us enthusiastically by many friends and family. We came across the cart at the corner and you can't miss it because it's the one cart which the humungous line. Luckily these guys have it down to an art and keep the line moving.  For only $6 you get a plate of rice with two wedges of pita bread and your choice or lamb, chicken or combo meat.  They also have a La Vic's-like signature white sauce.
