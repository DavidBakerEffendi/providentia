This place is a cool spot. They have a decent sized food menu, but where they really shine are their cocktails. Their mixologist is very creative, sometimes during brunch I see their bartenders experimenting with new stuff. It shows they are passionate about what they do. Food: Fried pickles -One of my favorite things on the menu. Lightly battered and fried, they come with a spicy creamy dipping sauce. Afton burger -Always juicy, perfectly cooked. I get mine with bacon. Mac and Cheese -This is my favorite on the menu, nice and creamy, also get it with bacon. Comes in a little skillet. I have even had brunch here, the Blueberry muddle is a great cocktail that makes me feel better after a night of drinking, breakfast items are also well done. Pancakes and Irish Breakfast are my go-to. Overall: This place is a lot of fun for a night out or a quiet brunch. The night times on Friday and Saturdays are pretty loud so don't expect a quiet peaceful dinner, the place gets pretty packed, but this is to be expected. You're going to have a good meal and drink here. Lots of fun.
