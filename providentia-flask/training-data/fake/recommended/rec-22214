I've been to Caseus several times and although this place may score some high points among the pseudo-sophisticated foodie hipster type, who, for some reason, are craving mac and cheese, the food here is surprisingly sub-par. The chef must really like pepper or seems to have never heard of any other spice or seasoning because, quite literally, everything I have ever eaten here is completely bland except for the overwhelming pepper flavor. The last thing I ate at Caseus was called on the menu "Strip Steak" with "Rice." It was strange that when I asked if I could have the steak medium rare the waitress told me it only came well done. I ended up getting a bowl full of rice and little pieces of carrots and what seemed to be the tiny remains of what was once some sort of steak. The whole thing was astonishingly tasteless except, of course, the overwhelming flavor of pepper. The dish explains why the term "Doggy Bag" came into existence because it was barely edible even for an animal. I tried to feed it to my dog, but even he seemed disinterested.   Secondly, most other items on the menu are a sort of mishmash of options a twelve year old might assemble. Grilled cheese, mac and cheese, cheese burger, and the occasional menu "special," the very creative, "steak and cheese hot pocket" (I'm not making this up) which sounded like something I ate at 2am when I was a freshman in college and regretted it.   I really don't get the hype about this place. There is a good beer selection, otherwise I would stay away.
