Meat-galore! I don't know if I should flip the start-stop-sign... cause when I flip it to GO... Oh Gosh!!! Here comes the dudes with meat ... slice! Slice! Slice! Meat! Meat! Meat! Here's some key points: (1) Come here when you're super hungerrrsss (2) Amazing shrooms (3) Fresh salad bar (4) Nice wine menu (5) When GO means GO - men will come with meat on your plate! NOMS (6) $$$ - decent (7) Make sure your date is ready to eat like a piggie! (8) Top Sirloin - my favs (9) Lamb (10) Everything really... **OVERALL: will come back again when I'm philly for some non-stop meat and shrooms! 5 stars!
