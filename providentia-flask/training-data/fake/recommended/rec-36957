Hands down the best pizza in CT and one of the best in the country. Â  This is one of the top 10 pizzaria in the country acoording to food network and national geographic programs. They are legendary Pizza maker. Go try white clam pizza....lots of juicy clam and so delicious. Sally in New Haven is great too. But Pepe's is just beyond perfect! One of the best Pizza I've ever had.
