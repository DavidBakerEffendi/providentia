Ask as few questions as possible and everyone stays happy! The way it goes is you order at the counter then take a seat. Food comes to you. Gaia is an angel in the kitchen. Her food is authentic and the portions are fantastic for a small price tag. She's tough to people who don't know her system as we learned today, but I didn't mind. You can tell she just loves food and making people happy with what she can offer. The questions and customer service portion can get tiring because she really is on her own here. Whatever, its the best damn Italian food I ever had and she has a gift.
