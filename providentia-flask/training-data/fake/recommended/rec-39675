I have been here several times. The BBQ is delicious but  what takes the cake for me is the mac and cheese!  Is that crazy? It is gooey and cheesy and melted. All the things one can love about mac.   I buy Groupon vouchers for Suzy Ques because they have them all the time.  For a small price (around $30) you can have two entrees, and two glasses of wine or beer. The portion of food in their entrees are enormous! The smoked wings are very juicy and had a nice smokey flavor. The brisket is also juicy and had good flavor. You can dowse everything in there signature BBQ sauces which I love to do. One is sweet,  one savory, and tangy. Try them all.   Overall,  good place for BBQ.  I like the set up.
