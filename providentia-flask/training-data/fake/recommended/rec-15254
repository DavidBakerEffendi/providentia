Great atmosphere. Guy behind the counter was very patient and let me take my time figuring out what I wanted to order. Bread was awesome! Â Tasted fresh, crispy on outside and soft inside. I got the works with provolone. Great sandwich. Also tasted the Italian Chicken, lots and lots of chicken, but wasn't as good as the Philly Cheesesteak. Great experience, highly recommended.
