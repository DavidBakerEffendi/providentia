Stopped by the cart while it was in willy b. Really impressed. They just started doing a cold noodle for summer time and it's so good. I had two bowls. It comes with a chili paste that you mix in and the spice just makes it perfect. I also tried the jasmine tea. Would be amazing as a cocktail. In my opinion. :) Will hit the cart again for the curry. Smell made my mouth water. 5 stars!
