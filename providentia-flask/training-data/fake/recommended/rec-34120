If you want a burger and a beer, and you're in New Haven, this is your place. We rolled up to this place early on a Friday evening, and it was pretty packed, so we sat at the bar to wait for a table.  They have a good selection of draft beer. We got a table within twenty minutes.  I ordered a New Haven burger (medium rare, of course), which comes with Swiss cheese, bacon, pickles, lettuce, grilled onion, and a house sauce.  It was everything and more than I hoped it would be--pretty close to perfect.   Practically everything on the menu is served with Belgian frites.  They alone are worth the trip.
