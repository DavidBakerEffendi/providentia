I've had just about every sandwich on the menu and I haven't had one I didn't like. If you like wasabi, the wasabi cheesesteak is far and away my favorite. The 50/50 is another classic choice. Can't forget about Monday's $5 pork sandwich either. They also usually offer a unique monthly special that is worth trying. Â On the side I would go with potato pancakes or farm fries. Don't forget to wash it down with a birch beer or their shake of the month.
