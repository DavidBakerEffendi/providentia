I'm rounding up giving Dinosaur 3 stars; I think it probably deserves 2.5. I'd describe most of the food as "fine": Not great, but not terrible. The one exception to Â is the mac 'n cheese which I think is downright disappointing. I'm baffled by all the rave reviews. There are *much* better places to get BBQ, both in Brooklyn (e.g., Fort Reno) and Manhattan (e.g., Hill Country). Definitely not worth the wait.
