Went to this place for my girl's bday and had a great time.  The owner was very nice and accommodating.  Great atmosphere and great looking venue.  The upstairs and downstairs makes if great for all occasions.  Upstairs it a quieter area to have a drink and good conversation, and the downstairs is great for getting loose with a group of friends. I would def go back.
