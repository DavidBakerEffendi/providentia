I've been going here regularly for 15 years. I walked into a very empty Balthazar at around 11, and asked (as I do most mornings) to sit at one of my regular booths. The host in the front looks me up and down before saying, "No, we can't do that." He would only allow me to sit at the bar. Then, when I tried to order breakfast, which again I've been doing at this same time for 15 years, they refused to serve me any and gave me a lot of attitude. I promptly walked out. Why would I pay 3 times as much money to go to a restaurant where I am treated like garbage and made to feel bad? I will never return to what was one of my favorite restaurants in nyc. They've really changed.
