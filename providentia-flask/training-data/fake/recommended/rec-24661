Went last week with my wife. Thankfully it stopped raining a few hours prior to our reservation, so that we were able to sit in the open air section. We kept commenting all night about the decor, which felt both upscale, and cozy. The ambiance was romantic, and the crowd was quite attractive. (We had models having dinner at the large table behind us, so that propelled the attractiveness quotient of the room exponentially) I had the cured meat appetizer, and i've never met a cured meat i didn't like, and Salinas' cured meat selection was good. My wife had the lamb meatballs, and those were excellent, if not exactly plentiful. As for the entree, I had the Porcella, which was a tad dry, but flavorful, and the skin was perfectly crisp and delicious. My wife had the Bacalao, octopus and cockles, which was delicious. All in all this was a great place, with a great menu. I would recommend this for anyone going on a first date, or a date night, as the atmosphere lends it self to intimacy and romance
