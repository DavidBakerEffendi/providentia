Luckily, my friend and I did not wait at all although we arrived at 10am on Sunday. It was a super cold day but we were so fortunate. After 15-30 minutes later, the waiting line started. Of course, we ordered blueberry pancakes, which was very soft and moist. I love it. Additionally we ordered eggs benedict. I really love it. I love the biscuit instead of English muffin. The biscuit was very moist but bit crunch outside. I don't usually order benedict but it was a great dish. I want to go back and eat it again.
