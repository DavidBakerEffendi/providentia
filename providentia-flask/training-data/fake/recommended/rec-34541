The food may be good but what is up with the trashy maintenance of this place? We were warned by an angry customer who was walking out that something bit her and it us mostly bed bug infested. We should have paid attention because one of us started having a terrible rash and itch in like five minutes. This is consistent with what another friend who visited the two different branches told us!
