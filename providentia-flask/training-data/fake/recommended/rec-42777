Not only was I greeted by women who were upset with the service - apparently they didn't like the wine they were served and were asked to leave when they asked for a replacement; When we walked up, we were asked if we knew them (btw I immediately thought they were being racist because they were Persian.) But when asked to provide my ID (which I did thinking "wow someone thinks I'm 22?") I was asked if I had been drinking (yes , one glass of wine! I get happy on one, sue me!) I was told they do not serve anyone who had been drinking. I guess I was not the right person who was drinking. We politely left and and gave our hard-earned money to another establishment. It's unfortunate we were looking forward to trying them out. Oh well, their loss. Â @kathrynkingman
