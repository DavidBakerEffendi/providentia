My coworker and I had to run to Home Depot for lunch and wanted to grab something while in the same shopping area.  We decided to give this place a try as we both really enjoy Indian food and it looked really cute inside. We debated over the menu for a few minutes, the guy behind the counter looked at us like we were nuts the whole time and offered no assistance or recommendations.. We stumbled upon the specials ourselves, he couldn't even be bothered to point them out as we obviously struggled to order.  We eventually placed our order and sat down. TWENTY minutes later our appetizers came out.  20 minutes for a Samosa seems crazy to me, but they were tasty.  Another 10 minutes went by before our meals came out.  There is obviously NO hurry at Hurry Chutney!  I could be naïve about Indian food, but when I saw my whole meal consisted of two pieces of chicken, no rice, no sauces, just chicken, the $13 I just spent seemed REALLY overpriced.  We started regretting not just going to the buffet at Palace of Asia in Hamilton (which is wonderful, and cheaper!!).  After 40 minutes, we had to get back to work so we asked for to-go containers for our meals, and I was told "EVERYTHING IS OVER THERE" and was pointed in the direction of the paper plates on a shelf. Needless to say, the service was slow, the food was OK but WAY overpriced, and we were not made to feel welcome at all, more like we were an inconvenience being in there even though they had 1 other customer in the whole place. We will not be returning, and made sure to tell our other coworkers about our experience as well.
