Yes! There are TWO options for Indian food in the Upper Valley!  I actually think Taj E was as good, if not better, than Jewel of India.  We got a couple curry dishes with naan and samosas and it was about four meals worth of food - for a very reasonable 30 bucks.  Definitely a good option when you don't feel like cooking and are tired of the usual bistro food options around here. Make sure you go around to what might seem like the back side of the house-like building and ring on the correct door.
