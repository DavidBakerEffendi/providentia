Very nice, cozy atmosphere. Small plates and first course dishes we had were good but not amazing and not up to the hype we had going in. We had meatballs, Brussel sprouts, baked oyster for small plates and first course was pretzel and tomato mozzarella. However second course dishes were delicious. We had short ribs and the chicken wings. Overall, great place to go for a romantic special occasion and prices were reasonable. But wouldn't put this place in the top echelon quite yet. Perhaps our favorite part was that this was a local spot and we didn't need to travel into the city.
