To this day Gramercy Tavern remains my favorite restaurant in the city.   The tavern side is much more my style, and if a bad dish exists on their menu, I haven't found it yet.  Don't be afraid to order out of your comfort zone at times, you will most often be rewarded for your intrepid nature.   The service staff is warm and attentive, and the sommelier seems to have a flare for the obscure.  I was looking for  at a glass of vermouth after dinner one night and her eyes just seemed to light up at the challenge of finding something that isn't often ordered.  She tasted me on some amazing options until I settled on the Punt e Mes.  She even gave my wife some shopping options for finding the creme de violet that she loves.   This place is as close to perfect as a restaurant can get.
