Finally made it to Umami Burger and was not disappointed. Â Was able to easily snag a table at 6:30 pm on a Monday night. My boyfriend and I both got the classic burger and it was really juicy. Not the best burger I've ever had, but certainly enjoyable. However, the real highlight for me was the seasonal special of avocado toast. This was absolutely scrumptious! It had a layer of creamy avocado on buttery brioche topped with arugula, a sunny side up egg and fried shallots. It was SO GOOD!!! Highly recommend and a steal at $6. As I will soon be moving right near here, I am sure I will be back.
