I visited twice recently on weekend mornings to grab a coffee.  I wouldn't recommend eating there.  First visit:  as I'm standing at the cash register counter to order my coffee, I look to my right and notice a woman in the kitchen holding an infant while placing bagels into a toaster.  What restaurant with an open kitchen thinks its a good idea that the staff have their hands all over a baby's dirty diaper ass and snotty face while simultaneously handling the food?  Second visit:  I'm standing at the cash register counter to order my coffee, one server walks by me carrying plates of food and is chomping on a mouth full of food so is unable to respond to my smile and "good morning" greeting.  Meanwhile, another staff member is standing in the kitchen eating.  If the staff is so hungry at 10AM, why don't they take a break, sit down at one of the many empty tables with their food and eat, then wash their hands before going back to work - almost every seat/table in the place was empty.  Food handlers and servers should not eat while working - not to mention handle a baby while cooking - because these habits can potentially contaminate your food with hazardous germs, bacteria and/or viruses.  I won't be going back.
