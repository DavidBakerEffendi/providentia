I loved this place! The seating had a lil wait because  of the Saturday mob. My husband and I had a lil bit of everything. I gave it a 4 star only because  they didn't  have the fried oysters i had my heart set on or the turtle tart. Other than that is was great....o we just had the banana cream pie and the pumpkin pie, it was not good at all.
