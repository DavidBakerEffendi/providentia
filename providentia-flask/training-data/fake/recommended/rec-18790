Went to Ozu twice in the past couple weeks, and I'm going to have to say that they now take the #1 spot for Japanese in the area. They make their rolls exactly the way I want it - a lot of fresh goodness inside without overloading on cheap rice. If you want to get your money's worth on rolls, definitely check out Ozu. $8 for 2 and $11 for 3 rolls for their lunch special. I also loved that they offered brown rice for free when I ordered their sashimi lunch special. I'm a convert!
