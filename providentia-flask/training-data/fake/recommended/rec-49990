Our banker suggested this place so we had to try it. She said it's one of the best halal places around with great food. We ordered alo chaat, wouldn't try it again. It was dry and didn't look to good. Beef Chapli kabobs were definitely good, cooked well and had great taste. We also had hot wings (they aren't really hot/spicy- I was under the impression they would be). It's a quite place, service & management is great
