Interesting brunch choices! I get tired of seeing only pancakes & French toast on menus so it was great to have more varied choices such as the perfectly spicy huarache de pollo and the gorditas de Puebla! Fresh ingredients combined in novel ways make this place stand out. And a garden to eat it in to boot! But not cheap.
