Having grown up in NY and worked there afterward, this is by far my favorite French restaurant hands down.  Although a bit loud at times and difficult to get a table on a walk in basis, it is well worth it.  Now that I live in CA I routinely recommend Balthazar to all my friends visiting NY.   The french onion soup is to die for and the steaks are always just right.  Did I mention the frittes?  Thin with just the right amount of crunch and zest.  If you have room definitely get the souffle.   The best times to hit Balthazar without a reservation is during the weekdays.  Also if you are on a budget go for lunch since the menu is almost the same but a bit cheaper.   I must also mention this place is also popular with the stars.  I have seen quite a number of celebs munching down at this oh so good restaurant.
