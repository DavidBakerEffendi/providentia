I went for an early dinner with my mom and everything was great! For an appetizer we shared an order of the wood-grilled octopus. Main course: my mom had the rabbit casalinga with polenta, and I had the special of roast pig topped with crispy skin alongside roasted potatoes; we split an order of artichokes as a side. The octopus was the best I've ever had, better than the one I had at the Standard Tap (also located in Philly). I tried some of my mom's rabbit and it was very good, but my main course was better. Not only was it the best slow-roasted pig I've ever had, the crispy skin on top was like icing on a cake, so good. To top it off, the grilled artichokes in olive oil were (once again) the best I've ever had, and I spent a semester abroad in Rome, Italy last summer so that tells you how good they are. Since it is on the pricey side, this place is more for a special occasion as opposed to a normal friday night out, but it is definitely worth it. If you order one thing when you go there, get the octopus, it's that good (though a bit small, but very good regardless).
