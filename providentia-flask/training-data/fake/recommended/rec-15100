This place is good for happy hour. They do reverse happy hour that starts at 9. I think their regular menu is overpriced for the quality you are getting. I enjoy the happy hour but if you come at a peak time its hard to get a table. Tables are self serve so you may have to be swift with taking someone else's as they are leaving which can be a bit stalker-y feeling. Regardless, for cheap drinks and apps I recommend the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps as well as the flat bread pizzas. Sushi is OK but definitely not the best I've had. Overall I give it four stars because the food is good and cheap during happy hours. Another big plus is that the manager always stops by the table every time we have dined here (and we have eaten here at least over a dozen times). We waited 20 min for service once and the manager came and comped us our first round of drinks for free. I'll keep coming back.
