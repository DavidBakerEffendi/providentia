Maybe by New Jersey standards it is spectacular, but in my opinion, Zen is simply ok. I think that one thing this place has going for them is that they accept coupons!  Make sure you don't leave home without one. The decor and food is alright.   We ordered squid for an appetizer.  It was very tasty! We also had the sashimi.  The cuts were too thick.  Overall the sashimi tasted fine, except the waitress could not tell us what each of the fish were :/  leaving us guessing as to what we were chewing. We also had a dragon roll and a soft shell crab tempura roll.  Both were pretty decent in taste, quantity, and price!   Service is kind of lacking for a Japanese restaurant.  Not attentive at all until we asked for a check.     I would probably go back to this place if I were really craving for some sushi!  I left full and satisfied.
