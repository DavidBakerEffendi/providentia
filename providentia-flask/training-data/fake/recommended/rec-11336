My friend is in from out of town and we were  hungry. We like walking around and trying new places. We found this place and decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately-      I was highly disappointed with this meal. I asked for an 'Ice lemon tea' and the server suggested a Malaysian tea, He said it was better and made with milk. I acquiesced even though i should have stuck with what I originally had wanted. It wasn't bad, just not what I had wanted. I also requested something spicy. When I asked if the Curry chicken was spicy, He stated it  was "very hot and spicy". I must say it was the blandest food I have  ever tasted.I threw a whole cup of Sriracha on it and it still couldn't save it. The meal left much to be desired. I wouldn't return.
