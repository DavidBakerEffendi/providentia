Ok, let's put it this way..... I had a friend visiting from L.A., and after bar hopping in Olde City he asked if we could "go back to that Vampiry place". LOL Now with that said, allow me to explain. He wasn't referring to a goth scene or some underground bloodletting. The ambiance of this place is great.... Dark, candle-lit, classic old style wooden bar, red velvet entrance curtain. Very cool atmosphere. They have an excellent beer menu too, for those who like more than your average light beer.
