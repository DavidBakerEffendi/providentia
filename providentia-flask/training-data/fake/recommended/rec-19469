Shocked at how horrible food and service was here. We arrived at 11:00pm so I knew that food would be okay so we only ordered the small plates. At first the waiter switched one of chicken plates for ham but I actually still enjoyed the food so I didn't say anything. What really bothered me was the empanadas. I ordered chicken empanadas and we received beef. I told the waiter what happened and he took away the plate and didn't say anything. Five minutes later he came back and said "so do you still want the chicken empanadas or no?" I was initially confused at the question because I thought we could just get what we ordered but he just repeated the question so I told him no thank you. The manager did come by and apologize. What really bothered me the most though was that our bill still had the empanadas on it! I told the waiter and he took it off the final bill but I was shocked that the whole fiasco. I'm hoping it was only because we went there so late at night and the service is otherwise okay but I was expecting a lot more from a Jose garces restaurant. To be honest with you the food was not good at all!! This restaurant is far from any of his other ventures.
