???? How has anyone given this place 5 stars? It sucked. Server could not have cared less. Staff standing around looking at their phones. Asked for recommendations on the menu and got a "Uh, the goat cheese is popular"... What we did end up ordering was drenched in sauce (steak frites) and super small portions ($8 for a laughable amount of Brussels) An overall regretful decision to eat here.
