Pork is clearly their core competence here (although service is not*). We had a great deal of it, all of which was great. The barbecue pork buns were exceptional, the meat is very crispy. The pigs ears were crunchy/chewy and flavorful. For entrees we had the pork shoulder steak and spicy pork sausages. The pork shoulder tasted great, although, being a shoulder cut, was quite chewy. The drinks were competently executed, the Scottish Navy Sour has a very complex, smokey flavor. Took about half an hour for the two of us to get seated for dinner on Saturday night, so plan accordingly. *Service seemed kind of slow, particularly the drinks.
