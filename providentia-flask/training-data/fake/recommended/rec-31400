We went during opening week. We decided to give it a try despite hankering assumptions that it might be a lot like their failed predecessor that formerly occupied that location. The decor is dark and kinda baroque, I liked the huge booths with tufted velvet seating. This place has a dining area, a vodka bar (with other boozes as well), and a club like area in the back. This place is actually pretty huge. The seating area has lots of big TVs also that played sports, thus its also part sports bar. Seems like they wanted to be a little bit of everything. I ordered the small plate of wings and the zucchini and cheese fritters. The wings were annoying and very dry. I got them half Parmesan and half Cajun. Though I ordered dry rub flavors, they could of made the chicken itself not dry. Also the Parmesan seemed to fall of the chicken when picked up thus becoming a plain wing with no flavor. It was basically plain wings with some kraft Parmesan sprinkled on top. The zucchini fritters were kind of ugly but ok tasting. They seemed more like little flat pancakes than fritters. My eating partner got a burger with fries that was actually not bad. The fries were decent and the burger was cooked medium well and not dry. I regretted the two appetizers I ordered. We also got some beers. The waiter, when asked what beers were on tap, told us something like "you know dark, light, ales...," Instead of telling us what beers they actually had on tap. I'll be nice and chalk that up to opening week. Overall though I probably won't be going back.
