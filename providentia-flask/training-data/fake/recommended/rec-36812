Our Friend Lili's Birthday Dinner last night at ilili. How can you find more prefect place for her? Dark and very woody deco was quite comfortable. Since we were a big group (15 ppl), we had prix-fixe menu $35 per person. The appetizers, mostly those usual hummus and other dips. We tried almost all appetizers in the menu. Dips are definitley tastefully done, more fine spread and subtle flavoring. I wasn't so crazy about falafel, chicken wings or beef tartar - they seem a bit too blend and usual to me. However, main course Sidon Black Cod that I had was so good. The Cod was so tender and moist melting in my mouth, and everyone raved about it. Other entres were great and everyone really finished all. The portion was just right after filling appetizers. The dessert, I had this Lebanese icecream and no one had any idea what this was made of? My Vanilla ice cream was almost tasted like soap (i think bc of some sweet herbs) with gooey texture. Not that it was bad but it was strange. Majority had chocolate candy bar and that was quite good. It is like a little caramel piece covered with milk chocolate. Overall, the service was really spot on - almost too attentive sometimes. We almost thought that this waiter had a crush on one of our girls.. LOL Only throw back was all the tables are round and they put two big tables together for us which made hard to talk to the other table and we had to move around to talk. I guess it is designed for intimate sharing but, i see a lot of other big table as us sitting weird as well. And it was a bit too dark to see food. Â Other than that, it was elegantly done for this type of cuisine which my usual experience elsewhere was more casual and not refined. With Wines, bill was $65 per person. Mature crowd in dining area but, there is a separate cool bar and lounge area so it could be a great casual lounging with appetizers and drinks. A bit dressy attire. Recommended.
