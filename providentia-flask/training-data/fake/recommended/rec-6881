Quietly tucked under the BQE, Xixa is cozy and delicious. The theme is sharing plates that are all very unique and surprisingly affordable (~$8/dish). The wine selection is impressive. We ending up getting a bottle of white from the Basque region in Spain ($40 range - also very reasonable). The menu is eclectic Mexican in tapas form - everything we had was fresh and tasty (I especially enjoyed the blue crab tamales in poblano cream and carrots with honey butter, feta, and dill....) The food was fantastic and there was no wait on a Friday night at 10. Minus one for the "meh" attitude of our server who was so eager to cash out, she forgot to ring us up.
