So this little hole in the wall spot is on point. I say hole in the wall cause its just that, its small eating venue that has seating too close to each other. And oh this place does not take cards "Only Cash" SMH. .. At any rate the food makes up for this place, went there with my lovely lady; I had Warm Maple Butter Pancakes with maple syrup on the side and a side of eggs and bacon. Wow this food was off the hook.. Go there people you wont be disappointed, I know Â wasn't ;)
