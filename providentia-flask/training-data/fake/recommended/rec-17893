This place is a goto place for peruvian food. I typically know the spots for more Caribbean food, so I had to depend on a peruvian for their goto spot.. This was highly recommended. It did not disappoint for peruvian. We got a huge platter, I think it was called the matador special. Its basically a little bit of everything. Chicken to the sausage, rice, beans, fries, vegetables. The one thing that I heard from others at the table that are ceviche freaks.. That this place make the best ceviche they have ever had. I think the platter combo was good but I think dominican food is better. I can't vouch for the ceviche but I am guessing it must have been top notch to produce that kind of reaction. The place gets loud pretty quick b/c its all hard materials there, so a couple of voices really carry through. I think if you are in the mood for peruvian food, then this is your goto spot!
