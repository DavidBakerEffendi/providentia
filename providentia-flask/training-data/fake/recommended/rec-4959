Went here with my friend again last night, its still awesome. I don't get here often because I live almost thirty minutes away, but it is well worth the trip every time. Everything on the menu is good, I really love the Kadu, Sombosa's, the qabuli palow and pretty much everything else. My friend tried the Hookah and loved it! The chai is wonderful, especially on a cold like last night. The decorations have changed since last time I have been there and I think it looks a lot nicer. The service was friendly and attentive as always.
