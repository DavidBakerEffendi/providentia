We picked up a pie from Paulie Gee's on Friday for a bring your own pizza party.  After some debate, we decided on a Regina with Fennel Sausage.  We stopped by at a little after 7:00 pm on Friday night and the place was super crowded.  I do feel that they don't have enough people in the front of the house managing the crowds and pick up orders. Anyway, the pizza was delicious.  All of the ingredients were very fresh, especially the cheese.  We definitely want to come back for a sit-down dinner.
