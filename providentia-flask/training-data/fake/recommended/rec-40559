Loved this spot!  The mojitos were the MOST DELICIOUS that I ever tasted! Had a beautiful brown eyed waitress who knew what she was talking about...very helpful. We started with the Guacamole Cubano - so fresh and yummy!  Then the coconut conch soup which my husband devoured! I had a delicious fish special that melted in my mouth.  My partner had Ropa Vieja which he thoroughly enjoyed! The coffee and espresso was also delicious and hot!  We will be coming back!!
