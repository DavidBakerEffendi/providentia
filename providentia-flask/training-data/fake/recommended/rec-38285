Kate just catered a party for us in our home over the weekend.  The service was impeccable and the food was outstanding!   We chose Kate's because of how much we love her lunch spot in Verona and we were not disappointed. Our guests were gushing over the food (still are 3 days later) and we have sent all of our local friends and family over to Kate's Kreations.
