Mushroom Tartine - creamy, piled high with a ton of creamy mushrooms and absolutely delicious. Gruyere Cheese Croquettes - Do you like fried and battered? Then this would be for you. It's a nice crispy batter that's not oily. Good as an appetizer but I would try the Shrimp ones. Small, narrow restaurant with wooden benches and chairs. It has a quaint new england feel and the menu is very mussel oriented. Wednesdays you get all you can eat mussels with a beer for something under $30. I like their beer selection although Delirium Tremens was out of stock. Six Point Buzz not a bad alternative. It's cozy and a nice place to go on a snowy night.
