Decent quality BUT TOO SWEET! The ingredients were all good quality, and the food wasn't necessarily bad, but please (Up Thai), come down on the sweetness. Ordered: chick dumplings - well made and presented, but like taking a bite of a spoonful of peanut butter + sweetener Shrimp pad Thai - VERY RICH...basically same feedback Thai salad - super fresh greens, but don't ruin it with the super sweet dressing.
