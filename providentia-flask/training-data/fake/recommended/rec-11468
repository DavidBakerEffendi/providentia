This is all my fault... I let people tell me from the day this place opened it's doors that I have to try it, I have to get the burger, I have to get the duck fat fries, I have to try one of the many whiskey's behind the bar... well I'm sick of people telling me what to do, but I listened anyway... and life seems to be OK again... for now. Enough of my personal issues and on to Village Whiskey.  Similar to Slumdog Millionaire, I was hoping to watch a movie that would change my life.  But no, I'm still balding at 26 years old, still living in Philadelphia, still not a millionaire (but I'm not a slumdog); nothing has changed.  This happens a lot and I expected that to happen with my visit to Village Whiskey.  But it didn't... The burger was great, the duck fat fries were even better and the whiskey made me tingle!  I'm still balding and still living in Philadelphia but my visit to Village Whiskey may in fact make me a millionaire... I've been officially impressed by all the hype.
