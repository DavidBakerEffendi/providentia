Wow tis been some time since I've written a 3-star review. anyhow, it was about halfway through morning when friend and I were looking for some food as we waited for the boutique next door to open. we found this little niche in the wall, and we squeeshed in. food: got bronte burger, and the egg plt, with ice coffees! I was shocked at the menu serving real food while realizing that the place was smaller than my apt. (the kitchen is the size of my bathroom). than the food came out and it was good. the side salad was good (dressing), the sandwiches/burger was good. i think what i truly loved about the food was definitely the bread. crunchy but soft. hm hm hm! service: chilled, because we were the only customers. waitress seemed to be engrossed by an interesting book. price: fair ambiance: cute? if a place has big wooden benches i love. will i swing by later? maybe!
