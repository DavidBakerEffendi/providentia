I love char no 4. I have been for brunch 3 weeks in a row and I dream about the chipotle bloody mary during the week.  Their prix fixe is a steal at $16. I don't eat meat and they were happy to replace the ham for delicious creamy grits topped with a perfectly poached egg. The  potatoes are salty and crispy and nicely balanced by homemade fig preseves, brown butter apple sauce, and a biscuit. We were stuffed but elated. The service is friendly and I love the atmosphere. A great addition to the neighborhood. I can't wait to go for dinner.
