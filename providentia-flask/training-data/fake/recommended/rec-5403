A friend recommended this place to me when I had to travel to Philadelphia for work recently, and I am so glad she did! The portions are huge for tapas, so we actually left full without spending a fortune ordering 2-3 plates per person. Our party shared 5 plates, and all agreed that 4 out of the 5 were outstanding. Recommendations (based on our order): Lobster Mac and Cheese - To die for. I LOVE macaroni and cheese, and this was one of the best versions I've ever had. Fusilli - Delicious. I think this would be easy to overlook on the menu, but it was my other favorite dish that we ordered. Barbecue Chicken Quesadillas - Really good. Reminded me of the flavors in California Pizza Kitchen's BBQ chicken chopped salad. Other positives - Our service was awesome - everything came out super fast, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is also really cool. My only complaint would be that the beer/wine selection is somewhat limited, but there's at least enough variety for everyone to find something they like. Overall, a solid 4-4 1/2 star place. I wish there was one of these near me, because this is a perfect place to visit with a big group on a Fri/Sat night! I will be returning if I'm ever back in Philly again!
