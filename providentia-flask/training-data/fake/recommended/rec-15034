As the musical deity Prince once sang "Nooothing, nothing compares 2 U," and I like to think that in a world were Prince and I were BFFS (and if he ate meat), that he might confess to the hook from his signature song being inspired by John's Roast Pork signature sandwich. I want to believe that nothing could compare to JRP, but despite my allegiance to my favorite South Philly gem I found myself inevitably comparing DiNic's roast pork to John's. I split a hearty roast pork sandwich at Reading Terminal Market yesterday with a friend and we agreed that the sandwich was worthy of long lines and $8.25. It would have been a threat to its competition if they dished it up on a Sarcone's roll; but the meat was tender, the provolone was sharp, and the broccoli rabe had almost a spicy kick. DiNic's obviously has a strong reputation for delectable food as I was told that their sandwiches almost always sell out. It's also great to know that center city has made delicious sandwiches accessible to folks who might not be able to venture into South Philly. I think the moans on Prince's "Adore" would best describe my feelings towards Philly's roast pork sandwiches, and despite being plagued with tourists, I would definitely recommend that any foodie get lost in Reading Terminal and hit up DiNic's.
