Too often New Yorkers run to the hottest restaurants and bars because of reviews like these, only be struck with an overwhelming wave of mediocrity. I have fallen victim to this several times, this experience included. Its one of the most exhausting parts of living in NYC. People claiming that everything they have touched is the best because a person in a blog told them so. The breakfast, Ham, 3 eggs sunny side up, hash browns, and a biscuit, was good. It was not great, and it was not special. Their ketchup is either homemade or organic, but it is not good. The wait was atrocious, and the food over priced. When your hung over and all you want is a diner style greasy breakfast/ brunch, don't bother with the wait. I am more than sure your local breakfast place will produce an equal, if not better, experience for half the wait & half the price.
