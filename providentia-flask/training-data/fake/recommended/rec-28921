We've been to Max Brenner's in Philadelphia a number of times over the years, and always had a good experience.  But it seems they've really let the quality and service slip.  The last time we were there, they only had about half the items on the dessert menu.  The food was still good, but slow.  This time, it took over an hour to get lunch, and I had to send two drinks back to the bar.  The first was a $12 Mojito, which they forgot to add sugar or simple syrup to.  When it came back, it was nearly all ice.  The second drink I ordered was a gin and tonic.  They served me a gin and club soda - yikes - two ingredients and you can't get that right?  Because the service was so slow, we didn't even get to order dessert, which was the only real reason to go there.  NEVER GOING BACK!  There are too many good restaurants in Center City to bother.
