This place reminds me of a bar called Violet Hour in Chicago which I love. This one just didn't do it for me. The food smells and atmosphere got a 3.5 but the drinks were only a 2. I just didn't think either that I tried were all that good. They sounded much better than they were. I had the Corpse Reviver and my friend had the Fish House Punch. Both were kind of meh for the price. The food did look and smell terrific though so if I should find myself in Philly again perhaps I will go back and try it.
