Good seafood for reasonable price! We went for lunch on a Friday. There was a 15 minute wait. Fish is a simple, no frills place where people happily enjoy their food. We tried all different types of oysters and ordered mussels and lobster salad. The food was all very fresh and tasty. We only had a little problem with the service, which was a little bit slow and inattentive. That's the reason for one star being taken off. In general, I would recommend this place. 6 oysters and a glass of wine for $8? That can't be beat!
