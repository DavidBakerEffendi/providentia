Went here on a Monday for dinner with my girlfriend.  We decided that we need to come back asap because it was that good! The service was impeccable - so friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. We had the mussels in the paprika sauce, the chicken in the garlic sauce, the octopus with sea salt and paprika and the shrimp in garlic sauce.  All were awesome! Nai Tapas is a go-to restaurant in Manhattan.
