Tasty food - arguably the tastiest Indian in downtown Princeton (my friends and I have had several debates with Mehek a close second).  I recommend any of the korma(s). However, awful, horrid service that can make a 1-2 hour dinner last twice as long as it should, even if you want to relax and have a long evening with friends.  I have friends who now refuse to go there.  One way around this is to only attend their lunchtime brunches, but even so service on the nonessentials (timeliness.. water.. bringing the bill.. etc) is just worse than anywhere I've ever been.  I am tempted to start a boycott for awhile, encourage them to improve, and go back in a year, because their food is really good.
