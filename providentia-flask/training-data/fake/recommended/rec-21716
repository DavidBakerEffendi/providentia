I really enjoyed a lunch in a very relaxed garden. In comparison with other Wsburg outside patios where often the buzzing sound of air conditioner just kills any benefit of being outside, here the outside garden is just tranquil. Add to that a really tasty cooked to perfection burger for just $11... And you've got yourself one of the best lunches this summer (so far).
