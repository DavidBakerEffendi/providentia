Natives recommended I try the crab fries, which to me tasted like soft, hot barbecue potato chips. They were pretty good and would have garnered a 3-star review. I added another star though for Play2. Being a huge gamer, I was pretty blown away that this place had big pods to rent out where you and friends can drink and play XBOX on a big screen. I wish there were places like this in Southern California. If there are, there aren't any nearby me so I'll have to stick to my home Rock Band parties/booze fests. As for the atmosphere of Chickie's & Pete's, the front area was to be expected. Very much a sports bar and crab shack sort of feel. However, our hostess led us to the back where the Play2 area is housed. I felt like I walked into a gay dance club. Techno music was thumping loudly from above and I couldn't hear anything my bf was saying sitting across from me at the table. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the atmosphere, as the walls were lit up and club lights sort of flashed around me. It was a little weird to not see people dancing in such an environment, though once a group of girls got trashed enough, they did attempt to get guys to dance with them in front of their table. They were unfortunately unsuccessful in that venture. There were a few big screens on the wall showing camera footage of people dancing or playing plastic instruments from the gaming pods. Cute.
