Had a really lovely meal here!   We found ourselves infront of Benito 1's hungry and tired around 230p and decided to give it a try.   Very yummy!  Lots of good choices and friendly service and the prices were not bad.   My daughter had the black squid ink pasta with seafood in a creamy tomatoe based sauce, husband had the linguini with octopus livornese, and I had the carbonara.  We started with the spiedini romano.  The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and everything was yummy and authentic - very much like you'd find in Italy. Best meal we had in NYC this long weekend.
