So very busy!  But the tofu stews here are indeed praiseworthy.  The flavor of the mixed seafood and pork stew was crazy good, very rich, and not at all watered down.  And the was surprisingly a lot of seafood as well.   My semi-gripe?  Servers, please smile more!  I hope they weren't all having a bad day, but I felt like I was doing something mean to them when I asked for water or sat sipping away at my stew.  That aside, the place is packed and busy during mealtime, but check BCD out for  tofu stews that will definitely hit the spot on a cold, winter day! ^o^
