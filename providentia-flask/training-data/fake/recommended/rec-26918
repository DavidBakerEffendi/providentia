I had dinner here alone at the bar on a hot, sticky Friday night in New York. It was great! I had a peppercorn filet cooked perfectly and a nice glass of red. The food was delicious, service was attentive, and the whole place had a very nice vibe. My go-to NYC hotel is right down the street so I'll definitely be back!
