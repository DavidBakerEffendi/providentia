The owners of The Alewife in LIC have done it again! Amazing brews, bites and vibe. Try the cocktail bar also, that guy is making drinks you'd expect to find in some secret hard to find speakeasy downtown...only it's uptown (mid) and easy to find! Â Can't wait to see what they're gonna do next! Patio is going to rock in the Summer!
