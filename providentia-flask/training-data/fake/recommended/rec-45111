If you get to The Pig before 7:00 you will probably not wait more than 1 hour.  It's worth wait.   The Spotted Pig has one of the best combinations of world class food, great/intimate atmosphere, and a fun/sceney vibe.  Weekdays in the winter are particularly intimate as it is usually just locals.  Weekends can get pretty crazy and packed so plan accordingly. As to what to get: Devils on Horseback are not to be missed.  The Gnudi should be illegal, and the Cheese Burger is the best in NYC IMO.  I'm also a huge fan of the Chappellett Merlot.  I seldom drink Merlot but this wine is worth checking out.   Also, for you beer drinkers, the Speckled Hen Ale is the real deal.
