I want to love this place for brunch, I really do. It's a block from my house and the establishment itself is really cute. Yet every time I go here, I'm underwhelmed by the brunch menu. I have given it my best shot, and I order something different every time I go in hopes I'll find that one awesome standby dish that makes me happy. As far as I can tell, it never changes - except for that one time they took the immensely popular bacon bloody mary off the menu [seriously? why??]. I tried a friend's french toast here once, and that's likely the best they have to offer. If you're a huge fan of eggs, then you can have them here basically any way you like. The drink menu is pretty impressive, but I'm not generally one to have *just* booze for lunch. One thing I will say is that the waitstaff here are pretty cool. I've never had to wait for anything, which is nice. Just sure wish they'd spice up the menu every once in awhile.
