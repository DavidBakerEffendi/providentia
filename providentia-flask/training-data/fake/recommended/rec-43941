I live in the neighborhood and have been Alice's for breakfast, lunch, dinner and to get food from their prepared food takeaway counter. The room is beautiful, large, open, airy with skylights and very charming repurposed salvage from old buildings. The food is excellent, fresh, lots of choices, daily specials, simply prepared, easy to understand dishes, not too quirky or kooky. The service from the waitstaff to the management to the chef, who will come and talk to you, is impeccable. Â Friendly, attentive, extremely accommodating. If you had a bad dining experience here you probably won't be happy anywhere..
