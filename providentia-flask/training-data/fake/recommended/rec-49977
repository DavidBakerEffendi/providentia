Really good food. There was a huge portion, that I can't believe I ate the whole thing.  It was that good and cheap, and large. The gyros are so good, they are some of the best I have ever had. They are so juicy and spicy. You can get either either lamb or chicken. You can also get  two sauces. One is a mayo-based sauce, the other is a spicy one. I would recommend this restaurant to someone out of town.
