I had my first hand-drawn noodle experience last Friday night, when my husband bought home a bowl of the shrimp noodle soup.  It was so delish that we went to the restaurant last night and I ordered a seafood noodle soup, including shrimp, scallops, clams and fish balls.  The broth is so comforting, especially during these super cold days of winter 2013!  Considering going back this afternoon for lunch!  (No judgment!)
