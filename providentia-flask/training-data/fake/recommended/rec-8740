This is a great place to bring people who are visiting NYC -- it's a unique and (presumably) as authentic a Japanese experience as you can expect on this side of the Pacific. There were so many couples here, and the ambience is on the peaceful side, so it seems like a good place for a date. My favorites: Shimeji mushrooms - the woodsy flavor really shines through Tuna tartar with avocado & mayo - classic mix of flavors done perfectly Other notables: Fillet steak - very tender and tastes surprisingly good with a bit of wasabi Bamboo shoots - forgot what it was called exactly but they were on the special menu; we decided that they basically tasted like a flower is blooming in your mouth. A very unique and floral taste Taro - normally I don't like taro, but the texture after grilling was very satisfying, and the flavors became subtle Black sesame mochi (dessert menu) - didn't expect it to come in a gelatinous form, but it basically melts in your mouth, and the peanut sprinkles add a dimension to the quintessential Asian flavor mix To try next time: fish, onigiri and some kind of battered asparagus the people next to us were eating Bonus points for having a coat check and for our waiter explaining the special menu to us! Basically, come here for a delightful, fresh-tasting meal and a bit of a zoo-like experience that probably won't sate your hunger completely unless you drop $$$$.
