This is my favorite Mexican food outside of Mexico and CA.  The pork tacos are the best - juicy and full of flavor.  The service is quick and very friendly, the owner often stops by to say hi and make sure we're happy with everything.  The place is usually packed during peak hours, but the great food, festive atmosphere, friendly service and affordable prices make it worth the always reasonable wait.
