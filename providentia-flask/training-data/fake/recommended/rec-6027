I have eaten here a few times.  I'm always greeted immediately and warmly.  The atmosphere makes you relax and like you are in a totally separate world than the one you just exited off the street.  The service is always impeccable and the food as fresh and amazing as it gets.  I love the pita and spreads.  The calamari, horiatiki salad and the moussaka are to die for. OUTSTANDING.
