I ordered a large margherita pizza and a 2-liter of sprite, and it was here in less than 20 minutes. My only criticism would be that one slide was slightly underdone, which was probably the side facing the front of the oven. I would recommend that they rotate pizzas halfway through the cooking time so that the pizzas cook more evenly. Other than that, I was extremely satisfied.
