i really don't have much to say about this place, although i am giving them solid four stars. the food was good, the ambiance was excellent and the service was notable. but did anything stand out? yea...probably the encased, over-sized chandelier that was in the middle of the restaurant. don't get me wrong, it's beautiful to look at while chomping down on your food. but to be honest, i didn't think much of it because most thai restaurants all look and taste the same. peep in soho, leng in astoria, klong in st. marks. it's all the same to me! *forgive me though, i did forget to mention their pad thai. if you're a pad thai fan, you should try their room service pad thai. it's definitely not your ordinary pad thai. instead, they use glass noodles that is wrapped up in an omelette. i thought that was pretty interesting. also the taste was pretty interesting too -- my friend thought they used squid ink to give it more of a fishier taste.
