Dined at Melograno for the second time and have yet to be dissapointed. Start with the antipasto for two. That and some bread and wine would make a great meal by itself. Assorted smoked Italian meats, fresh roasted veggies, assorted spereads and it is just heaven. For the main course, the Griglio Mista, assorted seafoood on a bed of mashed, creamed potatoes is delectable. The pasta witht he shredded Guinea Hen is also a great choice. The pasta is home made and the sauce a perfect complement. The chicken dish with mozzarella is a good choice. A bit noisy, long waits on weekends make it a 4 star but well worth the inconvenience.
