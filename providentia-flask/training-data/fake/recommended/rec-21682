Best BBQ in terms of value!! Once you grab your seat, you'll be presented with a menu that is quite overwhelming. However, Dinosaur does a great job in putting its ample selection in combinations for easier selections. Not sure what to try? How about "settling" with 1/2 a chicken, spare ribs, and a brisket and your choice of 2 sides for 17 bucks? It's like they WANT you to try everything in their restaurant in one sitting. And all that for 17 bucks? Sign me up. The atmosphere is fantastic as well. The wait wasn't bad (Sunday night football also). Great place to bring your friends or families! Hope you're ready to get your fingers sticky!
