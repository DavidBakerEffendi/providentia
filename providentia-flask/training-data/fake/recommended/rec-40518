Dear Jones, there are other seasonings besides SALT to season food. I ordered a turkey burger for take out and it was over salted. There was too much tomato aioli (making the bun soggy) and the fries were also too salty. I think your reputation is All HYPE. The one star is for the bartender.. He was accommodating and professional. Your food sucks.
