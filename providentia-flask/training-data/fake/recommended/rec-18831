Review of the Cheesesteak. I heard from local Italians and radio stations it was one of the best in the city. I've lived in the city now for 7 years and have had many cheesesteaks, and this one was not too great. The sesame bun was good, but the steak itself was VERY chewy, probably the chewiest I've had in the city. Ever had beef tendon? It was kinda like that. I won't have a cheesesteak steak from here ever again.
