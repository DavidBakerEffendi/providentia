I've made two visits to Pepe's since moving to New Haven this summer. I have to say that the summer tomato pie is my favorite thing about the place. It was delicious! The pepperoni pizza was good too, but not as amazing as the seasonal tomato pizza. I've yet to try the clam pie but it's on my list. As far as the line, it was long but moved regularly, so it wasn't terribly frustrating. Service is adequate. Give it a try, especially during tomato season!
