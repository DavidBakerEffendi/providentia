Tasty food, stylish decor, friendly staff. I had the kimchi melt brunch. Came with home fries and small mixed greens. $9. It had good flavor and the portion was appropriate. Not too big but definitely filling. Will surely come back. This place is located maybe a block off the Nostrand/Bedford G stop. The neighborhood is actively changing, and there are plenty of nearby joints to check out (Dynaco, Black Swan, Project Parlour, Brooklyn Stoops, Colador Cafe) if you want to hop around.
