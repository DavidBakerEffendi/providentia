12/30/2008 I love the decor of this resturant. They sometimes have a DJ playing cool music; the drinks are really good too. This place kind of got over populated so it is hard to just walk in on an evening and get a table. My favorite dish is the Pak Kraitum veggie dish.. I will order it over and over and over
