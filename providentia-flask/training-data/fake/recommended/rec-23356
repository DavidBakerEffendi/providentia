2 stars off for misconduct. And what, you ask, were the offenses? -Service was a bit off.  Slow, distracted, with a dash of attitude. -Our food was cold when we got it.  Luke-warm fries are not tasty. Their saving grace? The burger.  I asked for medium rare, and I got medium rare, to the disgust of my fellow diners (not my fault they like cardboard). The meat was properly seasoned.  Although this, too, was lukewarm. While sitting there I learned that Tuesday's are half-off burger days.  I may come back on a Tuesday to conduct further analysis.
