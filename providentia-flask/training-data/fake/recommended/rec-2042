UNRELIABLE--AVOID!!! Whether they will deliver or not is at their whim! Â  We placed our order Thursday night at 6:00 for $30 on 10/10/2013. You'll find out only after ordering and paying online, when they give you a call 20 minutes later noting that they are "too busy" tonight to want to deliver your order (yes, she actually said that). The restaurant then attempted to cajole us into coming to pick up the order, but when we told them we had no transportation, they told us that we (in Center City west) were beyond the area that they 'deliver'. It took another couple minutes of explaining to them that yes--we DO want a refund. Still waiting on getting our money back....AVOID.
