Disappointed. That is how I felt after taking my first bite of my room temperature parpadelle. Before I critique any further, I want to give a little background info to explain my emotions. In anticipation of meeting my roommate for the first time, I searched high and low for the perfect Italian restaurant to eat at. After a few moments, I came across Uva--what I believed at the time to be a hidden gem. Although it was a bit out of our way (a 1.5 hr long train/subway ride from Long Island), I was excited and ready to taste authentic Italian food. I believe our first mistake was going for lunch instead of dinner, as their lunch menu wasn't as extensive as their dinner menu. However, this problem got quickly resolved by their accommodating staff who allowed me to order from their dinner menu. After being thoroughly confused for a while (as I always am while looking at long menus), I decided to get the parpadelle. I had seen photos on yelp and was ready to be blown away! Sadly, I was not. The dish wasn't hot, the noodles were undercooked, and the spices were satisfactory at best. And to top it off, it was 18 bucks! I could've gotten two slices of pizza for less than a fourth of that and with a more satisfied palate. Though I'm sure the other great reviews here are valid, they don't apply to my experience at all. All I can recommend to you is to either stick with a cheap appetizer and just enjoy the amazing ambience, or only go during dinner time (maybe they have a better cook then). Good luck!
