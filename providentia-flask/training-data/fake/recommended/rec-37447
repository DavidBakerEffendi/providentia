I've eaten here twice, and the food is really tasty, but the first time I found a hair in my food, and the second time, a small roach! And on top of that, the the guy waiting on us was incredibly rude, and actually said "whatever". Â  Avoid this place unless you want to eat bugs and have creepy hipster boys be rude to you.
