I've yet to eat in--they're great at last minute almost closing time orders (I've yet to be turned away, and I'm typically a late eater..once ordered at 9:45 when they closed at ten) 1. They're snappy! Coming from the airport area (sounds farther than it is), it's always ready when I get there. ALWAYS. 2. To echo Ettya's sentiments, their korean pancake is WHERE ITS AT! So, so, good ! 3. Inexpensive and good quality. 5. Their bibimbap is SO fresh. and filling. and. good. 6. Great portions--especially for a college budget! Definitely recommend checking them out--hard-ish to locate--just keep your eyes peeled--shares a parking-lot. They have Ramune soda--a soft-spot for me..and so sweet--talk about sugar-rush..! Koreana has a dedicated fan for LIFE otu of me :)!
