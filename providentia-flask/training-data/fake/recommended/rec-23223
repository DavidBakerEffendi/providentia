I am so surprised by how many people rave about this place, especially saying it's better than Nom Nom. I have tried multiple times to like this place.. but I just can't. The broth is pretty good, but the pork on top is just really disappointing. It's rubbery and lacks any flavor. I usually end up just leaving it (which is a huge waste...) The only ramen I somewhat enjoyed was the Kara Kara. Probably because it didn't have their "Chasu" pork. Definitely a let down on the ramen side, but I will probably come back for their other dishes. Their takoyaki was pretty good.
