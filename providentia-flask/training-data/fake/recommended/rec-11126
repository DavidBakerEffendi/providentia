Empress Garden has the most authentic Taiwanese food. Their beef noodle soup are painstakingly stewed for 5 hours the day before with various ingredients to get the rich flavor. Â In fact I have recently given up vegetarianism for their beef noodle soup. I don't know how that happened but it did. This restaurant is run by the daughter of the owner of a chain of the same restaurants in Taiwan. All of the Taiwanese dishes are flavorful and truly unique to Taiwanese style of cooking. Highly recommend the scallion pancake, beef noodle soup, 3-cup/ flavor chicken, pot-stickers, Shanhaigh Won Ton Soup, and Taiwanese pork meat ball, and oyster pancake.
