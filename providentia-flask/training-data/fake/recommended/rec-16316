I would give this place 3 1/2 stars - good food, but nothing special. I came for dinner on a Monday at 6:45pm (perfectly timed to catch the last 15 minutes of happy hour) and the bar was completely full, but there were a bunch of tables open. It's a lively place, and there were a bunch of TVs showing the football games. We ordered our cocktails and received them very quickly. I can personally recommend the pomegranate white cosmo ($6 from 4-7 every day). I also ate the steak spring rolls, which are filled with spinach and mashed potatoes as well and are a good, hearty appetizer that could be shared (or eaten by themselves as a meal because they're enough food). They come with some really good sauces. Overall, it's a bar with slightly better/more interesting food and drinks. It's a good place for happy hour, but I wouldn't say it was an experience that particularly stood out.
