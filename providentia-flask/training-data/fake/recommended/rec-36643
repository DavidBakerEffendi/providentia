I love to dine at Balthazar when I'm in SoHo!  The fruits de mer is a great way to start and the steak au poivre is quite tasty.  Great wine selection.  The survival guide for a great dining experience at Balthazar is the following:  have a reservation, expect a wait, be prepared for the snooty-I-want-to-be-a-thesbian-but-I'm-waiting-­tables wait staff, and most importantly:  Take your time, enjoy your meal and soak in the ambiance.
