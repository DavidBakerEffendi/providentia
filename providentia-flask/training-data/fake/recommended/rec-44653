Pricey, but tasty! Went here on a Saturday around 5:30PM, and again later that day at 10:30PM. It was never overly crowded or loud. Drinks were definitely not watered down! If you want to have a snack, I enjoyed the Bar Room Fries. The others I was there with were all smiles as well (but maybe that was drinks after the long meeting we just finished... who knows).
