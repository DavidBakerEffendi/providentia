Dear Super Stoned Waiter Boy,  when I was so kind to point out that you only ran my credit card for half the bill, a thanks would have been nice.  I saved your ass from an angry manager at the end of the night, but I got no thanks, actually I don't think you even said a word.  The cotton mouth must have been bad. You brought me some killer food and that is why you get 4 stars, but you really lacked in conversation.  I will come back, because I think I need to try that pigs ear, but I am down on the $17 salad.  What is in there?
