The owner of this cafe is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. Bring a bottle of wine, jam out to voodoo music, and share a combination platter w/ your best bud. Afterwards sit back, enjoy a latte, and be pleased with yourself because you just had pretty decent Ethiopian food in center city!
