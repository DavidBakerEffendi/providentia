Writing a five star review for Mighty Quinn's feels like throwing some small kindling on a giant bonfire.  But I'm just checking in to agree with everyone. Th BBQ here is solid- it only comes drenched in sauce if you choose to douse it yourself (and their sauce is KILLER, so I say go for it).  The ribs fall right off the bone, and the brisket is nice and juicy.  Additionally, pretty much everything on the menu -minus the sweet potato thing and a few of their seasonal salads- is safe for celiacs.  Rejoice!
