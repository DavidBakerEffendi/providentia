Was walking around one evening looking for a place to eat for dinner in Hells Kitchen. We walked by Room Service and really liked the atmosphere from what we could see form the outside. After walking another block we decided to head back and try the restaurant.  We were immediately seated.  The first thing we talked about was how cool the interior was.... The service was great and we ordered a variety of appetizers and noodle dishes.  Everything was great and it seemed that as soon as you order it the food is getting brought to you - however, you are not forced to have a quick meal.   You can't beat the prices too for the area and ambiance, I highly recommend this place for friends and couples looking for dinner before heading out for some fun afterward since there are so many cool bars, etc close by.
