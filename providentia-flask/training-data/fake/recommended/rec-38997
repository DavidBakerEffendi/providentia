In a state filled with diners, this is by far the best one I ever been to.  I have been here perhaps 30 times in the past 7 years, and each time the food, service, and speed at which you get your food has been great.  Better yet, each time I go there something gets better, for instance the fries are now freshly cut.   They have daily lunch specials which come with soup and a dessert, but no longer do you get a free soda like you did in the past with these specials (my only real complaint!) With the amount of volume this place gets during lunch I have no idea how they can consistently deliver fresh good food, and in such a  timely fashion.I think the longest I have had to wait to get my lunch is maybe ten minutes.   There's not much more I can ay about this place other than it never dissapoints and please try it if you've never been here before!
