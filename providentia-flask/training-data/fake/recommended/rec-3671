Popped in for Happy Hour, on a hot and stormy Friday afternoon.  Love the 2 for 1 on cocktails (2 for $10).  With names like "Pump up the Jams" and "Gin-X," you can't help but try a few with those prices. I had both previously mentioned. More spice than whiskey in the first, but still liked it. The "Gin-X" was a perfect mix of gin and basil. I'll be back for more of those.
