wow, if I had seen these reviews before we came here, I would have talked my friends out of coming here.  fortunately, I did not, and we had an absolutely great experience here. when we got here, the restaurant was pretty empty for a Saturday night, which is kinda sad, because the food was great!  we had ordered the chicken schnitzel, the bahn mi, lamb ribs, pickled mussels and the pig head!  but really, the two dishes that stood out were the lamb ribs and the pig head!   as gross as a pig's head looks, it was really good.  I came with a bunch of Filipinos, so they were super excited to order this thing.  This is pretty much like Lechon, but you didn't need the lechon sauce at all, really tasty.  I would highly recommend it if you have more than 2 people since there's a lot of meat on the head.  The lamb ribs were REALLY tasty too, and probably would have been my favorite dish had we not ordered the pig head. since we had already been day drinking down the street at the Ides, we didn't order any alcohol.  Also, who's this chef?  apparently, Top Chef Season 2 winner is the exec chef here.  I didn't start watching Top Chef until about Season 4, so I had no idea who Ilan Hall is.  no matter, he cooked a great meal for us and even came by our table to take a picture with the group and the first pig head he's sold! overall, it was a great dining experience and the wait staff was excellent as well.  hopefully, the ratings will get better for this restaurant because it definitely is a gem.
