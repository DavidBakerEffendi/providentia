Price: $20 for brunch! Food: not $20 good Atmosphere:  nice - high ceilings, small tables Service:  good Would I go there again?:  Probably not ~~~~~~ I finally had a chance to try this place after hearing all the hype.  Luckily my friend and I were seated immediately at around 11am for a Sat brunch.  We decided to skip the $16 bread basket and dive into the entrees.  Boy was I in for a shock - sticker shock that is.  The entrees for brunch/lunch were around $20!  I ended up getting the asparagus/mushroom scramble in a puff pastry for $18 and my friend got a chicken salad something.  Both were good, but not spectacular and definitely not worth the price.  Probably won't go there again - there are a lot more other brunch places I'd like to try.
