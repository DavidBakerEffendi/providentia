Hella food for $6. Got the chicken and gyro mix over rice. This is probably the best halal place for chicken. Usually its dry and not tasty but I loved it. The gryo is a bit saltier than I like. Still freaking good. The portion is HUGE. Friend and I got our own because we're fat like that. Did not finish but its OK! Only $6. Probably the cheapest meal I've had my whole trip. The line is pretty long. It moves fast at least!
