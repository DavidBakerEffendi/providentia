My hubby and I opted to have a causal dinner/snack-fest here on a Saturday night after seeing a show and the obligatory tree sighting in Rockefeller Center, and are glad that we did. We prefer small plates as you get to try many different things, and the our choices were eclectic and so yummy.  We had the deviled eggs, funky meatballs, fried chicken (with their home-made Sriracha - to die for!), and the ricotta and honey bruschetta.  Each dish was so flavorful and fun.  We also ordered a few cheeses (an aged cheddar and a triple crème) and the boar charcuterie.  We also sampled the homemade cider doughnuts and the chocolate and blueberry bread pudding.   In addition, we sampled many wines and pairings for our food.   We thought that the staff was very attentive, and knowledgeable and had some really solid recommendations for us.  All greatly appreciated with so much to choose from. The ambiance is casual and cozy. Would recommend, and look forward to returning!
