I have been coming to City Fish for some time and purchasing their fresh seafood which is the best around, and addicted to their fresh cooked take out food. I recently took my wife there and she had the lobster roll. That was it, she is now a fan of City Fish and keeps asking to go back for more. I always get either the fried shrimp, clams, or fish dinner and have never been disappointed. Now that they have a sit in section it's even more appealing. Good food, reasonable price and Â comfortable eat in setting.
