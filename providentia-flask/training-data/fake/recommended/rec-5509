Great atmosphere, excellent waitstaff. I ordered the chicken rice vermicelli with a spring roll add on and I wasn't disappointed. The food came quickly, and was fresh and delicious. The portions were pretty large, and the price was reasonable ($13.45 before tax/tip). I will definitely come here again.
