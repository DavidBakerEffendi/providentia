We've been here twice and loved it both times.  The waitstaff was fabulous and made it a priority that we enjoyed our food.  We ate in the back patio and made a huge mistake our first time: we ordered a mushroom tarte as one of the appetizers. Forget what you think a tarte is, this is a delicious giant flatbread pizza that will fill you up if you ordered other appetizers as well (which we did).  No problem, the put it in a to-go box for us and we got to have two meals instead of one. They do not skimp on portions and everything we have tried we thoroughly enjoyed.    I would suggest taking ordering advise from the waiter.  Especially if your eyes are bigger than your stomach.
