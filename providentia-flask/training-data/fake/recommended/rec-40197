Awesome atmosphere, outstanding staff, scrumptious food and let me not forget the massive seasonal beverage selection.   The first time I stepped foot in Tria Taproom was on opening day....so, I'm going to combine both visits into one. I'm not a fan of crowds, but that's to be expected on opening night. Once we settled in near the bar I noticed the industrial-esque finishing throughout the building which was done perfectly to set the tone for this chilly evening. The drink selection was offered to us on a iPad Mini that showed the name, volume, price/size, keg quantity, producer and style of over 20 beverages. I'm not really into hoppy IPAs ('tis the season) so I went with the Domaine Dupont Cidre, Allagash White, and Riesling "The Finger" (x2) which I absolutely LOVED. After about a twenty minute wait we were seated and began to order. Once seated the service was fast and for "Snacks" we ordered the Saison Fish Fry, Wings, Wood-Grilled Asparagus which where great. My party especially loved the blend of spices on the wings with Gorgonzola. The entrees chosen were the Kennett Square, Philly Roast Pork, Grilled Jumbo Shrimp and Fennel Sausage grilled  flatbreads. They were all great as well. However, someone in the party would have loved a little more oil on the edges of the Fennel flatbread. That was the only downside to the meal...beside that we all enjoyed ourselves. P.S. Our sever Marissa was G R E A T !
