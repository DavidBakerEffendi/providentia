This is my first visit to Clinton St. Baking Company. Â I came here with expectations from Yelp! Reviews and little else. I got orange juice (fresh and delicious with the perfect amount of pulp) & the buttermilk biscuit sandwich. The sandwich was amazing, delicious, melt in your mouth, explosion in your mouth insanity! The biscuit was soft and crispy in the right places. The tomato jam was more of a thick tomato sauce but it was perfect with the eggs and cheese
