My wife and I have eaten at this humble Guatemalan restaurant in Parkville twice now, and we love it! Definitely a hole-in-the wall kind of place, but very clean. We have gotten very attentive service both times and the English translation of the menu provides some nice entertainment. :) But the great food is the reason we went back for our 2nd visit and we we left happy again this time. The Carne Adabada (sp?) is a delicious marinated pork cutlet and the empanadas (deep fried meat pies) were excellent as well. Our entrees came with salad, beans, fried plantains and freshly made corn tortillas. I highly Â recommend Antojitos for anyone wanting to try Latino food that's different than the typical Mexican restaurant offering.
