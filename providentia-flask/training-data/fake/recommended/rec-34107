The food here is consistently poor. It has gotten to the point where I will avoid going here even if it is under and invite and I won't be paying. Sure the waitstaff is about average, friendly enough and the decor/theme of the restaurant (firefighters) is creative but the fact is these positive aspects are way overshadowed by the complete lack of any culinary competence. 0/10 would not eat again.
