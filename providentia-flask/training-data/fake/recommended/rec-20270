not bad, but definitely not as good as i expected. maybe i came on an off night but all the food looked more appealing than it actually tasted. came for a late supper and sat in the garden area, which I wouldn't recommend unless you want to be attacked by mosquitos which is what happened to me. ordered the goat cheese and beet salad, crab and artichoke dip and french dip. salad was by far the best. crab and artichoke dip was meh. it had a runny consistency and unless you told me there was crab meat in there, i wouldn't have guessed it. i didn't like the toasted sliced baguettes it came with. i think it was a whole wheat or potato baguette. either way, it wasn't very complimentary with the dip. french dip had good flavors, but the meat was a bit tough. nice touch with the horseradish. fries it came with looked good but was super bland and tasted a bit stale.
