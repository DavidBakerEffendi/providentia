Excellent place for a tapas brunch; my party of 3 shared the spanish donuts with chocolate -- REALLY YUMMY, and I thoroughly enjoyed my fried eggs with peas and ham.   It's a small place, but I liked the decor and the service was pleasant.  For an out-of-towner, it made for a great first meal in NYC to kick off my short weekend visit.
