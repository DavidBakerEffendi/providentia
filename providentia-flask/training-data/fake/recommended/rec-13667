It really says something when a restaurant can move into a space 3 times bigger than the one before and still pack the place night after night.  Kefi is one of the restaurants that I miss when I am not in NYC.  Just about every dish that I have had has been full of flavor and executed perfectly.  Get the grilled octopus if you can.  They get such a good char on the meat and it is seasoned so well--probably the best dish of its kind I have found.  the lamb chops are also fantastic.  It is considered a daily special, but they have had it just about every time I have been there.  It is a much higher price point that other menu items, so I think they leave it off.  The pork medallions are so good as well as the branzino.  The only neg on the place is that it is quite loud.  When it is so packed full every night, the noise levels can get up there.
