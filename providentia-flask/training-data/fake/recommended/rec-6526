I loved the vibe as soon as I walked in, and our waiter was pleasantly attentive and very nice.  (looked like he had a few terminal degrees under his belt)   We got there at 7 and by the time our food arrived, the place was packed.  Gone in with a hankering for oysters, but the price (M/P) stopped us in our tracks.  ($3.75/oyster-ouch!!)  So we started with grilled quail and one of  the specials- lobster bisque.  Bisque should go on the menu, but the sauce the quail came in was way too sweet and overpowering.  For entrees we had the monkfish wrapped in prosciutto and another special - lamb shank.  The fish was dry, tasteless and small.  The lamb was huge and delicious.  I'd order it again if it was on the menu....For desert we split the chocolate cake with ice cream.  It was totally standard fare - I've had that very molten cake at a dozen restaurants.   My verdict?  They should put the specials on the menu, revisit the deserts to come up with more unique sweets, and get rid of the fruit flies that were all over the wall next to us!  Oh... and is there a reason that there is absolutely nothing on the walls?  No antique mirrors, no period paintings or old photographs...  Maybe it's to give their pet flies more room to move around.
