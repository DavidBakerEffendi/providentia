Incredible food! I've been there for dinner and brunch and both were very, very tasty. The food is flavorful and a definite New York creation. The "genre" I would say is Israeli inspired. The food is clearly fresh and thoughtful. I got a few appetizers and made it into a meal. It's a little bit "expensive", especially with drinks... but it's worth it.
