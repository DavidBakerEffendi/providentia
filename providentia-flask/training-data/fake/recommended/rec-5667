My husband and I decided to try out Amada for our second wedding anniversary. Despite our anniversary falling on a Tuesday in June, the restaurant was packed and I was glad we made reservations. The decor and ambiance were both very appealing, though the noise level and close proximity of tables could do with some work. If you are looking for an intimate date night, this is not the place for you. But my husband and I were fine with minimal chatter throughout dinner. Having poured through online reviews prior to our visit, we made our own tasting menu of the best sounding dishes. We were not disappointed. The red sangria that I ordered was perfectly spiced, sweet and boozy, though my husband was not too impressed with his Spanish lager. Our server was friendly, but we felt as though he forgot us a few times - we had our first dish on the table before we had anything to drink. Speaking of the food, we really enjoyed almost everything we tried. My favorites were the spicy potatoes, the crab stuffed peppers, the short rib flatbread, and the asparagus. The presentation and freshness of the food is evident, even though the chef went a little overboard with the salt on occasion. Thankfully, the man pouring the water came around very frequently. The food was fabulous, but the restaurant itself could use some tightening up in the service department, better pacing of the dishes, and about five less tables in the main dining area. I would definitely return, and try some of the other delicious sounding menu options!
