Excellent! The place itself was clean and attractive.  The service was great.  The owner even came by to check on us and said goodbye to us as we were leaving.  The menu offered enticing/flavorful items with unique touches such as their BLT with Brie! The ingredients were fresh.  The prices and portions were very reasonable.  Wow!  It is nice not to have to trek out to Montclair, Morristown or NYC area to get something above average. There was no wait but that will not be true for long.   There are only three things that I would personally add but not everyone would agree: 1. PLEASE do dinner time too! 2. I love that the place is BYOB, so champagne mimosas with brunch or a bottle of Pinot Grigio with lunch. However I would have loved to see their interpretation of a virgin Bloody Mary (I could bring an airplane bottle). I love bloody Mary's at brunch and I bet their rendition would be fresh and flavorful. 3. I'm a music nerd so ... I would have loved some Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald ... Or miles Davis or go classical guitar route or newer shoe gazer music (please no kenny g Michael Bolton type crap and please do not just throw some pop on) etc... You get my drift Like I said these are just my own personal touches I would add :0)
