A friend from DC was in town and requested to go to Alla Spina.  I was down, cuz when I think Marc Vetri, I think tasty food. When I think Marc Vetri, I think great food....i also think expensive food.  I was wrong though, well not on the great food part.  The food was delicious, but the prices were very reasonable, and the atmosphere casual.  We did not have a reservation.  The place was very busy, but we were seated immediately.  The beer list is extensive.  Even, if youre not a beer drinker, the wait staff is very knowledgeable and can recommend something you might like that will compliment your meal.  There's a full bar and wine though, if beer absolutely not your thing.   For an app we shared the pretzels and beer cheese.  Bread and cheese is a win win situation anyway, but this was particularly tasty, as most of the yelpers seem to agree.   Although this is a pork centered place, I was in the mood for a veggie burger.  It was wonderful and by no means healthy which is probably why it tasted so good.  My friend had the gnocchi.  I didn't taste it, but she did one of those things where you close your eyes and tilt your head back after the first bite so I think she was satisfied.   Unfortunately, no one ordered the pig head while we were there. I will definitely be back.  I'd love to try some of the pork menu specialties  and I hear they have a great happy hour and brunch.
