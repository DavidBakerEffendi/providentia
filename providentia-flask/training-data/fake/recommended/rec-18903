great food, great service & but nice people running it, but.. they are starting to pinch pennies. Since it first opened, they have raised prices a little, taken at least one dish off menu we liked, forgot my egg roll once, and my biggest complaint is they stopped accepting AMEX. I hate when that happens. The food is delicious though. I love the boneless spare ribs
