The short version- I ate the entire kebab sampler platter myself because it was so good. It's enough meat for 3 or 4 people. Longer version- I live a few blocks away and was very excited about my neighborhood getting a Turkish restaurant. S&H has not let me down. The kebabs (or kebaps if you rather) are all flavorful and moist and the lamb chops are among my favorite in the city. The Turkish Cheese Rolls are another winner if you like cheese, dough, and fried foods, which everyone should. Even the rice got cleaned off my massive plate o' meats. Flavor everywhere. Our waiter was completely unfamiliar with the menu and was obviously very new, but was nice enough and tried his best. Everyone was friendly and very concerned about our enjoyment of the meal; a little off-putting to some, but understandable that they want the feedback. Major bonus points for the fact that they make take-out a snap.
