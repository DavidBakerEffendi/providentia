Sottocasa is tucked away on Atlantic Avenue and easy to miss, but worth checking out.  The pizza is some of the best I have had in NYC/ Brooklyn.  It is Italian style and there is a wide variety of options to choose from.  We enjoyed the Rughetta salad to start which was $8 and definitely big enough to split between two people to start the meal.  The salad was a simple bowl of fresh arugula tossed with lemon juice and olive oil, and garnished with cheese, artichoke, and cherry tomatoes.  We chose the Diavola pizza ($13) and Popeye pizza ($14) and were more than satisfied with both.  The Diavola is great for meat lovers, and the Popeye is ideal for a veggie option.
