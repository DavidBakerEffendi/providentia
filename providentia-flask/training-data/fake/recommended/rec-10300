I had dinner here this past Friday night and I couldn't be happier with my experience! The salad was simple but the ingredients were fresh and the presentation was very nice. My husband and I also shared a special pizza on gluten free crust. The special pizza was incredible- pork belly, pepper Jack cheese, cubed potatoes, red onions, spinach and a drizzle of apricot sweet and sour sauce. We thought the combination sounded a little weird, but I'm glad we took the gamble because it turned out to be amazing! The gluten free crust tasted exactly like I remember "real" pizza to taste. Our waitress was also very friendly and attentive. I can't review this place without talking about the beer! The Zero Gravity brewery is also located here and their beers were amazing! I was an especially big fan of the summer gruit. If I lived in Burlington, there is no doubt that I would be a regular here. Great atmosphere, amazing food, fresh, super tasty beer- what more could a person want?!
