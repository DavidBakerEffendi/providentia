I was so pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Our choice to dine here was sort of a last resort after turning down a few other near by diners. First off, because we had to wait for our food longer than expected (which by any ones standards wasn't that uncommonly long at all!) they served us complimentary muffins which were warm and delicious! Â Could have easily made a breakfast out of just those alone. Quickly my Apple Pancake was delivered and I was blown away by the presentation along with aroma that surrounded it. I dove in and without I doubt I can tell you one of the best apple pancakes I've ever had. Amazing. The friends I were with had equally delicious blintzes. I highly recommend this place and I can tell you I plan on eating here again very soon!! Thank you Day By Day!
