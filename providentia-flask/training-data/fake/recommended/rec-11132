I was back in a Philly for a short visit when a friend told me of this place.  Why oh why did it opened when I moved away!  My last day of my trip and I was determined to try their hot dos...all of them and I did.  Some of the combination were hits some were misses in my book.  The stand outs were the Texas Hold-em, Saigon Fusion, the Southern Comfort, and of course the Philadelphia Surf and Turf. My one suggestion to elevate this place is for them to make different types of dogs or sausages that would be worthy of the imaginative toppings that they came up with.
