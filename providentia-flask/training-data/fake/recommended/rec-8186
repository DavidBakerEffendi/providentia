I live down the street from Koch's.  I used to have to force myself to only go every other week so as not to gain too much weight.   I think most of the reviews here are elegies to Bob Koch and his family.  Bob was one of those guys who just made the place.  You'd come in and he'd know your name after you'd been there a couple of times, he'd tell you an off-color joke and if you came in with your family, he'd hit on your mom (in the best possible way). The sandwiches are legendary.  The size of small elephants.  You can get a sandwich and eat half for lunch and half for dinner with a nap in between.  I remember thinking that they were a little expensive (almost ten dollars for a sandwich) but when you hold the bag in your hands, you will understand why.  Size alone does not recommend a sandwich of course.  Koch's uses good meat and has a bewildering array of possible choices for your hoagie.  My favorites are the Restaurant School special and the Drexel.   Since Bob passed away a couple of years ago, Koch's has been taken over by some guys who are working to keep it like the Koch's of old.  It isn't the same, but they are still handing out treats to keep you happy in line and the boss is trying to tell bad jokes.  Sure, I don't go in as often as I used to, but it is still a great place.
