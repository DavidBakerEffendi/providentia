I didn't have brunch here, as the wait time was waaay too long.  But trust me friends, if the baked goods are any sign of how well they can execute brunch, the 5 stars are well-deserved.  I had an applesauce muffin, a buttermilk biscuit the size of my head, and an oatmeal raisin cookie.  The muffin was pronounced "perfect" by my sweets-averse boyfriend, texture being almost cake-like, with a thin-cidery glaze and an echo of apple-ness.  The biscuit was crunchy and craggly outside, substantial yet light on the inside and smelled buttery divine.  And the cookie was chewy-crispy-toothsome yumminess.  I'm salivating just thinking about them.  All in all, can't wait to go back and have a real meal here.  Wish they had a cookbook as well....their pastry chef's a star.
