This is really just AOK place! FOODS are Too over rating. We went there for dinner before the movie. I ordered pad thai and curry, of cause some wine. This place has a fancy interior design, but they'd better do good on foods too, cuz it's a restaurant not just a bar. The beef is over cooked, taste like  rubbers.  Pad thai is a soul food in Thai cuisine, but I will never try it here again. I will recommend to have a few drink with friend here tho, since this nicely dim silver environment is kinda relax. Service:4 stars Drink: 4 stars Foods: Sorry, 2 stars. I mean i will go to the one right cross the street name's Wondee Siam.
