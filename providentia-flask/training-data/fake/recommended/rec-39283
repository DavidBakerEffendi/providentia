This was the best food and experience of our entire trip north.  As has been said, Simon Pearce was hit hard by Irene, but sitting at our table overlooking the water, sun streaming in the window, sipping on our Simon Pearce Reserve Pinot Noir, one would never imagine it was anything but serene and peaceful here in Quechee. Cheddar Soup, Shepherd's Pie, Penne with Roasted Pumpkin and fresh bread - all wonderful!  Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable. We adored Simon Pearce! We made sure to buy a bottle of that wonderful Pinot Noir too!
