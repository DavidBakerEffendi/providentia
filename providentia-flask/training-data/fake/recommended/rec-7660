I have been here a few times to make sure my burger and French fries are consistently good. And yes! If you order what I always do - the truffled burger and the truffled cheese fries you will experience what I experience as long as you like the flavor of truffles.  Don't forget to ask for the dips or sauces on the side that you could eat with your burger or fries.  For me it's the best burger in the city.  It's not cheap and it's not super expensive.  You get what you pay for! I am very objective with my burgers because I am not a burger person to begin with.  A good burger for me must meet a lot of criteria. The other burger I like is from a Bistro with foie gras and cost twice as much. Therefore, THIS to me is super good and great value - with truffle flavor.
