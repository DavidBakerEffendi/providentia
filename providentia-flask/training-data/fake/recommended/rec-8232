There is nothing bad to say about this place! We found this place while walking towards Church Street where we thought we would find out dining spot. There was a crowd of people walking into American Flatbread so it immediately caught our eye. There was a 20 minute wait but it was well worth it! The place was hopping! I started with the Zero Gravity Craft Brewery T.L.A. IPA! Do yourself a favor- GET THIS BEER!!!!! Everyone in the group had one of the Gravity Craft beers but all agreed the T.L.A IPA was the best! I dined on the Medicine Wheel, which was made of organic tomato sauce, and grana padano cheese. YUMMMMM!!! The small was listed as being for one person but it definitely could have accommodated two of us. All of the ingredients used are local, fresh, and organic. This place thrives on food being made from the heart and it shows. They take great pride in their food and you can taste that in every bite. The founder, George Schenk is a "food philosopher". Go to the website and read some of his quotes and essays! They are awesome and make you feel good about eating at a place like American Flatbread!
