Thanks the bf for taking me out the other night when I was super sick and taking me out to dinner after class. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be able to try out this place and loved it. Service: It was a wednesday night, so we didn't have to wait to get seated. The guy was nice and came a few times to see how we were doing with our food. Food: We were planning to eat light that night since it was getting super late and they were about to close in a hour. He ordered the french beef tartar and I ordered the french raviole de royale. Anything with cheese and truffle oil is amazing! Best creative way of making ravioli I ever had! It just melts in your mouth. Since it was mini raviolis, I took my sweet time to enjoy this dining experience with every bite. The french beef tartar was pretty good too, but I was too focused on my dish. Ambiance: They definitely had a cool and hip vibe to the place! Feels like a sun burnt calf restaurant with slightly similar decor! Overall: I will definitely come back in coming months to try out their fish tacos. A goid place for groups and definitely date nights! Cheers!
