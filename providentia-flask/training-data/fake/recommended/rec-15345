Review #451, this leaves me searching for something new to say. Oh hell, impossible. You just have to eat here! I make sure I do every trip out to NYC. Ya got 6 bucks, then done deal you have dinner. Step up get in line, even if you're not hungry, take a smell...go ahead, now you're hungry. Step up, pick your thing, lamb, chicken or beef. Ah the rice, so good. Now give them your 6 bucks and enjoy. Trust me you won't regret it.
