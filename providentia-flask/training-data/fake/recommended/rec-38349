Great burritos! This is one of the best places to eat in BTV, even if it is a chain restaurant. There are so many choices to make your burrito out of. Some ingredients, such as tofu, bbq sauce, and buffalo sauce may seem odd, but they are really good. I recommend ordering off the "goloco": menu instead of ordering one of the flavors. You can fully customize your burrito on that menu. Another great thing i love is the Boloco card system. Its their rewards program. When you spend a dollar, you get 1 point, and when you amass 50 points, you get A FREE BURRITO. Ive gotten multiple burritos this way. BOLOCO = AWESOME
