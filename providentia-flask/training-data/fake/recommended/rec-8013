Came here on a random work night with a coworker while in Philly for work and we were not disappointed.  The wasabi shu mai was really good if not pungent to say the least.  I had a sashimi combo platter and I was surprised by the value of what you get for the price, and all of the fishes on the plate were of good quality.  My coworker was very happy with his rolls selection, the service was very pleasant as well.
