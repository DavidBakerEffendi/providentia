If you're a fan of great food in a cozy environment with amazing Flamenco performances, you must check this place out. There were not that many vegetarian options but dishes we ordered were all excellent, except for one. What we ordered: Patata Bravas - Nice spicy kick in the sauce Patata Aoli(?) - My second favorite dish that had garlic aoli on top of square potatoe fries Coconut seafood crepe - My favorite dish that had shrimp and crab inside small dumpling looking crepes Goat cheese Croquette - Small portions. We only got 3 small croquettes... Mango Sangria- Definitely worth it. For $7 you get a huge glass of tangy, perfect sangria. White Asparagus with pink sauce - Unlike what other reviewers said, this dish did not work for me or my friends. It was mushy and just plain not appetizing. However, the waiter was so kind to take it off of our bill when we asked.
