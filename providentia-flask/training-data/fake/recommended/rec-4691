Slowly, but surely, Bagel Train has become my primary bagel source.  While I still miss Bagel Junction in Newtown, the B Train has found a way into my heart and stomach with regularity.  My son and I stop in once a week before school to grab a breakfast of Onion Bagel, Butter and Swiss. He goes for Yoohoo, while I pour my first coffee of the day.   The bite, texture and taste are exactly what we love (and kvell over).  This has become our routine. Bonding is a wonderful side dish with the bagels.   Given the importance it has taken on in our lives, and the high quality and exceptional taste sensations generated, a bump to 5 Stars is overdue.
