My most recent work travels brought me to the great big city isle, and on my free evening I had occasion to venture down to my favorite NYC borough to visit a friend. On his recommendation, I was fortunate enough to enjoy a late meal at Chuko, which, for anyone that has paid attention, is my kind of place.   I know many of you read the word ramen and flash back to your college years; late night cup of noodles that served primarily to sate the insatiable beer-crazed munchies that drove you to inhale all manner of things in your younger days that you would balk at now.  For the record: this is not the ramen of your youth.  And even if it were: would you really balk at it?  Don't most people occasionally enjoy the taste of nostalgia?  I'm not the man to ask, where ramen is concerned.  I spent all of my college calories on DP Dough.   I thoroughly enjoyed the kimchi ramen --- a steaming bowl of noodles with scallions, ground pork, and a fried egg thrown in for good measure.  Very good measure. Strong, spicy flavor and a nourishing meal, washed down with a cold Sapporo. There were some pretty good looking appetizers on the menu as well (steamed pork buns, spicy pickles, crispy sprouts) but we stuck with the ramen.  My friend ordered his go-to, the miso ramen, which was also delicious but, being a man that prefers his food with a little kick, it was kimchi or bust for me. This is a pretty tight spot but a long wait was made tolerable by the use of modern technology and alcohol.   They take down your cell phone number and encourage you to venture over to the bar across the street while you wait, Woodwork.  Great little bar with Empire IPA and Brooklyn Lager on draft.  A good one-two punch on a Thursday night.
