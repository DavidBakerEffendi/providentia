Love love LOVE Fiorino! We love to go for a romantic date night, because it really is something special. The bolognese is the best I've ever had, and the fish entrees are spectacular. Â Also I'm pretty sure if I was on death row I would request my last meal to consist of just the homemade bread and tomato pesto... Haha. We love this place!
