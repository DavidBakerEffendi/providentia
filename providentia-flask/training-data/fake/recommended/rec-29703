Had an incredible dinner here on 7/28/12.  Our server was fantastic, and the restaurant has a really cool atmosphere.  My wife had the swordfish (and I took a few bites), and it is probably the best swordfish I've ever had in my life.  The capers add a perfect touch and the flavors were perfectly balanced.  I had the fettuccine, and while it wasn't quite traditional fettuccine alfredo. it was delicious.  A girl at the table next to ours ordered the fettuccine and didn't like it, but I loved mine.   And now the highlight... they have homemade limoncello, and it is indescribably delicious.  If nothing else, go here JUST for the limoncello. I highly recommend this place!
