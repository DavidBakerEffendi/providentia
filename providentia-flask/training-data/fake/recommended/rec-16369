I would like to give 3.6 stars. The hostess, waiter and the manager were all friendly and nice. We got there around 10pm but it was almost full and the atmosphere was very energetic. I ordered spicy pork meat ball with Parmesan sauce, rigatoni and spinach underneath, as recommended by the waiter and I had no regrets! While I still don't believe this place is completely Michelin worthy, the overall experience was great.
