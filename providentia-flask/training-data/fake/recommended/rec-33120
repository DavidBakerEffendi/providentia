great savory crepes!  i love the goat cheese, rosemary, figs and some was my favorite.  we also ordered the salmon/leeks crepe and that was good.  i thought the tapenade/goat cheese a pretty gooooood. we weren't too impressed with the sweet crepes.  i prefer my dessert crepes to be more thin and crispier.  great quality and will be returning
