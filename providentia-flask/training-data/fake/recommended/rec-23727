I really liked this place.  We went for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu.  It was very reasonably priced considering the miso soup and green tea.  I had the Sushi lunch which on that day was a delicious flotilla.   I'm used to sushi rolls, but my lunch was fish on top of tender rice (I know this is standard at some places, but hey I'm not super-cosmopolitan).  My girlfriend is vegetarian and went with some avocado and cucumber rolls which weren't fantastic but weren't bad either. Two things I noticed in other reviews that I'd like to comment on: 1) The atmosphere.  I liked the tucked away feel, as if I'd found a neighborhood secret.  The place was well-lit and subtly decorated so as not to be obnoxious.  There are a small number of tables so come early, waiting space was limited too. 2) The service.  I guess they have gotten better since previous posters, our waitress was quick to bring us water and take our order.  Food came out promptly and our waters and green tea cups never got empty.  Though there were people waiting, we never felt pressured to eat and get out.
