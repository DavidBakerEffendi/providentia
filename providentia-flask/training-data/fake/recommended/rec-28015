I consistently frequent this place, and for good reason. Everything from the crostini, to the panini, to the service is downright excellent. This is a benchmark for all restaurants and true gem of the neighborhood. The greatest thing about this place is that literally everything is fantastic. I end up trying new things every time I go. My recommendations would be the "Shrine to Swine" and the Tuna crostini. 5/5 - Simply perfect.
