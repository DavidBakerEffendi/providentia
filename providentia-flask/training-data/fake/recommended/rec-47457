Went here based on the 4 star review on Yelp.  Don't think it deserves the 4 stars.  Average food in Little Italy.   We started with the Portobello Grigliato, which was just a mushroom with melted cheese.  Was expecting more flavor, but didn't get much.  All of our entrees were average as well.  Not much extra flavor again.  Good, but not great.  Had the ravioli alla pellegrino and ravioli di spinaci.  The nice thing was that they allowed one plate to have half of each.  Also had the pollo del bosco.  Was expecting a little more with the sauce, but didn't get it.   A saving grace was the service.  The waiters were helpful, gave their recommendations, and also accommodated one plate with different pastas.  So, average food with good service, 3 stars.
