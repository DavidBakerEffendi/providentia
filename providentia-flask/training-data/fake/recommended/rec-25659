I just got back from our eating frenzy in NY this past Memorial Day Weekend.  The objective of the trip:  the tour de Momofuku.  We stopped by Ssam, Noodle Bar and Milk Bar.   After Ssam catapulted to be one of the top 50 restaurants in the world, I just had to go try it out!  So, on the Bolt Bus we went. Sadly, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed in our Momofuku experience.  I thought everything was good...but not deserving of the enormous amount of praise it's been getting as of lately.  The standout of them all, was the cereal milk soft serve at Milk Bar next door.  However, in regards to everything else...I just thought it was...meh.  Having tried to make the pork belly buns from the Momofuku at home...I actually liked ours a little more.  So, I guess as the saying goes...why by milk when you have the cow at home really does apply in this instance. I wouldn't rush to go back...but Milk Bar is definitely deserving of another visit.
