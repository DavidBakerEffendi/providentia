A friend told me that there was only one word to describe Umami Burger. And that word was HYPE. She was 100% on point. Good thing we only waited about 10 minutes for our table of four (it was a Thursday at around 6:30). Not long after we ordered, there was a long line outside. I had the Truffle Burger. To give you a general idea of just how greasy this burger was, think - the oil of five Shake Shack burgers squeezed into this one Umami Burger. (Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a tad but I think you get the picture). We also ordered the truffle fries, cheesy tots (not on the menu) and the smashed potatoes. CARBS GALORE! Truffle fries were good. Cheesy tots were okay but it only comes with eight dinky pieces so it wasn't really worth it. The smashed potato is literally just a smashed potato. Flavorless and looks like somebody sat on it. If you're in the area and you don't have to wait more than 15 minutes, I would say give it a shot. Anything more than 15 minutes would just be wasting your time.
