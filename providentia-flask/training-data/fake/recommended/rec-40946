Surprise surprise, I didn't hate this place. Guess that's a success. Our training class decided to take the instructor out for lunch to show our appreciation on the last day of the training. The instructor was super laid back and picked Yorkside pizza b/c it's close to the law school where we had the training. Two colleagues who work at the law school said ppl call Yorkside pizza "pukeside". Ah oh! That's not a good sign! So based on that I didn't have any expectations. I know New Haven has tons of pizza choices so I was sad our dear instructor wanted to eat at Yorkside pizza! Â Oh well! We made a reservation of 12 and were seated quickly on a Friday around noon. The restaurant was super busy and I actually saw ppl waiting in line. To get into pukeside? I wondered. They have a pretty extensive menu of choices but most of our group ordered the lunch special that includes one slice of pizza and a side salad. For the lunch special pizza slice, you only have three choices of pepperoni, cheese and a third option with three toppings. I opted to get the one with three toppings and a Greek salad. Don't be fooled. The portion was huge! It was deff not your average slice of pizza and side salad. It was a big meal for sure. I actually enjoyed my pizza and I especially loved the Greek salad. Delicious! Now I question the pukeside joke. Anyways, I think this place is a solid quick lunch spot at least based on my one time visit. I don't mind stopping by once in awhile.
