Location - located on busy Farmington avenue in West Hartford.  Parking is atrocious if you're looking to get a spot in front of the restaurant.  Your best bet is to go around the back where there's more parking spaces.  (-1) Aesthetics - looks like a regular Chinese restaurant from the outside and in but the decor is little darker.  There are some tables and chair for customers to eat but the area is a bit small.  Good thing I opted for take-out. Menu/food - I opted for the lunch menu and chose the Hunan chicken with pork fried rice.  I have to say I wasn't too impressed by the taste of the chicken.  It just seemed to have a peculiar taste and odor to it and the entire dish was too salty for my liking.  The cook/chef must've gone overboard with the soy sauce.  Vegetables and rice was good.  (-1) Service - Friendly on the phone but in person when I arrived to pick up my order, service was not so friendly - didn't get so much as a "thank you", "have a nice day", or "please come again" plus the young cashier seemed more interested in chatting up the delivery guy rather than pay me any attention not that I was particularly looking for any. (-1) Rating - 2/5 - for parking, overly salty food, strange tasting and smelling chicken, and unfriendly service.
