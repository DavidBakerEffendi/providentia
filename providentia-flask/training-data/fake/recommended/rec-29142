A nice sports bar tucked in off the street. Recently reopened under new ownership.  Interior looks like most sports bars:  plenty of big screen TVs, a projection TV, jerseys and lots of bar height seating.   The beer selection is good and 5 on tap includes a New England Brewery selection, as well as a fairly extensive bottle selection.  The menu is huge, and includes anything you would expect and then some.  So far, everything I've tried has been pretty tasty. There is a separate dining room (also with TVs) for those with family or otherwise want a quieter crowd.   The staff is friendly and is always willing to look up games for you.   There are special events throughout the week (such as karaoke tuesdays) that also make the place a great visit even if you don't have a game to watch.
