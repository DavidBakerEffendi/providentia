The meal I had here was the first time ever that I had Pad Thai sitting in a pool of broth.  The Beef Salad was seasoned correctly, but it came with 6 small morsels.  Real Thai Beef salad is basically a plate of really spicy beef sitting on a small pile of greens.  This was neither.  This is what a good Thai Beef Salad looks like: templeofthai.com/recipes…
