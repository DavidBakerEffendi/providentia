THIS IS AN AVERAGE DINER!!! Â I had the "Mexican Omelette", with french toast.. I was not taken by it at all.. Everything i ate felt like i could of just made it at home... I don't like giving bad review but i really had too.. Some people just don't know good taste and go around giving all of these good review!! I would give this a one star, but the waiter was supper nice to me... So for all you locals Continue going here.. I'll be sticking to "The usual" on Vanderbilt....
