This is another one of my favorites!!! Monday-Friday 5pm-7pm & 10pm-12am they have $10 pitchers of margaritas...$14 if you want a flavor!! You cannot beat that! I come here with friends all the time! I highly recommend the chicken quesadillas and try their different sauces with it as well.  WARNING: The jalapeno poppers are no joke! They are HOT! I love poppers but I had to send the food back because it was unbearably hot! I like the fried pickles as well!  & I can't forget the $1 per person unlimited chips and salsa! Great vibe, great dim lighting, and plenty of diversity! Parking is a little difficult at times, but it's worth it!
