I love philly cheese steaks! Although, it is not the same in the west coast. This was my first time eating a real deal philly cheese steak right in Philadelphia.   I ordered a philly cheese steak with cheese whiz.  It also comes with sauteed onions.   The wait wasn't long, and my cheese steak was ready! I was so excited to try my first philly cheese steak in Philadelphia!   The bread used in the philly cheese steak is crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.  The portion of meat is plentiful, and perfectly cooked.  Sauteed onions add texture and nice flavor.  The cheese whiz is a great compliment to the sandwich. I want to come back, maybe try the sandwiches with different cheese steaks.
