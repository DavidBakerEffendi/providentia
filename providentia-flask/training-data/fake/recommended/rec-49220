DO NOT get the kimchee vodka bloody mary.  It really has an odd, aggressive, fish-y taste to it.  Borderline undrinkable (and I have a strong stomach and happen to love spicy bloody mary's). Other than that, the main dish, including the pork buns and the special house dish, the entire side of pork (I believe it's the shoulder) that's slow cooked and served for $200 for the entire table -- with small sides and rice and lettuce leaves to wrap it -- was very, very good.   To really do some damage to the huge pork dish, I recommend at least 10 people to tackle it.  Otherwise you will either (1) have lots of left-overs, or (2) over-eat, or (3) both.   The service was fine but a little "too cool for school" / Williamsburg Brooklyn / hipster for my taste.  Could have been nicer and more down to earth. My request for salt and pepper was greeted with a sneer and a snide "Um, I'm not sure we have those, let me ask the kitchen."   (?!).   SALT.  And PEPPER.   Poor form.
