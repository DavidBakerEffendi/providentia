loved it. The atmosphere manages to charming and bustling at the same time. You almost feel like you are in a private party in a wine cellar. The food was quite good - the artichoke salad was a unique offering. The bruchetta is much smaller than I have seen before, but very tasty. Wine list was diverse for both red and white wine drinkers. Noise level starts to gets quite loud starting around 8 pm but there is an outside area as well as a patio that are, presumably, quieter.
