This restaurant might be my soul mate. Genius and fun to get wasted with. Tequila margarita Gusher things are like adult Gusher shots. My two favorite things. Get the Salad. Salads are always lame at other restaurants but this one stands on its own two feet. The e666gs are so good. SOOOOO GOOD. I love the whole menu. People say its "hipster" but that is misleading. The staff isn't a bunch of insufferable douche bags. Its just...cool. It's cool like the kid in high school that did his own thing and effortlessly had the best taste. You hate this place if you are lame. This place makes me glad I'm not an anorexic.
