All-around awesome: great wait staff, chef, food quality, ambiance, price point. Like everyone says, fried chicken is where it's all: regular, hot, super hot - voted #1 in the nation by The View. Feel like that's saying something, although I haven't watched it since Star Jones was on it...which was forever ago. Happy hour 3-7 that includes 2 for $5 beers, $5 cocktails. Southern inspired mixed drinks: rum, fruit, sweet tea. Food is legit Nashville (we ate with a Nashville native who confirmed): chicken, grits, collard greens, mac n chz, bacon potato salad, cornbread. All good. Staff was great: super nice server, chef came out to bring our food and said goodbye when he left for the night. Will definitely come back. Haven't been to their other location (just called Peaches), but know this is an offshoot.
