Being on Restaurant Row might be an excuse for small portions at high prices.  But tacking on an extra $6 to a $17 Taquitos de Langosta appetizer (total cost $23) so that two of us could share 4 miniscule tacos with a few shreds of lobster meat?  A  rip off.  $12 cocktails were tasty but had little impact due to the absence of alcohol (served in small tumblers with large ice cubes).  The absence of a real light fixture in the bathroom completes the picture of a restaurant with potential focused more on profit than on pleasing the customer.
