One of the hiddgen gems in the Ironbound.  I have been about 4-5 times and have never been dissapointed.  On Sunday's the special is "slow cooked beef ribs", very flavorful and tender served with patatoe salad.  I dropped one star because parking is always difficult. It is not a rodizio restaurant but it is so worth it!!
