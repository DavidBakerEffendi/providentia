I have never been treated with such pretension and condescension in any restaurant experience. I had heard wonderful things about the food at Han Dynasty and was curious to try it. From the moment that the owner began taking our order, things went down hill. He proceeded to criticize our selections and tell us "You can get fried dumplings any place, people don't come here for fried dumpling." Then why are they on your menu? He answered the phone when one of us was mid-sentence with our order. It was unbelievably rude. After that, I thought, the food here must be amazing because no one would put up with this attitude for mediocre cuisine. But you know what? It wasn't amazing, it was just ok. I would never put myself through this experience ever again. Don't bother with this restaurant unless you want average Chinese food served up with its insanely arrogant owner.
