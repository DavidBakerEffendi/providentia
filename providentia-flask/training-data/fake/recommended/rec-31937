The food is good not the greatest but it is a nice spot to relax and eat if you have all day. The service is OK but not the best. If you looking for a quick slice of pizza to go forget about it they always run out and tell you they will make a pie. Overall average the place is OK if there is no other place nearby that has pizza.
