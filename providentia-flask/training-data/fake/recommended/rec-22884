We went for a Sunday brunch when we couldn't get in elsewhere--it was dead at 11 a.m..  Service was fine and it was quiet so we could talk and catch-up.  The chicken waffle sandwich, which sounds so delightful, was tasteless and bland.  i think the main draw is all you can drink drinks for $12 in ninety minutes
