Ate here for the first time last night, based on the recommendation of a friend. I didn't expect much as I don't believe Bayonne is really known for great restaurants. I ordered a few oysters Â which turned out to be really fresh, I then had the Chilean sea bass which was good as well, but a little oily. For what the bill ran, I would have expected better. The indoor atmosphere is so so, and the outdoor seating would be nice if the area was more appealing. I will most likely not make the drive back to Bayonne for buon appetito, as it was only a fair experience all together.
