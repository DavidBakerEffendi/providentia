From the time I walked through the door until the time I left, I felt like I was family!  I was promptly greeted by Jose who introduced me to his business partner, Orlando.   We chatted for a bit then I was seated near by.   Wandia (hope I spelled it correctly) introduced herself and helped guide me through my indecisiveness due to the fact that I wanted one of everything!  I selected the rice with gandules, pink beans and mussels with a tropical fruit salsa.   Another server came over with a plate of delicious looking appetizer.  It contained gluten so she took it back to the kitchen and came out with a delicious alternative!  Bonus points!!!  I know how to order in the parameters of my limitations sometimes others have no clue as to what gluten intolerant actually means.  Not this woman!   My meal was nothing short of fabulous!!!  Hell, Jose even swayed me into ordering a super scrumptious dessert.  I can't believe I ate the entire dessert!   I asked Jose for a tour of the upstairs banquet room.  It can accomodate up to 35-40 people.  The patio seating outdoors seats approximately the same amount.  And there is a juice/coffee bar and two dining rooms.   I left here feeling nothing short of satisfied, happy and already looking forward to my next visit.   They are open weekends only which at first made me quite sad, but it is for my own good!  I would never be home!   Congratulations on the new and fabulous dining experience Jose and Orlando!  I look forward to seeing you next weekend! P.S.  Buen Prevecho is BYOB.  Next time I will remember wine or sangria.
