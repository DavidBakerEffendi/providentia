I wish I could review the food but unfortunately I was never able to! I made a reservation for a party of 4 and when I got here I was told that the restaurant had tried to call me to confirm the reservation, and since they had not been able to get a hold of me, they just cancelled it (?). I was only given the option of waiting for another table that would open up 40 minutes after my original reservation time. What the heck? If you call a restaurant to make a reservation, then it is expected that they ACTUALLY reserve a table for the time you make a reservation?
