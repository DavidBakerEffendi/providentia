Compared to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, this place rocks because you don't have to wait in a 2 hour line, (literally.) you're not squished while trying to eat your pizza, and the pizza tastes just as good/better. I always get meatballs and pepperoni for toppings and it never disappoints. Yeah, the place can be tourist-y, but it's GOOD food at a tourist-y place, which is more than I can say about some other places in the city. *Ahem.* Plus, you can go to Rice to Riches across the street after dinner!
