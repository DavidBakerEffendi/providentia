I've been to Osteria a few times for work events. My first visit wasn't too pleasant. The service was extremely poor. Considering the price of their lunch menu, service should have been outstanding. That being said, the food was amazing. I had the pizza with the octopus and it was the first time I ever had octopus on pizza and it went very well together! My colleagues and I decided to try Osteria a second time, and the food was fantastic once again. I opted to split the Parma Pizza and  Bufala Mozzarella Panini with a colleague. I have to say that the prosciutto at Osteria is phenomenal.  I recommend any menu item with prosciutto! Must try! The service the second time around was much better as well, and I'll be sure to try Osteria out for dinner sometime, I hope it's as good as their lunch menu!
