After a huge disappointment at Nom Wah Tea Parlor we still had some space in our tummies because we left almost half of their food on the plates. So we headed down the street and landed up in this little whole- in-a- wall spot. And in no time our mood was restored to the happy stage by eating their wonderful hand pulled noodle dish with duck. That was the best noodle dish we ever ate. We appreciate our experience very much and recommend this place to Chinese noodle lovers.
