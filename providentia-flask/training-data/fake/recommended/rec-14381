What else is there to say that hasn't already been said by the other 4500+ reviewers? In a city with tons of other similar food stands, this one is (supposedly) the best. (I haven't tried other halal food stands, but trust me, Halal Guys is amazing on its own merits.) Lamb and chicken and rice combo--delightful. Absolutely delicious. Generous portions of lamb and chicken (juicy and totally not dry) on a bed of hot rice. What's also great is that the amount of meat they give seems to be more than the amount of rice. As of this writing, it's $6, which is an awesome deal; I honestly wasn't able to finish it since they give so much food! The line was a tad long, but the food comes fast and thus the line isn't that much of a bother. Can't wait to come back to this place!
