Most of the food is on the rich, heavy side.  Went with a big group and had to wait a good while but the service was friendly and gracious.  They offer popcorn in bacon grease to start off, which I liked at first but all the fat adds up.  My favorite dish was the heirloom tomato salad because it was really fresh, delicious and well balanced.  The shaved foie gras was yummy as well as the pork trotter torchon;  the pork belly tacos were too fatty but that's the nature of the stuff.  The seafood (mussels and yellowtail tartare) was not memorable in comparison.  One of our group joked about ordering the entire menu but the waitress told us we'd get sick.  We ate about 2/3 of the menu and several of us did feel sick afterwards from the fattiness.
