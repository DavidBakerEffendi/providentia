Ilili is a fantastic restaurant. We had a group of 8 there for lunch a couple of months ago. Excellent Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, Moujadara, Tabbouleh, Falafel, Brussel Sprouts, Phoenician fries, Kebabs and much more. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because we asked them if we are over-ordering and they said no. Turns out we had way too much. But still a great meal.
