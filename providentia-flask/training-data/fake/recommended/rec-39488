Great place to go on Tuesdays for half off tapas, and great happy hour. It gets very busy, so if you want a seat go early. Also try there weekend brunch $17 gets you food and a drink, which are usually very strong.. Two drinks and you start to get a good buzz. Try the red sangria. In all cant go wrong here great food, and vibe.
