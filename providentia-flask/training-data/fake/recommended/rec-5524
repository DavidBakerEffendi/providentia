When I went to Ichiban a few years ago the sushi that I had ordered had a bit of a plastic after taste, which didn't sit well. When I went yesterday I noticed that there was a great deal of improvement! I ordered the eel and avocado roll and the shrimp tempura roll to go. Both rolls were good but for some reason I felt that that the eel roll was lacking flavor. As a sushi restaurant in Hartford, Ichiban does a good job but I wish that their menu was a bit more creative.
