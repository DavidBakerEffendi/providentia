Imagine this, you're a lightweight or maybe even allergic to alcohol, so what is one to do when it's raining and has just had a big dinner and dessert tasting at Chikalicious?  Go to Cha-An for some tea and small sweets.   I love the ambiance and decor of this place.  The staff is also very friendly and never pushed us to go.  We spent a good 2-3 hours here, just chatting and resting our feet.  We happily drank our tea and ate the small little treats, much like an English afternoon tea with a Japanese twist.  We never felt pressured to leave and we never felt we were overstaying our welcome b/c there was never a wait for our table. I didn't get a chance to try anything savoury, but looked around at the food that was being served and it definitely peaked my curiosity.  I will be back again.
