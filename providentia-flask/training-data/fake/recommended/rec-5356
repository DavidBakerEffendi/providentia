I came here on a friday night without reservations.  We waited for about 45 minutes to an hour for the table.  However, it could've been a shorter wait if they set people up in ways where you can move tables around.  There were a lot of tables open for 2 people but most people who were there came in groups of 3 or more.  You can choose to ask them for glasses to drink your BYOB wine/liquor while you wait.  This one group finished all their wine before they even got seated.  The service was pretty good, nothing extraordinary. The inside is pretty small and cozy with outside seatings available.  We sat outside on a fall night.  There were heat lamps above us so it wasn't all that bad, pretty pleasant.  The noise level can get pretty loud since it is a byob and when people come in groups and drink, it tends to get loud. As far as the food goes, the appetizers were amazing.  We ordered the antipasta and meatballs.  The antipasti was very refreshing served with some bread.  I ordered the risotto which I only took about a bite of because I was so full from the wine and appetizers.  I wish I had room for dessert because I normally like to end the night with sweets. One down side to this place is it's CASH ONLY.  It really is an inconvenience because most people don't carry too much cash on them anymore.
