Driven by here a few times, never seemed to want to go in, but someone showed me the menu and I was Intrigued.  My husband and I shared an appetizer and split one of the chicken sandwiches.  It wad delicious!   We actually went back the next night for dinner. We ordered a different appetizer 2 actually and got an entry.  We ordered sangria that came out in fish bowls... the prices were great and the place was empty.  Which is why I am writing, I don't want this treasure to go anywhere.  They have a bar in the front that doesn't interfere with the atmosphere except for the music.  It's a jukebox and the whole place is one that sound system.  So whatever someone from the bar chooses to listen to the whole joint does. There are just too many pros that out way the cons in my opinion.  I would and have highly recommend this place!!
