A friend and wanted to try both Pat's and Geno's.  He jumped in line at Pat's, and I at Geno's.  The plan was to each get 2 cheese stakes, and then swap one each for a taste challenge. First clue, the length of the lines.  Got our steaks from Pats in under 5 minutes. Geno's took 20 + minutes. As far as the stakes go, Geno's was MUCH better all around.   Pat's still made a great cheese steak and has enough history to be well worth a visit(s).
