Simply delicious!!! The start was kind of slow, with Burrata, a little bit too much raspberry and not enough acidity. But hell did they come back from this false start... The Pig Cheeks are a must, the scallops really live off the carrot puree they're soaked in, and the bacon doughnuts, I mean they're delicious. But the coffee ice cream, with its roasted flavors, together with the smoky bacon - genius!!! Don't skip the Foie Gras either...
