We went to snack for sandwiches, although their pies looked really good, too. The sandwiches were yummy. They are served on bread which has a crusty outside and a nice chewy inside. It's delicious, but can be difficult to bite through in a sandwich. The hummus was not at all bland and was served with freshly baked pitas. I also got the mint lemonade. The lemonade was perfect: not too sour, not too sweet, but there was no taste of mint. All in all, a great lunch spot. Lots of vegetarian options. There is a $20 credit card minimum.
