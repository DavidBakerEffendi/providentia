The lady and I were walking through the village with the intention of finding somewhere low-key, neighborhood-y, and hopefully having some seafood for dinner. Walking down Bleecker, we were trying to convince ourselves that the street wasn't too busy to find a hidden gem. We almost gave up and went to Choptank but knew it wasn't exactly right. We decided to search for a bit more and took a turn down Grove because it's such a beautiful, inviting street. Sure enough Little Owl popped up on the next corner, EXACTLY what we were looking for. A tiny restaurant on a perfect corner. We got the cheapest bottle of red and it was delicious. We ordered a lobster soup to start, chard and mushrooms for the sides, and split a skate over a arugula and crab salad for the main. Finished with some delicious cheeses for dessert. Everything was absolutely amazing. Seriously, everything. Perfection. We then heard the tables next to us talking about how difficult it is to get a table here. The waitress was even suggesting to them that they should call a month in advance at exactly 10am if they want to be sure to get a reservation at a time they want. We walked right in and waited only 15 minutes to sit. Who knew? Anyways, I hope you enjoyed my story. I guess it can be hard to get in, but if you're only two, and there are seats at the bar, just wait it out. You won't regret it.
