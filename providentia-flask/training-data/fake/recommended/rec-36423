So impressed with our little afternoon "snack" of Caesar salad with chicken meatballs, and that my cousin (who lives nearby) hadn't had a chance to eat here....we go back the next night for a try at dinner.... It's on a Saturday night around 8:15 and we figure if it's crazy there's tons of other choices close by (always good to have a backup plan), so we waltz right in...no wait...seated promptly... It's a small place but has a cozy vibe, sort of homey eclectic with a touch of cute. They have a really nice choice of items on the menu, to me different from the usual fare. I decide to go for the FBLT (fake bacon aka "soy", and lettuce and tomato). served on a nice earthy bread with some kick ass fries. Wowwie Wow...it was great! I don't do Pork or Beef so Bacon in the "real world" is usually out for me. This was thick and crunchy with a bit of a spicy kick and oh yeah it had avocado too. Mmmmmm just thinking about it, I could go for one right now. I love this place, and for dessert (they all sounded so good, and usually my husband and I share) but not tonight. Get your own! So the three of us splurged and each got our own, all out of this world yummy! I got a peach raspberry pie, my cousin got a lovely piece of carrot cake with nice gooey thick frosting and hubby got a nice chocolate cupcake. Everyone was happy. The world was good. And when I come back to my second home I'll be boppin' over to Penelope for something really delicious.
