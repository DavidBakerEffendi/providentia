the first review was for delivery. this one is for dinner. i like their food, but what i like more is the atmosphere. they have some kind of satellite radio set up that plays the radio stations from bombay. so if i am homesick, this is where i go. listen to ridiculous bombay radio, eat a navratan korma and a garlic naan. get some tea. and i feel right at home. the waiters there chat me up and have often given me free dessert! (free dessert!) ..kheer, and jalebi a few times. this review might be based on very personal things, but thats what makes my experience great, right? :) the personal stuff!
