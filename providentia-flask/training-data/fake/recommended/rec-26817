The food selections for dim sum were definitely lacking and sub-par. We were waiting for 15 minutes seated with no dim sum even circulating to our table. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was absolutely horrendous. The waiters did not remember to bring anything that we asked for. There were numerous times when they came over to our table, and did not even bother once to clear off the finished food plates that were piling up. The staff were all very rude as well. All in all, the worst dim sum experience I have ever had. I had high hopes for this place, and unfortunately I left very disappointed.
