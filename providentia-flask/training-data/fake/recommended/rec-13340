Get the bistro burger. It has bacon in it, which makes all the difference. The meat is thick, but cooked medium and it's amazingly juicy. Fries were kind of too crispy for me, but the cute old man who seemed like the owner made up for it. He's so sweet! It's a small, quaint, and friendly little joint. Quiet, with a bar, kind of a chill place. Somewhere you can even eat alone and not feel judged. And we got fries, cheeseburger, and the bistro burger..for less than $20! Worth a try, definitely. Just nothing super memorable.
