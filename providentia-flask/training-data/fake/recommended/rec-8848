It's bad for you, you're gonna have to wait in line, and you'll probably be accosted by panhandlers while waiting.  Still, you don't even have to ask--YES, it's worth it.  Chicken and rice (that delish orange rice), drenched in white sauce (it's all about that sauce), and drizzled with a little bit of hot sauce.  I feel like crap after every time eat it, but the next day I'm craving it again.  That's addiction, baby. Tip:  Yes, the other carts on the SE corner of 53rd and 6th and the SW corner of 53rd and 7th (the latter apparently serves lunch) are run by the same owners with the same food.  My hubby claims the original cart has fresher food, but I think it's worth it to patronize the other carts to avoid the line.
