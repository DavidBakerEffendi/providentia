Being big NYC burger aficionados we had to give this West Coast institution a try. We had the truffle burgers, one FF and the tempura onion rings. Truffle burger: terrific! Every bite a pleasure, and I don't make statements like that lightly. You can really taste the truffle infused butter (or sauce, or what ever) Rings: Yum. Â Fluffy, and the onion doesn't pull out of the coating after the first bit rookie style. Fries: meh The bill: worth the price Diagnosis: delicious. GO GO GO
