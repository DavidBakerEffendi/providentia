Why does the kitchen have to close from 3:30-5PM? I was in the area and decided to drop by for an late lunch/early dinner but it was closed so I was so disappointed. I thought that since I was there at 4PM, I'd be able to avoid the perpetual long line but I guess I just don't come here enough to know their hours. The menu is very limited but their noodles are quite good. This is definitely one of my favorite places for ramen. I always order more noodles because there's never enough! I always want more! My other favorite place for ramen is Menchanko Tei.
