This place was recommended to me by the homeless guy outside a bagel shop who wanted to tell me a story and of course I said yes because hell I love talking to crazy homeless people how else would I get such great brunch recommendations? We knew what we were getting into reading these other reviews, about the wait, so we put our name in with our be-speckled hostess and took a walk to East River Park. Let me tell you it was SO BEAUTIFUL! It was a crisp autumn day, pre-Sandy, and we walked down Houston down to the river and had a nice sit. Nice benches there, and we had a great view of the Williamsburg Bridge, probably some other bridges too I forget (just too many to name). There were soccer fields and baseball diamonds and everyone was looking great and just having the best time! What a nice neighbourhood the lower east side is, especially in the fall! Such lovely foliage. And quieter than up town, I guess that goes without saying. All in all, I think I'm going to spend a LOT more time in the LES from NOW ON.
