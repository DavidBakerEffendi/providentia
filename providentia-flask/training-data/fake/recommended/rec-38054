There's almost always a wait, sometimes up to an hour but it's definitely worth it. Definitely isn't super classy, wear your stretch pants cause you will leave stuffed! I recommend the poppy John shrimp appetizer-SO GOOD! And I always get the lazy man lobster with stuffing. Expect to spend at least $50-100 for just 2 people.
