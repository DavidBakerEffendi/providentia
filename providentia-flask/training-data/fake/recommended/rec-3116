I'm a fan not because the food is spectacular or anything but more out of convenience.  After returning from week long road trip to Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Maine, I kinda wanted to try the lobster roll for myself to see how it compares. It was good.  It was as fresh as it was gonna get in NYC.  I recommend it.  Def.  Also, you can't beat the fact that it's available at the Brooklyn Flea and spend the afternoon browsing treasures.
