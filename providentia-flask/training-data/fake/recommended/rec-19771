Valenca Restaurant DO NOT COME HERE!!!!! Unless you understand that you will eat the best steak one could have. Don't waste your time with anything else. Filet Mignon on a hot stone. AKA, steak on a stone for the FNDC. The FNDC (Friday Night Dinner Club) 7 in total makes this one of its stops on a regular basis. Yes, the wait can be long but worth it. Lunch time works well and also after hours for the late eaters can get you a table. Bread and salad come with every meal. When the FNDC shows up, we start off with the garlic shrimp, flaming Portuguese sausage table side and we change up between the grilled octopus and muscles in red diablo sauce (not enough devil in the Diablo but no place is enough for me) and that is just our appetizers. Let's not forget the pitcher of white and red sangria made to perfection.  After we have worked our way through that we have learned that one order of Fillet mignon on hot stone at $25 for two fillets can feed two easily. You will need to ask for extra GARLIC butter... Also, comes with yellow rice and thinly cut house made fried crispy not grease potato chips.  Not only do I come with my family. Anytime anyone comes to visit I make it a point to give them this experience. Fun place, where you are not in a hurry to leave. Making it something of an issue if you are the type to hurry for your food, hurry through the service and hurry for the check.  They do have a restaurant side. Quite, less bar like, same food, same service. Okay if that is what you are wanting for the night.  Don't recommend the desserts, very common, nothing to write home about. Parking as with all restaurants found in a city is not the best. They do have valet parking, never used them so can't comment. Remember to always drink responsibly   Crazy Cubano Out.
