This is the best byob I've been to in a long time! I went for my birthday last night and I loved the small cozy atmosphere and Moroccan decor. I ordered the rare tuna with garlic mashed potatoes...they did not mess around with the garlic in those potatoes but it was still wonderful. My boyfriend got the lamb shank and it was jam packed full of flavor. The portions are generous. The only downside to the place is service isn't fantastic. Our server wasn't very attentive and he didn't really answer any of the questions we had about the menu. I asked him if he preferred the tuna or the swordfish and he looked at me like I was crazy and said they are too different. It was like I asked...what's better apples or chocolate bars?? Don't let that scare you away though! I will be back for a another satisfying meal.
