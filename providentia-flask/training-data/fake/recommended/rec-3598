After reading the reviews, I decided to try this place out and was highly impressed. As noted this place is cash only and very reasonable. The service was great and so was the food. I ordered the 2 for 2 - (2) Eggs, (2) Pancakes, (2) Pork Sausages and a side of Bacon. I finished everything!!! and did not require seconds. Also the staff came around and offered fresh oranges. I enjoyed myself as so did my girlfriend, we definitely would return again.
