P.S. stopped by for a heffeweissen the other day and it was soooo divine, i've been a) thinking about it ever since, and b) relishing the mastermind who knows these beers so well and makes them available to the average beer drinker, like me! P.P.S. Another visit & I had the fish and chips. DON'T DO IT. I actually had to rescue the fish from the gummy thick batter that was completely unappetizing and not a all what I would think of when I am seeking out crispy, light battered fish!
