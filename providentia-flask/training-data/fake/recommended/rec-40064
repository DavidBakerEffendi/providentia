Coworkers and I decided to drive into Philly one night to check out the scene. We wanted to grab a drink and stumbled across National Mechanics on Yelp. It was Wednesday night so it was quizzo trivia time! We were promptly seated when we arrived and I stuck with my Yueling Lager. The crowd consisted mostly of young professionals and there was a good vibe all around. We enjoyed our drinks and listening to the questions that were being asked (one coworker got so many of them right!) Too bad we had to leave earlier since we had to get up early for work the next day. Best part = we had 10 drinks for only $47! Back in LA, our bill definitely would've been closer to $100.
