My boyfriend's office orders from here from time to time and he's raved about it and I finally gave it a shot today.  Staff is friendly and food came out quickly.  The turkey cranberry sandwich with Brie on rye was one of the best sandwich I have had in ages!  I can't wait to come back and get this sandwich again and to try others!!
