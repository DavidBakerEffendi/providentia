Now, this joint is just straight-up cool. I went here for a livetronica show and benefit for Haiti a few months back. The place got a little too packed, which I'm figuring security would not have allowed but for the raising money for a good cause. The sound is good, and it is just amazing that you can pick between a bar to your left and a diner to your right. Speaking of bars, sometimes when I go to shows, for reasons I cannot explain, I crave a Zima. Try ordering that at a bar -- any bartender will laugh, but they know exactly what you're asking for. The bartender here said that since the calendar was telling her it was 2010 and not 1995, I was going to have to settle for a hard lemonade. Â Fair enough. And a note on security -- security DID kick out a friend of mine for smoking indoors. He was not smoking, but he is 6'6" and gets picked on a lot by security because he looks tough, even though he's a total kitten. Well he decides to leave, change clothes and come back in. Security definitely recognized him immediately (he's 6' 6"), but they let it slide. All in all, good times had by all. And judging by the rave reviews of the food, I can see that I definitely need to go back here to eat.
