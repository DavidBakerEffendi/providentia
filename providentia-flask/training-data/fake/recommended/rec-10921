I'll spare the repeated comments for you all. Some quick things to know: During the day, they are not at the usual spot - check out either the east side corner of 53rd and 6th, or 52nd and 6th.  The guys at the usual spot own the permit during the day, and scoop up some unaware custies! Anyway, cheap good quality halal.  Great munchies food whether drunk, baked, or whatever you do on your own time. Be conservative with the hot sauce, or else it will light your ass on fire, literally!  I tend to use a bit more than needed. Don't give the homeless beggars money before you look at their clothes and facial hair - if they got a better line up than you, don't give the bastard money! It is possible to get sick off of this food, but I think it's more of a function of the fact that you are consuming a large grease concoction versus the food being cooked to order. Enjoy and smile!
