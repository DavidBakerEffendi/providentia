What a phenomenal place! Seriously - I rarely care enough to write more than a two-liner, but this place is so so so worthy. Amazingly tasty Thai food combined with a beautiful and unique decor. On top of all that, it is so reasonably priced that i actually consider it irrational not to return... Unlike other places where something you order always turns out to be a dud, not a single dish that our party of six ate was anything less than magnificent. We started with the delicious Golden Triangle which was pure fried heaven served with a fantastic plum saki sauce. Had this along with the calamari which was damn good also. Â  For my meal I had a dish i could not even have imaged in my wildest dreams - the Lychee Siamese Duck with lychee fruit, pineapples, cherry tomatoes and basil.
