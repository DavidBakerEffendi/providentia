Here's the short and simple: 1. Food is Good. 2. Food is expensive. 3. Beer selection is ... OK. Dinosaur BBQ is frequently touted as being the best of the best when I talk to fellow cooks in the city, and to be honest I might be inclined to agree on a few of their items (specifically the FRIED GREEN TOMATOES and DEVILED EGGS are some of the best I've had) - but other elements aren't so good - the Buffalo Wings are at best average and ... kind of forgettable, which is a shame because I do love me some wings. The Pork BBQ is tasty, but I've had better - but I will give credit where credit is due as so many places in this city seem to be afraid of putting pork on the menu. I was severely disappointed by the Beef Brisket - the portion was exceptionally tiny, and the (admittedly masterfully thinly sliced) dish was cold by the time it reached my table (topping the brisket with cold pickles probably didn't help this any. ) Dinner for my wife and myself (complete with 2 entrees, and appetizer, and a lemonade and a beer) came to over $70 - which just goes to show how much of a trend food BBQ has become, I remember when BBQ joints are where you went to get lots of food for cheap - now at Dinosaur BBQ I'm getting a little bit for a lot. I probably won't be back to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, which is a shame because the things that were good where very good, but the disappointments and the high price will keep me from going back when there are so many other, better, cheaper options out there in the city. That being said, I would certainly recommend that you try it - especially those Fried Green Tomatoes (Late at night they haunt me with their crispy beauty - ORDER THE TOMATOES, DAMNIT) ... Just be prepared to spend wayyyy more money than you should.
