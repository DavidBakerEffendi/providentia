Some diners are better than others. And Handy's Lunch is a family legacy with heart, a horseshoe counter, and hot cookies. I really, really enjoy diners, diner culture, diner food- to me, it's something distinctly American you can't really experience in very many places. The walls in the entryway proudly display their first license, and other special pieces of Handy's history. When we arrived, couples, groups of friends, and families were all dining here and seemed to be engaged happily with the funny, helpful workers here. Try the pancakes, and the omelettes looked great too. This is one of those places where everything is probably really good, if my eyes watering as they kept brining out food indicates anything. Really a special place.
