This place is incredible! I woke up this morning and wanted a strawberry Belgian waffle. I found Chhaya on yelp and decided to try it since they specialize in waffles - so happy I did! I had the strawberry nutella waffle and my boyfriend tried the sausage gravy and cornbread waffle: simply amazing! I highly recommend it, we'll definitely be going back for brunch.
