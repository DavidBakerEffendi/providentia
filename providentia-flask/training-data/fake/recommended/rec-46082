Sigh*  a lot of people found my secret sushi lair... Alas, this hungry beast shall still eat her mighty dragon rolls, beloved oshinko, and other rolls- so i guess you can join her while in feast. (dare you to waldo me, bro) DF (dearest fiancee) and I are always there. LOVE it there. take note, kids: 1. real good sushi has to have rice to soypaper/laver ratio. this place has the perfect ratio. not too much rice... just enough to cover and provide balance for the fish. 2. sauces are on par. 3. some basic sushi rolls are not on the menu for a reason... they are not popular. for example, shrimp tempura. they will make it for you, but will charge you a non 50% off fee. but,  if you are a true sushi lover like me, you would know simple rolls are the best. the crazy, overstuffed big rolls are okay, but you come here for simple sushi/sashimi. 4. there's a reason why the rolls are 50% off.  they are what they specialize in. 5. this is a casual sushi place... not a five star uppity scale restaurant.. so you will sometimes have a hit or miss. 6. you can order online or by phone. i prefer phone.
