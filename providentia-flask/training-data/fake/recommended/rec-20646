Delicioussss chicken and rice!! No joke. You have to try the halaL guys if you happen to be in New York. Try to walk by their food cart and you will die a little inside. The red sauce is soo spicy. Don't attempt to add generously. Both the gyro with rice and chicken with rice were yumyumyum! Ask for sauce on the side.
