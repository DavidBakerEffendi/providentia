We went here last night for my fiancees birthday celebration.  As usual both the food and the service was excellent.  Our table for eight was ready to go right when we walked in the door.   I do have to take a star away from my last review though.  It seems pretty consistent that they are out of many beers on the menu.  I don't think they update it very often.  I ordered three beers and each time the waitress came back and said they did not have that one.  On the fourth try I just went with something that I knew they would have as it had already taken ten minutes to order my first beer. I think they really just need to update the menu more consistently.   Other then the beer issue though everything was amazing.  Definitely try this place out.  It's worth the trip.
