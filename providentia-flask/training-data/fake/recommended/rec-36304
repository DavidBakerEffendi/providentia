My friends took me here for a special birthday dinner and we had a wonderful experience.  Please note, I highly recommend placing a reservation.  Our table was ready and waiting the moment we arrived. Martinis are important in my world and they did not disappoint.  I like mine dirty and appreciate when they have a hint instead of a slap in the face of olive brine. I'd been told that they are known for their raw bar, so we all agreed to share the Le Grand.  This tower of seafood bliss, turned heads and changed my feeling about oysters forever.  Before this experience, I'd always shunned oysters.  Something about the texture.  I decided to try again and discovered the beauty of what I'd been missing out.  I'd never had razor clams either and tried those for the first time.  Wonderful! For dinner, steak au poivre.  Perfect of course.  The side of spinach and frites, equally as dreamy.  My sister had the skate, which she let me sample.  It was a perfect blend of crispy sear, buttery smoothness and flakey scallop-like finish.  I wanted more! However, we moved on to a perfect desert of warm chocolate cake.  They even placed a candle in honor of my birthday, very sweet.  The gesture, that is.  The cake had wonderful restraint.  It wasn't overly chocolate.  Everything about this meal was in balance. Here's what I appreciated most about my time here.  The service.  They never rushed us.  We were allowed to savor each course and enjoy some conversation between, during and after our meal.  The water was always filled and even when one of the martini glasses had a chip in it, they quickly corrected it and gave us one on the house. This place is first class without making you feel uncomfortable.  I would love to come back here someday.
