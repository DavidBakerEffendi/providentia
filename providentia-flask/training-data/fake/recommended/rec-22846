Met a friend here for drinks and light appetizers. The atmosphere is cool and the place has a great vibe. There were quite a few couples seated around us, so this is probably a good date spot. The lychee martinis were amazing and definitely had a decent amount if alcohol for the $6 price. We were pretty buzzed after two. The appetizers we're delicious and well presented. I will definitely try this place again!
