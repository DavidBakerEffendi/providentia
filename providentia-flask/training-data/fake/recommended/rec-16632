Yes, this place is tiny but as one of my fellow table-mates said, "It is sort of like being at a wedding." A wedding with really, really amazing food. We ordered the watermelon feta salad, the skate, lychee martini and a few other things I can't remember. Everything was amazing and unique. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine ran about $150 which I think was extremely reasonable. Next time I'm in New York I'll make a point to go to Graffiti for dinner.
