Holy macaroni and cheese!  They have thee best mac and cheese; so good that I had to say it twice.  It's probably causing a traffic jam in my blood stream as we speak but oh well, there is a price to pay for everything good in life. The meatloaf sandwich was fantastic too.  Put it this way, I forgot what everyone else ordered because I was too busy eating.   Rye is pretty damn cool.  They charged me twice but was quick to correct it.  My lack of love for NY is still very alive but it's getting more tolerable.
