The food was an ATROCITY. I'm baffled how they can really sell this food for consumption. I got Shrimp Egg Foo Young and the patties were burnt and tastless, as well as shrimp fried rice which was yellow. I've been told many low quality places here have yellow rice, and I'm disappointed the gossip was true. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST! #EWWW
