Overpriced, small portions.  If they're charging these prices the rice should be free, they charge $3 per scoop.  Four people need to order 5-6 dishes for lunch plus several orders of rice.  The sticky rice was dry and on the hard side.  The wings were tasty; they were very garlicky sweet.  The flank steak salad was good, but each order lasts about 4-5 bites.
