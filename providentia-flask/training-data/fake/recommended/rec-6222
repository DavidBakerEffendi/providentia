This may have been the best meal I have ever had in my life!  The saganaki was perfect and the dolmades were the best I have ever eaten.  The avgolemono soup just needed an extra splash of lemon but was otherwise delicious.  The staff was polite and attentive and the mood and decor of this place was cozy and inviting.  I will definitely be visiting Pylos again on my next trip to NYC.
