Oddly enough (or not so oddly), I ended up here on a second date...I was warned about a lack of ambiance, but a promise that the food would be delicious.  And delicious it was, although we huddled in the small seating area in our winter coats since it was definitely chilly out.  But the dumplings!  I never knew how much I liked them.  Some soup on the side and we were all warmed up. This place is apparently no secret, but I didn't know any better and thought it was a lucky find.  Will definitely be back!
