Wiz Wit! If I was rating this Pat's vs. Geno's, I couldn't give Pat's enough stars. Don't be fooled by your friends, the lights, or the shortness of the line, you should still go to Pat's. Ok, now that I've got that outta the way, I must say, Pat's can be very hit and miss. Occasionally, especially in winter, you get a cold one, and there is nothing on earth more disappointing. But generally, they are great. If I'm bringing someone into town for a cheesesteak, showing them "Philly", we go to Pat's, the Original, the best. Its not the best around anymore, but you can't say its bad. Cheese fries are a must, as is a Birch Beer. I've never had my meal any other way. The rolls are unparalleled in their softness and taste so no complaints there.
