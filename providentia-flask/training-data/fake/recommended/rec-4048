Bouley is hard for me to rate because I don't get to go to this kind of restaurant very often. I've been to Bouley twice, and each time I had some dish that really made me think, with tremendously concentrated flavors and textures juxtaposed in novel, interesting ways. The comment "portions were far too small" just misses the point. Last time, I ordered squab, which turned out to be deboned pieces of squab, combined with (I recall) foie gras in a kind of sushi roll with savoy cabbage rather than seaweed on the outside. This combination, which was extremely interesting to me texturally and flavor-wise, was simply not something I could have dreamed up on my own, let alone executed. It gave my palate something to think about. Now, there may be other restaurants in New York which top Bouley at this kind of high-end gastronomy. I wouldn't know, because I can't afford to go to them. There are some aspects of the Bouley experience which perplex me. What's up with the bread cart? Sending around a cart with different kinds of bread seems like a gimmick worthy of Olive Garden. The bread really isn't all that good. Also not very good is the little cake they give you as a going away present. A promotion for Bouley bakery, I suppose.
