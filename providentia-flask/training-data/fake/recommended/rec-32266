In my opinion this is the best Jamaican food in the city! The portions are big and the food is just full of flavor. I use to go here everyday when I went to CCP, it was definitely the best part of my school days =) The Jerk Chicken is good but the OX Tail is just mouth watering; the meat is cook until it's so tender that it just falls off of the bone. Oh another thing I would like to add, with each platter you get a choice of a side dish ex: mac n cheese, cabbage etc. My favorite use to be the sweet corns but they stopped offering it many years ago. Definitely would be a big plus if they would add that back on the menu!!! But my second choice is always the side dish of steamed cabbage. I highly recommend this place to everyone who loves flavor and Caribbean food.
