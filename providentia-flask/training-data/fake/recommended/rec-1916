We made a special detour to Geno's based on it's online reputation...and what a disappointment!  You know something's up when the person who greets you at the window is rude with a negative attitude!   But, we overlooked that, afterall...that guy may just be having a bad day. But then the sandwich was passed to us.  The steak was DRY, and tasted like a flavorless roast beef sandwich.  There was nothing on the sandwich expect cheese melted into the bread (i.e. so you can barely taste it, and the meat remained dry), and a few onions.  We had to add tons of relish, ketchup and mustard just to choke down this dry sandwich.   What a disappointment!   Genos is a place that is riding on the coat-tails of a past good reputation (probably when there was less competition, or when their was less arrogance and better service/food being served!)  Total waste of time...and wish we would have gone across the street to the other cheese steak place instead!
