The pizza was OK not great, ordered the Hawaiian pizza and had them add BBQ. They didn't add enough BBQ to the pizza was kinda bland the crust was fine. Also ordered a 420 brownie, it was good and large. No special ingredient though. Ordered over the phone, repeated order about 5 times. She admitted she was a dumb blond, it was fine she was funny. Food came quickly and I was happy with the order.
