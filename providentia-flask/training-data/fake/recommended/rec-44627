i come here often for drinks with my friends but i just recently discovered that they have a full dinner menu. well i tried the short ribs and my friend had the salmon with cauliflower. WOW!! we loved it!! it was on small plates but really filling and so so good. my friend loved her salmon with the cauliflower and the ribs were just so tender. Finally we found a new dinner spot!!! Will return for sure! ps- the drinks are awesome too
