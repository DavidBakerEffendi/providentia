This place is definitely historic and has quite the feel to it. I would say, you have to either go to Pats and/or Genos on your Philly trip just to experience it. The steak was good, not great, but good. I got the extra cheese with whiz and provolone. I would recommend it. The service is spotty at best, but what do you expect... A little bit sketchy of an area, but worth the cab ride over.
