The best pizza in Center City. As close to Jersey-style pizza as you're going to find in this town. The crust is a medium thickness, the sauce is good, and the cheese isn't overpowering. The BBQ chicken and bacon/onion/ranch slices are incredible. They are a bit on the pricey side - $2.43 for a plain slice and $12 for a small pie. If a good bagel place were to open up next to Little Italy (ha, good bagels in Philadelphia... I crack myself up), I'd have a reason to move to this side of town.
