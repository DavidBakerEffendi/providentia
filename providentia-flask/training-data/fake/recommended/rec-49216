What a great find on a rainy weekend day nestled in the West Village where Le Gamin used to be long ago on Waverly Pl b/w 6th and 7th. Snuggled up to the Chef's table -- right in the kitchen, toasty warm. The brunch menu is fun, egg sandwiches, steak and eggs, turkey pesto sandwich. Everything is beautifully presented and tasty. Staff is friendly and cool.
