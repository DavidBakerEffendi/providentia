I'm not exactly sure why this place is so highly rated. The spicy pork meatballs were mediocre at best.  A little salty but I like my food bland so I may not be the best judge of saltiness.  I had a side of spaghetti which was fine as well.  The cookie ice-cream sandwich was great (who doesn't like cookies plus ice-cream?).   We were told the wait would be close to an hour on a Sunday night but it ended up being less than 30 minutes.  They have a great system where you can see the status of your wait time online while you grab a drink elsewhere.  Check out Hair of the Dog across the street for half off beers all day Sunday. Would I recommend this place? Sure.  Go check it out and see if the place is worth the hype.  The food wasn't disgusting, just don't expect life changing meatballs here.
