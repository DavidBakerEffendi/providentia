I love Julianna's! IN RESTAURANT: The first time I went here, it was really good! It was about a week after opening. However, I couldn't really enjoy my pizza because my cousin was having a party there, a bit hectic! REST OF VISITS: absolutely amazing! I finally got to enjoy my pizza. Really fresh, and yummy! DELIVERY/TAKEOUT: When I heard they did delivery, Monday thru Thursday, I took advantage of it! The pizza tasted just like I was in the restaurant. PROS: -fresh ingredients - delicious pizza - nice selection on menu -great service - Seated quick CONS: - a little pricy, but it's worth it ;) I still go every 2 or 3 weeks Overall: I'd rather go to Julianna's than having to wait for hours at grimaldi's *most of the time patsy Grimaldi himself is there! *this is the original spot! *the delivery is really fast: 10-15 mins
