The food was just delicious! I had egg Benedict with smoked salmon. The hostess  was very nice. There was a 45 min wait so I went to Coca bar down the street for coffee. Now, you may wonder why 3 stars. Well I hate to be forced to pay 15%  graduituty when the waitress is borderline rude! No smile, barely heard her voice, talked and then disappeared..  Then threw  the money on the table mumbled something and gone! Was shocked!
