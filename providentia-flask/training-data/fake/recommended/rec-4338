i've died and gone to crepe heaven. Â  this little food truck has managed to wedge its way into my heart. i just started at temple, and i've been dying to find good food thats not a chain restuarant or a 7-eleven. and now i've found this beautiful little gem. so many different kinds (i got nutella and banana of course). nice guys who work the truck. a bit of a wait (because it's so WORTH it). reasonable price. they have a deal where if you get a crepe and a drink, its cheaper. like an extra $1 or something. i'd take advantage of that. lord, all i know is after eating that crepe, i was smiling from ear to ear. i've found my new weakness.
