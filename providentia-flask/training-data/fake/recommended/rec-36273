If I lived closer to the LES, you bet your ass this would be my favorite spot to grab a bite to eat and enjoy a few drinks. I love the decor, ambience, everything about this place. I love that you walk into a bar/restaurant and beyond the corner is a whole other bar thats even cozier! Not a huge fan of the dead animals hanging all over the place, but the lighting, furniture and music easily make you feel relaxed. If you're going for just drinks make sure to try the French 75, it's a glorified liquored up lemonade, and if you're in the mood for food, they have great cheese plates, and the devils on horseback are a must have! PS- Â I think the bartender in the back looks like Johnny Depp!
