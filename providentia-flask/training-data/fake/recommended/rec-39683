Awesome Mexican food and atmosphere with Day of the Dead paintings along the windows and wooden tables. Unlimited seasoned chips with roasted pico de gallo and green salsa for $1/person fills you up. The burritos are huge, so come hungry, or split with a friend: $8 burritos. About a $15 dollar dinner that will leave you full. They also have a selection of margaritas and wines.
