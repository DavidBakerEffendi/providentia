Food isn't bad, but this place is an unorganized mess. On several occasions I've come in & they are out of menu items I wanted to order. Tonight they were also out of clean silverware.  You can't a  restaurant without clean forks (especially 6-7pm).   They help is eating on the floor in between bring out orders.  Incredibly unprofessional and poorly run.  Lots of other choices in area, no need to return for bad service & limited choices.
