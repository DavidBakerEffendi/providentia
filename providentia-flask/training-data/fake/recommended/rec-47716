We stopped here for dinner during a road trip we took over the weekend.  My fiancé graduated from Yale a few years earlier and remembered good things about this place. My how things have changed. We arrived at 9pm sharp for our 9pm reservation only to be told that we had to wait for someone to leave.  Okay, no biggie I guess.  "Do you have an ETA on when we can get a table?" I ask to which the server replies "Uhhh no. No I don't know." and just walks off.  I thought that was VERY strange. We ended up getting seated at the sushi bar (not even a table for our reservation?) after 15 minutes of awkwardly standing at the front door.  There's no waiting area. Upon being seated, two other couples were also seated to either side of us.  Our server did not arrive until about 10 minutes later.  Okay we finally get to talk to a server at 9:25 at the sushi bar for our 9pm reservation.  We had plenty of time to look over the long, overly complex, freaking novel-of-a-menu and just gave him our order.   Then he disappears.  9:45 rolls by and meanwhile the two couples around us had just started on, I kid you not, their third course of food.  It was like torture.  So we got up and left and ate left over pizza instead. Heard they have great food.  Good luck getting it served to you.
