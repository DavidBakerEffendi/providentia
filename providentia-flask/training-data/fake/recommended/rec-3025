Came here for a show last fall.  The atmosphere was great and relaxing.  The upstairs floor where the show was had this small square room with a tall ceiling with another level for viewing the performing artist/band.  They had some good beers on tap too.  My favorite part of this venue is the size since it's not huge, it gives you a better experience and more intimate show.  Definitely had a great time and look forward to coming back.
