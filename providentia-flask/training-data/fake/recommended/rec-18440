There's a reason why this place is crowded 24*7. It's super-cheap, addictive cart food. What to get here? Lamb over rice or chicken/lamb combo over rice. Slather it with white and  then hot sauce. Go easy on the hot sauce though, it's fiery hot. Don't fret it if you think you've not added enough. They place extra bottles on the side of the cart for you to pick up and squirt to your heart's content. For vegetarians, there's falafel over rice, but that's rather disappointing. There are much better falafel places in town. Other Tips: - If you've been here once and want to escape the crowd, these same guys have a cart on 53rd and 7th which has almost no crowd at all. It's the exact same food, but not many know of it. If it's your first time and you want to experience the craze, not minding the wait, go to their flagship spot on 53rd and 6th. - There are 2 carts on either side of 6th Av, 53rd st. The one on east side of the avenue is for to-go and is usually faster than the have-here cart on the west side of the road. - The portion size is huge, so if it's 2 of you, consider sharing. I wouldn't suggest saving the left overs for next day. Covering all the positives, I should remind you it's cart food after all. So yeah, unhealthy.  Nevertheless, a "Sinful delight" is how I'd tag this food and come here once in a while giving in to my temptation!
