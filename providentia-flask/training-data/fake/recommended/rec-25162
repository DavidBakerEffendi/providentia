This is a nice cozy little place for brunch. The environment can be noisy and truth be told, touristy. However, the prices are good for the area and the available options. The food is good but not fantastic or imaginative. On the day I visited (only once), service was slow, although I was given unlimited coffee. Nice spot for inexpensive SoHo brunch/breakfast.
