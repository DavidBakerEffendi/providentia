Moved away from philadelphia 4 years ago, but recently on an east coast tour came back to fat salmon (previously known as Shinju) because this is hands-down our favorite sushi place ever. This is coming from someone who lives in LA two miles away from Little Tokyo. This place is a cannot-miss for anyone living in Philly. It's BYOB. Very reasonably priced. And their spicy tuna with crunch and fancy salmon roll.. there is nothing to compare to that. The old shinju was really romantic for a date-night. The new fat salmon is a little bit more modern appearing, but also seems well-lit.
