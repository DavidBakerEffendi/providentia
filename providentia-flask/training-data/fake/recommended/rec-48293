Nice atmosphere, good service. I was very excited to go to this place but i was very dissatisfied with my food. I ordered the spaetzle and it tasted so bland. I kept on adding salt so i could taste something but it didn't really help. I can't speak as to the other dishes but I was so unimpressed that I left with no desire to come back and try them.
