Walking down the street on a Friday afternoon and saw what appeared to be a former church turned bar, I had to take a closer look. Early afternoon spared us from any kind of crowd. My friend and I sat at the bar, where a friendly and knowledgeable barman chatted with us about the different beer offerings and poured enough unsolicited samples that we didn't really need to order anything (but that would have been a dick move). The music was good, the beer selection respectable, and the staff friendly and knowledgeable as previously mentioned. I dig the place.
