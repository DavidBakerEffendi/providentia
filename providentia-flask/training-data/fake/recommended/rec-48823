What a gem! Absolutely enchanting decor, high-quality food and great service. This is the best Thai food I've had in Manhattan by far. So many Thai restaurants use too much sugar in their pad thai, but Up Thai's is perfectly seasoned. There are several Thai restaurants closer to my apartment, but Up Thai is definitely the type of place I'd go out of my way for. Overall a truly lovely dining experience!
