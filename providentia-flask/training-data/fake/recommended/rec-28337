Went to this new neighbor spot for brunch one morning with my wife. The decor inside is very nice and comfortable (great design). The staff is friendly as well. Â Awesome beer selection. The food on the other hand, could use some improvement. I ordered the chilaquiles and they were very average. The chips were soggy from the sauce. My wife order the omelette and it cost $15 or $16. That was just the omelette only.... No toast or potatoes were included. And it was very average. Maybe there was some confusion with the pricing, but the menu should be transparent. They did have $4 unlimited bloody Mary's, which were pretty good. A little weak, but expected for those types of deals. I'll come back and give it another shot.... or maybe just drink at the bar.... until then I consider it average.
