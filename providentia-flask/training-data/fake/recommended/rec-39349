You're going to wait well over an hour to be seated. The rude waiters will treat you like an unwelcome guest. You'll wait well over an hour for your food. You will be served your food in no particular order. People who clearly came in after you will get their food way before you. This will happen a lot. If you complain, it will just piss off your waiter and it'll take longer to get your food. When your food finally comes, you won't even care how it tastes because it's like 8pm now and you've waited more than 2 hours for pizza while everyone around you has eaten and left. And it's not really that good.
