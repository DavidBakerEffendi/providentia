DELICIOUS, fresh, imaginative dishes.  I had chicken curry egg noodles with crispy noodles on top - a perfectly layered meal.  This dish gets it's power from the pairing of opposite: soft soupy + crispy salty, sweet curry + salty pickles.  The papaya salad appetizer had a zing.   1 appetizer + dish = meal + leftovers for lunch. Service is friendly and attentive.
