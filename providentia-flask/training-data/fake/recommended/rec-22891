Loved this place!  Great pre-show location and delicious and affordable food. We were allset to splurge on $10 cocktails and the waiter showed us the $6. happy hour cocktails so that was a bonus. The spring rolls were yummy but how do you mess up fried food?  Our dinners were perfectly seasoned and generous.  I got Pad Hau Neung Kai and the kaffir lime flavor was DIVINE!!
