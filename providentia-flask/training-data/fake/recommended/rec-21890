Ok, so the only reason why this isn't getting five stars is because truthfully, I do not know bahn mi. I had my first one EVER at Num Pang. Was it incredible? I'll give that a resounding yes! Pulled pork with spiced honey served with pickled carrots, cucumber, cilantro, and some saucy goodness with a kick. Was it authentic? I'm thinking no, considering there's pork belly with poached pear on the menu. Maybe not authentic, but man, it's tasty.
