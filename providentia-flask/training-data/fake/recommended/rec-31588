I came here one time before with some friends since I've been hearing so many great reviews about this place and actually had a great time.  However, after bringing my entire family here for Fathers day, I was absolutely disappointed... The staff was ok in the beginning, but as soon as you let them know you were not satisfied with your meal for some reason, they make you feel as if its your fault or an idiot that you ordered that particular dish (and that was from the maitre'd...)...I was shocked how she handled this...and even better, she had her chef come out to give an explanation about the dish to make you feel more like an idiot for complaining! And talked down as if I've NEVER eaten thai food before (btw, I am asian and can pass for a Thai) I would have given 2 or 3 stars, but after that whole situation, they didn't even do anything to alleviate our disappointed (maybe take it off the bill, or complimentary dessert , nothing!)  Honestly, I hate to write a bad review about a restaurant especially since I am a chef at one and want small restaurant businesses to do well, however, after such treatment I'm disappointed ...  Will most likely never set foot in this place, sorry I've had better.
