Danny Meyer's attempt at an Italian eatery is a winner. The ambiance is warm and inviting (like every Danny Meyer establishment) and the service is stellar. Breakfast is perfect and light and lunch and dinner are home runs. Words cannot express how amazing the suckling pig is and if you are not in the mood for that much meat, the pastas are very reliable too. I come here on my lunch breaks for a nice plate of carciofini (fried artichokes) and a nice cappuccino. It can get pricey, but one leaves feeling happy and full. Thanks again, Danny Meyer!
