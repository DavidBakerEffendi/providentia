went here recently for the first time and it was delicious! the waitress was really nice and attentive. We did get there on time though, since this is a popular place i recommend u plan your trip wisely and check their opening hours before going, my friend and i got there at opening time and were first in line, but im sure if we went on any other random time we would have had to wait for a seat. We got the banana pancakes and they were scrumptious! the maple butter was the secret! bacon was yum too. biscuits and butter was complimentary. the horchata drink was okay was not blown away i think its worth $2 not $6. but everything else was spectacular. the waitress was kind and gave us extra goodies too! so sweet of her! i will definitely come back on an empty stomach to fill it up again :) i love how this place was featured on the cooking channel! definitely worth the hype! for those complaining about the service and wait time, i think its unfair to give the place low ratings, u should rate it on food instead, cause this place is a small bakery started out as a small business, but grew to popularity and they try to serve as many people as they can! its not their fault. u just have to find a good time to go.
