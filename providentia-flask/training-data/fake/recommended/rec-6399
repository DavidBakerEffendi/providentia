I went to Kefi as a suggestion from a friend and was really impressed by the food, wonderful service, and open atmosphere. The place is a lot larger than it looks from the outside, much to my delight, and we were seated immediately downstairs. I ordered the flat pasta with rabbit and graviera cheese and the octopus appetizer. So. Good. The octopus was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Meaty and with a wonderful texture, it is now permanently affixed in the cravings portion of my brain. It was my first time trying rabbit and I was delightfully surprised. Not too gamey and you could tell it was stewed into the sauce for a long time to meld all the flavor together. The sauce had many interesting notes, both tangy and rich at the same time. Being a carb whore, i have to note the pasta as well. Perfectly al dente and I'm pretty sure freshly rolled. Definitely one of my new favorites around my block!
