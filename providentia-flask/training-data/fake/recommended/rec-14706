When Yelp strikes back.! Seriously, is everyone taking crazy pills?!  Act like you've been to a halal cart before.  More power to the guys running the stand and cashing in people's pack-mentality.  But c'mon.  Quantity wise the value is decent, but the quality is sacrificed by cooking huge trays of boiled chicken to feed the steady stream of sheep.  Pretty much any halal cart that cooks in smaller portions will be much tastier and fresher, as well as better seasoned.   Try the halal guy at the corner of 4th St and 6th ave for instance, or better yet try the halal guy at 4th st and broadway (I don't want to be waiting in any ridiculous and unnecessary lines for my corner halal cart). Me thinks that this may have become such a cult phenomenon because it only operates late-night and 80% of people eating this are faded and super-agreeable with anything involving calories.  Lastly, why would anyone want to go to Mid-town to drink anyways?  I think that out-of-towners unfamiliar with your average halal cart also likely played a role in the legend of this "random and amazing" food cart.
