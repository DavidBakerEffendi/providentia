Just had a great birthday dinner at Open Door.  We also, had a great time back in May when we celebrated my husbands birthday there is 14 people.  Nick, the owner, is wonderful.  He really makes sure everyone in your group gets what they need and has a great time.   The food is tapas style but with a twist.  Everything I have tried has been amazing.  I especially LOVE the polenta and the chicken bites.  4-5 plates shared between two people works perfect.  The music is always great here if that is important to you. Definitely a great addition to LIC and worth checking out for dinner or with a large group!
