We've been there many times. We love the food, until last night have always been happy with the service. We paid the bill with cash and left a 20% tip. As we were walking to the car our waitress walked out on the street and accused us of not paying our bill! My wife followed the waitress in. It turned out another server had cleared our table, took the money and placed it by the bar. We were embarrassed. The scene took place in front of other people leaving at the same time. I can't imagine too many people dine-n-dash the place. Maybe the owners should have a policy in place not to chase their customers into the street, just in case they actually paid. The L'amante security guard server didn't bother to apologize. We did speak to the owner the next day and he couldn't have cared less. We won't be back.
