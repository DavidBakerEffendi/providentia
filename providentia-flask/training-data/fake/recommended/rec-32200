The service wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad. Just not very welcoming or friendly and I felt hurried despite them being pretty empty. BUT the food was amaaaaaaazing...hence the 5 stars. I got the truffle burger (medium) with bacon and a fried egg with fries and some delicious sauce. Really just too good for words. It was a lot to finish but I didn't let that stop me. I'm looking forward to coming back to Philly just for this burger. Under $20 for the meal including a bottled soda. ***Update*** Being the glutton that I am, I went back the next day (today) and had a far different experience. The service was about the same but this time my order was messed up because of waitress error and the food didn't taste the same at all. Except the fries. Those were perfect again. In any case I'm not nearly as happy about the food this time around as I was before. Wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
