I came to Market Table a few weeks ago with a friend. We had a reservation and were seated right away near the back of the restaurant. The space is large and at times loud, but the dimly lit ambiance is perfect for a Saturday night with girlfriends or double date. However, I wouldn't go here if you want to spend a quiet, romantic evening with a significant other. For food, I had the swordfish, which was perfectly cooked and excellent. I also had the side of brussels sprouts, which were as good, if not better than Alta's (gasp!). Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. Although I thought it was a little expensive, the quality and ambiance make it worth a second visit. I will definitely be back!
