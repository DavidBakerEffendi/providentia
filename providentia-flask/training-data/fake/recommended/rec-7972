Went here for a romantic date with my boyfriend. "The burp I just burped tasted like the mussel broth and it tasted good. My burp tasted good," I purred to him, romantically. The mussels were also good for regular eating. So was the duck sausage! Good job, chefs! 1 star off for not giving me all the food I wanted at no charge. I hate when restaurants don't just give me things for free.
