We had a great time, the atmosphere is special but not stuffy. The staff is friendly. We were seated right when we arrived after making our reservation just a few hours earlier. We had the tempura green beans as an appetizer and they were so much fun to eat, and they were delicious, I couldn't get over how much I loved them. The olive oil they serve to dip bread in is amazing. The entrees were tasty. Dessert looked tempting but we were stuffed. Second visit: First night back in NYC and I wanted to treat my friend to dinner since he brought me with him on his trip. So I went back to this favorite of mine. We had the green beans and I still love them just as much. Their Manhattan was fantastic and strong. What a great return to the city.
