I don't know what I loved the most!! The food or the decor or the staff .The place is pretty neat with little things to amaze you.I just love the retro themed cash register at the bar,the wallpaper,the plates(which are hand painted) :D,the statue of Buddha at the entrance with the retro telephone and so much more.Staffs are super friendly which makes you really comfy and the food,oh the food!!! Been there 3 times for dinner and the best combination was starting with beet orange(must have for salad lover),having special lamb(which is absolutely stunning) as a main And finishing off with the rich chocolate pudding. :') In total,a great place to visit with family,friends and obviously with a date :)
