We came here after a day of touring NJ with four tweens and three adults.  We waited for 10 minutes to meet our waitress, she disappeared without taking our order or bringing bread or water or anything.  The bar tender and host were chatting ten feet away from us and staring.  I finally got up after 10 more minutes and asked if they could take our order and he ( the host) said a waitress would be out shortly and continued his chat.  She finally took our drink and food order.  She was obviously overwhelmed and the only one working.  The food came fairly quickly and was okay- just standard.  We will find somewhere else to eat next time we are in Princeton.
