I came here on a Sunday night with a group of 11 friends. Let me just start off by saying that the waitress was not nice to us from the start. We had a few waitresses come by and take our orders separately and still didn't get out food in time. There was a hair in my friends spinach dish and they did not even take it off our bill. My friend ordered moscato wine and they gave him two sips for 20 dollars!!! The food was great but If it wasn't for the bus boys, we wouldn't have had anything tonight.
