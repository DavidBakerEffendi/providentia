I almost once fought a friend for a turnip here. We ordered the turnip greens as a side and they were so heavenly that we ate them with a focus that I hadn't had in a while. When the last green had been pierced by my friends fork (took a lot out of me to let her have it), a turnip was revealed to be hiding underneath it. I literally squealed (joyfully) at the sight of it. I don't squeal. But the surprise of the squeal bought me just enough time to swoop in and snag the crispy on the outside, yet so succulent on the inside turnip chunk. We also ordered the burger. It was incredible. The cheese was so perfectly salty and the meat full of flavor and the perfect amount of juicy. It comes with Â mound of crispy potato sting fries. It baffles me how you are supposed to eat them politely. I tend to start off jabbing at the mound with my fork, but after the first bite, I throw my pompous manners out the window and shovel them into my mouth with my bare hands. It's my go to place when i want a delicious, inspiring, palate pleasing meal. Oh, and I ran into the guy from U2 here. The one that wears the cap. A burger will set you back about $16 or $18 and I think sides are $6. Not certain. go with the knowledge that you will spend a little money, but it will be MORE than worth it.
