Great spot for brunch. I have been here twice now. I have had the pankcakes and the french toast. They were both delicious. The perfect compliment are the mimosas. The decor is very sleek and everyone there is very personable. It is very busy for dinner too but I have yet to go here for dinner. Brunch is only on Sundays. There is parking in the back as street parking can sometimes be tough to get. My favorite place to sit here is close to the huge windows in the front. The prices are also pretty reasonable.
