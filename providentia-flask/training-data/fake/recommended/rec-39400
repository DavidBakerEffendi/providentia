Came here on a Thursday afternoon, plenty of open seats. Laid back, European feel, friendly staff. Ordered an Americano and the hummus and falafel platter with a side salad. Absolutely delicious! Hummus serving on the smaller side. Will definitely be back to try some brunch-- and I know there will be a line..
