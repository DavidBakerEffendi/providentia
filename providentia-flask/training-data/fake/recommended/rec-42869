A great little Italian spot in a touristy area. The wine list was long, but filled with a lot of affordable options,which I always appreciate immensely. Â Started off with the calamari and caprese. This was one of the standout caprese salads I've ever had. The mozzarella was seriously fresh, like straight from the farm. The pasta was very fresh and tasty. I love that feeling where you're at a restaurant and you don't feel rushed, even as you can see the place starting to empty out. We ended the meal with some limoncello, the perfect palate cleanser to an amazing meal.
