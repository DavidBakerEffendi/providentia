A place I wished we had skipped. Apart from a promising start with some nice olives, things soon went downhill with a mushy and uninspired stuffed artichoke. An unfortunate, heaping mess of an idea. The pizza that followed was another misfire. Just simply not a good pie, although the crust had some promise. M's ricotta shells were a couple notches above the frozen, store-bought variety, but not by much. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Dishes: Olives (Good) Stuffed Artichoke (Lousy) Potato, Scallion and Proscuitto Pizza (Missed the mark) Ricotta Shells (Average)
