One of the real Philly sandwiches (ie. Cheesesteak, roast pork).  Don't mess around, just get the namesake sandwich.  Insane.  Make sure to get the potatoes and a Hank's to wash it down.  You'll be set for most of day.  Bring cash!  I think they might Venmo? If you really need to change it up, the Gustaio is the next best thing, followed by the Diavlo.  One day I'll go to the S. Philly location so I can try the Liveracce sandwich that they don't offer at the Girard location.  In addition, if you are looking for a cheesesteak, you will not find it here unless they have a cheesesteak as a daily special...which is pretty damn good, but you're at Paesanos.  Just get the Paesano.
