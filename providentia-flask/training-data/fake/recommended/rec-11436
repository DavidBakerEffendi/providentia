Yup, some things are good, some things are not-so-good. The chile relleno was delish, the jalapeno macaroni and cheese was decent, but the dessert thing (sopapilla? churro thing?) was hard and gross.   You can get the same margarita special (half off pitchers from 11-1) down the street at dos segundos.  But I do have a soft spot in my heart for that waiter with the huge moustache....He's adorable, he's attentive, and he's ALWAYS there.
