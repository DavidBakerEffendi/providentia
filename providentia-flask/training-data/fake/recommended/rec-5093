Came here desperately searchin 4 a good panino in the area. Wooow, this place cracks!! Let's start from the location. This place is sooo warm, and I love the massive use of light wood they did. It reminds me a real Italian PANINERIA where you can go with your friends, eat an amazing panino, drink some good wine and be ready for the rest of the day. I even love the 60/70es posters on the wall, a touch of vintage taste. 2 young and friendly guys and a beautiful girl will welcome you to this place. The PANINI! Omg guys! Once you eat one you wanna try all of them! A selection of cured meats and cheeses to make of a PANINO an experience, a flavour trip to Italy. I had 2 amazing PANINOS. One with sweet Prosciutto di Parma, olive oil and Taleggio cheese that I suggest, and the other one with Imported Tuna in olive oil, fresh cherry tomatoes amazing home made pesto and some oregano, and this one I suggest right after the first one, just to make sure you have enough strenght to enjoy the city and your day. Then Italian beer, Italian wine and Italian soda will hold your thirst down. This place is a good destination for a warm sweet breakfast, a lunch, a break or whetever hunger feeling you might have! 10$, yes you read it well, just 10$ for a big baguette PANINO and a drink, perfect deal! LA PANINERIA my future " carbs" destination
