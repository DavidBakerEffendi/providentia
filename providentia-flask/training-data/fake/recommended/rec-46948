Had an 8pm reservation and the restaurant was put in the terrible situation of a party just sitting without ordering anything after paying their check for about 45 minutes.  No other table was open and we were supposed to sit at that table.  At 8:25, the hostess finally said something to the people just sitting.  They didn't get up immediately, but after about another 10 minutes, they left.   Because of that, they brought their lobster triangles out immediately for us (on the house).  After learning that my girlfriend doesn't eat shellfish, they brought out the Market Salad (also on the house), which was delicious.  The table of 4 ordered 2 apps and 2 pastas to share.  I had the whole grilled artichoke and a few bites of the trio bruschetta.  The artichoke was cooked perfectly and the white sauce that accompanied it was a great pairing.  The bruschetta trio included mushroom, english pea, and butternut squash.  They were all decent, but I definitely prefer the original.   As for the pasta, my gf and I shared the Beet Agnolotti, which was delicious.  Even though there was no meat, the entire dish looked like it.  The thinly sliced beets looked like a dark salami, and the agnolotti looked like rare meat with fat on the sides.  Not sure if that's what they were going for, but it was still delicious.   For dinner, I had the short rib ragu.  It was chalk full of gnocci and short ribs.  Soooo good.   All-in-all, I would definitely go back and hopefully next time we don't have to wait so long to sit (especially since it's a small restaurant with no place to stand inside on a cold rainy night).  I live for good authentic Italian food, and Mercato is definitely that.
