If you like pancakes, French toast, or waffles, this is the place.  About a dozen different varieties, all of them yummy.  Also good are the fries with the spicy mayo, and of course the Cherry Lime Ricky.  Arrive before 10 or after 2:30 on weekends if you want to avoid a line (of course, they have chairs and free food for people waiting in line, so it's not the worst experience).  Probably the most diverse clientele of any place in the neighborhood--everyone eats at Toms's. Lunch there is good too, but it's not in the same league as the breakfast offerings.
