I wish I could give Zinna's five stars, but I'm afraid that would be misleading because I didn't actually taste the food. Zinna's was such a huge help this week: my 80+ yr old grandparents were homebound and without power as a result of Hurricane Sandy. I was SO relieved to discover that Zinna's was open and could deliver to their community. They loved the pizza and the chicken soup and the cheesecake. Thank you Zinna's!!
