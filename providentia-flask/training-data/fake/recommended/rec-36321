Had the opportunity to visit Cheryl's Global on a quiet Friday morning. I arrived around 10am and the place was quite empty. The atmosphere is cozy/intimate - although the tables are a bit to close to each other for me. My girlfriend had the pancakes, scrambled eggs and chicken sausage. She had no complaints with the food although didn't praise it either, i settled for just a cup of coffee - no complaints with that either. The staff were moderately friendly/attentive but i can DEFINITELY foresee them being rude and much less attentive during busier hours! Didn't cross paths with Cheryl The Global Bitch - as another yelp-er referred to her. But If I do make her acquaintance hopefully it will be a pleasant experience. What I get from most reviews on this place is - long wait, rude staff/owner, great food. To that I say she should hire someone great with customer service, let that person train the staff to deal with customers while she cooks, sit back and count her dough or whatever it is she does. Some people are just not blessed with the know how to make people feel at home in their place of business. Why chase customers out the door? These are the people who pay your bills! Things may seem good now because you have lines of customers out the door, but piss the wrong or Right customer off for that matter and they might have the power to turn your whole business upside down. Life is strange that way- so think about that! Coffee was good and strong, I will be back to try the food one day.....
