This is my all-time favorite place to have tea, sit with friends, and do work. I absolutely love this establishment and it is near and dear to my heart. The people that work at Chhaya are always friendly and welcoming. The London Fog is one of the most comforting beverages that I have had in the city. I would rather bike 15 minutes in the rain to Chhaya than settle for one of the many coffee shops that Rittenhouse has to offer.
