Nothing to rave about here nor recommend.. We stopped in for a little drink and food prior to boarding our flight but were only met with mediocrity at this joint. The menu sounded good enough to satisfy and was one of the only places with decent food and drink at the same spot. We ordered the Lobster BLT and the shrimp po'boy. Nothing to rave about here nor recommend.
