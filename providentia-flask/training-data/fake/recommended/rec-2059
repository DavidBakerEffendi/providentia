First off, this isn't a review that compares Shake Shack to Five Guys, In-n-Out or the like. I'm not even going to compare it to the locations in NYC! This review is all about the Philly location and nothing more. I went around the time that this Shake Shack opened and I must have gotten lucky. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in line, so it wasn't nearly as bad as others have been reporting. Maybe certain times of the day are better/worse? Seating was a little crazy here, but it wasn't impossible to find a place to sit (a group left a booth while i started to find a place for my friend and I to sit). The food was great! My Shack Burger was delicious and my cheese fries were soooo good. (The fries probably could've been a bit fresher, but overall they were still good.) In all, it was definitely a 4 star experience. If I were in the city, I'd stop by again!
