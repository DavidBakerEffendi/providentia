My favorite night time place to be, I've seen Omarion, Nene Leakes and Mariah Carey here. Its so 90210 but NYC. Im sure there are several models who eat here but i have never been disappointed with the crowd. The waiters are cool and the food is amazing. Mac and cheese and a Cafeteria Burger is what i order. The fries are to die for.
