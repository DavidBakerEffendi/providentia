I was brought to Tinto while traveling on business.  The atmosphere is very minimlistic and sophisticated, and the wine list is extensive.  We ordered the full 5 course Chef's tasting menu, which was delicious, although I really can't tell you what I had because each course had so many different components.  I only have 2 bad things to say about this restaurant.  The first is that the food runners who brought each course would basically mumble what was on the plate very quickly and walk away.  Like I said, there were so many different components on each plate that we really wish they had been clearer about what we were eating.  The second is that we had 2 cooked meat items, a lamb skewer and sliced sirloin.  Both items were extremely salty for my taste.  Overall, this was an amazing dining experience and I would recommend it to anyone.
