What hasn't been said about this cart.  We dragged all 3 of kids (9, 7, &  under 1) close to midnight to get to experience this goodness.  I had made a copycat recipe but wanted to try the real deal chicken and rice.  We also tried the chicken, lamb, & rice.  We asked for extra sauce and they dumped a bunch in our bag with a "sure!"  The hot sauce was indeed hot...like burn the internal lining of your stomach off...but well worth it and so good. I'm glad I read previous reviews warning us of the spice levels. Definitely worth it to say we tried it.
