I love Pat's but the only reason I gave it 3 stars is that the staff are complete low lifes.  They are so rude,  There is one woman working at the soda/fry counter who is really dirty looking and so ignorant.  She was yelling at an asian guy because she was having trouble understanding him. I was standing right next to him and understood him just fine.  Again, I like the steaks, but I think most of the people who work here are on a prison release program.
