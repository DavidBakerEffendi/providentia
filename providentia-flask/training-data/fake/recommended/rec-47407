Alright, they make some really amazing fried chicken. However, the back dining room was playing mid 90's commercial country music. Ok, not that big of a deal, but come on. The mashed potatoes are nothing special, pretty bland if you ask me and gravy is $1 more, but well worth it as their gravy is bangin'. The mac'n cheese is fine, but I would rather go with something else here. The coffee was great! A lot better than some of the more expensive coffee houses around the corner, but I'm not going here for coffee. Service was kinda like the service you would expect from a busy diner, which for the prices here, I'd expect it to be a little better, at least ask me if I'm enjoying my meal or if we need anything else. I don't want to have to shout over achy breaky heart blaring in the background. Ok, then, there was dessert. Deep fried apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. Ice cream was good as was the pie, but it is more like a turnover and I had expected better. I will go for a more traditional pie next time. Great chicken. Worth it for that reason alone.
