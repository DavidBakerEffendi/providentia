Frankford hall gets a mixed review for me. If you have ever been to Germany, you will find the atmosphere of Frankford Hall very similar to an outdoor beer garden. However, the food does not consistently meet expectations of real German food. For example, every time I go, which is probably once a month, the spaetzle recipe changes. It doesn't really taste like spaetzle you would get in Germany or at another German restaurant. It tastes more like mac and cheese or pasta. I ordered a Bratwurst and spaetzle, and asked for a little more spaetzle instead of cabbage. The meal came out with spaetzle in a dish, which was really good but again more like mac and cheese. The extra that I asked for was next to the Bratwurst, but was somehow fried with no sauce.  It tasted strange and perplexed us as to why they wouldn't just add more of the real thing.  The potato salad is good, but again not exactly what it tastes like in Germany - it has more of the American flare going on. The seating is great for groups of people.  In the winter they have a large fire pit that you can sit around and cook smores.  There is also ping pong and jenga games that you can take to your table. In terms of cost, Frankford Hall is on the more expensive side.  For two people, you can expect to spend at least $60 and up on food and drinks for dinner.  Being a Steven Starr restaurant, the drinks are on the pricy side, about $10 for a cosmo or wine, and $6 or $7 for a half liter of beer. Its a fun place to go, and the drinks are good, but the food is so so and not always up to par.  If you want to go and hang out with a group of friends, I would definitely recommend Frankford Hall.  If you are looking for the authentic German food experience, I would recommend other local German restaurants.
