Finally a tapas restaurant that has a trendy feel, reliably good food, and doesn't break the bank. Not to mention the accommodating customer service: the wait staff served us small plates and drinks at a table in the bar area (at 530pm) while we waited for our 7-person party, and then we stayed until nearly 930pm, without feeling pressured to leave or put in our whole tapas order at once. A great place to stop in with friends for drinks and small plates after an afternoon shopping in soho. The datiles con beicon (dates with bacon) are a must. They taste like candy melting in your mouth.
