If you are coming to Philly to get a great cheesesteak you have to come here. Are there better ones? Sure. But Pat's is a Philadelphia staple. Pat's is right across the street from Geno's, which I prefer because the rolls have always seemed better to me. Don't get me wrong, these are delicious cheesesteaks! I usually eat them two at a time. But since I drive through Philly relatively often, I go to Tony Luke's to get my steaks now. All in all this is a great cheesesteak and if it's your first time to Philly do it for the tourist factor!
