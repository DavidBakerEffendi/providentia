This is probably my favorite spot to eat, drink, and be merry. The staff are all perky, fun, and sometimes sarcastic, but always willing to please. On busy nights like weekends, Mondays (Goulash night), or Wednesdays (live music), you might have to wait a while for table. That being said, the food is worth the wait. The trout is always great and cheese spaetzle is filling and flavorful and comes in huge portions. I particularly prefer Steinhof on weeknights when there's less of a crowd. The regulars all convene at the bar to compare drinks, talk about music, and crack bad jokes with bartenders and waiters. I always leave with a decent amount of cash still in my pocket, and a huge smile on my face. For the price and location, you can't do much better.
