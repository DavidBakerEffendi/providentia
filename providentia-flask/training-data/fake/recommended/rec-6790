First thing is you cannot beat the price. Stick to the apps and you will not be disapointed. We had the steamed pork soup dumplings and the steamed pork scallion dumplings and they we awesome. They had two specials, moon pies with pork which was great and ribs in brown sause that was not very good. The ribs were a real disappointment since it was by far the most expensive item at $15. There was 6 of us and the total was only $90..its hard to get this kind of quality and value..if I did not get the ribs..it would have only been $75..that's only $12 a person..hard to beat that.
