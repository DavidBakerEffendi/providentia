This restaurant is terrible.  The food is mediocre and ridiculously overpriced.  The servers are obnoxious and have no idea about the beers served.   Once I dined there with some clients, and the steak I ordered blue rare was served medium well, and the server said I would need to pay for another one if I wanted it cooked "that gross way."   Another night, we went there on a Community Night in which we spent over $250 not including tip, and the restaurant did not claim our meal as part of the proceeds, refusing to donate our portion to the Humane Society of Chittenden County.   We will not be dining at this establishment ever again, and recommend everyone else do the same.
