Miriam is an incredible restaurant for any meal. Their brunch has been voted best brunch in Brooklyn, and it's clear why. The eggs are life-changing; so is the crispy dough, burekas, shakshouka, I could go on. The dinner menu is similarly full of amazing options, without being complicated or sacrificing quality. The staff is friendly, attentive, and warm. The owner, chef Rafael Hasid, is in the house frequently and loves to meet customers and make sure their experience is good. The ambiance is beautiful and perfect for a small dinner with friends or a partner, but the restaurant can also accommodate groups and events expertly (I attended an event there that was unforgettable!).
