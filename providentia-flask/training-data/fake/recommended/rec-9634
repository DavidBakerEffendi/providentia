False advertising--Don't waste your time. After searching for a restaurant to take my Paleo friend out for his birthday, I thought Hu Kitchen was the perfect place when I saw their delicious menu on their site.  NY1 had also featured a segment on them a few weeks ago so my friend and I decided to go for it. Imagine our surprise when we went in and found out their in-store menu is dramatically shorter than what's on their site.  I had gotten my appetite worked up for their Beef Burger, and an employee told me it's been "a while" since they carried that.  Another employee, who seemed to be a supervisor, said they've been "trying" to update their website but have run into IT issues. Granted, their online menu says "Menu & Prices Are Subject to Change", but wow... If you don't believe me, check out their site, then go to the restaurant.  But you won't see me there!
