Took in Tremont a couple of times during my trip to the Claremont area. Tested it with a couple of the standards...first a regular cheese pizza, then a large steak and cheese sub with mushrooms. Overall...both were acceptably greasy, larger than what one would get for the same price in a larger community, and made with fresh (though not gourmet quality) ingredients. Small seating area handled my party well, the place wasn't too loud, and service was prompt. Liked what we got there and I expect to go back. It's not glamorous but it's tasty and reliable.
