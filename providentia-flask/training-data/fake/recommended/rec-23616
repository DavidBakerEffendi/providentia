I live nearby and get take out once or twice a month for sushi. Individual rolls are a bit pricey but the quality makes the price worth it. My wife doesn't eat seafood so she goes for their veggie options and loves it. They are quick to prepare food and their sushi is prepared well consistently. They are not wheelchair accessible (as listed). They have several steps and a portable ramp most likely won't work. I just say this as a wheelchair user who always wants to know my options.
