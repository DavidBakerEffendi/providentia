Ordered for delivery. Unimpressed and will not be ordering again. Ordered over the phone. Person answering phone acted/sounded inconvenienced. Ordered 2 Buffalo Chx Sandwiches, a Side Salad, and an Arizona Iced Tea. Screwed up the order. Only got 1 sandwich. Called back. Asked how it was possible that this was a $17 lunch. Buffalo Chicken sandwich ($7), Side Salad ($5), and Arizona Iced Tea ($2). It wasn't. He explained it was anyway and added tax. Fine. Whatever. Starving. Sit down to eat. The side salad is a hand full of romaine, 2 slices of cucumber, 1/4 a tomato, and a handful of olives. Not $5 worth. Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is grilled chicken, not really spicy/kinda like bbq sauce, on a wrap. Nothing else. Blue cheese on the side. Terrible. An $7 sandwich that costs $3 to make and that's being generous. Iced tea was Arizona and it was in the smaller container than the 99c cans and it was $2. Half an hour later they come back with another sandwich. Should of been a wrap. This time they toss tomatoes and lettuce on it. Put it on a huge, hard, crusted roll. Marked up prices, half ass effort, worse food than I could make at a gas station grocery store.
