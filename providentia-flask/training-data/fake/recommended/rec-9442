Don't get ripped off at breakfast!  This was my 3rd trip where I stayed at Ink48 hotel and had breakfast at Print.  I just noticed that they add 18% gratuity automatically to your bill, even if you're solo, as I was.  So I've double tipped every breakfast I've had there.  The only reason to do this is to rip off those that don't inspect the check well.  I've been traveling for 30 years - I've never seen this before, and I'm not going back.
