We wanted to try a new place in K-town and this place got pretty decent reviews so we decided to try it out.  We were impressed with the pre-meal assortment of kimchi, etc.  We liked that each person got a fried fish as part of that.  I ordered a spicy squid dish and my fiancé got pork soondubu.  They were both very good but dangerously spicy, especially the soondubu.  I would have preferred a little less spice and I think I would have liked it a lot better.  Other than that, the place was pretty good.  Ambience was very nice as well.
