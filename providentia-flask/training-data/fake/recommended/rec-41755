I never care enough to write bad reviews, but I really think this place deserves some warning. I went there on a week night, it wasn't too busy. After waiting over 30 mins for two tacos, I eventually asked for my money back. At least 5 LARGE groups of people got their food while I waited. When I asked what was happening with my order (politely) I was brushed off. It obv wasn't on the line. ALSO, I'm vegetarian and watched the line cook basically fry pork in the vegetables on the grill AND the other line cook was totally unsanitary with his gloves. Never going back.
