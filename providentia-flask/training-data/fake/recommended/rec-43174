Yummy yummy YUMMY. I crave you, my dear 53rd. Absolutely delicious halal food. I would marry it. Chicken and rice with white sauce? Can't beat it. The pita bread too mmmmmmm. TO DIE FOR. All for 6 bucks?? In New York City?! Unbelievable/ And they give you sooo much food. I hardly ever finish mine, making it the ultimate best leftovers EVER. Beware the red hot sauce though. Sweet BBQ sauce = yum, red hot sauce = burning, dont drink soda with your meal. As much as I don't want my mouth to explode & as rare as I get it, the hot sauce makes the food still taste awesome haha. I have to be in a certain mood for it though. I don't care how long the lines are. Worth it? Hell yeah.
