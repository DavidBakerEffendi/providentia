Absolutely as good as it gets!! Classic NJ spot, whenever I have family or friends visiting, they are going to be eating at Star. Pesto Pie is awesome. So is the Eggplant if you're a garlic lover. But the real deal is the plain mmmmmm. Extra parking available in the lot next door. Usually a line around dinner, definitely on weekends, but always worth it. If you don't want to bother call ahead and order some pick-up.
