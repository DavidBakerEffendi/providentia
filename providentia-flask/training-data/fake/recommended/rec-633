Honestly, did not want to admit it, but SOOOOOO WORTH THE HYPE!!! Going in a group larger than 2 will be a bit tough - but a party of 2 even on a Friday night presented 0 wait time. WINNNNNNNNN. The truffle burger is my go-to (actually, I've never even tried anything else) and the cheesey tots (off the menu) is absolutely TDF. Throw in one of those ice cream cookies for dessert and you'll be seriously reeling from satisfaction!
