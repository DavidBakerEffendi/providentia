I first went to Kefi years ago when they were in the high 70s near Broadway, back then, there were no reservations and I remember waiting over an hour to be seated. So I was really very excited when I found out the new location was going to take reservations!   Kefi is unbelievably good. The food is fresh and the menu is inventive without being strange or pretentious. I had a warm asparagus salad and the Kefi mac n' cheese. Both were pleasant dishes. I also had a cocktail recommended by the waitress. The cocktail was refreshing and light,  near perfection for a gin cocktail. And when the bill came, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a rarity to get such a good value in Manhattan! The interior of Kefi, while very similar to the old location, is mores spacious. We were seated downstairs and the space was surprisingly bright. Our waitress was excellent, and we had great service overall!
