This is a scrumptious place. The Amelia cocktail was yummy - great flavor and not too sweet. The steak tartar is by far the best I have ever had. The smoked trout salad was crisp and tasty -not too salty. Â Everything was so good that when my friend ordered the sweetbreads, I thought to myself that this would be the best place for me to try them out and I did. They did not disappoint! I also tasted the Ginger Smash-another yummy cocktail. To end the perfect meal, the bread pudding was to die for. I am not a fan of bread pudding usually but this was exceptionally delicious. I will definitely need to plan another trip to NYC just to eat at this place!
