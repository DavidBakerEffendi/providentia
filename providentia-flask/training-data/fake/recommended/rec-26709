After having a devine, elegant and amazing meal at Vetri, I have to say I was dissappointed.  Osteria was ok; but truly I expected something entirely different....a laid back, rustic Vetri.  Instead I got a half-a**ed Vetri.   Wanting for a nice, dry white wine for a hot Fourth of July dinner, the sommelier sugggested something too fruity at first and then a Pinot Blanc that was a bit too thin....(Iron Hill's Concannon Sauvignon Blanc was better and that's not a compliment....especially at $64 a bottle...). The pizze were fabulous and my swordfish was good, but after spending $100 pp I truly thought I should be in heaven....alack alas, I was merely on North Broad looking for fireworks.....
