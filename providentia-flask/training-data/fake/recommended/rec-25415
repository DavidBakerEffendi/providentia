Love this place. I discovered this hidden gem during my quest for great lunch spots, and it has quickly become my favorite. It takes a while to prepare your food, so I always call in advance. However, it is always worth it. A bit pricy, but it is quality food. I bring all of my coworkers there. You can eat in if you have some time to spare or order to take out. Either way, this is a great spot and I hope they do well enough to open other locations.
