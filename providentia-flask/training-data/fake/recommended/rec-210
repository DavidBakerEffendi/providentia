It's going to be really hard to write this review, the rating is not because of the food or drinks, those were really good. But I do appreciate when a good manager keeps the staff in checked. When we got there we were told that the pitcher of sangria was $10 in happy hour. We order 2 pitchers before 7pm, among several plates. When it was time to pay the bill, our surprise was seeing the pitchers at full price. And when I asked about it the waiter tells me that the one at that price is the half pitcher. At this point all I wanted to do is talk to the manager, and the waiter in a very rude manner approached us, and claiming that it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication grabbed the bill (which was handwritten) and tore it right there in front of us. As I see things, if it was a mistake (totally posible) I would have fix the pitcher value as a way to say sorry and let the customer pay the bill. At this point with no bill I couldn't pay it, couldn't talk to the manager and no tip for the waiter of course after that behavior. It seems very dubious to me and my friends that this guys destroyed the bill without trying to come up with another solution and talk about it. I consider myself a very understanding costumer but I don't answer good to rudeness and when I feel some type of dishonesty is happening I can't let it go. Hopefully this was a one person thing and I had bad luck.
