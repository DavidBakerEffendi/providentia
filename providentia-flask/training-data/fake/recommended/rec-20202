Today I had brunch at a small Mexican restaurant in Woodside, NY.  We found the place through yelp.  I really didn't expect much, but I was surprised at the food. I had the enchilada verdes with rice and beans.  It was delicious and it was only $10.  I think this was one of favorite Mexican meals I had in a  long time.  I know I shouldn't say this, but I think the enchilada was better than I had in Mexico.   If you are ever around Woodside or Sunnyside, I would check this place out.  its not very big, so I don't recommend to go there with a big crowd.
