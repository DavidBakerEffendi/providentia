Confession...... I don't like burgers that much. I've given them a chance from time to time, but they always made me think, "I don't get it, what's the big deal?" But I finally saw the light with umami burger's truffle burger. Soft, with the flavor of the beef coming through (medium-rare), not too salty, lots of truffle oil texture. The bun and the burger were one. The dipping sauces and the ketchup each added extra flavor and oomph. Our server was extremely friendly, and service was surprisingly quick. Not five stars mostly because of the wait. Although it's set up so that you get a text message when your table is ready, we still had to wait an extra 15 minutes after the text message (so an hour total).
