FYI, they don't take reservations! don't let that scare you because the food is sooooo worth the wait! Also, if the weather is nice, get a seat outside! we got lucky as there was a table of 3 paying their bill as soon as we walked up :) we ordered tapas style amongst 3 people (2 gals, 1 guy): CHEESE SAMBUSAK ($11) - savory pastry stuffed with cheese & spices. comes 3 pieces to an order. LAFFA TACO ($12) - chicken schwarma, topped with a mix of onion/tomato/pepper. comes 2 pieces to an order. YELLOW FIN TUNA CEVICHE ($13) - with avocado slices and a mix of chopped up peppers (i think). and oddly, this came with only one small piece of a toasted baguette. why not at least 2? GRILLED OCTOPUS ($14) - with a small side of salad topped with chickpeas i totally thought we were going to need at least one more order but surprisingly this filled us all up! I tried to order the Baked Meatballs but sadly, they ran out! Not only do I have to come back for the meatballs, i have to come back for brunch to try the Shakshuka specialty dish that all you yelp'ers are posting delicious pictures of! :) my only issue was our server -- she wasn't too attentive, and seemed to want to rush us through our order as we were asking her opinion on the menu items.
