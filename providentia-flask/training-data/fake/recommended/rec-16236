Come early and leave happy.  The lines can get out of control for a table.  But this is nothing new.  Anything more than 4 is a hassle, so beware. Bistro Burger medium rare, fries and a beer are what make me happy.  I mean how can deep fried bacon make something bad?  It cannot.  It is all like $10. Don't come here expecting to be coddled by the wait staff, it ain't their thing.
