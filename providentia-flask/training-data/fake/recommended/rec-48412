I'd been meaning to eat here for awhile, and finally did a few weeks back. I was really really pleasantly surprised! (Maybe that is their secret weapon, the surprise. Seems like everyone on here went in with low expectations and left impressed.) First off, the place looks great. Beautifully minimal, yet warm, decor, with a sort of modern-rustic-elegant-Nolita-on-St-Marks look. A nice change from the typically less than chic East Village joints. There was a long wooden table in the corner under a papier mache mounted deer that looks like it would make a great spot for a birthday dinner gathering. The wine list is okay, nothing exciting, but I did have a tasty lambrusco. Once you order, they bring bread and an olive plate, which I simply cannot argue with. My friend and I ordered the polenta appetizer and when we told the waitress we were splitting it, she had them serve it on two separate plates (huge serving each, still, and sooooooo so good. Could have eaten a whole plate as a meal alone). That was nice. My pasta with salmon cream sauce featured actual lumps of salmon. It was exactly what I wanted, I've been craving it for weeks since I had it. Everyone else in the restaurant looked extremely happy with their meals. I can't wait to go back!
