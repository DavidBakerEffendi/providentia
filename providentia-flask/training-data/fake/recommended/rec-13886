I'll echo most sentiments here - nice, thick burger that comes out quickly - mine was medium well although I asked for medium rare...could have used more salt, cheap buns, and it's a little smelly (like urinal/stale beer smell). The place looks/is more like a bar than a burger joint. Good burger but not going out of my way again- better burgers in order are: (1) Chelsea Grill (bigger more seasoned burger, cooked to perfection with better fries and better atmosphere) (2) Island Burgers - smaller but thicker -again, cooked to perfection and 1,000 topping suggestions - no fries though. (3) Le Parker Meridian - secret hotel burger - lines and not a great value (thin burger). (4) Burger place in Madison Sq Park - lines are ridiculous - thin but flavorful patty I haven't tried Paul's in East Village but it's next on my list. Pros: Good but not great burger Cons: Mild seasoning (salt), lack of consistency, cheap buns, smelly place
