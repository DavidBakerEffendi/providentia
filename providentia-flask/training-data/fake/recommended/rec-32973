Some people don't care for the owner's "sense of humor" BUT, who cares! The food is awesome! Huge menu, lots of specials and awesome Chicken Scarpiello! There is something for everyone from burgers to burritos, salads and homemade soups. White trash cheeseburger and the big fat fish sandwich are on the top of my list but you can go there and never get bored with the selections. A little tight and fast paced but worth the visit!
