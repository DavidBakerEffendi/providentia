The food is fantastic!  But, don't go on a Saturday night.  We had to wait by the door (even thought we had a reservation) and there was a crowd with us waiting, but no room.  We had to squeeze next to each other and I actually felt bad for the people sitting at tables there because it was cold and the door kept opening with people coming in and just standing around waiting and watching.  It was very unorganized.  Once you are seated, you usually have to sit very close to other people, and you can't order appetizers first, you have to order everything at once.  But, the food makes up for everything.  Next time, I will go on a week night and enjoy the delicious food!
