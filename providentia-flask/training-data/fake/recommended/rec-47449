I can't speak to the food here (though it looks good..) but the bubble tea was a disaster. I ordered a fruit flavored one and it was poorly mixed-- there were clumps of powder floating at the top of my drink. They don't have a mixing machine here, and of course powder doesn't dissolve well in cold drinks. Very sloppy to serve a bubble tea unmixed!
