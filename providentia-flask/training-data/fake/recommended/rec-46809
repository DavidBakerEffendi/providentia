Went here for the first time tonight and have to say it was great. The drinks were good, a little strong but not complaining. We had the fixed menu for restaurant week in bloomfield. I ended up with gazpacho which I've never had and it was really good. I also had the roasted salmon with Cous cous...the salmon was the best I've had in a while. My fiance had grilled chicken for dinner and mac and cheese with short ribs for the appetizer...you have to try it. staff was very friendly as well. My only issue was the entire meal we had to listen to another customer complain about everything from the sun coming in the window to the music being too loud to being upset with a baby crying that really wasn't crying much at all...she was so loud it really disrupted our conversation but no fault at all of the restaurant. ...we will definitely be back!
