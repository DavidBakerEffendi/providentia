It feels like Tokyo when you come to this restaurant.  It's nothing special if I were in Japan, but since I am in NY, I rate it 4 stars.  In addition to your regular selection of Yakitori, I recommend the tori-dango w/ rice on the outside.  The restaurant has a decent selection of sake, which goes well with Yakitori.  Come by as a couple and you can get seated relatively quickly.  Alternatively, I believe the sister restaurant Torisu and Aburiya Kinnosuke (both near Grand Central on the East Side) are a little less crowded and offer similar food. Warning: for those of you scared of undercooked chicken - this is not the place for you.
