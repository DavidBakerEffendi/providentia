Ewww!!! My experience today sucked!!!! I feel very pissed and offended -- what an unprofessional and rude business!! They got my order wrong, and was very rude after I called them about their mistake....they are very non-apologetic, and asked me to wait another 40 minutes before they deliver my panini and pick up the wrong order....When I asked for a refund, they asked me to calculate for them how much it is going to cost...Can you imagine that? ?!! The manager Willy refused to correct their mistake, and refused to transfer me to their owner Jeff to file a complaint. Such a horrible experience -- now I totally lost my appetite and I would never ever go back to this place again. To take further actions, I need to file a complaint with the better business bureau. Do not go to this place, they will mess up with your order and act very rude on the phone!! They need to train their staff about attitude, work etiquette, English, and math!!! Horrible food too --- my order looks and tastes like leftover dog food - DRY AND COLD AND NAUSEATING. YIKES!!!
