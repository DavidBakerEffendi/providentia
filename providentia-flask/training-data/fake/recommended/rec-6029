I can't say enough about this place. Ok so the outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, but that's a good thing. When you walk in you are greeted by the hostess, she has an accent which I assume was Greek, I think most if not all of the wait staff are Greek and that just gives you a great feel of authenticity. Now on to the food, my lady and I decided to get apps before our entrees. She decided on the grape leaves stuffed with ground veal, rice, pine nuts and golden raisins and I went with the grilled octopus. All I can say is wow. We ended up sharing with each other and bother were equally amazing. It couldn't get better right?! Wrong, it did with the main courses. She chose the baby lamp chops and I went with the braised short ribs. Can you say TENDER. The meat literally fell apart with just the touch of my fork, the mashed potatoes with porcini mushrooms was exquisite as well. My lady said her meal was equally as memorable as it looked. All I can say is I'll definitely be back.
