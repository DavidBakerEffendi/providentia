Yes, my friends and I actually made a day trip to Philly from Ithaca just to grub. The highlight of the trip was supposed to be Delilah's but for lunch we did the Pat's vs. Geno's bit. I don't really like Philly Cheesesteaks but I approach eating like it's my business (which it sort of is considering my major) and eating a cheesesteak in Philly, blah blah blah. I didn't set great expectations but I figured Philly and its sandwiches had to raise my impressions of cheesesteaks by a notch or two. Turns out not so much. We tried Geno's first. The place looks newer than Pat's but it looks like a Harley Davidson dealer. The line was all the way out into the street but it moved pretty quickly. My friends and I split the cheez whiz one and got a racist pen as a bonus...Double yuck. Might as well call it clogged arteries topped with disgrace-to-all-real-cheese with a supersized side of Â bigotry. Everything about this experience was distasteful.
