This place is ok.  I haven't gone for a show yet, just happy hour at the bar.  The Falafel was good and worth going back for.  The crowd is a bunch of hipster kids, but everyone is nice enough.  I'd go back to check out a show or get another falafel, but I wouldn't make this place a regular watering hole.  My one complaint was that we went during the winter and the place was freezing, after we ate we left to go to another, warmer bar.
