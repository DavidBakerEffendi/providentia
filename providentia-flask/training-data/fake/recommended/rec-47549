I ordered two peperoni pies on 10/11/13 for my family,not only was the pie thin but the sauce was barely there, fake cheese it was like cardboard.I am a true New Yorker and this is far from bk pizza.they should be ashamed i will never order again.who ever thinks this pizza is good needs to get out of jersey Â more really.
