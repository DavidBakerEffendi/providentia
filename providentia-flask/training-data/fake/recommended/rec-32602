The service here is absolutely top notch. It was the first time I had ever noticed how spectacular service can make you love a place. The waiters were attentive, conversational but not too chatty, and very classy. Food was great as well. Had the cod and it was delicious. The wine selection was great as well. I'd recommend it for an important business dinner or for a romantic meal with someone love.
