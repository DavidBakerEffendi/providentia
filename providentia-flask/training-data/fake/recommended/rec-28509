This place is good and friendly and down home. My suggestion is to hit up the ATM and come when it just opens. Â We did that and did not have to wait for a table for 6, but as soon as we finished, there was a line around the corner. We made our own pizza, one with white sauce, one with red and they were both GREAT. Amazing ingredients and friendly service!
