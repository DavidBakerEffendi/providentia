I have only been to Riverpark once and that too for brunch. I lived in this area for years and never visited (despite getting hounded by their emails after cancelling an open table reservation once). I guess I was put off by the location (inside a hospital, kind of hidden). Just goes to show that good food is good food and certainly worth any sort of trek/location! I loved brunch - I tried the grilled bread with avocado and hash browns with onion smother. My friend had the mushroom omelette with greens and pecorino. Simple items you may think but Riverpark nailed everything. I like places that put a lot of attention and care into the simplest menu items because I can only expect that things get better from there! My grilled bread was thick and perfect covered with layers of avocado drizzled with amazing olive oil and some sea salt. The hash browns were delicious but made even more yummy by the caramelized sweet and savory onion smother. Lastly, my coffee was one of the better brunch coffees I've had! My friend's omelette was great too. I want to check out Riverpark for dinner one of these days - maybe even convince some friends to try their farm to table eats this summer!
