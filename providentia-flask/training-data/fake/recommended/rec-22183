I ordered the Nabe Yakima Udon for takeout, because someone at the dog park recommended it. Thought to try it out!  As soon as I picked it up it weighed like 10lbs!  Took it home and it could easily be for 2 people. It came with a whole jar of broth and a smaller one with noodles. The broth had chicken, imitation crab that was surprisingly good, and vegetables. It also came with a whole tempura basket that had shrimp, sweet potato, eggplant, and squash. Very good!  Would get this again
