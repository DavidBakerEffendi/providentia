Went here with two coworkers who raved about the burgers. I was a bit surprised the menu didn't include a turkey burger, but was happy to settle for the veggie burger instead (chickpeas, in case you're wondering). I have to say, I think Morningstar has a leg up on this place when it comes to veggie burgers. Mine was mushy, lukewarm and bland. The saving grace was delivered in the French fries, which were nicely salted. After seeing two other tables gulp down milkshakes I decided to order the root beer float and was a bit disappointed that it was merely your basic root beer float: root beer and a scoop of ice cream. Good, but nothing I couldn't get at Arby's for 1/3 of the price. The restaurant itself was like a meat locker - absolutely freezing. It's rather unusual for a restaurant to crank the air conditioning in mid-October, but that's exactly what Burger & Barrel was doing (and the temperature outside was in the low 70s, so no need). There are so few quality dining options for lunch in Soho, so I really had my hopes up for this one...but I think I'm going to keep brown bagging for awhile.
