We had a fantastic lunch here while vacationing in Brooklyn. The tomato soup and grilled ham and brie sandwich were perfect on a rainy afternoon and I enjoyed a great Austrian rose. Our server was extremely friendly. This is a great, casual restaurant and I look forward to returning next time we're in town.
