This place is just awesome. You have to know what you're getting into with this place but it is so damn good.  This is a corner house converted into a casual restaurant just off Broad Street on Porter. As others said, you walk through kitchen to get to the dining room.  Dining room is really small, tight...you will bump chairs with your neighbor. No one cares, because the atmosphere is great.  It is a Byob so bring your favorite wine.  Menu is not huge but interesting and fresh. Many grilled dishes and they are awesome. Grilled calamari is a great app as is the caprese/mozzarella plate. Every entree has been terrific, love the tenderloin medallions when they have it. Gnocchi is hands down best in ever had and comes with grilled shrimp. This place doesn't look like much but is well worth checking out.
