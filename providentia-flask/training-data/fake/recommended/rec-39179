If you are from the school that a cocktail is just a cocktail, this place will educate you in the creation of well-mixed, perfectly blended drinx.  A friend of a friend said this was her favorite place in all of NYC.  I believe her.  One cocktail turned into four, because I wanted to taste them all.  I started with the Pimm's Cup and then I had the West Side.  Yummy.  You can't taste the alcohol in the Long and Fancy works of art with alcohol.  Henry one of the men who make this place what it s stood behind the bar and made his own recommendations- he even made me a custom drink that was soooooooooooo delicious. I didn't even ask what he put in it.  The drinks are magical and reason enough to come by EO.  The speakeasy that makes drinkin' easy.
