There's no other way to say it: this is the grilled cheese of which dreams are made. Crispy, melty, buttery with a host of add-ons to make it your own (my favorite is bacon and guacamole, like so many others). My husband would eat here every day, especially for the peppers he gets on his sandwich. The tomato soup is absolutely fantastic- tomato-y and rich with a little spicy kick and lots of pepper, worth eating even in warmer weather. People with narrowly defined ideas about what tomato soup should be need not apply. This is fantastic soup for people who appreciate things that taste amazing and are willing to be open minded against the sickly sweet tomato soup of their Campbell's youth.
