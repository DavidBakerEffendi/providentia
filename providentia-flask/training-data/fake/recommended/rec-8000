Easily a hundred different kinds of bourbon, rye, and American whiskey, available in 1 or 2 oz. pours, in a setting that makes you feel like spending 3 or 4 hours catching up with an old friend. In Manhattan, this place would be packed every night, but one of the lovely things about Brooklyn is that we had it almost to ourselves for several hours. Â I would like to be the kind of person who is a regular here.
