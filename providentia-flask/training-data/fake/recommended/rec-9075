The first time I heard of bone marrow as a food dish, outside of my grandma devouring whole chicken bones, was years ago from a friend who had it at Blue Ribbon at the behest of a New Yorker. After years of being a big fan of bone marrow thanks to progressive restaurant menus, I found myself sitting at Blue Ribbon at 1 am; coincidence? chance? fate? Meh, who cares...let's dig in! Ambiance (3): Small cramped space that screams New York. Brick walls and tiny bar to boot. Food (3): Fried chicken: weak, not crunchy enough, and the flavor was 'meh'. Skate: lost in a world of bacon (yum) and maybe a touch overcooked. Squab: forgettable (as per a fellow diner). Bone marrow: good quantity, however, the way it's delivered with acid/bitter/sweet/fat/salt flavors at other restaurants makes this one pale in comparison. This bone marrow was more two dimensional (sweet/fat) but I still enjoyed it. It came with phenomenal caramelized onions that were superb on their own. I liked the scotch selection and the wine list looked descent. Â  Service (4): Friendly staff. Not much else I can think of saying. They stay open till 3 or 4 so that's a good late night option. Value (3): It was NYC prices but not too bad. Overall: Honestly, after all I had heard about this place and how the waiter talked up the fried chicken which was pretty lackluster, I was disappointed and let down. It would make a good option for late night eating, but I would put it at the bottom of my list.
