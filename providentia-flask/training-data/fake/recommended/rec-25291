I wandered in to this little hole-in-the-wall eatery with my brother and we were immediately welcomed into such a friendly environment. The menu is outstanding. Great tacos and everything else is wonderful as well. Looking forward to tackling the entire spread! It's not only the food that makes this place, in my opinion, one of the best up and coming LES spots, it's the Mexicali fusion and the passion that the chefs bring to each and every dish. An awesome place to kick it with your friends after a great Friday night out drinking. Come for the food and stay for the food & the company.
