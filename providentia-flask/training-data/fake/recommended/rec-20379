This place is quaint and cozy. They have hanging plants, paintings and postcards, knick knacks, shelves of preserves and nutella AND all of the other patrons were French. I immediately felt Â transported to another place. Now on to the food... Each bite of my savory chicken with mushroom crepe made me go "Mmmmmmmmm"... Made me go "Aaahhhhhhhh" It really did! This place is a total gem.
