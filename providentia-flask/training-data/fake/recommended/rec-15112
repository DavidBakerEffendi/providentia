OMG. This was the place!!! Can you imagine a line one mile long. Exactly, hard to believe, but it's true. Luckily i was staying at the hotel next to the cart.   They open at 7PM promptly and the lines start. What can i say. The smell from blocks away is enticing.  Got in line, and waited for my turn. Finally, got the order guy, saw their menu.. went w/ chicken platter.. Comes w/ chicken shwarma type entree, mixed w/ rice, sauces (hot or not up to you).. in an aluminum platter.. piping hot.. Taste! Well, let's put it this way. Best chicken shwarma I have had outside of Istanbul.  Not greasy, not dry.. perfectly made.. Each time I am in NYC, i must visit this little gem on 53th..
