I've had brunch here many times - the best in Astoria by far. My favorite dish since I was a child has always been creamy Northern Italian-style polenta. Da-da! They dished it for breakfast. It was like all my polenta fantasies coming true. So I'm having dinner this time, and pulling in tow my straight-off-the-boat Italian friend. She knew all the wines, and oohed and aahed while going through the list. We picked the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. Amazing. Then we decided to order a selection of side dishes for dinner instead of the one-platers. Gawd. Mouth watering, salty-as-all-hell chicory. JUST LIKE NONNA'S!! And I was delighted to discover that the secret mouth watering base-flavor for the cabbage and wheatberry dish was VEAL stock. The both of us were in food and wine heaven. I just wish it wasn't so expensive for such such home-cooked goodness; I'd be there every day.
