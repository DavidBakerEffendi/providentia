BY FAR my favorite place I dined during my three day Philadephia trip.  This place was not one of the places recommended to me by the locals, and it was about an 8 minute walk from our hotel(Palomar), but it was worth it!  Everything on the menu looked spectacular and the staff was so friendly.  They offer pizza, sandwiches, breakfast staples, eggs, salads, etc.  The "everything" bagel I had was stellar!  Probably one of the top 10 bagels I have ever eaten.  I ordered the Miles Salad, that was served piled high with carmalized nuts and a VERY generous amount of goat cheese.  Since I also wanted the smoked plate, I ordered that as well, which I was  most definitely told that both options  I chose were large portions...I said I was hungry and ordered both.  I am glad that I did, because although they were very large portions(one would have been PLENTY), I am glad that I was able to taste the delciousness of both options.  If I had to do it again, I probably would have made the same decisions.  The smoked fish plate was perfect.  Aesthetically and flavor wise, this plate will make you happy.  The portion size and price ratio was great.  My salad was just amazing...mmm.. The husband ordered a grilled cheese and I am going to assume it was good because he did not talk, but instead let out moans of happiness while we scarfed down the fries and cheese sandwich. This place is just wonderful. I should have ordered a coffee, but I would have ended up not having enough room in my stomach. We WILL return to this place of business when we return to Philly, and I will recommend others to go as well.  Super yum.
