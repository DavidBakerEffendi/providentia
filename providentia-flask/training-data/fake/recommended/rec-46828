The menu really impressed me, easily on par with the highest quality restaurants out there, the dishes are creative and delicious, my mom and I were both very happy. The short ribs were fantastic! as was the special that day (a po'boy fish sandwich with bacon jam -- it was amazing). We loved the warm atmosphere and full bar, definitely recommend checking this place out!
