IF you are going for brunch make a reservation. It was raining and cold and this place was still packed. We got there for a party of 2 and they estimated an hour and 45 minute wait and we waited exactly that long. Even people who had reservations had to wait about 15 minutes to get their table. The food was amazing, although I had to send mine back because it was cold and then the new plate had a piece of plastic on it, but they were more than accommodating and i did not pay for that plate and they gave us a free glass of champagne as well. This would deter most people, but given how busy they were and how well they handled it I would chop this up to the rush that's going on. The food was excellent, we had the lobster benny and the Benedict Jane, along with the donuts and I would gladly order them again, although everyone's food around us looked amazing. I would say though, that had it not been raining I wouldn't have waited all that time to eat, but we didn't really have much else to do, so make a reservation!
