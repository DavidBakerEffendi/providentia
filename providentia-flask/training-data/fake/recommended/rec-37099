So first of all, they have a fair price for a good selection of food.  I went there on a Tuesday night for their dinner buffet, which wass $13.95.  The price is listed on their napkin dispensers and the price goes higher obviously on the weekends and lower for lunch as some people have already noted.   Food options included your deserts (pastries, pudding, ice creams), sushi bar (consisting of about a dozen different style rolls, salmon and yellowtail sashimi, shrimp, and crab), and then your hot entrees (fried American Chinese options like egg rolls, fried chicken wings, spareribs, chicken and broccli, steamed fish, steak) and then soups, and some limited dim sum (spare ribs and chicken feet that has been steamed/sat around for a little while).  I went around 7:30 PM at night and the entrees were still mostly fresh. However, while eating, one of our party found a short and curly embedded in a sushi roll.  We told a server who then talked to a manager.  The server came back and said the manager said it was from seaweed and that was it.  The short and curly did not look like seaweed and the manager didn't ever come to address us.   I accept the fact that stuff happens ... and hair can fall into food, but short and curlys don't just embed themselves into a sushi roll.  (I don't think it was from seaweed or even a beard).  I see from the other reviews that they just opened so maybe it'll get better, but this is the last time for me.  Again, good price for a decent selection and I probably would have given four stars if it weren't for the way the manager's response to the short and curly.
