This spot is amazing. The location is slightly off the main artery of foot traffic, but that makes it all the better. First, the food: holy f---. It was good. Not mind blowing rethink what you know about the culinary arts good, but questioning the tearing capacity of your stomach good. I had the pork chops and apple sauce, which was standard and well made, but my girlfriend had the crab cakes and mussels and they were both fantastic. Amazingly fantastic. I'm not a seafood fan and I was blown away by how good the crab cakes were. The whole restaurant has a great old New York aesthetic and the building is a great historic landmark. The service is friendly and a bit more down home charm than most places in Manhattan. I highly recommend the Ear Inn to anyone that wants a great meal at a good price served with a charm not often encountered in the big city.
