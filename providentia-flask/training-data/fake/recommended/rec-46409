Been coming here with my parents since I was a kid. Came here with the boyfriend this time, we ordered half a duck and a noodle dish each, I know it's a lot but I had no problems taking the left over duck home and snack on later with some beer. Mmmm... The duck is not the typical roast duck with the glossy skin in many of the Cantonese restaurants, it's more of a soy sauce flavored duck, tastes awesome, your mouth will be in flavor town... (ha-ha?)... Anyway, our food came out within 5 minutes of ordering, I LOVE that, I hate being hangry and waiting. Quick and easy, my go to noodle place in China Town. Side note: There are lots of dishes with animal organs, so for people who don't like that stuff, be on the look out for something more friendly, like, fish balls, or sliced meat.
