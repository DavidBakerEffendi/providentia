This new joint is situated literally below my office and I've been interested to see what it would turn into after months of renovation and blacked out windows. The founder, Jordan, was thoughtful enough to go floor to floor in the building and invite everyone to the soft opening. Who doesn't love free food? I have been back a few times since. Yes, it's pricey but the food is super yummy and they make a damn good latte. They definitely have some kinks to work out and I have seen some improvement in regard to portion size and space layout. The staff is friendly and helpful. Jordan is there talking to people and getting feedback. The interior is well thought out and comfortable. I wish them luck. I'll continue to forgo breakfast so I can splurge on lunch..
