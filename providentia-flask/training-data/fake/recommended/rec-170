We've gotten take out from here a couple of times.  They had a deal on cheese pizzas. The pizza was not bad; not Modern or Wooster St., but still tasty.   Today we got a grilled chicken wrap that was absolutely devoid of flavor.  Nothing!  It had a brown sauce that looked like a balsamic dressing.  No taste.  It was like eating cardboard.
