Hey there! I finally made it over to Bierhaus!!! I usually get my German from my very local Killmeyers, but I wanted to see what was same/different at Bierhaus. So here goes. I started out with a fantastic German Riesling. Mmmmm. Then I always get a wurst platter (brats and kielbasa), with red cabbage and sauerkraut. The food was very good, and very similar to Killmeyers. I thought the red cabbage at KM was better because it is very sweet and dessert-like. However, at KM they also do that to the sauerkraut and it always annoys me, because sauerkrat should be, well sour. Lol. The menu at Bierhaus was huge and much more extensive then KM. However, you get all your Geman mainstays- Potato Pancakes, Wurts, German potato salad (YUM!), German chocolate cake, etc at Bierhaus. The food was VERY good. This place was very romantic. It was dark and all lit by candles . Def worth a night out with that special someone. You can also go outside to the Biergarten (weather permitting) and they grill hot dogs, hamburgers, etc back there. They also had a HUGE variety of beer and alcoholic drinks. Would def return and recommend.
