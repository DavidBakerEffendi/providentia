Had to wait an hour on a Saturday which wasn't so bad considering they originally said two hours!  Well worth the wait- AMAZING margaritas, hands down the BEST enchiladas verdes I have ever had!  Guacamole was also good, and chips were very fresh.  Also had the vegetable tacos, which were tasty but a bit cold and obviously could not compare to the enchiladas!  Still dreaming about those- can't wait to go back!
