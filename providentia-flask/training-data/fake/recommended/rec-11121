I will admit that Dmitri's is very good, but I don't get the cult-like following this place seems to have. The fish preparations are very basic, which allows the full flavor of the fish to shine through. You're not going to get a macadamia nut encrusted trout or anything exotic. Just plain broiled or grilled fish. Â All the entrees come served with escarole and rice. I really don't have much to say about this place. It's a nice BYO, but it's boring. The menu isn't that exciting, but if you're in the mood for just a piece of fish, then I would suggest this place.
