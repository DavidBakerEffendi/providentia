The country fried steak here is... good. I won't say it's great, but it's good. The wings here are also very delicious and fried well. My only gripe is the pricing. The wings for a serving of 6 were $12...that's $2 per wing! (albeit very good wings) The country fried steak was $16 and definitely filling but it's essentially a thin piece of skirt steak with mashed potatoes. This place earns a half star for serving food until 2 p.m. I won't give it 4 though since neither the food nor the value is great.
