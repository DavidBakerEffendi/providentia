First of all, I am writing this review very ticked off after being turned down for take-out service. My office is close by, so when I'm jammin on a deadline, I typically run over for a coffee (pretty good and hot) and sometimes a muffin (typically dry, not too much flavor). But, I have to say that I've been really disappointed lately. Their tofu scramble is completely flavorless and everything else I've ordered has had me running to the bathroom with a stomach ache. Blegh! I'm not one with a sensitive stomach, either. But the thing that upsets me the most, is that I just called to order a berry bisquit (the one thing I would recommend trying) which is um, bisquits they already have made and some berries and whipped cream on top - hello, that would take 2 minutes...and before I even had a chance to order, the guy who answers says "we don't do takeout, we are too busy" CLICK. Well, that is the last time I'll give them my business. Disappointed to say the least.
