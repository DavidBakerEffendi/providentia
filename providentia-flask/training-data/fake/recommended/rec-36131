I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking for an amazing dinner, but does not mind spending a little more money. this place is great for special occasions. Their food was all amazing from the steaks, to the salads, to the desserts everything was delicious and fresh. The waiters and waitresses were all so attentive ans nice. Love balthazar and would def come back!! the only thing I would like them to change is the restroom location, which downstairs in the basement which is very cold. But other than that the restaurant is amazing!
