Stuffed is a perfect fit for Montclair. 100% grass fed burgers with fresh hand cut fries are welcome here. The menu is simple but there are many great choices. Get the Bacon Jam burger-you will come back to have it again. Same with bacon jam fries. Or just build your own. I have tried many variations-all are great. The atmosphere is comfortable and has a fun vibe with large screen tv and music. Staff and service were great.
