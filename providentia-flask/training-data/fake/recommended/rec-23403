Our favorite restaurant in Princeton. Always creative, always hopping. The dishes change frequently, so it's hard to highlight specific ones for you to try. Everything is small plates, meant mostly for sharing but really it's up to you. Â I strongly suggest the beet lemonade and the raspberry Kombucha tea. We're not meat eaters but will eat some fish. Vegetarians, take note: best restaurant in Princeton I've seen. Big variety here. My only criticism is how loud it can be. The decor does not lend itself to sound absorption, and the kitchen is mostly open. Fun to watch the chefs, but hard to hear your dinner companion.
