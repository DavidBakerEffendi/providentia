So delicious. Go at happy hour and getcha a shot-o-rum. Order two arepas if you're anything beyond a little hungry. They have great starters (guac is great, as are the tostones) and great salads, surprisingly! Ask for the spicy sauce (they call it chingona sauce--you're a badass if you use it!), even if the waitress looks at you like, "really? Really? You want the spicy sauce?" The back area is great in the summer, they almost always have great music piping, and the staff are nice as can be.
