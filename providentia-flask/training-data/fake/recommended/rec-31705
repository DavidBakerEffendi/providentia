Quality food, great service and cool atmosphere with live music, dj and dancing.  Attractive staff and clientele and additional eye candy from classic movies projected on the wall.  Lots of really yummy vegetarian options. Full disclosure -- I perform there several times a month -- but the New Years Eve prix fixe stirred me write this review because they really deserve praise. Way to go Cubana Social!
