This place was great. Friendly service, great (and creative) food, good music. Everything was delicious but not too heavy where it felt like you were getting too full. My favorites were the pork belly and burrata cheese/avocado mousse. For desert, the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream were great but the key lime was a little sweet for my taste but I still ate it all. Also, a cool but small cocktail selection included a chilli infused vodka that was spicy and yummy.
