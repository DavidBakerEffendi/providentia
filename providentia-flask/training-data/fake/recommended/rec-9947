txipirones en su tinta (squid in ink with rice). BOMB. Wish this wasn't a tapas place so I could order a large size.  It also goes well with the chorizo but you will need more rice.   My friend highly recommended the patatas bravas (potatoes) but it was just okay. Make sure to end the night with their leche frita (fried custard)! YUMMM!
