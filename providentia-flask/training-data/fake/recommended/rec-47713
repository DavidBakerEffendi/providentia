The food is okay, it's not great. I went here with two other people around lunch time. It wasn't busy at all but the service was bad and slow. Their utensils were dirty so as they glasses. It still had lipstick stains on it, we asked them to be changed and when the waitress did the glass still had a lipstick stain on it. I really think that was disgusting. The fries were good. If everything else besides the fries was good I would probably go back. But it wasn't.
