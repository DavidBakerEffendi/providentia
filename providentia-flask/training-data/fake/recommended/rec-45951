Vesta is an amazing restaurant in an area with a lot of great restaurants. I've held a private party in their private room and the owner Frank and entire staff couldn't have treated us more like VIP's. they have great daily specials and their pizzas are out f this world. Try the rib appetizer, buffalo chicken pizza and the braised Short ribs substitute polenta for truffle fries. Also their cheese plate and meAt plates are great. And guess what?!? You can get a Half cheese half meat plate! Just ask! Eat here! Drink here!
