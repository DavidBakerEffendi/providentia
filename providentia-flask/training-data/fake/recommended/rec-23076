So I didn't read closely enough when I chose to come here, but to another reviewer's point that was my own fault.  I was expecting a typical diner and was gearing up for diner chili and fries for dinner.  Instead I got a really lovely meal with wonderful service.  It is a bit more pricey and the menu is more fine dining (translate a more limited selection), but I really loved it.
