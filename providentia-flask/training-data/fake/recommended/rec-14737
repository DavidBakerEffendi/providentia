The Firepit in Kearny, NJ I never had Portuguese ribs until the Firepit in Kearny, NJ. They are made fresh to order and usually take about 45 minutes for them to cook. So if you are planning on trying them, you will need to allow the time. While we waited, we had the shrimp in garlic sauce that was really garlicy and succulent. There is plenty of garlic in the sauce to dip in that wonderful Portuguese bread. We also ordered black beans and the Portuguese fries to go with the ribs.  These ribs aren't like any other ribs I've ever had. They are grilled with a savory homemade sauce on them that make the outside very crispy and tasty and tender to bite. There's no bar-b-q sauce on them, so you really get the flavor of the babyback ribs.  The beans and fries were really wonderful!
