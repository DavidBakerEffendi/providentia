We had my best friend's little brother's bar mitzvah dinner here years ago so there was agreeable symmetry last night when I met his college girlfriend, or "the one" as he put it each time he'd aggressively shwirl his glass of Pinot Griogio, which we still had to order for him...it was absolutely great - like watching a re-interpretation of how his older brother, my best friend, and I were when we were finishing school - still getting used to our Independence, feeling out the confidence...the restaurant could have served doritos for dinner and I would of had fun, but luckily they didn't, it's Isabella's and the meal was superb - From the appetizer menu I suggest the Parma Proscuitto served with buffalo mozzarella or the Crispy Lobster and Gulf Shrimp Spring Roll, with the Crab Cakes being a solid third choice. Entree side of things the Grilled Filet Mignon is the way to go, but I would also speak highly of the Free Range Chicken and Organic Salmon. I did not like the Mediterranean Risotto but my friends love it. Next time it's Gnocchi for me with a Goat Cheese Salad to start, both looked awesome.
