Back in New York this weekend and brought my best friend to Buvette. Food continues to be wonderful, but I'm docking two stars for a significant slide in wait staff professionalism that really detracted from the experience. The man running the food prep end of the bar had several angry outbursts at other staff with an awkward "haha I said that with a smile" afterwards. There was also a Â manager of some sort present of who kept exchanging complaints with our bartender, some of them about diner behaviors that sounded pretty innocuous to me. It made everyone eating at the bar really uncomfortable. If you've been to Buvette you know the bar is always packed as a dining space and you are practically in the wait staffs laps since its such a small space. Take your anger issues and need to vent about wait staff and customers behind closed doors, I don't need to listen to them while I eat at a restaurant of this quality!
