We had a great lunch at Beyoglu. There were 6 of us so we were lucky that the restaurant was not too crowded and we were seated immediately. We started with the large mezze plate which was heavenly, but best shared for 4 people or fewer - with 6 we each got just a spoonful. I would probably just order that for myself next time! I was craving salad so I got the Beyoglu salad (hint: the g is silent when you pronounce it) which had tasty feta cheese, grilled chicken, and some other yummies piled high. Most people at the table ordered an entree item. I was lucky enough to get a bite of my boyfriend's swordfish kebab which was very good. I didn't hear any complaints from the others who ordered the mixt grill and kofte kebab. Portions are large and most of us had leftovers. Service was fine, no complaints.
