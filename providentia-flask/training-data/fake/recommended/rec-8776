Went here for a friends birthday a few months ago, and we had the whole top floor for the festivities. This place is so awesome! Love to speakeasy vibe, and even though the place was packed, the bartenders were really nice and accommodating. We ate at Scarpetta for dinner, so we just had so appetizers with our drinks, but those were delicious, from what I can remember, I was a little buzzed that night.
