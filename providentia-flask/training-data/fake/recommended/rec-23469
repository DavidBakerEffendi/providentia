The first four stars are because this is a great neighborhood bar. It's cozy, the bartenders have always been nice, the drinks strong, and prices reasonable. Happy hour rail drinks and beer are $3. And my non-happy hour vodka soda was $5! They also have the usual "PBR and a shot of really, really bad whiskey for $5" special all the time. The fifth star is a result of the one time I left my credit card sitting on the bar. The bartender sent her friend sprinting down the street to return my card to me. I was already a block away. This dude was yelling "miss! you forgot your debit card" Who does that? It was awesome. Definitely my go-to bar in Bushwick.
