Definitely a place you want to return. Quality of food and service are in line with their reputation. Â It's a lively place with great bar scene. Great fro business dinners, friends or even a date! the combination of having great seafood and steaks is not new, but you have to excel at it. I ordered the NY Strip and it was absolutely perfect! Sorry, but I behaved and skipped dessert, but they looked great.
