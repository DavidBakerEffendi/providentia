Very good Mexican food at rock-bottom prices! I got the fajitas with the spicy seasoning, and my eyes were tearing up like crazy afterwards - those things were hot as can be! If you do not like spicy food, don't worry, as they only add the spicy seasoning upon request. But the food is delicious and affordable, a highly recommended Mexican takeout restaurant in the Central NJ area!
