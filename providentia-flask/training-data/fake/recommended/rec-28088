Just went to Desnuda tonight based on the great Yelp reviews, and I must say I was extremely disappointed. I'm not sure if the other reviewers have ever had authentic ceviche, but based on the amazing reviews - I'd have to go with not. I had the Locust, and it was terrible. I loooove cilantro, but in this drink it did NOT work. The place is super smokey (not sure why, when most of the cooking they do is the searing of the scallops!), and extremely loud. We ordered the kale salad, potato salad, scallop and tuna ceviche. The potato salad was amazing, it was made with purple potatoes, onions, and mayonnaise. It was served warm. The kale salad was horrible, the dressing was bitter, and the radish and apples did not compliment the dish at all. On to the ceviches - the scallop ceviche was so bland it was ridiculous. It had absolutely no flavor, and were full of sand. Like literally crunching between my teeth. My fiance had the spicy tuna (there are 2, I don't recall which, but it had potato chips on it) tiradito, and he felt it was boring and bland as well. I definitely will never return to this overpriced place, when I can get better ceviche at a hole in the wall place in Jackson Heights for half of the price! As an aside there were 2 other tables of diners - 3 girls and 3 guys, and all were complaining about portion size and price. To the point that they were joking with each other (no they did not know each other), where they would go after to REALLY eat. Avoid this place, do NOT listen to the previous reviews. I had to go eat pizza after coming here. Way overpriced. Wish they spent more time on flavor, as opposed to fancy plating.
