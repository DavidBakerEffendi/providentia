Omg! what a great place. me and my friend went Â a few days ago for dinner and we were in awe as to how delicious the food was. our waitress was really nice. we had the guacamole for starters and then we shared a plate of the carnitas. what a feast that plate was. what can i say about the dessert, they were amazing. we had the warm chocolate souffle and the tres leches. i would recommend this to any one.
