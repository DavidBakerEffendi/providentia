This place is adorable. My friend and I walked a mile in the snow to get there and it was definitely worth it. What's funny is the sign outside doesn't even say "Tom." It just says "Restaurant." It has a warm home-y feel to it. Our server was pleasant and sweet. Also, there sat a man next to us who sat alone. He appeared to be a regular because I didn't even hear him order and he was brought out his drinks and food. He had two glasses of soda and I thought he was meeting someone, but it turns out the server knew he would finish the first one and want a refill. OH and the CHIPOTLE SAUCE. I'm a fan of chipotle anything. I would drink that up! They do keep it old school and only take cash. There is an ATM, though. I'm envious that my friend lives close to here. I'm sure she'll be stopping by more often.
