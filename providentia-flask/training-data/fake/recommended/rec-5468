If you're a smoker, and you love good food and drinks, this is the place to come. The cigar selection is decent, but the food and service is extraordinary. I had clams and cajun sausage, and it was great. The fact that you can enjoy a good cigar is a plus. everyone was very friendly. If there is a manlier bar in NJ I haven't been there. Classy all the way. Its a guaranteed good time at Jamie's for people looking for a good drink a good cigar and a great meal.
