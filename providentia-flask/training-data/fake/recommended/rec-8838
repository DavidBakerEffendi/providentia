Menu changes daily, however the Brick Chicken seems to appear more often than not. Very enjoyable. Fantastic artisan cheese selections, that can feature a Raw cows milk variety at times. As small and cramped as an overpriced Williamsburg apartment. Bring a bag of chips as they only take reservations for 6+
