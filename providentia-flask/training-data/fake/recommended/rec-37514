Three words: Value, Value, Value! I've been lamenting that I can't find a variety of affordable Asian food that's not way too big a portion and not too oily like the Chinese buffet places. Our cousin who works nearby recommended this place and we went there 3 times in a week after discovering the place. They have a buffet spread that runs till 3 or 4 in the afternoon. Food is sold by the pound. This was a great option for me since I like lots of variety. The food tastes reasonably good for the price and there are lots of takeout options and a noodle bar. I will definitely stop by every time i'm in the area.
