Came here a while back for my birthday, definitely a great place. The ambiance is nice, well decorated. Not your usual tables, but felt more like eating in the comforts of your own home. The service was great, the waitress was very attentive. Though there was a bit of a wait for the food. The food was great, definitely recommend the uni croquette. The sliders however, I could do without. They weren't bad but it didn't wow me neither.
