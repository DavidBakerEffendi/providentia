I feel like I went to a different restaurant than most of the reviewers here.  I will agree that the decor was beautiful, but that's not going to make me return to a restaurant -- food quality, price, and service will. The food was really just okay.  Pretty standard thai, nothing special.  Their menu is quite lengthy.  The spiciness was strange.  For both the tom kha gai and the penang curry, they dumped the pepper flakes at the bottom but never mixed them in, so the dish was hardly spicy at all until you got the the bottom.  Penang curry only came with a tiny amount of rice, and $2 for additional rice, seriously?  The pineapple fried rice was fine, but again, just standard, nothing amazing.  I did like the clear sauce with onions, cucumber, and peppers that came with the chicken satay, but that was about the only interesting thing. Thai tends to be more expensive than other Asian food for some reason, and I guess this place was about average for Thai restaurants, $14-16 for an entree, but $7-$8 for appetizers and desserts seems high. Service was really lacking.  A waiter was standing and chatting not 5 feet from my table when I had an empty water glass.  It took like 15 minutes to get our check.  We never got the extra plates we asked for.  The servers were just very discombobulated, since every time someone came by our table, it was a different waiter. I didn't think this was a good value, and while the food tasted fine, the lack of service means I don't think I'd return here for the most part.
