Great drinks and quesadilla. Went here to have a snack and watch the world cup game. It was perfect. Until I dropped sour cream into my drink. The waiter so kindly offered me a new one when he saw me trying to get the topping out. I thought that was nice, I didnt have to ask! Waiter even joked he wouldnt let me drink that. Â The watermelon lemonde is delicious!!!! And the quesadilla was great.
