Was lured in by the concept and positive reviews. But I have to say i did not care for what I ordered AT ALL, however perhaps I need to try again because I will say it was fresh and is a great great great concept. .. and I see other reviewers rave about this place and concoction, in particular, but I THREW IT AWAY. That says a lot for me, ha, not much food waste in these parts :( ... Hmmmmm.... I had one of their posted the creations, the salmon one, and added the wasabi guac to it because well wasabi and guac go together with salmon brilliantly. This creation however did NOT work. I just didn't like the flavor, it was too sweet for one--I dont think I cared for the mango on it and would have left off the sriracha type sauce that was one of the standards on this "rollito"... blah ... perhaps will try again and crunch it out instead and no sriracha sauce (it's not called this but i don't remember what they call it but sriracha is the base)....I dunno though if I will, am kinda turned off and $10 in the trash isn't a lot but it could have gotten me a delish sandwich at Hip City Veg....lol A couple of stars for great, friendly service and a great concept but *think* about what you order or get the sauces on the side at first. I did not pick well...
