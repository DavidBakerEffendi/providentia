Huge space, great service, and generous portions. This place is well worth the $8 for a gyro. Ambience is a plus as there was plenty of seating (even during the lunch-time rush) and you will always encounter a friendly face. No attitude from the employees seems to be hard to come by now a days... You'll find no attitude here!
