We brought my dad here for his birthday and it was all our first time there.  Made a reservation which seems to have been a good choice because the place was packed.  The dining area felt really cramped though.  I know it's a business and they're trying to feed as many mouths as they can but it would be nicer if everyone wasn't sitting on top of each other.  It was a bit bothersome to the other people and myself when I needed to get out of my seat to use the bathroom.  It was like a whole procedure with my family at my table needing to get out to push their chairs in and bumping the back of the people sitting at the table behind us. The steaks were AMAZING though.  We all got something different and tasted each others.  The chefs in the back definitely know what they are doing when it comes to steaks.  I guess broccoli is a standard side [tasted great].  the mashed potatoes and fries were also delicious.
