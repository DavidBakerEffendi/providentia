Overall my entire experience here was pretty much a disaster. Upon being seated we were told the sushi chef was ill and so no sushi was available. Not a big deal considering we were mainly focused on the barbeque. While ordering we were told several other items were unavailable as well, as the sushi chef prepares them... My friend's drink order never comes out... They quickly came out with lots of side dishes (unfortunately almost HALF of what was promised on the menu...) The only questions we had concerning the items weren't really answered by the wait staff, apparently they don't know the menu very well... I was very excited for the barbeque portion, especially considering I had never been to a restaurant like this. They come out, light the grill, glaze the grill pan, throw some meat on, then leave.... He comes back again, flips the meat after nearly burning, changes the pan, then leaves again... We finally begin to suspect that we're in charge of cooking ourselves, when a different man comes out, gives us a horrible attitude considering the situation and exclaims how he shouldn't be doing it... How insanely rude, especially considering we were never told... He comes back shortly after and throws the rest of our meat on, despite us cooking already... After all that, we waited nearly half an hour before having to ask for the check... Mind you we were the only ones there on a Monday night... Never again
