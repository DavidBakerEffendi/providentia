Rybread makes me crave food I don't even like...what's a scone anyways? Who cares, they make them cheesy and bacon-y and mmmmmm!!!!! Carrot cake is gross, but not at Rybread topped with half a pound of cream cheese icing (secret ingredient: crack?)! I even enjoy the carrot chunks for some reason. Who knew?
