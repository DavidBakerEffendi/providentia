We ate at Obao last night and we all loved it!!  I had read a few reviews about issues with the service, but that was not the case for us at all.  The food was incredibly flavorful and all of the staff was extremely friendly.  We were running a bit late to get to a show and they helped by getting our food out very quickly even though the restaurant was completely packed.  Definitely coming back to this spot!!
