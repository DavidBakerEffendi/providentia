We went to Tinto on the last night of restaurant week and had a nice night.  The food was great but my wife put it best saying, "good, but nothing innovative."  I loved the grilled octopus and the beef skewers.  The desserts were nothing special at all to me.  I'd like to return during a normal time and try it all again.
