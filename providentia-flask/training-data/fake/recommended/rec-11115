One of my favorite places to eat.  Great place to take a vegetarian friend too, because any of their dishes can be made without meat.  Don't forget, they are cash only, and BYO.  Not open on Sundays.  Everything on the menu is amazing.  My favorite is the Panang Curry dish. With shrimp or chicken.   When I was looking for a new apartment, this restaurant was one of my top reasons not to leave West Philly.  I left anyways, but there is a great sadness in my heart when I remember that Vientiane is no longer the closest restaurant to my house. They do take out orders too.
