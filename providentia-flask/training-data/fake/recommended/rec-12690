Can't say that the place lived up to the hype. Got our names in for a table, with a 2 hour wait which turned into a 3 hour wait. Not too bad though as you can walk around and check with the waitnow notifications. So for the meal itself, the day was crappy and raining so when we did get seated, we were soaking wet and got put next to the cold window. Again nothing that was within their control but it may have added to our experience. Took a few minutes to see out server. Placed out order the. Waited again for a while to get our drinks, hot chocolate is meant to be just that, hot. Both of ours were luke warm at best, and we were ready to tell our server when she was to come over and ask how we were doing..... She didn't come back, another server dropped off our food. Now the food, the pancakes are fricken great. Blueberries and the maple butter are enough to endure a wonder sugar coma, the farmers plate was also well done. With great sour dough bread and the raspberry spread that was not overly sweet but perfectly paired with the butter and bread. So the food deserved a good 4 stars Again the service part, finished our meal and waited for out server to finally come by the table after 8 or 9 fly byes. So for service 1 to 2 stars. Average the two out and round up.
