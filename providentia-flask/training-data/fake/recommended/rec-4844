Great meal, Aldine should be way more busy than it was on a Saturday night at 8. There are 13 items on the menu -- we ordered 10 of them. The pasta and duck breast were incredible and our waiter paced the meal really well. The dishes are meant to be shared, but some of them were a little awkwardly presented if that's the goal. What's most important though is that the food was awesome, and likewise for the cocktails. I hope Aldine makes it.
