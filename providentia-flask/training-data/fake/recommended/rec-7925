Our second visit to White Dog.  At the risk of arrogance, this is a world class restaurant. The food is excellent. Service fantastic.  Maggie has returned to serving and was wonderful. We had all the pastas, Tortellini and Ahi Tartare as appetizers. Scottish salmon.  Recommendation for the Trefethen blend and the "OPP" Oregon Pinot.  Great. Busy but worthy it.  Have wine on the patio, chill and enjoy.
