Great place.. relaxed atmosphere but professional service.  Foccacia bread put on the table was amazing and the rest of the food was good too.  The desserts were really great, we had the mixed berry and custard dessert which was delicious and the homemade cookies which tasted fresh and were paired well with a custard-type side as well.  Would definitely recommend, but make a reservation or go early!
