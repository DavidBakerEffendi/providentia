While I used to love these guys, the long ass line is pretty overrated.  I used to be one of the sheep thinking that since the line is longer, the food must be the best, but really it's not the case.  Plus, I noticed THE GUYS HANDLING MONEY WERE ALSO TOUCHING ACTUAL FOOD WITHOUT GLOVES.  That's f*cking disgusting!   (and I mean touching the pita with their bare hands, chopping the chicken & lamb and their hands touching the meat on the sides).  And what's up with the stupid white sauce containers?  They didn't always do that and it's annoying. Here's a tip:  Walk your butt to the other side of the block to the cart on 52nd and 6th- same block, don't cross any streets.   The food is just as good, if not better, and you're not waiting for an hour to get it.
