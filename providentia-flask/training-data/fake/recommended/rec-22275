If I could put zero stars, I would. Purchased a living social deal for $50 and called to make a reservation to use it the last week of the time period and was told upon calling they had no more reservations available and that it would not be valid. They are only open certain nights am at certain times making it difficult to not only get someone to answer a phone but to actually go in and eat. I would love to say it is fabulous but the person I spoke with was rude, condescending, and incredibly unhelpful. Her demeanor turned me off that I don't even know if I would actually go, as she strikes me as the kind of person who would spit in people's food. Sad. The menu looks amazing. Really sucks. Would've loved to have gone. Now we are out $50.
