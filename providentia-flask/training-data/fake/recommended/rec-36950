I dislike the word epitome from overuse, so instead, this is the BEST PLACE EVER for late night drunken food stops. One of my college courses had a segment on why fries and other fried carbs cause cancer. This has not deterred me from eating at Pommes Frites. The fries are unbelievable and there are some odd 40-50 sauces. My favorite: wasabi.
