This is a great spot to grab a nice fat burger loaded with locally sourced ingredients and toppings. They always have great things on tap.. .think Hill Farmstead... and they have a great outdoor patio for the warmer months. If you are in Burlington and wandering around Church St. give the Farmhouse a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.
