This place is sucks, the service is also sucks, very expensive, food do not have taste at all, I ordered Homos and falafel combo, the taste very smellier to anything except Homos and Falafel, and Also I order Tea with ment, it was horrible. Beside all that we order desert called Konafeh, and they bring to us totally different desert and they insist it's what we order. while we are there, there was a big group of student, they had another bad experience like they missed up with there bills and there order. we were 4 people, we had bad experience and we do not recommend anyone to go there, I'm not sure how this kind of restaurant can service tell now with this kind of service.
