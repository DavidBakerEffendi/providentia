I didn't believe this Yelp listing. 5000+ reviews and almost five stars?! No way! NO WAY! Way. This street food is legitimately forming a painful addiction within me. I come out of my internship every Tuesday and Wednesday evening and despite there consistently being a 20 person line, I get in that line and wait until I get the magical thing that is the Halal Guys' take on falafel over rice. What really makes their food though is the sauce (and every other reviewer has noted that). The white sauce is out of this world and I could easily guzzle a jug of that on its own. The red sauce, however, is surprisingly understated here. It gives the food a nice acidity (AND HEAT!) that otherwise would be missing. It's definitely spicy though, so if you don't like hot, hot, hot food, perhaps best to avoid. Still, for $6, this is the best food you can get in midtown. Swoon.
