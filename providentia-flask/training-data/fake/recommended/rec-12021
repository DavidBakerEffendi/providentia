I love this place. It's a great place you can bring anyone to because there is really something for everyone- vegetarians, gluten-free, omnivores, and foodies alike. I love the chicken curry buckwheat crepe myself, it's so rich and decadent. They have an impressive selection of traditional French ciders, wine, and beer too. The socca appetizing is a chickpea pancake that is buttery crispy deliciousness!
