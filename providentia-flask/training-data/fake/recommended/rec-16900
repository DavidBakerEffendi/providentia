randomly ended up in parsippany and figured we'd grab lunch.  looked a few indian places up online and this sounded like a good choice.  we got there at about 2:15 and lunch ended at 2:30.  we felt bad showing up so close to the end, but the people couldn't have been nicer.  they brought out the appetizers and they were some of the best we've had.  and the entrees were phenomenal.  I eat and cook a ton of indian and this place is awesome.  nothing negative to say at all.
