Love this place and crave it constantly. The crust is thin, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The toppings are superb and unique. The hot honey makes the pizza sweet, savory, and spicy. The atmosphere is rustic and the smell of pizza intoxicating. Â The service is good once you sit, but the wait can be hours. I like to go early Mon-Thurs.
