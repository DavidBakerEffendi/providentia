My favorite bar in Astoria for sure. They have a great beer selection, bartenders are super friendly and the environment is fun. Only complaint is that on Friday and Saturday nights, when the bar gets crowded, it becomes extremely difficult to buy a drink. I believe they should be scheduling one more helping hand behind the bar on those nights. As for the food, I haven't tried that much but the Kale Cob Salad is amazing. They also have great fries and fried pickles.
