Perfect time to come here is Sat. right before they open. No wait, and we just missed the lunch rush. I'm not a hardcore burger fan but this burger was good. Ordered a medium rare Original. Very juicy, very fatty. My favorite was the Portuguese bun. So soft and buttery. Couldn't taste any of the shitake mushrooms though. If it didn't say so on the menu wouldn't have known it was there. I dislike the cheese and onions but the Parmesan crisp was great and the onions were cooked down so that they were tasteless. As a side, we orderd the truffle fries. Crispy fries, but would not have paid extra for the truffle oil. Friendly waiter, nice restaurant, but overall, thought burger was a little small for the price. I was still hungry afterwards.
