My friends keep telling me how good the lobster rolls are so I finally went out of my way and came here for dinner with a buddy last night. Red hook isn't the easiest place to get to without a car, but it's very easy to find parking if you do. You order on one side and bring it to the other for a sit down meal. Thumbs up to their lobster roll, it was full of lobster meat so every bite was quite fulfilling. The price is steep but it's comparable to all the other lobster joints in NYC. My friend ordered a clam chowder and said that was good too. The lobster mac-n-cheese were not so great though, I will definitely pass on that next time. We both liked their root beer soda, my friend had the lemon lime and I had the blueberry. It was different and refreshing!
