I found JB's to be the perfect combo for getting a drink and seeing a live band.  If you are hungry-just go to the downstair area, get their cheeseburger (pretty tasty) and then go upstairs to see a live show.  This place has it right as you can enjoy your food downstairs and actually carry a conversation, without being bombarded by a band.  They also carry Dogfish on tap-a big plus for them.
