My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out for brunch this morning and with one meal it has become our new favorite restaurant. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and accommodating. You know when you feel like the bartender is your long lost best friend? This was one of those times. My boyfriend can eat a lot so we ordered four entrees to split - the chicken and waffles Benedict, the huevos rancheros with crawfish, the brisket grilled cheese, and the special short rib hash. It was all amazing, but the huevos rancheros really stood out. We also had a few cocktails while we were there - the southern bloody mary, gin and roses, and the grapefruit shandy. Again, all great. Â  So we're sitting there after our meal basking in the glory of our delicious food and the manager brings over more food on the house! They gave us a complimentary milk and cookies. So yeah, like I said, new favorite restaurant. Great food, great drinks, great service. Can't wait to try their dinner.
