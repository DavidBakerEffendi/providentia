Great place to come for lunch! Good variety of food but I prefer the packaged food rather than hot buffet style food, which they weight by the lb. That's a way for them to overcharge you for a small amount of food. Anyways, I'm so in love with their Kim chi stew. This is what I usually come for! I got all my friends addicted to it as well. Must try!
