The diner in Randolph, NJ is amazing so when we came to our daughter's wedding in Princeton, NJ we wanted a good breakfast to hold us off until the afternoon.  The gentleman who seated us was nice enough.  The waitress a doll, simply perfect.  So was the waitress yesterday.  We had two different breakfasts 2 days in a row and enjoyed them both.  There was a lot of food so I cut the meal in half and had enough for lunch.  I can't vouch for the food at lunch or diner but I will certainly come back if I'm in the region again.  For diner food this place was great!
