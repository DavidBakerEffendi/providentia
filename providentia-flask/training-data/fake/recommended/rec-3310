The most amazing food where portions & prices are balanced well. The food was excellent. I highly suggest the jalape√±o au gratin potatoes. It was my birthday and so they let me pick any dessert for FREE. The peanut butter pie is insanely delicious, made with Hershey products. The meats are from corn fed animals. Try the ahi tuna tartare for the app. I can't wait to go back!
