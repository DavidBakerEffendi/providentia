Was here for a friend s wedding and it was so unbelievably great. They had brisket, smoked lobster, chicken wings and ribs along with Mac n cheese, collard greens and corn bread AND the best red velvet cupcakes i ve ever had on the menu and I ate everything on my plate. I used to work at the Waldorf with an amazing French pastry chef and, sorry jean-Claude, these cupcakes blew yours out of the water!. I love food and eating but i get full so soon after my first bite....thankfully this place cured me of that at least momentarily. It s so low key and laid back and the owner and chefs are super duper deluxely nice....the waitresses not so much but who wants to work on a 90 degree day when you're seventeen? Aside from being a happy event, the day was perfect and the place was perfect. I ve been here before so I know I wasn't over wrought by the wedding. :-)
