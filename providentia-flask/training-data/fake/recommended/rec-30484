Make reservations for your convenience and comfort! First of all, SO WORTH GOING! the food is exquisite! My friend and I ordered a drink, appetizer and entree and we couldn't even finish our meal. We were very intrigued with sheep milk (mostly because we were ignorant and didn't know the existence of such yummy milk!...). Sheep milk ravioli and Sheep milk dumplings were beyond our expectations. Surprisingly such a comfort food. We ordered the home-made sausage appetizer and the sausage definitely tasted different and delectable! Their special cocktails are mouth-watering too. Secondly, this place is bigger than it looks from the outside. The main floor looks like a family restaurant as said by other reviewers but the downstairs of this restaurant definitely change the ambience into a more romantic and formal setting. Thirdly, PRICE FRIENDLY! we ordered drinks, appetizers, and entree and we still payed below $65 (including tax and tip). I definitely recommend this place to friends and visitors and I myself will be frequenting this restaurant more often!
