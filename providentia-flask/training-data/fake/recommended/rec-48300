I'm so upset that I have to deduct a star at this practically perfect Italian restaurant, however the slow service was too hard to ignore. I came here on a busy Saturday evening, so I can only assume that's the reason why the service wasn't as prompt as I wished it would be. The waiters were really sweet, however having to ask for more water constantly and waiting for the check for over 15 minutes isn't exactly impressive service. I'll let it slide, though. It could've been worse. Aside from that, however, the food and wine at Piccoli Trattoria is some of the best you'll find. Fresh meats and seafood and delectable pastas. For an appetizer, we ordered the grilled calamari which was tender and grilled to perfection with an awesome charred flavor. With a squeeze of lemon on top, this appetizer really hit the spot. For a main course I ordered the pan seared duck with a pomegranate vinaigrette and it was the most tender and flavorful duck I've ever eaten. After eating that plate, I've officially crowned duck my new favorite dish. I finished off my wonderful meal with a cappuccino and the Tortino cake: a warm chocolate cake with a chocolate-caramel center and whipped cream on top. Truly divine! I can't wait to come back here again.
