I remember my first lamb &chicken combo I had here. 'Twas on a cold Christmas morning approximately four thirty. I had been thrown into the cab among my three other friends in attempt to fill our burning,empty stomach we voluntarily suffered from all kinds of alcohol. My first bowl of chicken and lamb combo with the firing hot red and rich creamy white sauce burst my tastebuds and I refused to remain drunk for I had to be fully awake to devour the rest. I had fallen in love every since!
