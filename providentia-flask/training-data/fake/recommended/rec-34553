I come to this place every time I'm in NY, so clearly I love the food there. However, every time I order a Kati roll, I feel it's missing something, something like salt or spice or lemon juice, I just can't pin point it but these rolls always leave me hanging. I noticed they started selling chatni so maybe that will elevate the rolls to perfection, I'll have to try it next time.
