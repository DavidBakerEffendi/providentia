Just had Saturday brunch here this morning and it was great! As a previous reviewer noted there was a 10 minute wait as it's pretty busy but we were seated promptly and our waitress was very quick to take our orders. As for the food, I got the Eggs Benedict (Canadian bacon on an English muffin with two poached eggs and potatoes on the side). The eggs were cooked to perfection and the entire plate was extremely delectable. The flavors came together perfectly. Plus it comes with orange juice (fresh squeezed I think) and your choice of cappuccino, Americano, or espresso. At $15.50, this is a pretty good deal. The only thing that would have made it better would have been outdoor seating. Guess I'll just have to get there earlier next time!
