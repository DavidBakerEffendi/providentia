I really like this place. Ate here with a co-worker and we shared the Salmon and the crepe Suzette. Do need to warn you to consider the Salmon before ordering. The description sounded really good and the presentation of the dish was beautiful, however, the quality of the salmon was very poor. I think that it just wasn't fresh but the taste of the meal itself was not great. However, the Crepe saved the day. It was truly delicious. Sweet taste of vanilla along with the burst of orange and a tang of grand Marnier.
