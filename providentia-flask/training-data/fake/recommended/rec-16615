This place is HANDS DOWN my favorite thai place in brooklyn! I get the same plate every time I come here or order take out and of course that plate is pad thai! They give you a very large portion and so I always end up making my food last for 2 meals. They deliver fast too! But it might have something to do with me living 6 blocks away, but still very fast. Also the prices are AWESOME!
