I love hole in the wall restaurants, and this is probably one of the most well known in lower manhattan.  With 4 dumplings for $1.25, there's no reason to complain about price, but one must be savvy when ordering.  Having tried a wide variety of the menu's offerings, here the low down on what to order when navigating Vanessa's: Chive and Pork or Cabbage and Pork Dumplings- nothing special, no better than the frozen variety.   Pork Fried bun- quite good, and actually a bargain as this is harder to find in chinatown than dollar dumplings. Sesame pancake- plain, but great when dipped in the dumpling sauce. Keep in mind this is more of a bread consistency, not the fried, greasy scallion pancake most expect. Sesame Pancake with roasted pork- This was the standout of the order, delicious,, and at $2.50, still a deal.  The pork juices were sopped up in the pancake, and the edges of the pork are crispy, truely delicious. Wonton Noodle soup- not special, on par with takeout soup. All in all, you can find a good, cheap meal at Vanessa's, just be careful!
