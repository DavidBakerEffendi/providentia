A decent, well-decorated sushi-bar near Independence Mall with the cutest mascot ever (a little dancing salmon sashimi). I've been here over 5 times and had good experiences. The warm sake is always good and house sake is a reasonable price. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Make a reservation if you can because otherwise it might be tough to get in, especially on a weekend. There are a lot of dates going on here, my favorite thing to do is people watch the dates to see how they are going.
