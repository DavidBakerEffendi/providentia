Great place for grabbing sandwiches TO GO. In fact, this is one of those places you never notice until someone brings you in and you have a great sandwich that forces you to recognize the goodness that is Grillmasters. I've had various items from the egg and cheese sandwiches on bagel (super yummy) to chicken salad on hoagie with pickles and hotpeppers (don't judge me). All items are fresh and as someone who usually cringes at the idea of ordering chicken/egg/tuna salad from a deli I have to say everything is extremely fresh and made really well. The coffee is also really good, nothing special - not La Colombe I don't think - just good simple deli coffee. Â If you live or work in the neighborhood and want a quick and extremely CHEAP lunch or breakfast to go be sure to check out Grill Master Deli!
