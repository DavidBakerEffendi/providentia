No other has come close to this one!!  I have yet to find one in the Bay Area.  (Sounds almost like a relationship...)  So if anyone knows of one that is truly spellbinding, PLEASE let me know.  I will follow you there! The noodles are freshly kneaded.  There is a glassed viewing room downstairs for all you curious folks to gawk at as the staff do their magic.  No wonder this place is so addictive.  What in the world do they put in those flours?? Decor is nice and modern with a black & red theme.  I heard from a friend who currently works there that Sarah Jessica Parker came here a few times before.  I know, I know.  A lot of you are probably thinking,  "Who frickin' cares?  Big whoop dee doo."  However, for all of us crazed Sex & the City fans (myself included), this is national news!! Anyhoo, back to the food....where were we... Oh yes.  Why one star short of a perfect five you ask??  A tab bit pricey....$15+ for a bowl but it equals out at the end since portions are pretty reasonable.  The pork buns are expensive but scrumptious.  Also,  the lines are ridiculously LONG.  The lunch rush will feel like a Friday happy hour spot at the latest club.   So ladies, don't come if you're PMSing and gentlemen, please leave your testosterone-fuelled glow at the door.  Thanks.
