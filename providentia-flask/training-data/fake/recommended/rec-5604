This has to be one of the worst Lobster Mac & Cheeses I've ever had--or Mac & Cheese of any type for that matter. They swore it was one of their best sellers, but I doubt it's a repeat order for most. Two other people ordered it at the table too and were just as disappointed. No one finished more than half of their order.  The chives were overpowering, lobster was okay, but the cheese tasted like cream cheese and the use of orzo as the pasta just made it into a casserole and there wasn't enough texture.  If Kraft Mac & Cheese is a 5 on a scale of 1-10, this falls below that. Other tables agreed, it sounded better than it was.  It definitely wasn't worth the money.  The rest of the food was okay (passable for an inexpensive chain restaurant), but they definitely don't know what type of restaurant they want to be based on the menu. Before that, we reserved a table for 10 and still had a 30-minute wait once we got there.  Also, the decor is ridiculous with shag carpet over the bar, retro lights, and bathroom tile on the walls. The waitress also raved that it was done by some designer from Los Angeles, but the guy must have been either washed up or high as a kite because this place makes no sense. I'll not be going back and I'd suggest others not bother... Unless you're from Restaurant: Impossible.  This place could use some help.
