Came here for brunch on Sunday. Disappointing to say the least - bloody Mary and a mamosa - ordered chicken & waffles special - eggs Benedict - latte Positive - food tasted good - attentive staff Negative - The brioche for the eggs Benedict was barely toasted. Plating was also lacking, no greens. - chintzy piece of pork belly - waffle undercooked. No crunch at all and it was only 2 quarters of a small waffle. - chintzy servings of chicken, bony thigh and small drumstick. -Latte came out as a cappuccino, although it was the first day for the person who made it. Another case of inflated reviews on Yelp. Maybe deserves a 2.5 star
