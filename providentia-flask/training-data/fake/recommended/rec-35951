This place has got pre-theater dinner down to a science. They pack it in and keep things moving, but in a really good way. $23 for their special of a really well stocked anti-pasti plate and then all you can eat fresh pasta selections waiters bring around to you. Very very good food and very inexpensively priced and a perfect pre-theater trip. We also had kids with us and pasta+kids = easy. The pasta our night was some paperdelle and tomato which was simple and ok for me. The mushroom ravioli were fantastic and my favorite was the short rib gemelli which had a very rich, unctuous sauce. Really great dinner and service.
