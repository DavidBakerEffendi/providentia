Will be going back.  Everything was pretty tasty and the entrees were not over priced. My bf ordered Bacardi and coke and he actually tasted the Bacardi and not just the coke.  The crowd is an upbeat crowd.  Very mixed.....many in their 20-30's and some in their 50-60's, probably for a family gathering. Overall, I will return.
