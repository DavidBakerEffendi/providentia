Being my first time here I didn't know what to expect but the service was good and the food was absolutely amazing. I had the grilled chicken burrito and they were very generous with the amount of chicken they stuffed in it. It had great flavor and it was quite enjoyable. Needless to say, Â I can't wait to go back.
