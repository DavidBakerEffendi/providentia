Executive summary: Great simple food. Came here for lunch with a guest. Had the soup-dumplings (shoronpo) to share while we individually had mabo-tofu, country noodles, and chicken soup. I asked for my mabo-tofu to be made with pork -- it's on the vegetarian menu and so is normally made without meat. They made a perfect mabo-tofu, just the right blend of Szechuan spices. My dining companions seemed less pleased with their entrees though. The country noodles seemed greasy and the soup thin. The soup-dumplings were good but needed more soup inside (and one was DOA - broken - on arrival, so no soup for you!). This was all fine for an inexpensive lunch. The serving sizes could be a bit smaller so that everything could be eaten on the spot (I don't like to doggy-bag my lunches) and prices reduced a tad and/or quality raised a notch. But I'll come again so I think it's a-ok! Â (fight yelp inflation!)
