The food was ok, a bit salty but not bad.  The Service how ever was horrible.  The waiter, in the middle of taking are order, walked away and totally forgot about our table.   He was in a far off place that night, altered but who know's what but I will never go back.  He also forgot to put in our order, fill water glasses and generally was full of pretty bad table side manners. Bad service can sometimes be made up for by good food, but not here.  NYC has so many other better restaurants.  I'd move on to the next place if I were you.
