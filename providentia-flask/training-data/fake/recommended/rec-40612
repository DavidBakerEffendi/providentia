I used to love this place, recently not so much. If I ever do end up going back again and they blow me away I'll update my review to a 5 star. For now they get 3 stars only for some fond memories. I've been here for a few momentous times in my life. Once was for one of my more epic birthday years where I saw Phantom of the Opera then went here with a bunch of friends and family for dinner. Another time was right after my husband and I became engaged. This actually was our go to after Phantom of the Opera meal choice. The portions are family style, if you go in for the first time and you don't know this place too well you'll probably flip out over the prices until you understand that one dish will feed at least three people. It used to be great, the food used to blow me away, the service used to be impeccable. Recently this place has been nothing but upsetting and strife causing. Trying to get in has become impossible during the times that I tried to get in, recently my husband tried to get a table for us, I was down the street but they wouldn't sit him until I came in, I was literally 2 stores away and they gave the table to someone else. The last time we went my eggplant parm tasted so strange, it had a fishy taste to it and I think they put meat inside of it. As I said before three stars for the fond memories, if I end up back here and it's gotten better I'll give a review update and take it back up to 5 stars.
