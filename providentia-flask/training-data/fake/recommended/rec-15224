I was staying at Apple Hostels right around the corner while I was in town for a librarian conference, and even though I had access to a kitchen and had brought canned tuna and peanut butter from home, it had snowed every day since I had arrived and I just wanted to eat something warm, darn it!  So I searched for cheesesteak places near where I was staying, and this one was literally 500 feet from my bed.  Sold. Oh, my gosh, you guys.  It was SO good. My Mom's family is from Lancaster and my Dad's family is from South Jersey, so I've done the Philly tourist thing a few times.  I know cheesesteaks pretty well for an out-of-towner.  I've known since I was a child that I prefer provolone to whiz, but I got the whiz here anyway. It was amazing.  I'm never switching back.
