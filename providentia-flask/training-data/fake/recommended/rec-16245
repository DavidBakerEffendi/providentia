My favorite burger in the city.  You can't beat a bistro burger at 2:30am after a night of drinking.  Also they have an excellent jukebox that i always have to put at least 7 songs on every time.  Even after I'm done with my burger I can sit and drink some cheap McSorley's until my songs finish playing.
