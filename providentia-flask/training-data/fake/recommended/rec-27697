I LOVE New York pizza! Thin crust, and for me, just a plain slice or two. No need for pepperoni or sausage or anything else. I want the perfect cheese to sauce balance.... and a hint of oregano and garlic. The bottom of the crust needs to be dry and maybe the teeny-tiniest bit charred. This place came pretty close. The slices were possibly a bit on the small side, but what can you expect these days for two bucks? Service was quick, although not overly friendly. All in all not a bad little place to stop for a quick lunch before stopping at the Staten Island Museum on a rainy Tuesday afternoon (p.s. The museum is FREE on Tuesdays from noon until 2 during the summer. Cute little place).
