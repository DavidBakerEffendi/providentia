I can't wait to go back to this place when the weather warms up and you can sit outside!! The back patio is gorgeous--a wooden deck with the serenity of potted plants everywhere you look mixed with the urban feel of the brick buildings with the oh-so New York iron fire escapes surrounding. This little oasis makes you want to sit back, order a bottle of wine, and make a lazy day out of it. That's just what we did... We ordered a bottle of wine (good choices here), a salad, and a panini, all of which I thought were great! If you're super starving and a big eater, the portions are a little on the small side, though I didn't feel hungry when I walked out of there. I thought the food was extremely high quality and that the prices were reasonable considering what you get. I definitely will be back!
