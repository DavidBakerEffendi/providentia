You know the deal with this place so I'll keep it short.  Don't listen to the cheesesteak snob elitists who bash it.   You have to try it, along with Geno's, get both, they are right next to each other.  I prefer it with provolone, whiz is good too.  I like the bread better at Geno's, but they are less generous than Pat's with the meat.  Super greasy and awesome, prepare for the food coma by making sure you are not the driver if you are making the trip from out of town (done it twice so far).  They can be grumpy here, first time I went I had a cup from Geno's since I ate there first and rested it on the counter to pay for my food.  The guy said he wouldn't have served me if he saw it first.  Yikes!
