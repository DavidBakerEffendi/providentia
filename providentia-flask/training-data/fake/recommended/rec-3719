ive been here a couple of times. after waiting in line for an hour the 1st time, i had sense enough to go during off hours the next few times. this is probably the best street meat ive had in nyc.. but king of falafel in astoria is close behind. on second thought. i think i like king of falafel a bit better; but i digress. i love the 53rd and 6th hot sauce. but be careful if you want to taste anything for the rest of the day (or your life). it is very spicy! they also have some of the best rice ive tasted from these carts the only reason i cant go any higher than three stars is because after eating there one night, our whole party had a mild stomach virus the next day.. no bueno.
