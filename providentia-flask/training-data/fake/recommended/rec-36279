The food is absolutely delicious! Let me tell you.  Oysters, Bone Marrow, Kale Salad, MacNCheese, Port Chop and Chicken entrees.  The bone marrow is something else.  You eat it and you think you have died and went to rich heaven. :)  Topped on some Texas Toast with those onions.  UNBELIEVABLE.    The smoked onion rings side also topped my list of never tried before. Of note, they are kid friendly, but no high chairs, just booster seats.
