Went on a vacation to New York and wanted to try some restaurants that we don't have in Southern California. I watch Iron Chef America and definitely wanted to come here. My girlfriend and I came for one of our date nights and the restaurant was so hip. As soon as we walked in we noticed hip hop playing softly in the background. So cool considering it was a Michelin Star restaurant. We had the Sunday Supper, which is a three course meal. We had the Hiramasa tartare and bone marrow for appetizers. I never liked bone marrow to begin with, but absolutely enjoyed the tartare. I forgot what it was called, but the waiter told me to savor this tiny thing that was supposed to compliment the tartare. I ate the tartare very slowly savoring every bite and my goodness sake it was amazing! For the entree, we got the Chicken Under the Brick. Warning: this feeds two and you will be full off of it (we ended up getting it to-go). My girlfriend was hesitant since she is always telling me "What could you possibly do with chicken? Chicken is just chicken." It was so good! It was the first time I have ever had a chicken this tender, moist, and juicy. Needless to say, the girlfriend owed me an apology haha. For the dessert, I ordered the banana pecan pie bread pudding. Let's just say that I can't remember how good it was since I devoured it so quickly. With every bite, I just wanted to get off my seat and scream with joy, but I had to hold my composure. It was my only Michelin Star restaurant and I was left very impressed.
