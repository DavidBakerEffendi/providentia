As soon as we moved to Montclair, multiple people urged us to give this place a visit. Â On warm nights in summer I've walked my dog passed the place and it was always full with a warm feel and faint scent of flavor and spice in the air. One year later my husband and I decide to finally go and I feel I have done an injustice to myself. The food was absolutely delicious from start to end and I cleaned my plate each course. I've been missing out for one year!!!! My four stars could easily be 5 stars however, on this particular night the service was a bit...unusual. I'm going to chalk this up to a full moon and basic what the heckness but just know the people in the restaurant that night and I have a time and place we've been together with events that no one would believe if we told you ( note:if a waitress comes back to take your order 4 times...and she chugs your beer...ask for the manager ) Back to the food, we started with the Savour Sampler. Empenadas were to die for. The tostones with cavier and cheese were excellently crispy, smoky and freshest cheese was used ( goat ). They served it with what I thought was cole slaw but only realized after I had a mouthful it was the spiciest, crunchiest, vegetable type slaw I've ever had. No water could save me, I had to "man" up till it went away. My husband devoured it. To this day I can still taste that mushroom black rice. My goodness, the flavor of everything on my plate. If I was ballin I would eat here at least once a week.
