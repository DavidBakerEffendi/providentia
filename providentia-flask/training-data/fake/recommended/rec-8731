I give them 5 stars for their pork hirata buns- absolutely the best thing ever!! The pork buns are a MUST. I usually order 2 orders of them (they come in twos) when I come with a friend, since ONE IS JUST NOT ENOUGH. Their ramen is great. I get their Akamaru Modern. It's my favorite ramen. I think it's their most popular ramen. There is also a bar in front of the restaurant. I had some kind of Green Tea cocktail there, and it was good. The service is great. You really feel welcome when you get to your seat because all the workers greet you out loud in Japanese. The atmosphere is nice and clean. I saw couple parties who shared tables (because it's so crowded). I guess it isn't that bad if you don't mind. The wait is usually an hour, but the pork buns make it all worth it.
