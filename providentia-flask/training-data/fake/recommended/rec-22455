I really wanted to like it, I did.......but Ugh! If you get the smoothie and you want it cold make sure you ask them to blend it with ice. If you don't it will come out warm ::gag::. The server was nice and everything about it and re-blended our smoothies but it just wasn't that good, my friend didn't even drink hers. My other friend got a sandwich and also wasn't very impressed with the taste or anything, kinda bland...he only ate half.
