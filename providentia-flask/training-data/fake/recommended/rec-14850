Great food, great staff! I have had the chicken and lamb vindaloo several times and it's always delicious. I get it with the garlic or plain naan and raita and it's really enough for two people. The small complimentary dessert is a nice touch. I definitely recommend! And remember, asking for extra spicy is just that.
