one of the biggest let downs ever. i've been wanting to come here to eat for years but the wait was always too long and so i always went to the bakery side for food. today there was space at the bar so i went and sat there for breakfast. i ordered eggs florentine, a side of bacon and a side of homefries. eggs florentine- Â 2 poached eggs on top of steamed/boiled soggy spinach and 3 pieces of artichoke. there was almost no hollandaise sauce, and there was no english muffin on the bottom... this was tasteless and bland..if there had been more hollandaise sauce it may have been better, and this is the first time i've gotten eggs florentine with no english muffin. bacon- was bacon.. thick not crunchy, sort of hard homefries- i could see the potential in these, they had good flavor but were stale. the edges of the potatoes were chewy and dry like they had been left out for awhile and the inside was sort of chalky for the limited of time i'm in nyc i'm sad that i wasted a meal and stomach space on this place... granted it was my 3rd choice after cafe habana (not open yet), and cafe falai...(i accidentally walked into bottega falai instead of cafe falai)
