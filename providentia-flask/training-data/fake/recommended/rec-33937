I had read about this spot in the Times and was excited when we walked past it during an epic wander that started in Brooklyn Bridge Park.  We pulled in at about 10:15 pm and were the only ones in the small ordering room.  This place definitely has a lot of options, but from what I understand, the only real choice is what type of lobster roll to order.  We all went with the Connecticut (hot and buttery) over the Maine (cold with mayo) and were satisfied.  Though the menu promised a very buttery experience, I didn't think it was excessive.  It complimented the meal well.  The portions of lobster meat helped to justify the big price ($18).  A big dining room with picnic tables is available next door, also a nice plus.  Overall, the food and spot are fresh and it makes sense why when you see tomorrow's lobsters crawling around in two giant hot tubs.  If you're going to eat in Red Hook, this should be near the top of your list.
