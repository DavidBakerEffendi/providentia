I really don't think it's as good as everyone says. We got a large cheese and a large sausage. I picked up a sausage slice and everything immediately slid off. I like my toppings on my pizza, thanks. The pizza was greasy and black on the bottom. In my opinion, burnt pizza isn't exactly great. I could see the appeal. It's in a nice area, so I guess it could make for a nice night out, but it's really not worth all of the acclaim.
