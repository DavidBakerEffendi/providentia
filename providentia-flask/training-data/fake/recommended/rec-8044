I have moved past having a crush on Rex. We are now in a relationship. In short time, this has become our go-to restaurant in the neighborhood. Lou always has some new drinks for us to try, and there are often interesting new dinner specials from the kitchen. On the regular dinner menu, we've become fans of the pork loin and collards, and the mac&cheese is always a go-to for a bar snack. For Philly Beer Week, Rex hosted a tasting menu with Neshaminy Creek Brewing, and we had wonderful IPA-battered catfish, as well as root-beer braised short ribs. This place just seems to get better and better, so we look forward to seeing what's in store for summer.
