If you are willing to wait for 30 mins outside just to get inside then another 15 minutes to be seated, then you are in for a great treat.  We didn't have much expectation except that it is conveniently located across the Metropolitan Museum of Arts. But their menu while limited and maybe a bit pricy, it's all worth it. I have the sausage with sauerkraut and Dijon. I must say it was delicious. Their spicy egg with paprika is also excellent. But their desserts are the real surprise.  The Vienna Dark chocolate cake and apple strudel were out of this world.
