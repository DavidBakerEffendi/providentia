I want to start off my review by apologizing to the entire ilili staff for the ridiculous rowdiness of my group. We were too many and our drinks were strong, I know we were annoying, thank you for not letting your annoyance show n.n I hosted my birthday dinner here, and it definitely was an excellent choice. Lebanese cuisine is my favorite, and this place certainly did not disappoint. Since we were ten people, we decided to go for the mezza royale and sample a little bit of everything, and, except for baba ghanouj, which I have never, ever liked, everything was absolutely exquisite. Service was friendly, Billy was an excellent server, very patient with our large party. In the end they brought out a dessert with a candle and I am still not sure if someone from my table ordered it or the staff just did it because I had mentioned in my reservation it was my birthday or because my group randomly sang happy birthday while eating our mezze. Anyway, I don't know, I had one too many "From Beirut with Passion" cocktails (must try!), but I was very happy nonetheless. The only downside, I feel like some of the staff, especially in the front area, take themselves a little too seriously. And so do maaaany of the guests in the restaurant. It's a shame, I think pretentious attitudes actually take away from the awesome essence of the place, and make it look like the kind of venue where people go to try hard to be something. Anyway, I can't wait to be back. Next time less drunk and with a smaller group, dear ilili staff, I promise. You guys were great.
