LITERALLY INSULTED BY THE CASHIER!!!!  I have been to ruthies a couple times for their pizza, and the most recent time, when i wanted to pay for my order, the cashier (bald and left handed.  avoid him)  addressed me with an insulting term that apparently they refer to me with in the kitchen (Im not even a regular customer). I will not repeat what i was called. I can't believe that businesses can get away with that kind of verbal abuse
