Amélie is a straight throwback to the experience of a neighborhood French bistro. It serves consistently good food and wine for reasonable prices. The only incongruity is the decor which is neither French nor interesting. They have an excellent deal on wine flights where you can choose ANY three wines from the wine menu for $10 during happy hour ( $16 otherwise). The foodie equally well priced and some faves on the menu: Goat cheese ball: pistachio encrusted and served on a bed of caramelized onions and drizzled with honey. Delicious! Foie gras: not the highest quality but still very good. Perfectly balanced by the wine poached pears and frisée salad it's served with. A little fatty, a little salt, a little sweet and some bitter! Onion soup: the melted cheese on top is sublime. The soup itself was a little sweet but still great for cold days Duck confit: Crispy skin, moist inside. Really good. Not a fan of the potato/mushroom thing it was served with but since the duck is so good that can be overlooked Molten chocolate cake: good. Perfect ending to a perfectly good meal
