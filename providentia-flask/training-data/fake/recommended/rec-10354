I have been going to Yerba Buena for years now for one simple reason, it is the perfect dining experience. The service is impeccable and Giovanny treats you like family.  From the moment you walk in you are treated to wonderful ambiance and incredible food and drinks.  Over the years I have had pretty much everything on the menu and have yet to have a bad dish.  It is the prefect place for a romantic dinner, to take friends, out of town guest and they have a great room downstairs for a larger sized party.
