Thank you Yelpers! I was desperately looking for something new for lunch near work and a quick search lead me to NY Dosas. I found the little cart on the south side of Washington Square, all wrapped up in plastic to battle the cold. I peeked in and saw a happy man cooking dosas. No line today--it's friggin' cold! I got the special Pondicherry dosa. The guy is amazingly cheery and infallibly polite and helpful. He explained exactly what he was cooking me, offered drinks, and thoughtfully offered utensils so I could sit and eat somewhere. I did, which was kinda stupid because it's, like I said, friggin' cold. The dosa was delicious! The potatoes were tasty, the veggies were crisp, and my god I loved the coconut chutney. The soup was good too. The "medium" spiciness isn't bad at all, and I probably could have went spicier. I got in a few bites of piping hot dosa before the chilly air cooled it off. My fingers were freezing off, but my mouth was happily spiced. The dosa looks huge, but it's really not. Perfect if you're hungry, but not "omg, I need to devour something."
