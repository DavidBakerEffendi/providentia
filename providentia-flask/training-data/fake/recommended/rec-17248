I used to really enjoy this place. You'd call me a regular. It's convenient, cheap, and friendly. But recently things have gotten sloppy. My boyfriend Â attempted to split a check between cash and card which was a 50/50 split. The server took the cash and charged the card the entire amount. Suzy rectified the situation which we appreciated. I want to continue to support this local business. I would strongly suggest that Suzy hire a restaurant floor manager. Also, they often close long before 2am. Last call can be as early as midnight. Lastly, I suspect I've gotten food poisoning from them. I can't be sure, and don't want to make false accusations but I'm pretty it was from this establishment. I still go here from time to time for drinks and live music, but that's about it.
