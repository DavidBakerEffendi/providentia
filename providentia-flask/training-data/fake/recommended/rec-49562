This place is awesome! Great Healthy food nice portions. I eat raw mainly but I was looking for something other then raw restaurants that offered similar too what I eat and came across this place. It's a small place with helpful staff and the food was divine I had the La Fiesta roll and Spicy Mang were awesome. This place is Semi Raw, cause they do organic vegetable rolls(raw) Â with Black Rice (not Raw) but came very close to what I eat just minus the rice. Please come up with rolls that are completely raw and you'll be an even bigger success. Great place tasty food, Awesome!
