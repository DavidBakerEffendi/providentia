Ate here for restaurant week and really enjoyed it! Customer service was just how I like it.  Server was helpful, but not intrusive.  She let us sit and talk after we signed our bill. Food was fantastic! I was surprised at the generous quantity of the food at such a nice restaurant, but they didn't take any shortcuts.  That said, it wasn't too much food.  High quality, great taste, presentation, etc. Atmosphere and physical appearance were also great.  Restaurant was open and lively but not loud.  I liked the style of the fixtures, decorations, and colors.  The floor to ceiling windows to the street are awesome.
