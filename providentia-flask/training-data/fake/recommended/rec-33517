I'm puzzled by the reviews for Olea.  I gave up on it after two visits.  It's a beautiful room and the staff is friendly enough, but the food is blah.  This is difficult to explain, but the food manages to be bland, while simultaneously being overseasoned.  There seems to be a "if we throw enough stuff on it, it's bound to be good" mentality here.  A pork chop came out mostly gristle and fat, while the tiny edible portion was dry and had a bizarre mix of spices.  If I tasted it blindfolded I would never guessed it to be pork.  This held true of the other dishes I tried, including a plate of toasted almonds doused (drenched, dredged through, slathered) with way, way, way too much paprika.   It's a shame.  I walk by, and the place is so damned inviting, it looks lovely in all seasons and it's convenient.  But alas the food, the food stinks.
