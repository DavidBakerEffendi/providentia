My husband and I were talking and he confirmed to me that yes I did do reviews for all of these restaurants in Philly and many of them seem to have been taken down. But I never got any e-mails from Yelp HQ. Maybe this one because I gave it 3 stars and not 5.   Yelp says they have honest reviews but if they are taken down if someone pays for advertising how can anyone trust Yelp? Yelp left my pictures up but took down the reviews. Look at the dates for the pictures.   Anyway not sure what the fuss is about this place. We are used to juicy succulent meat and we got this dry over cooked pork at least when we were there. Call me simple but I like juicy pork. I did not know dry pork was popular but to each his own.
