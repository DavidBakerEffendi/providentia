We've ordered from natureworks a few times before and had good experiences overall. This time, I think they just got a little lazy with their preparation. The tuna salad was in the shape of a can or tupperware container, and actually had chunks of ice mixed in with the fish. This was not appetizing, and the melting ice on the salad did not make for a nice meal. We ordered a side of sweet potatoes which were very good, which when combined with previous experiences prompted the 2nd star here. I always like to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but in Manhattan it's hard to do that with so many other choices within 10 blocks!
