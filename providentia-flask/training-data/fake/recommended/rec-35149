This place is wonderful! I have been twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner. My sister and I live super close by and we were really excited when it opened up. The best thing about this place is the absolutely delicious food. At brunch my sister got the Farmhouse breakfast and I got the griddle cakes. My sister's meal came with delicious turkey sausage, toast, roasted potatoes and a frittata. Totally devoured.Their griddlecakes were the best I have in as long as I can remember - thinner than most pancakes and really flavorful, served with whipped cream and fresh fruit. We returned a week later with our other sister for dinner and were not disappointed. They graciously extended happy hour for us and we got two for one pitchers of sangria. We ordered a LOT of food and ate every bite. One of my sisters had a soup and the Riverside burger which had really delicious spicy mayo. Other sister and I split a harvest salad and a grilled cheese, which made a perfect meal. The salad had all my favorite goodies and they were happy to customize (I switched blue cheese for goat cheese and added beets). Everything in the salad was ultra fresh and the house made balsamic dressing was wonderful. Other positives: food is healthy with lots of fresh and organic ingredients, super friendly and warm staff, WiFi, and prices
