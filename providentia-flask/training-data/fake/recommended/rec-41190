Salt and Fat is a wonderful restaurant serving up creative, well presented, and delicious food for people to share. They also serve complimentary popcorn made in bacon fat, which is amazing. The Yellowtail Tartare is one of my favorite plates. With a beautiful presentation and a Â delicious variety of ingredients to mix, it is always a succulent and delectable dish with fresh yellowtail, great spices and sauces, and wonderful crackers. The Korean BBQ wraps are a good dish for those who want finger food. Take the lettuce with the sauces, steak, and caramelized onions, wrap the goodness, and bite in. Always excellent and juicy, and full of good texture and flavor. The English Cucumber Salad is an interesting blend of herbs and spices. The quantity is small, but I recommend getting it at least once. Sesame is interesting, the combination of flavors, herbs, and textures are one of a kind, and it's quite an interesting dish, wonderfully presented. I could say more about each dish, but I will state the following: Their Arctic Char and Long Island Duck Breast are excellent entrees, and the fried chicken and Oxtail Terrine (as well as the Uni Toast, which is warm, moist, and surprisingly non-fishy) are all excellent choices. A final note: They tend to change their menu often. Stay peeled for new dishes.
