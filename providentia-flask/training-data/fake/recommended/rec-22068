Yo, the pizza's so good I can't bring myself to even try the risotto, despite the other slammin' reviews. I totally recommend ordering the prosciutto plate and a cheese plate to munch on, and to stack extra goodies onto your pizzas. Â Not that you have to, but you could (read should). I've never been to the West Village without a celebrity sighting. Like, that'd be my useless super power. This time it was Danny Aiello at Risotteria. He mentioned to his server he was a movie star and I said, "More of a known supporting actor, yeah?" Ol' Danny didn't appreciate that. But, seriously, the pizza is amazing.
