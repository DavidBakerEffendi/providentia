Just returned from a brief visit to the Ascutney area, a gentle and friendly spot of the Northeast USA.  The Red Barn cafe was a gem for us to find.  The people and food are outstanding.  WiFi was a special treat.  We enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and scones and highly recommend both.  Lunch was delicious as well.   A perfect stop off the highway at Exit 8.  It's just a five minute drive east to Route 5 and the Red Barn cafe.  Well worth it.  Closed Mondays.
