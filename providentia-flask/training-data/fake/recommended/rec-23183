2 stars, I've experienced better.  Waiter was attentive, kitchen was slow, food arrived barely warm.  Our table plus only 6 other tables occupied in restaurant at the time- the place was not busy at all.  In the empty restaurant, we enjoyed our own company, but the 2 hours to have lunch was a disappointment.  Four of us ordered from the "Lunch Box" section of the menu. It was a bright sunny day, which clearly showed the overall condition of the facility is tired and worn out (lets put it this way, most of us would not allow our homes to have all of our table tops and chairs with chips, deep scratches, carpet stains, etc).   Overall, in my party, we were disappointed by the experience  I had lunch reservations for five on July 4, 2013.
