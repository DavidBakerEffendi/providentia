This place was so good I went there twice on a four-day business trip. Great for myself (vegetarian) and my coworkers (meat-eaters) to find things everyone likes. The fish tacos were as good, if not better, than the ones I had in San Diego last week. The only reason it doesn't get a five-star is because the servings are SO HUGE. Most people like that, but I can't eat a lot in one serving and since my hotel didn't have a fridge, a lot of food went to waste.
