This is for weekend brunch, which is a bit disappointing considering all the raving reviews on yelp. I got Crab Benedict with fries. Fries are decent, but the crab meat doesn't taste quite fresh, and I'm not a big fan of the sauce. However, service is good and the weekday menu looks more interesting (French African?) so I might give it another try.
