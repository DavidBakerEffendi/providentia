Excellent food and service. Definitely worth the trip! The nasi goreng was a perfect blend of flavors. I could eat it every day. I also loved the bluefish, which came with an assortment of accompaniments (bok choi, roti, chutneys) that worked perfectly together. I'd love to see a similarly inventive and well-balanced set of desserts--a ginger-peppercorn ice cream, maybe...?
