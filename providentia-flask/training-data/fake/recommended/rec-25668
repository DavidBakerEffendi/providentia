I ordered some food from grub hub. So I liked that service, and they were very prompt. However, the spaghetti was probably the worse spaghetti I've had. It was watered down and tasted a little odd. Also, my "garlic bread" was just half a piece of a hoagie bun. The mozzarella sticks were delicious however.
