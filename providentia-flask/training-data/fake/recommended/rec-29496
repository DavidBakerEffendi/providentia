Enjoyed a steak dinner here not too long ago. Co workers go for lunch and dinner and speak about the restaurant often, so I was really happy to finally get a chance to dine here. I enjoyed my beet salad, strip steak, and pan sauteed brussel sprouts. The steak had really awesome flavor, and to this day we all still talk about "wanting that Witherspoon steak"  3 of us got the strip steak, one got the chilean sea bass.  The fish was a nice size portion, and friend said it was delicious.  You know a steak is good when 3 people simultaneously go "mmmm" upon the first bite! Wine by the bottle, delicious and served at the right temperature. The service was non intrusive, and decent for the price tag the bill carries. Everything is alacart, wines by the glass and bottle, full bar, and noise level acceptable for a full house.  This is a great spot to get alil dressed up, celebrate something, or just to lavish yourself or someone else! with a nice meal.
