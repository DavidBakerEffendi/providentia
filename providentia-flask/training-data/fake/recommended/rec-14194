Very flavorful.  The ingredients, flavor, and setting are very true to that of tapas places that you would find on the streets of Barcelona.   I like the intimate setting.  It's a great date place.  However, plan way, way ahead -- the wait can be horrendous -- I waited for close to 1.5 hours.  There are wine bars next door and across the street to hang at before dinner.
