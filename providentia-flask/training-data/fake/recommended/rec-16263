This place feels like home! The atomosphere is so comfortable, Â the staff treats you like family, and the food is as good as a home cooked meal in Italy. Highly recommend for anyone in the area, this place is not to be missed!! I go with friends and on dates with my husband- it can be romantic and intimate or open and friendly- just sit at the bar and you're easily charmed by the bartenders or the company next to you. My fave place in Astoria for sure!!
