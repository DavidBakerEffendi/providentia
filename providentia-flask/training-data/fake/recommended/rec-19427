Here I am in the heart of Philly for a business meeting - with some time to spare to explore the history and culture that this city has to offer. Thanks to my gf AP, we mapped what museums/sights to hit up on a beautiful Thursday morning. But before that...we needed to fuel up so we went to Sabrina's Caf√©. Quiet, clean, & spacious, the server welcomed us in with a friendly attitude and seated us promptly. Brunch is my FAVORITE meal of the day! You get the best of both dining worlds. & here at Sabrina's they have an extensive menu that made an indecisive person like me have an even more difficult time deciding on what to eat! I went with my gut - definitely something sweet. Food: -Stuffed Challah French toast ($9.99) - shared this dish. Two thick slices of challah bread stuffed with cream cheese, topped with bananas and vanilla bean syrup. Pretty sweet according to my friend, yet perfect for me...absolutely THE best kind of French toast I have ever had in my life (so far!). I highly recommend it if you want something sweet and satisfying!! -Two eggs any style w/ fried potatoes, multi-grain bread ($5.89) - standard breakfast food. I think I worked on the French toast more than this dish. I just wanted the protein from the eggs. -Fruit bowl ($5.99) - the fruit tasted fresh! Plenty of strawberries, grapes, and melon. It made me feel less guilty devouring the French toast. Overall: 4. If I happened to be in Philly again, I would definitely go to this place and try the other breakfast/lunch items they offer. Also recommend trying the stuffed challah french toast...it's TO DIE(T) FOR!!
