I've been here so many times and keep coming back! Most of the times I've been here have been for Sunday Brunch, but I did come once for lunch. You mustcome here for Sunday Brunch, if not for the great stay and upbeat atmosphere, but for the cheese grits. They are to die for. Seriously, a must get! I've always gotten the Egg White Omelet with spinach, goat cheese, and a side of home fries. The omelet is huge and so fresh--with the spinach and goat cheese, what's there to complain about? The home fries are also very good. But seriously, you must order a side of their cheese grits--grits cooked with a white cheddar cheese, chives, and jalapeno peppers. I don't remember what I got for lunch, but I think it came with sweet potato fries which are always winners in my book!
