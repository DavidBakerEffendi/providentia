Went for lunch and it couldn't have been a better choice. The room is light and very comfortable, the atmosphere relaxed. Oysters is a little pricey but an excellent Â selection and staff knowledgeably guided us through the unfamiliar options. Seafood stew outstanding and more than enough for one person --the flavors fresh, light and distinct, rarely found in restaurants, where the shellfish and flavors suffer usually from overcooking.
