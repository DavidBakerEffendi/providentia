I am not happy to bring you this review. I may need to give this neighborhood spot another try. Atmosphere is awesome, I give that a 5. Would totally be good for a few beers, a date, or catching a game. Beer selection was also good. I enjoyed my IPA off the chalkboard menu. Service is what brings me to 3 stars. Bartender was rude, inattentive, and not helpful. Take it or leave it...
