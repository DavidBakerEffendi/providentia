I'm from Seattle and here on a theater trip with girlfriends. We went here for a late lunch yesterday and it was amazing. What really stood out besides the fabulous food was the staff. Everyone there wanted to make sure that our experience was great. you really get the feeling that they all are there to work together to make this restaurant the best it can be for their guests. This is especially noteworthy for a restaurant that's been around for awhile The beet salad, roast chicken, shepherd's pie, and pumpkin cheesecake were fantastic. Looking forward to coming back next time I'm in New York!
