This place qualifies as NYC dining institution. It's got 3 stands right in the 6th Ave & W 53rd St area. The chicken kebabs at $4 are real tasty and an absolute deal for the price. Same goes with the $6 chicken and rice trays. Pro tip, grab a plate and bring it over to Central Park. Makes for a great outdoor meal. =)
