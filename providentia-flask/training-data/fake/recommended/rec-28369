I live half a block from this place. It's fantastic. Every time I walk by, whether on my way to catch the bus or walking the dog, I always peek in the windows to get a glimpse of what people are eating and drinking. Heavenly smells are always wafting out the doors. Yum. I've been here for everything they have to offer: lazy Saturday brunch, dinner date, or just a glass of wine at the end of a crazy day. The prices are perfectly reasonable for both drinks and food, the ambience complements the menu, the music is always great, and the servers are sweet and attentive. The last time I had brunch here I had the Warm Bankie and a Bloody Mary... Yum. I've had a solid variety of things from their dinner menu and nothing has ever disappointed me. I'm a particular fan of the potato pancetta pizza and that ever-awesome Baby Jesus Cake! A half-carafe of pretty much any wine they offer is the perfect addition for a meal for two. The first everyone I ever came here, one of the owners happened to be behind the bar. I sat down on a stool and ordered a glass of wine, content with my intention to delve into my book for a while... only to find myself engrossed in conversation with said owner and couple of other patrons at the bar for almost two hours. It's that kind of place. Yay Astoria!
