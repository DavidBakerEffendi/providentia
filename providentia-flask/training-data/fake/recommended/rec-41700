It should not take 45 minutes to get two tacos. Period. End of story. Let me back up. My wife & I love tacos. We joke around that we would probably eat them once a day. And the tacos at Gueros are, for New York at least, really quite good. Far better than the fare served at the entirely overrated Chavellas. But: tacos are not fine dining. They are not slow food. They are the kind of thing you get with a beer on your way to someplace else.  They should not take 45 minutes to arrive, they should not be consistently forgotten and misplaced, and you should not get half your order and then never get the other half. The bottom line is: Gueros is a place I have gone to many times, always hoping they will have solved their weird logistical issues, the kind of issues that make ordering for pickup, showing up, and then grabbing a seat if there is one the most surefire way to get what you want in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not the kind of person who trashes a place for a single screw up, or a single incident, or even two or three. The thing is, though, that Gueros is the kind of place where you have a 33% chance of not getting your food on time, or (like today) at all. There will eventually be a shakeout on Franklin Avenue wherein the large number of amateur hour businesses eventually fade away to be replaced be people who actually know what they are doing.  Gueros, however, will be around for a long time, because there will always be a horde of hungry Pratt kids who don't mind, or are too drunk to notice, they just waited an hour hour a taco. Too bad. I like the food here. They just don't know what they are doing when it comes to logistics.
