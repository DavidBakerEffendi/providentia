Having spent many weekends at RiRa's in my earlier college days - going back as an adult i was pleased to see it was still there!  A group of us head to Burlington for a weekend every February - and we always make sure to stop at RiRa's.  We being a bit older now - head out a bit earlier then back when we were in college - but we usually head to RiRa's around 5 - get a few drinks - get a table - get some apps sometimes dinner - get some more drinks and then hang around for the live band/  We usually call it a nite around 11-12 so its before things get too crazy - but we ALWAYS have a great time.   The service is sometimes a little slower then we like - but we just remind ourselves we are on vacation - and order another drink.  The bar staff is always friendly and outgoing as is the wait staff.  The hostess staff could use a little refresher course in customer service - but for the 5 minutes you have to interact with them its easy to forget. Even though there are multiple locations and there is a RiRa's about 25 mins from us at home - we only go to the one in Burlington!
