Great wings, lousy service. They have great wings here but their website is horrendous and calling their store is a chore. The last time I tried to order online, the site told me that they couldn't deliver at 7pm on a Friday night because they were closed. Really? So I called the store, got hung up on and then had to call back. I asked the person on the other line if they could hear me now and they denied knowing what I was talking about. I explained that I wanted to make sure that she could hear me so she didn't hang up on me again. Needless to say, she was rude about the whole thing, acknowledged that their "website ordering process is horrible" and took my order. Before I could even thank her for her help, she hung up on me (again).
