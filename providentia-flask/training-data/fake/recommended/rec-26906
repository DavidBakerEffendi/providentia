Great little bistro with outside seating. Quaint and romantic on the inside. I shared a beet salad with my boyfriend and had a  nice big steak that was actually medium rare like I asked. My boyfriend had the duck breast per the waiters recommendation. It was unreal. I have never tasted duck done correctly, but this place did it. They have a great prixe fixe but we came too late for that. Would definitely recommend this place for the food and friendly service. And whoever that was that said that this place is expensive, I don't know where you normally eat, but we got in and out for under $100 with wine.  That's steak, duck, salad and wine, unheard of in Manhattan.
