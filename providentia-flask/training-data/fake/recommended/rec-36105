I came here with my companion on a Sunday morning after a long Saturday night... The wait looked to be atrocious, we slept in till 11:30, and arrived just after noon. I somehow made eye contact with a lovely little hostess and got on a short list for two seated by the window. The food was magnificent! I had the brioche French toast, and she had the eggs maurette. The French toast was fluffy but substantial and served with some delicious bacon. Luckily, my companion was too light in the stomach to finish her eggs maurette, and I was treated to a fair amount of this dish as well. Such a savory dish! The mushrooms and the onions were cooked to perfection!
