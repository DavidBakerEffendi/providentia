I'm a Japanese food lover. I felt I came back to Japan for few hours. The place is amazing at the bar or at the table. Everything is perfect. Just amazing FRESH food and EXCELLENT service. Surely, one of the best Japanese place and best experience in Manhattan and anywhere else. The giant prawn is one of the best one I ever tasted. The Sashimi was fresh and perfectly sliced. The fish is grilled just at it needs to be. The show at the bar is just awesome. The staff at the entrance, mainly ladies are well dressed and very welcoming. The Uni for the appetizer is excellent. Everything I took was also incredibly fresh and I felt I was returning to Kyoto, Tokyo... Always remember to come early or try to make a reservation if you are a regular customer. Always try to taste one fish well prepared, it's one amazing experience. This type of place is perfect from A to Z. I came back many time and I'm always leaving with a big smile and thinking the next time I will return. One of the best gem of Manhattan.
