The food is fine, although it took much too long to come out (25 mins for chicken and waffles on a really slow morning). If that were my only complaint, I would be giving four stars. What made me much less happy was the waitstaff. They were inattentive to me. I did hear plenty of their conversation with each other, though, because they had such grating voices. These gentlemen were talking derogatorily and loudly about psychiatric illnesses, their exes, dating websites, fat women, etc. etc. How is that acceptable? It made my entire experience so unpleasant. I even heard them snickering about my ordering dessert after a meal of fried chicken. Needless to say I tipped minimally and got the hell out.
