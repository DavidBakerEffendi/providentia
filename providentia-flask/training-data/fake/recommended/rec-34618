Philadelphia needed this place.  Great beer selection, decent food (the fries are amazing), and an amazing backyard where you can sit all day, any time of year. Any place that will allow me to lounge around and play jenga for hours when all I've purchased is a hot chocolate is a find.  Invite some friends and make an afternoon (or evening, or entire day) of it.
