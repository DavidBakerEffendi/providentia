Best dinner we've had in awhile. We've used a groupon twice here and will definitely be coming back. Every taste is savory and only locally grown and seasonal items are on the menu. This makes for heavy experimentation by chef Chris using staples like beets, sweet potatoes (my fave), pumpkin, etc. There are multicolored sauces on plates that have you asking the waiter, what's in this? What's that? Also cocktail sauce aspic (!) The beef Wellington on the current menu is melt in your mouth good as is the mushroom and rye berry pasta. We also ordered the fish and chips which were lightly coated and very well seasoned, over the top delicious. The portions aren't big but our table of four had appetizers and we were all sampling from each other's plates. The place is BYOB so we had a large bottle of white which we couldn't even finish. The brownie was delicious as were the milk and cookies. Our bellies were full and happy when we left there .
