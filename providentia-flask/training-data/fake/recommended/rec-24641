Came here last week for the first time and I already love this place.  Great food and good for people watching while seating outside. Cafe Orlin has been flirting with me for a long time.  When it sees me pass by on my way to YTTP: yelp.com/biz/yoga-to-the… or when I'm meeting friends for dinner/drinks... it's just so cute! I finally walked in when I pass by it with a friend and she thought it was cute too.  We shared the portobello mushroom ravioli.  It was delicious! yum yum.. so good.  I didn't miss the lack of meat on my plate at all.    It was really saucy and had a lot of shaved parmesan cheese on top.  The portion was big.  I was so full from eating half of this dish and a beer. Tip: ask for bread to dip on the yummy sauce.
