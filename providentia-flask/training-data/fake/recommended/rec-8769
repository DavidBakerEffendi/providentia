I'm reluctant to even give this review because Fonda seems to be the only bottomless brunch you can get a reservation at in under a week.  But they deserve it, so I'll just come right out and say it.  This is one of the best bottomless brunches out there.  And if you're specifically looking for Mexican bottomless brunch, it's far superior to Agave both in drink offerings and in the quality and taste of the food.   The only thing that's a little difficult is getting out to Alphabet City, BUT if you're doing a bottomless brunch, chances are you're going to continue day drinking.  And that part of town is perfect for day drinking.
