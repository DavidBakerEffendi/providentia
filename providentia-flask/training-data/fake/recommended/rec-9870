Tried Umami at Googa Mooga and it was fantastic. The truffle burger was straight out of my dreams. We were anxiously awaiting the opening of the storefront for months. When it opened, we were turned off by the excessive waits we read about on the Yelp. Two+ hours? No thanks. We saw that lunch on the early side (11:30 ish) was doable, and did just that. We had to wait about 20-25 minutes. Not bad. We were seated at the bar. We ordered the Truffle Burger, Truffle Fries, and another burger which had cheese and peppers and maybe something else. The Truffle Burger was fantastic, albeit undercooked for medium rare -- VERY pink in the center and the pink went right up to the edges. The other burger, whose name I cannot remember and whose website lists no menu, wasn't my jam. One thing we noticed was that there were tables that sat empty for lengthy periods but a line outside. Strange. All in all, burgers were good, prices were good, line was manageable (if you go early), location was good. Just have to time it right.
