To Emily S: I experienced your moment and your party was indescribable in it's self. I frequent the Ear and I have never encountered customers that are so disrespectful to the staff and customers. Â Shame on you. Don't come back, you ruin everything that the Ear stands for. Thank you for reminding me why this is a haven from assholes.
