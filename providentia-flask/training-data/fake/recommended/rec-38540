Food was above average but the service was awful. It took us 45 mins to get our food. We ordered an appetizer, 2 drinks, and an entree. Appetizer came out same time as entree, it was luke-warm, drinks didn't come right away either. There were only 4 tables at dinner time on a Friday night but service was still the worst I've ever had. The waitress was nice though, just took way too long.
