Overall: $50 wasted! they earned their name in a BAD way- too salty and too much reliance on bacon fat - I drank 6 glasses of water and an icetea within 1hr - I am now enduring a sodium high with no expectation of coming down from it til Wednesday! - I had to go home and eat some white rice just so my body would stop swelling from the immense intake of salt - my better half got a headache from all the bacon grease used Service here Sucks! Not because the people are unfriendly but simply because they are disorganized!!!! - there are 6 people walking around yet none of them are timely with serving you your check, beverage, or water - there is no one set waitperson per table which means you end up having your drink brought to you after your 2nd course, due to none of them knowing really who got you what at what time :( - it took 20minutes before someone got us a check, not us they were busy cuz it was not a full house, or cuz they didn't see we were done, but again rookie mistakes To start: free bacon flavored popcorn (a very rich not light bacon taste, very clog your arteries!) Cobb salad with blue cheese, Chinese sausage chips and tomatoes with a poached egg- if only they didn't overuse pepper in this dish, it would have been a perfect combination of ingredients Oxtail tarrine - overly salty, we couldn't even taste the flavors of the caramelized onions or the rich robust taste of the oxtail Crack and cheese - potato gnocchi with cheese and bacon bits, way too sharp a cheese that it completely overpowered the Â potato and bacon ( which is damn hard to do) Fried chicken with herb ranch - nothing special, fried perfectly (earning 1 star) but lacking in flavor, the herb dipping sauce was more like horse radish with mayo than a true fusion pairing Desert-lychee panne cotta and yuzu buttermilk sorbet - panna cotta had some weird syrup on it that reminded me of cough syrup, the texture was good though, the sorbet was the saving grace
