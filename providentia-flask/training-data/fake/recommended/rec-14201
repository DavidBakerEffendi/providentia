Mmmm....i've been living in Chicago for the past year...but I definitely think that NY thin crust definitely does it for me wayyyyy more than deep dish.  We shared a margharita pizza and it was so yummy...the crust was perfection...not too crusty, not too doughy...and the cheese and sauce were in perfect proportions.  it really reminded me of the pizza ate the summer I lived in Florence...
