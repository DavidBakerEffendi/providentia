I came on a Tuesday evening, around 7pm. Although there weren't any available tables, the bar was pretty open. So bar it was. The service was good - the bartender/waiter recommended the duck and foie gras ravioli for my main course. I also ordered the creamy polenta for appetizer. OMG. I don't know about the rest of the menu, but the creamy polenta was like fireworks on my taste buds! MUST TRY. The duck and foie gras ravioli was also very delicious but it was very rich. I couldn't finish the whole plate because it was just too much flavor. But delicious nonetheless. Would definitely go back for these two things.
