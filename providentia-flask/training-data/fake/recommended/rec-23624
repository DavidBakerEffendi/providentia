Leziz, formerly Kebob house is most deserving of praise - and this review is long overdue. The owner welcomes you himself into this turkish cuisine heaven. Start with the turkish tea or coffee, and a hummus plate (one of the best that I've ever had, and as an admitted hummus addict, that says a lot). Continue with the grape leaves, a great app to share with friends. Entree rec . is the whole grilled fish, it is cooked to order, and you will be licking your fingers and the plate, it is that good. Dessert, baklavah - 'nuf said.
