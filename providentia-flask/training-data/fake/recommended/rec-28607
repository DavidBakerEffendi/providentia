This place is a dream come true!!!!!!! If you, like I, Â have trouble eating snacks on the go or snacks with coffee because of food allergies, then this is your place! The make their own GF flour WITHOUT guar gum or xanthan gum. Theymakes all their own milks: almond, coconut and another i can't remember- the regular milk is organic. They have muffins that are made of only coconut flour (i'm allergic to the tapioca in their all-purpose flour) The guy who served me said they follow mainly a paleo diet with some of their own tweaks. I have dreamed of the day that a coffee place would serve coconut milk.....I'll never go anywhere else- I will make special trips to this wonderland of allergy-free foods!!!!!
