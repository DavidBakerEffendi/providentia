Indian-style burritos! Came here at the recommendation of a co-worker. Really fun concept here: They take Indian-spiced fillings (chicken, chickpea, egg, etc) and roll it up in Indian flat bread (roti) for something especially resembling a burrito. I tried the chana masala; which was chick peas, some red onion and blackening spices all wrapped up. The idea is really cool and the wrap was pretty good; Not blow-your-face-off amazing, but definitely memorable. I would have liked it a little more spicy, but I understand they need to make this food accessible to everyone. One roll is not enough for a meal, so make sure to get two if you want to fill up. Its not especially cheap either, 2 will run you about 10 bucks, but this is Manhattan so it is understandable.
