I hate to be a hater but damn this place is just the pits for me.  Basically, The Smith is a knock-off of a Keith McNally restaurant [Schiller's, Balthazar, Minetta Tavern, Pastis, Lucky Strike etc].  The Smith copied the decor pretty convincingly but the food is really bad.  Do yourself a favor and go to Schiller's, Lucky Strike or Balthazar instead.  Trust me.  If you're gonna do it, do it right.
