I love this place. They have authentic Mexican food that's just so good. Also give their hot sauces a try: they're *all* good. I'd maybe like to see some more vegetarian/vegan protein options like tofu or seitan. I usually pick up a burrito and a few bottles from the Bottle Shop around the corner and that makes a great night.
