I don't really see what is super special about this place, other than the pancakes. I had the western omelette and it was only okay. My brunch companion ordered the pancakes and he did say they were really good. The coffee was pretty gross. It was also so loud in the restaurant that we could barely hear each other talking. If you're craving pancakes, go to Cafe Luluc. If you aren't craving pancakes, go somewhere else.
