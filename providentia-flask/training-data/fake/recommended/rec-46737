Decided to go here as I was feeling Mexican and this was the highest rated Mexican joint near where I was staying on business.  As one previous reviewer stated, don't let the store front location fool you.  Very non-descript.  It is in a plaza and you can miss it if you don't look sharp.  There is, however, ample parking in the rear of the building as it shares a parking lot with TGIFridays. It is a bit pricey for what I was looking for but decided to stick it out & give it a try.  I'm glad I did! Ola boasts an eclectic décor and a short but appetizing menu.  I went with the chicken, asparagus, plantain, lobster mashed potato plate.  Very tasty!  Well worth the price.  I'm glad I stayed!  The service was on par. It's certainly not your typical chips 'n salsa/tequila-shots casa.  I will return should I find myself this way again! Ola!!
