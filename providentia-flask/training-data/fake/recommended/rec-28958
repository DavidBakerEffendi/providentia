Great setting for a romantic evening. The smell of the chocolate is amazing. The fish tacos with mango slaw were very good and reasonably priced. Dessert was very rich and delicious. Drinks are outrageously priced. The glass was tiny and they charge more than $12. The waiter wasn't very good at all, inattentive and recommended everything instead of being specific. Overall it was very good with some things they could do better.
