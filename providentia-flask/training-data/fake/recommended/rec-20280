After being voted a NY magazine fav and seeing the plentiful Yelp reviews (which doesn't happen much in NY, at least Yelp is nowhere near as big here as it is in SF), I knew I wanted to try Penelope.   On a recent Sunday, a few girlfriends and I decided to brave the artic temperatures outside and supposed horrendous wait time and made our way to Kips Bay for some delicious brunch. We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait time and we ended up waiting around 75 minutes. Yuck, but the free, and actually good coffee helped the situation.  The atmosphere was very homey and relaxing.  Everyone seemed to be content, happy, and enjoying their food!  Finally it was time to sit down.  At this point, we all knew what we wanted and had to be somewhere promptly by 2:30 pm, so we pretty much needed to be in and out! The awesome $14.50 prix fixe brunch is a great deal (or maybe I'm just saying that now that I'm a New Yorker and prices are ridiculously high here) and your entree comes with a tasty apple cider mimosa! YUM.  We started off with the nutella french toast (so what, we're fatasses) and I'm SO glad we decided on that as an appetizer.  We were all in agreeance that it was a bit too sweet - I don't think I could've eaten it as an entire meal - it came with 3 slices of bread filled with warm hazelnut chocolate filling dusted with powdered sugar, and fruit on the side.  I couldn't have been happier with my Penny Egg Sandwich (scrambled eggs with pesto and american cheese, which I had on a croissant (choose that or an English muff).  Their house made pesto is the best pesto I've ever eaten, it was a lovely addition to the perfectly cooked eggs. I definitely plan to return for dinner!
