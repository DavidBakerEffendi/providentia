When I first heard about this restaurant I was skeptical in approaching a place who's menu is solely based on JUST meatballs. To my surprise, the discovery of fresh sauces, cheeses and toppings completely changed my mind. I've been eating meatballs all my life and these are some of the best ever, (just don't tell my grandma). Seeing the menu have chicken meatballs on it really caught my attention so I had a traditional sandwich with 2 beef and 2 chicken meatballs, tomato sauce, and a delicious sharp provolone. Any sandwich I eat is toasted so that crunchy roll and melty cheese was just icing on the cake. The flavors were new to me because I now saw more potential in something I eat regularly. A tip of my hat to MMCo for putting a fresh, fun twist on an Italian classic.
