The service here is amazing, the food is superb, and i would absolutely recommend it to anyone visiting, or who hasnt been here before.  like some other reviewers, I would suggest going with a group so you could try a little bit of everything.  The chicken is amazing.  Great for some fine italian and also some fresh, real food.
