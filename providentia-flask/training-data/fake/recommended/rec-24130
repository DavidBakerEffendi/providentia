I frequent Green Eggs. It was my first time at their Dickenson location. I'm not a huge fan of the staff here. My chicken and waffles was perfect. I asked for my biscuit and gravy dish to be served freely hot as I was once served very cool before at another location. It came out warm, no biggie, but the biscuits were hard as if they were stale. Atmosphere was nice, but overall, I prefer the Center City location more. Their staff seem more down-to-earth.
