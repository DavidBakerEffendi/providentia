Awww, man. Some of you guys make me feel like such a hater. Market Table is good. The service was nice and the dining room was cute. My chicken was cooked well and that grilled chile lime corn was so fresh and tasty! I liked it but am confused by all of the rave reviews. I suspect it's WVillage locale is adding to the hype. It's worth a visit but no need to return.
