I went there for my sisters birthday with 9 people. The service was amazing. The waiters were extremely nice. When we got the birthday cake, they gave everyone a free glass of champagne. The food is great - we were partial to the smaller dishes - the tuna taquitos and the empanadas were fantastic. This was a great place for a big party. Can't thank the staff enough for making it a great night.
