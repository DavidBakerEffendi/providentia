I love this place. Get the Churrasco, it's the best value on the menu. In terms of the small plates, the mini cuban sandwiches, the empanadas, and the chicken lollipops are really good. Any of the flavors of pitchers of mojitos are the perfect accompaniment to the food.The food is fantastic as well as inexpensive. The cons are, it is pretty hard to move through the restaurant, since the paths through the restaurant are only wide enough for one person. Also, if you go on a birthday heavy weekend, bring earplugs as they do some very loud drum playing. I watched one birthday girl actually flinch. Even so, I would still go here pretty much everyday if I lived closer.
