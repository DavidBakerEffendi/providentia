Go to Zafra and enjoy some delicious beverages as well as some well executed Cuban inspired dishes. The staff was super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Thanks to the floor staff and kitchen for a great night. BTW if your not in the mood for a whole meal just stop @ the bar and let Ed take great care of you.
