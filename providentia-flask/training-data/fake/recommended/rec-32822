We went and I was hoping to find that the not so great reviews were nothing but I too fall into this status.  While the staff was very nice my party of 4 did not find the food to be anything spectacular.  The polenta fries were very bland and the main courses were nothing to rave about. The dishes are made to sound and look sophisticated but fall short of being an amazingly delicious meal.
