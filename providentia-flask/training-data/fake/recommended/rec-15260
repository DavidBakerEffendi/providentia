Many other reviewers have done a lovely job of describing the food and ambiance - both of which were wonderful. My review, and my justification of 5 stars, is based on the service. Things didn't start too well ... We arrived for our reservation on Christmas Eve, plans made after scouring Yelp and personal recommendations from friends about Talula's Garden. We were led to a table in the rear of the restaurant with a common problem -- banquette seat on one side, giant rectangular table and one seat with it's back to the room. This is always an uncomfortable arrangement - too far away from each other for a romantic dinner let alone conversation, and the weird feeling that someone could sneak up on you from behind. Josh, the manager came by to check on us when he noticed our appetizers weren't being eaten and thoughtfully interpreted my partner's non-verbals as not being too happy. We discussed with him the physical arrangements of the table and settled in for another awkward dinner since we couldn't speak to each other. Moments later, Josh came to our table, collected our drinks, and moved us. Such a simple thing, but so considerate! We were moved to a nice table that was turned the short way so we were close and in the transition between two sections so we both felt we could see what was happening around us. I can't adequately describe how much this improved our experience. Thoughtfully doing the right thing, with no fanfare. If only customer service like this existed everywhere, but since it doesn't it makes Talula's stand out even more. Thank you to Josh and Tatiana, our server, for not only providing a delightful dinner for us, but acting to save us from what might have been a disappointing experience.
