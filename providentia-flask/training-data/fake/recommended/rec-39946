My husband and I ate here the other day for the last time. We only went because we had a gift certificate to use. The food is SO hit or miss that you have better odds of winning at the casino than your burger being cooked the way you want it which for us is some pink.  We went a months or so after they opened and the burgers were great and cooked with some pink as we requested. Went another time and it was good. Another time we went my husband's burger was pink and mine was past well done and much smaller than his, only covering half the bun.  The other day, his was dry and well done and so was mine except for the RAW meat in the the very center. Well and and raw in the same burger?!! The manager tried to  make things right, but I was almost done with mine by the time he came over ( picked out the raw part) and did not want another burger. I had already eaten. He offered a dessert but we didn't want any. It's not rocket science... they are a burger place. Why is to SO difficult to make a burger that is medium and not very well done??
