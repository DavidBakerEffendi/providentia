The first night I arrived in New York my wonderful friend brought me to this amazing shop. I usually eat meatballs from stuff like Costco and I think they're typically decent, but hell naw. TOTALLY WRONG ON THAT. The meat balls here are made to order and they're amazzzzing. Like...WOW. WOW. WOW. THIS STUFF IS LEGIT. CATHY THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME HERE IF YOU READ THIS REVIEW. LOT'S OF LOVE TO YOU! Thanks for giving me a great experience in NY on my first night! Usually, it's a long wait to get in, but we managed to get in here right away when it was probably around 1pm I believe. You can simply mix and match what you want on your plate. Ordering is very simple too. I recommend the special meatball because it was fantassstic!  I also ordered it with spicy meat sauce. My friend had Parmesan sauce with hers, and I had a taste of it and BOY IT'S SO GOOOD. I don't know how else to describe this, but it's basically a foodgasm/party in your mouth. When you get your bill you also receive a recipe as well.  The food is affordable for it's price, but I wish they gave bigger portions. It's hard to resist good food like this ;w; The ambiance, music, and food are excellent. There's lot's of people late at night so be warned! ^^!!!~ They also serve wine and other drinks. Great spot to take someone out on a date. I love it! I would like to come back here again! :DDD  I love my ballss... SO GOOOD!
