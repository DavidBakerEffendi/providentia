i left staten island 8 years ago and everytime i visit, i make absolutely sure denino's is part of the experience.   denino's absolutely epitomizes the staten island experience- good pizza, great value, cheap beer, friendly service.  This time around, we started with an order of the fried calamari, then got a white pizza and sausage and peppers pizza for dinner.  we are never let down with this place.  the calamari is fantastic, and the pizza never lets down.
