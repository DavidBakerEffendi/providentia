I love this place!! Best sandwiches ever! I ordered the Italian stallion, which was amazing, and my husband got the Ducati Dealer, which is a aandwich like no other, and they were kind enough to fix my son a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, which he loved. Everything came with a free side. Prices are very reasonable, decor is upscale and inviting, staff is friendly and accommodating, sandwiches are among the best I've ever had. Love supporting local business and budding entrepreneurs! Keep up the good work!
