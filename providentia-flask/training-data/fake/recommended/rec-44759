Made reservations here for valentines day at 6:30 PM got there on time and checked. Took about 15 minutes to seat us to a table. When we got to the table it was the outdoor area which has a breeze and my arm was hitting the door handle. Girl friend did not like the seating so I had to make other arrangements. Manager came and tried to get us seated upstairs but I was so disappointed with their first try we left and headed to Mr. Chows on 57th. Oh yea, apparently the seat they gave us was "The BEST" seat in the house. Really??? When the door handle is hitting my arm and there was a breeze coming through....
