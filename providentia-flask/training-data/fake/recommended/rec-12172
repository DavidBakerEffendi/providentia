I really wanted to love this place and had high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews about the food. It's definitely a place for "foodies" and for a small plates restaurant the prices were very high. Ironically our favorite dishes were from the vegetable section of the menu, we were not planning on getting 3 dishes. The frisee salad with bacon and poached egg was fabulous, I could not stop eating it as was my husbands mushroom taleggio crepe. But things went down hill from there. The smoked octopus was chewy and the blue crab had shells in it, though the farro was delicious. The venison I had was cold and needed seasoning and my husbands short ribs were overcooked. Mistakes I would not expect from this kitchen. Drinks were good and our server excellent even on a very busy night. I probably would not come back any time soon
