I went with 4 others on a Saturday morning. My friend got there before me at 11:30 a.m.  She put her name on the waiting list and provided her phone number.  The host stated it would be a 30 minute wait and that he would text her when the table was ready.  Well, 45 minutes later, she followed up with the host and he said "5 more minutes".  15 minutes later, I followed up with the host.  He said, "Oh, you're so and so?  I just seated your table."  Turns out, some girl lied and said it was HER table.  So, I told him that we waited for an hour and he was very apologetic and told us that we would be the next to be seated.  Some guy came in while we were waiting and claimed to have waited over an hour for his table - TOTAL LIE.  My friends and I were waiting the whole time outside and that guy was NOT waiting the entire time.  Bunch of liars in NYC when it comes to places that don't take reservations!  So, I informed the host that the guy was lying and he thanked me. The food came out very fast and our server was very pleasant.  I had the penny egg sandwich - it was good, but not out of this world, but I guess the pesto sauce on the side makes it "unique".  I tried a bite of my friend's nutella french toast - it was good, even though I'm not a fan of french toast.  I had the peach bellini and it was refreshing and mildly sweet.   At one point, the A/C was leaking above us and because we got wet, the waiter knocked off my ice coffee and red velvet cake....really nice!  The red velvet cake was moist and yummy. If you go here and you're waiting, make sure to check every 15 minutes to ensure nobody steals your spot in line.  This place really should take reservations.
