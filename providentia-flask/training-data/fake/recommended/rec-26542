went to ilili last night for a birthday celebration dinner...as soon as you enter the decor takes your breath away...bar area is amazing. I sat @ the bar for a quick drink, asked the bartender for a coors lite..and replied with a "what is that"...I slowly replied Coors Lite beer..he said we dont have that...so I asked him for some options...ended with a Lebanese beer..Amashe (i dont have a spellcheck). Later on, for dinner our group ordered falafel, cheese rolls, some eggplant dish (not my choice!!!) pita bread, lamb chops. must say the portions are very small...since we ended up ordering so many dishes, we pretty much shared (they have options to share dishes, which our waitress was more than willing to offer). Ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir for the bday boy...which was not bad at all.. all in all - decent food @ high prices, u can probably get better or equal quality food @ 1/2 prices else where...guess u are paying for decor, decent service (rest room has a lady waiting to greet you and provide you with a towel, which was unique...usually see those @ clubs). ok for a visit, if you are all dressed up and in mood for lavish dinner.
