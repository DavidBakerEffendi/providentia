If it weren't for the rooftop seating this would be a one star review. I have been here twice and while the rooftop seating is very nice the food is only okay and the service is just universally awful. The first time I was there the waiter barely noticed us but I try to give a place two tries before giving up on them. The second time we had a reservation and because it was very slow and it was for a friends birthday we asked if we could be seated on the roof (they don't take reservations for the roof). The hostess flat out refused all the while letting an even larger group without a reservation upstairs. Luckily the manager was there and he told us he would get us seating up there. The hostess was visibly annoyed at us. Apparently my group of friends wasn't attractive enough for her to make exceptions for. At least the manager realized we would be getting full meals and a few rounds if drinks unlike the hostess' friends who got salad and water and were complete pains the whole time. Â  And once again our waiter was awful. He had no personality and the service was slow. None of the tables around us seemed to be getting better service either. The food was okay, but I have had better for the price. And it's really a shame, I wanted to like this place as the location is great but they really seem to rely on the location but don't back it up with even decent service. There really is much better food to be had in the center and I would suggest going there instead. UPDATE: I recently heard more service horror stories and a story of downright discrimination from the hostess toward a friend of mine. After thinking about it and how I talk about this place to people it's honestly not worth two stars. I will never go back and I am always telling people how awful the service is. I am amazed this place survives with so many better options in West Hartford Center.
