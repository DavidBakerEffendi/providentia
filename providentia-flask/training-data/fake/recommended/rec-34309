Myself and 5 friends decided to meet here for our holiday dinner. Glad we did. I arrived first and had a drink at the bar. The bartender came right over, even though the place was busy, and served me in less than 2 minutes! Once the rest of our party arrived, we moved to the dining room. Our waitress was great! She came over immediately, took our drink order and got it right the first time. The appetizers we ordered were very good. The Hotsy Totsy Shrimp was excellent as were the Short Rib Tacos (my favorite) and crab cakes. Since this is a steakhouse, all 6 in our party had steak. The Cowboy, New York Strip and the Delmonico were cooked perfectly, juicy and full of flavor. I had the Delmonico and couldn't have been happier. The owner came over twice, once during dinner and then again at the end to make sure we were happy with the service and food. Bottom line: I recommend the Franklin Steakhouse 100%. The service and food were great. I'll be back with the family!
