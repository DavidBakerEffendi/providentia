The food was just ok nothing new compared to the others Latin restaurants in the city. I only give this place 1 star because Service was horrible and I felt pretty annoyed by the staff, I know this place is kinda new but they are definitely not trained properly,when I tried to speak to the manager "he was too busy and refused to talk to me during my meal", my wine glass was dirty and I found a piece of plastic on my empanada. I do not recommend this place at all and I'm not going to try it again.
