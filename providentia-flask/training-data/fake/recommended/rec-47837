The food was very good but the place was grubby looking. tables were not clean the chairs at the bar has seen better days beer stains bribbled all down the back of them. Gum yes gum stuck in the plank type table. I get the rustic natural look but keep it clean! I wonder what the kitchen looks. They don't care much about there apperance or cleanlyness. Won't go back even thou the pizza was Very Good!
