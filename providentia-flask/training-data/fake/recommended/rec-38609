Fat Salmon is slightly better than average sushi in a sleek space. The emphasis is on over-the-top Americanized sushi loaded with fried items and "crunchy" (aka Panko bread crumbs). Over the 8 or so special rolls that we tried, nothing was terrible, but nothing stood out. The lone exception is the Super Dragon -- a Dragon roll on steroids. It's so large, you can barely eat it without making a fool of yourself. The beer menu has an extensive Asian selection, but the prices are relatively steep. Service is adequate, if unremarkable. For better sushi, try Zento (BYOB) from the former Morimoto Sous-Chef, Uzu (also in Old City) or Morimoto for a splurge. I've heard good things about Umai in Rittenhouse, but haven't been.
