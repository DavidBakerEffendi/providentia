Sweet baby jeebus why did I wait so long to come here! My first real experience with Puerto Rican food was here and it was glorious! I went with a friend on a Saturday night around 8 and we were seated right away. Though, while we were there a lot of parties had to wait as the place is very small. We ordered some tostones, mofongo with pork, and 1/2 rotisserie. I was in heaven! The mofongo was especially my favorite. I loved the family environment and our server came by several times to ask if we were good and to ask specifically how we liked the food. It's also BYOB, but don't get crazy. My buddy and I bought two big beers and shared that..but I'd avoid bringing a 6 pack since....well we were told they frown upon that. Also, the price is PERFECT! See you in Alphabet City!
