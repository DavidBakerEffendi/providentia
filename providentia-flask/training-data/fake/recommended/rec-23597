This is one of the only places I've been where when they say "fresh," they mean "bland." All that rice they pile in the burrito to disguise the notable lack of filling is very "fresh." I once added tons of their chili to my burrito and had a good experience here, but I went back a few days later and it was back to bland, even though I again ordered the chili. I'll take the place around the corner over this place any day!
