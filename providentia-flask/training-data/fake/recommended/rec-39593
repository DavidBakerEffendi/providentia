This was my 1st of three stops in search of decent Cuban food on mothers day this year. This place came in second ahead of Mojitos (I'm not sure if that should be considered a compliment). The food was OK. I ordered a Ropa vieja and so did my friend. We were both so very disappointed. It's Cuban food for goodness sake you should try to add some flavor, salt, adobo idk something. I digress, the drinks were not that great. It tasted like water and alcohol...all of them eww. Will I come back. Nope not ever. Oh yeah before I forget where was our waiter???
