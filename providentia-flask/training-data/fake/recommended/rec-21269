I accidentally wandered into this restaurant/bar on a wednesday eve. I was extremely confused, looking for Jacques, a bar I know for a fact is located between Mott and Elizabeth. However, in my drunken stupor, even in my own neighborhood, I didn't realize I was actually on spring street instead of prince, and was pacing back and forth swearing to my compatriot I am certain Jacques is on this block! Well, it isn't. But Mother's Ruin is, and it was fair. The atmosphere is quaint, romantic-esque, exposed brick, and the clientele seemed to be fairly attractive on this fine evening. However - and this is my source of conflict, I wasn't thrilled with the bar service. Seated against the wall (not at the bar), I asked my fellow to bring me something "nice and whiskey based". As this is a cocktail establishment, I would expect his return with a handcrafted cocktail, maybe a manhattan, hell even an old fashioned - but with these words exactly you know what the bartender poured? No questions asked? A shot of whiskey. I mean, I have a sense of humor. But really? And my compatriot may be Dutch, but his English isn't so poor that requesting "something nice and whiskey based" in a cocktail bar should warrant a shot of house whiskey. For the second round I ordered a beer. And thankfully, that is what I received. Next time I'm wandering by Mother's Ruin, I'll probably try and remember that Jacques is on Prince, and not Spring.
