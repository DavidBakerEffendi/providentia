Not what I expected for the money. Duck Meatballs were bland and mushy. The Monkfish special was communicated to us from the server as $30 when in fact it was $32. For that price I expected it to be amazing. The taste Â texture was not like Monkfish at all. It was missing that lobster like texture and the fish was more on the dry side.The puree they served underneath it was the best part of the dish. Maybe it was an off night because it was 9:30 on a Saturday night. In my opinion that is NYC prime time. So all in all, my guests and I were not impressed. Like some of the reviews on here. This place just missed it.
