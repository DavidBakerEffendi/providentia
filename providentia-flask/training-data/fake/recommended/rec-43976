I'm really surprised by all of the negative reviews of Est Est Est. I consider it my favorite pizza in New Haven. (Bar is good too, but I haven't liked their service.) Granted, I usually just order the cheese pizza, and I haven't really tried much else on the menu, but I love it, and I've found them to be very reliable and prompt.
