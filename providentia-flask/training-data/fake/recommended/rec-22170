So, it's my first night in New Haven. I rolled into town at dinner time, having not eaten since breakfast. I check into my hotel, and head out the door for food. Aaaaaaand it's raining. Zaroka became a choice of necessity, as I was tired of getting water droplets all over me and was ready to JUST EAT ALREADY. What a happy accident. I was greeted by wonderfully kind staff members who joked with me and took me upstairs where I was basically alone in the restaurant, save one student studying with headphones in a corner. I ordered chicken broccoli balti -- which came out promptly with some of the best basmati rice ever. When I left, having cleaned my plate, the rain was pouring from the sky. The staff gave me a plastic bag for my phone and my head (the second of which I declined) and wished me well as I ran the half mile back to my hotel. Should the weather cooperate, I'm going to drop by before I leave and thank them again for great food and even better service.
