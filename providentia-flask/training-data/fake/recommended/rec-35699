I find it almost impossible to believe that anybody gives this place anything less that 5 stars.  While the decor may not be the greatest, the food is incredibly flavorful and extremely bountiful!  his is real-deal szechuan cuisine - it is spicy and delicious - and is better than any place I ever visited in Chinatown in Philly or New York.  Beyond having great food, this place is an amazing value: its BYOB, so you can bring whatever you want to drink, and for $20-25 per person you get a ton of food. I've been here twice (both times with groups of 8 or more) and I left each time absolutely thrilled. I honestly don't have any specific food recommendations for this place because everything is amazing and worth trying.  One of the best parts of this place is that if you just tell your waiter what types of things you like and don't like and the amount of money that you want to spend, they will just order for you (and in doing so bring you all of their best dishes). Just writing this review makes me want to go back to eat there ASAP!
