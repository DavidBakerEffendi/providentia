Got the carne asada and adobado (marinated pork, shredded) tacos. Love corn tortillas and the salsa bar =] The pork is cut from a spit with slices of pineapple! It was delicious! The steak was yummy as well. These tacos were one of the closest in NY so far in reminding me of those beloved CA taco truck tacos...except these are about $3 each. lol We beat the lunch crowd fortunately. A HUGE line formed only 5 min after we ordered. Get there before 12!
