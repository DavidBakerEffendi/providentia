Came here for dinner with 7 people.  Ambiance is great; very dimly lit and spacious.  Ordered the fresh meadows cocktail and it was AMAZING!  If you love Gin, this is the perfect drink for you. Overall, the food was good.  There were a few small plates we were disappointed with (the cheese rolls - not so good).  Be mindful that their "large plates" really aren't at all that large, especially for the price.  I ordered the chicken and was given two tiny tiny pieces of chicken.  Things that were amazing include the hummus, warm eggplant, brussel sprouts, and yogurt dip.
