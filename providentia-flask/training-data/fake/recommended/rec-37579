Um... talk about guilty pleasures!   I'm typically always dieting.  Which I am right now... so my Double Smoke Stack Burger I had this weekend is my current biggest guilty pleasure.  OMG.  (Double Cheeseburger w/ Applewood Smoked Bacon, Chopped Cherry Peppers, & Shack Sauce)  I think I was in heaven while I was eating this burger.  How have I not tried Shake Shack until now!?  I'm sorry to sound like a teenybopper, but OMGOMGOMG!!!! I thankfully was smart enough (aka told by my boyfriend) to skip out on the shake/concrete this visit because I was freakin' stuffed after my burger and shared fries.  I cannot wait to go back to try one of those because the toppings are super creative and I am having dreams about them.   I think this place is WAY better than Elevation & Five-Guys.  YUMMMY!
