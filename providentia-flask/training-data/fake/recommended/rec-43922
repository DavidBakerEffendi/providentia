Went to Alice's on Wednesday night.  There was a small crowd so we were seated immediately.  Waitress was friendly and enthusiastic about the menu and specials.  We were looking for healthy fresh food with innovative recipes.  I had the shredded fennel salad on a base of golden beets, goat cheese crumble, pistachios and an amazing dressing.  I started feeling healthy so I went for the special - boneless short ribs stuffed with caramelized onions and spinach with small roasted potatoes.  It also came with spaghetti squash my wife ate it, I wasn't crazy about it.   The appetizer and dinner was great.  My wife got a fish dish with a really tasty corn and polenta.  She loved it.  The cheese cake desert was amazing it was light and creamy and definitely was made with ricotta cheese.  I will be back to this place mainly for the creative dishes, flavors and ingredients.  The craft beer I had (think it was called Six Points) was locally brewed and a good IPA but not to hoppy.
