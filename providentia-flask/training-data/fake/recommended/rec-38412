This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my life. I'm not one for superlatives but every dish I ate here was the best of its kind. Seriously, the most delicious friend chicken, cornbread, and BBQ pork ribs of my life. And, to top it all off, the service was impeccable. Sandra herself came out and made sure everything was perfect. She told us a bit of history about the home cooking and dedicated the entire restaurant to her mother. She was sweet and I want everyone in the world to visit this restaurant. I couldn't have asked for more.
