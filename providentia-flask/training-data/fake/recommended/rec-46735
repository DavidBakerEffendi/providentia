The food was ok. Although, I don't eat shellfish and everything they offered under the living social deal contained shellfish. I thought one didn't, so I ordered two of them, but the guests at the next table over (not the server, who I just informed I don't eat shellfish) told me the side it came with contained shellfish. The sangria's were good, as well as the tuna tartare appetizer we added on. The flan was horrible. Â It was over-baked and the fruit compote on top was just gross. I couldn't eat it. We also had to wait 15 minutes between courses for our second course to come out and the steak I had ordered rare came out medium well. Because we had the deal, it was an okay meal for the money, but I wouldn't go back and pay full price.
