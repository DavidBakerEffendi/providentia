This cart is worth the wait!! People do not be fooled! There are a lot of Halal carts, but you have to go to this one. It's a great place to go for the late night grub. Â  You have the choice of the chicken or lamb. Be warned! It's a LOT of food. You really get your money's worth! I had the chicken, which was deeelish! Came with pita bread and the meat sat on a pile of rice and lettuce. You have the choice of having it as a platter or wrapped in a pita as a sandwich. You can top it off with the "white" or "red" sauce and they also offer ketchup. The red sauce is super spicy so go easy on it or you'll have a "great" time later. I have no idea what the white sauce was but it's tasty.
