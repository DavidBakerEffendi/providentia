Went to Chowder Pot for lunch with an out of town client from the Midwest who wanted some seafood...We were in the area so I fugured Chowder Pot was a reasonable choice.  I had not been here in about 5 years so not sure what to expect, I do remember good times here.  Let's start with walking in and having to wait 15 minutes to be seated with 2/3 of the restaurants empty....when I asked why we could not be seated the hostess says it's "expensive" to run a full restaurant on slow days so they needed to wait until someone left because they did not have enough help....Really?  Now for the food I started with a bowl of the Rhode Island clam chowder, unbelievably SALTY! I ordered the $19.00 lobster roll that was served in a hot dog roll which is fine but there was barely any lobster meat in the roll, I counted two claws and arm meat...maybe worth $8 bucks.  the cole slaw was probably the best deal because it was included.  My last gripe....Can you PLEASE clean the carpets at least once every five years...disgusting.   For those of you that enjoy this place you better dine here soon because I don't believe it will be in business too long. PS: the waitress was a very friendly lady.
