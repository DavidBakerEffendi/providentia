We stopped in there on our way home, and we were really disappointed with our Margherita pizza - it was utterly tasteless. No nice garlic tones, and the fresh Mozz cheese was scant, to say the least. Wings and salad were overpriced, but OK. We thought the interior was original in decor and there was live music playing, which are nice, but the food we got was blah. Maybe we should have ordered a regular cheese pizza or something else on menu.
