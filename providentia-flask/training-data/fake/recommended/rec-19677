YEAH BABAY! I came here once late at night, being told they have the BEST HALAL in NY. Not that I've had a lot of Halal or anything, but it was purdy damn good! Apparently they have the best white sauce but I'm not into that so I can't say, but still! I was all 'nomnomnomthisissogood' and everyone else was like 'iknowright?!?' So yeah, I think that speaks for itself.
