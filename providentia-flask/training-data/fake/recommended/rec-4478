Ok! Now I've seen it all. Halal Chinese food and I have to say this is the best Chinese food that I have had in along time. The wings are huge and fresh. The food is cooked to order and not precooked like some of the Chinese restaurants do with their Chinese rice. Mind you this is halal and according to the Islamic law it has to not only be slaughtered a certain kind of way it also can't be raised or feed any impurities( steroids and what have you). I recommend the wings and the egg foo yung which is "slamming". Everything is packed full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Amina has several locations throughout central jersey. You can't fail with it.
