Came here for the second time hoping for a good experience like the first time. The owner Bill was the rudest person I ever met. There were problems with the experience right from the start. Took 20 minutes to get eggs. Two tables who sat after us got their food before us. Restaurant was half full. My Western  came out with cheese had to send back.  Second time came out rushed and potatoes covered in cayenne pepper.  Come to think of it there was not a trace of hot pepper on my original potatoes or anyone else's at the table. I'm willing to bet that the chef purposely added the cayenne pepper after I had sent it back. Good thing I wasn't allergic to the ingredient. Had to ask for new potatoes. Omelet had uncooked vegetables when I brought it to the attention of the thug owner Bill he told us he would pick up the tab and to never come back again. Nice work Bill. I'll make sure to tell everyone what an ass you are. We had a nice experience here the first time but this was one experience I'll tell everyone about. Just as a point of reference as to the type of omelette you can expect to get. It's a plain pancake of eggs with the ingredients dropped on and then folded over. Very lazy chef if you ask me. We also ordered the $8.00 pancakes which were incredibly dry and had a weird sweet taste to them.  I guess the first time we went was a fluke and the is what to expect from Hapgoods or should I say Hap not goods.
