One of my favorite places in NYC. Casual divey decor but amazingly fresh food that will compete with restaurants that are 4x 5x times in prices. The red white and blue special is a gem for oyster lovers. I dont think they make reservations so it is sometimes tricky to get through if you arrive at busy hour. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because they spilled a tray of oyster juice on my mom one cold day :( besides that food is great.
