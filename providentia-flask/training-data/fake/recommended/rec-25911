Great find!  Sadly we were only in town for a night, but finding the Tip Top Cafe made that night memorable.  Their garlic aioli (served with crusty bread) sets up high expectations for a meal that did not disappoint.  We had the apple and sweetpotato fritters, which came piping hot with a slightly spicy creamy dipping sauce.  Next was the butternut squash,  bacon, and cheddar risotto (I had mine w/o bacon).  Finally, we snagged a chocolate chip cookie for the road.
