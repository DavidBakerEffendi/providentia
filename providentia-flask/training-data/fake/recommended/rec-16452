You like Trend too?!  STFD!!! SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! No really, shut the front door. Chicken salad wrap was very good, but the tomato cucumber somethingorother on the side was bland. The raspberry coffee is actually worth drinking... which is saying something coming from me.  The pumpkin spice coffee... isn't. The cupcakes look creative and generous enough to share, if you insist, but aren't too... special. But seriously, unless you're trying to tick people off, shut the front door.  It doesn't close by itself.
