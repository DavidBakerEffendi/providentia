I really really like this place. I decided to eat here for a casual anniversary dinner. Moderately priced which is always good. Definitely smaller than I imagined but terrific still. The service was great. They were very attentive and checked up on us throughout our meal. Ambience was pretty okay, it's a small place so it can get very loud so don't expect to have a quiet dinner. The entree portions were big. I could barely finish my steak ($22) but very worth it. I picked this restaurant because the menu was extensive... I couldnt decide what to get but of course, I can never pass up steak LOL. They had pastas, gluten free entrees, etc. And for dessert, I got the tiramisu and it was delicious so I definitely recommend that. Â  Overall, great place and I will definitely be back.
