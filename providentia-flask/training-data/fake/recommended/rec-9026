I was shocked when I came across this little Hell's Kitchen/Theatre District gem! You walk in and it feels trendy and chic, you sit down...in our case immediately, and can order one of their fun cocktails (which I did, the "detox", and it was delish) also immediately. Service was made available and eager to assist. Â  Their portions are generous, so don't think you and a girlfriend can split two apps and an entree! We had the avocado spring rolls, which were excellent and delightfully refreshing with the mint leaves hidden inside. We also had the honey ribs, which fell right off the bone. Although, have of our order was inedible and fatty. Entree we shared the curry scampi, which was excellent. With a bit of spice, jumbo prawns and rice to share it was the perfect dinner for an after show meal! Affordable, chic and good food.
