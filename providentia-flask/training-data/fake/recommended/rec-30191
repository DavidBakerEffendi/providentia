Brunch review: server was wonderful and very nice. My friend and I both got the blueberry ginger margarita and it was delicious! It was really refreshing and not your typical sugary marg. We ordered the beingets with blueberry sauce to start which were really yummy. For our main dishes we ordered the frittata and poached eggs and both were delicious! A great brunch and I would definitely come back!
