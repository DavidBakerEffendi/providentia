The atmosphere here makes the experience quite romantic. Dim lights (although almost too dim), wooded interior, great wait staff. It's two stories with the second floor overlooking the first. I would recommend making reservations because it was pretty packed when I went at 7pm mid-week. The food is very good. Tapas are tapas. Small portions. My boyfriend and I ordered 7 tapas and it was a good amount to suit us. I would recommend the Fried Goat Cheese (dipped in honey!) and the Spaghetti Pepperoncini. Pitfalls: My drink - the Floridita. Way too tart. And the drinks seem overpriced compared to the food menu which is very reasonable.
