OMG!!! okay so i'm obsessed with their flat noodle with beef!! omg!! love it!!! it's a bit tangy and if you add the hot oil, it makes it oh the better!! love it love it!! Usually when you go to other chinese noodle places, the noodle and beef comes in a plain beef broth, but this place has it all figured out!!! trust me...go try it...
