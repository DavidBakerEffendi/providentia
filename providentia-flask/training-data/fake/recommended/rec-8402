The best of Indian Foods!  No doubt the friendliest service.  I took my family and my sister's family and we all really loved it...and we are particular about our Indian foods.  They have the best garlic and potatoe Naan and chickpea poori.  Their special chicken samosa is also awesome.  Try their Marbala chicken and their Vindaloo beef and lamb (if you like really spicy food) - it's the best.
