Went here for a late Sunday Brunch today and had exceptional service and food. Location is a block from the Liberty Bell Museum and Independence Mall. My husband and I shared the monkey bread, which comes with a side of glaze/icing for dipping. Nice to start the meal with something a little sweet and still hot from the oven The mac and cheese hit all our favorite aspects of mac and cheese. Crunchy topping for texture and creamy base. Always something good to have, either as a meal or a side. We ordered the protein plate with a side of potato pancakes and chicken and waffles. Everything tasted flavorful, crispy, nostalgic and all things dericious. Service was very professional and attentive. There was no wait at the time so we were seated immediately. Water glasses were always filled and the manager John handled a situation that could have gotten out of hand in a very professional manner. We love the Starr restaurants and definitely will be coming back to Jones for dinner and any other meal.
