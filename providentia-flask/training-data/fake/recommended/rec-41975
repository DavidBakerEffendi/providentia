I've been to Frankford Hall a couple of times now.  An outdoor beer garden is certainly a welcome addition to the ranks of Fishtown's rapidly expanding beer bar scene.  However, my first impression was that the valet and security was a bit out of place for the neighborhood, but I guess these are standard components of a Steven Starr establishment. Although not extensive, I think the beer selection fits very well.  They have stocked their taps with suitable session beers; particurlarly suitable if you decide to drink them by the liter.  The atmosphere is great if you enjoy drinking cold beer on a hot summer's day (and who doesn't).  Bottom line:  this isn't a beer bar with a rotating list of eclectic high alcohol gems, nor is it trying to be.   The food could use some major improvement.  Our party ordered a wide selection from the menu and I was left very underwhelmed.  The spaetzle was the worst, being almost too salty to eat.  The potato pancakes weren't crispy enough on the outside and too mushy on the inside.  I'd suggest sticking to sausages if you're going to eat anything.  Also, I refuse to pay $8 for a pretzel, even if the dough does come from Germany, when we alreadly live in a city that makes great pretzels for 50 cents a piece.
