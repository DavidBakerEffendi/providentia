4.5 Stars because I've rarely, if ever, eaten anything more delicious.  It seemed as though  Every Single Bite (honestly) refused to be ignored and demanded our full attention.  The conversation stalled because everyone was getting busy with those flavors!  A masterful tapas experience. I've only been here once so can't say much about the consistency but the night we came everything was top notch.  I arrived early and had a nice artisan cocktail at the bar.  We were seated for dinner in the downstairs area which was very cozy and almost a private room, which was fine with us.  The service was excellent all night. The menu looked delicious and it would have been hard not to over do it without help from the price$.  Each plate was averaging about $8-12 with just a few bites per plate and so seemingly you could price your bites at about $1-3 each!  But man, was it tasty!  We had Scottish Salmon, Chicken Brochettes, Pulpo, Wild Mushrooms and a few other things.  It didn't seem to matter what we ordered because it all ranged from excellent to "Oh my Gawd". I was truly inspired my the experience and am hoping to recreate some of the marinated brochettes once the weather warms up and I can break out the grill.  Tough act to follow, though....
