I came to Silk City for a halloween party on Oct 26. The official name was "DJ DEEJAY presents: SILK CITY SATURDAYS ***SPECIAL HALLOWEEN COSTUME PARTY!!***" It was a great time. Online it said cover was $5 with a costume and they were true to their word. We got there around 11:15 and the place slowly got busier over the next hour or so. Drinks were reasonable ($3 for a beer, $5 for a rum and coke) and the bartenders were really quick with their service. If you're looking for a place to dance, look no further. The DJ played an amazing mix that was a ton of fun to dance to and overall just a great blend of genres. No sketchy guys coming up behind you like they would at a typical club, so my friends and I definitely appreciated that. This place is very chill and not at all pretentious. No requirement for heels, which is nice because charging $20+ for cover and requiring heels does NOT automatically make a great club. It was a great place to kick off Halloweek celebrations that'll continue into the following weekend. Keep it up, Silk City!
