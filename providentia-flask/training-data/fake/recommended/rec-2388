After a late evening dinner at Peter Luger's my friends and I still had cravings for more food. After hearing from all the locals on where to go we had to try this place out. It's funny to see all the carts around the neighborhood completely empty while this place has a line that can stretch for a whole block! We arrived around 11 pm since they come around 7 in the evening anyway and waited for about 20 minutes before we got to order. The people in line are nice and it was cool making conversation with people who grew up in New York. Since it was my first time there,I naturally went with what everybody suggested, the combo of chicken and lamb and boy was the food good. It came in a nice aluminum plate and I can tell you that you need to put tons of white sauce on top. If your a little more adventurist then put a good helping of the red sauce on for some kick. The chicken and lamb itself was amazing as it was a nice change in pace than what I am use to eating. The chicken was moist and soft which made chewing that much easier. Now to be honest I'm not much of a lamb kinda guy but for the first time in a while I didn't mind eating it. It kinda tasted like beef and the best word to describe it is savory. The only thing from keeping the score from being perfect is the rice. I have eaten a lot of rice in my life and I can tell you it tasted a little like cardboard. Now I don't know how they do it here but maybe it's because it was cooking for too long, or that's the style it's made... I don't know. I know for a fact that I needed to put tons and tons of white sauce in order to negate the taste. Outside of that this really is a place you should try out at least once in your life.
