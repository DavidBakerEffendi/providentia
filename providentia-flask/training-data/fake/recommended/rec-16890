I come here in occasion as it is walking distance from my job. The iced dirty chai is amazing. It's a basically a chai latte with a little something special. They are always kind enough to modify it for me as ordered without any typical coffee shop snobbery. I did have the chorizo and egg frittata as well. I didn't think it was great, but it wasn't horrible either. I personally think the service is good. They people there are nice and friendly and always smiling. Come here for an eclectic scene and good coffee.
