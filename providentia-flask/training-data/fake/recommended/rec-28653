I love this place and am there 3xs a week -- the food is delicious, healthy, and expensive (but worth it) -- but the staff is so rude! (except for the chefs, they're super friendly)  It's a shame bc I would love to make it my local spot, but the employees are incredibly entitled and NOT NICE.  I thought it was just me, but I have spoken to a half dozen friends who go regularly and we all agree.   Unkind staff combined with no loyalty program (they were giving 10% for Hu "gear", but switched to only giving a discount if you wear one of their hats) means they're ripe for competition in my view.
