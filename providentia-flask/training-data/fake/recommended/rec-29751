So good! I had the cornbread with bacon and jalape√±os, brussel sprouts, cauliflower salad, and chicken with dirty rice- all excellent. I want to go back soon and try more things. Also, I'm not usually a Bloody Mary drinker but they have one with beef broth in it that is incredibly delicious. Also the staff is very friendly and helpful. Really cool spot.
