This is by far the best restaurant on Staten Island. I love this place! Everything from the service to the drinks to the food to the decor is on point. I like coming here Mon-Thurs cause they have an awesome pre-fixe menu. You get three courses for just $19.95. And normally I am not a big fan of pre-fixe menus because the choices aren't so great. However, they have a lot of great options on the menu. Unless you are super, super picky about what you eat, you should be able to find something you like.
