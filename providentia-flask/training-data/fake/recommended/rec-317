One of the best tapas places in NY! Food was amazing and all people working there are super friendly. My group went for my friend's birthday Saturday night. The Flamenco dance every Saturday made the night a lot more fun and engaging. They served us a slice of birthday cake for free and "allowed" my bday friend to dance in front of everyone. Will definitely come back.
