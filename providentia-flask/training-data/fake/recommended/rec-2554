Any place that has Ween and Tom Waits in the Juke is alright in my book. I was first introduced to this place years ago by my friend from NY strangely enough. The food here is Uber delicious. I recommend the octopus or the mushroom cigar. The Mako kabobs rock too. I was here last night and got the pork sandwich and a sweet potato somosa. Very Tasty Indeed!! Johnny Brenda's also has quite an extensive selection of local beers to choose from.  Yards, Slyfox, Victory etc. If shooting pool is your thing they have a table. The last time I shot pool here there was some crazy guy that had this light up electric pool stick. It was quite funny actually. Upstairs you can catch all sorts of great live music. Local talent as well as Bigger Acts. I've seen all sorts of Acts from comedian Neil Hamburger, Joe Genaro, Slim Cesna's Auto Club, to the Calvin Weston/Billy Martin duo(medeski, martin and wood)  They bring in some really good shows here. FYI- upstars bar only takes cash
