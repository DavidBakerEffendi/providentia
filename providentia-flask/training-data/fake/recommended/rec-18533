Five tacos has become my staple for a quick nosh in the E village.  The menu is simple, similar to what you get at Dos Toros.  What really sets it apart is the sauces.  I am obsessed with the coconut masala and others (chipotle mayo, Jamaican jerk and habanero) are all great too.  If you are really into sauces like me, this is your spot.  The owner, Moti, and the staff are all very nice and welcoming.  It is a wonderful treat indeed!
