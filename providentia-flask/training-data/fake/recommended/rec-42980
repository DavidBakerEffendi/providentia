Always a good choice and no brainer for brunch ... other times ... i always order their Mediterranean sampler app. Small cozy space ... Good expresso ... outdoor seating is nice ... however i wish they allowed smoking like before ... i have to jump the gate walk a few feet away ... have a cigarette while having a distant conversation ... yeah perhaps i should quit ... always a easy laid back experience here.
