LaScala's sings old world Italian. As usual I'll start with service. Attentive, engaging and efficient, but some work to do. Enough said? What makes a restaurant is the menu. Agreed? For starters, we ordered the broccoli rabe and the eggplant capanata. Â It's unusual to describe both in the same way, yet the words "tender" and "flavorful" come to mind. As we were consumed them, we had to stop at one point and ask "are we leaving room for dinner?" That's how good they were. As for dinner, we were served papperdelle noodles with sausage and bolognese and seafood fraDiavolo. So, I should start with how we finished. Taking half of the dishes home. The portions are huge, and by no means a reflections on flavor. It was true italian in every sense. Might I add my girlfriend is Sicilian (a bit of an expert on the matter). So knowing Italian cuisine, I would say LaScala hits the mark from a taste perspective. Where a little coaching is needed is in the service area. The server was immature in his approach and presentation. His knowledge of the menu was limited and did not present the best of what LaScala has to offer. It was not bad, by any means, just lacking in enthusiasm. One certain annoyance is the televisions in the bar area. I believe a restaurant should be exclusive to food, service and atmosphere. Hearing the silly World Series game announcers was simply not a welcomed audible. Why would you have this? If you venture downtown Philadelphia, especially the Olde City area, I think LaScala is worth the try. I'll finish telling you we took half our entree's home (huge portions). We gleefully heated them up the next day for lunch and dug in. Smiles ensued. IF YOU ENJOYED MY REVIEW, PLEASE RATE IT AND SEND ME A COMMENT!
