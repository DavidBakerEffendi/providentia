Not bad at all for the price. Ordered the shrimp teriyaki which was ok tasting and perfect portion for the price. Only thing is they give you wayyy too much rice (and I eat a lot of rice) which is a waste. The snowball roll was really tasty, especially if you like cream cheese LOL The bf had the chicken teriyaki and ako roll- no complaints there either. Will def come back to try other stuff, but don't forget to bring cash!!
