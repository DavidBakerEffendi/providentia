This place had a huge lineup every time we passed by. And it surely has a reason for it. For $6, you get to have meat over rice, some salad and couple pieces of bread. It was very tasty... but watch out for the red spicy... it is extremely spicy!!!!!! The portion is great and will definitely fills you up. P.s. the line might look long, but it took about 5 mins to go thru 20+ ppl in front of us..
