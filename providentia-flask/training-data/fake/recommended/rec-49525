So delicious and nutritious. I stumbled upon this place yesterday.  The food is so beautifully presented, the kind of presentation that usually occurs in  a more formal restaurant space. The fiesta roll is so tasty and the sushi by the piece is just as tasty as it is to look at! Even better,I left Beyond Sushi feeling that I was full but felt like I  ate a really clean meal.Wow.
