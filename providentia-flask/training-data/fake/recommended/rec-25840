Words can barely exress how much we enjoy going to Piccolo Angolo.  We live in Southern California and fly to New York once a year for business.  We ALWAYS go to Piccolo Angelo twice.  For us it is a genuine piece of New York, and the food just knocks us out. I've sent several other company owners there, and every single one of them has been blown away. Do not EVER close this restaurant -- we look forward to many more years of looking forward to visiting!!
