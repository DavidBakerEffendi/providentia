My partner and I were working near New Haven today and one of the people we were was working with recommended Sally's, but they were closed for vacation.  We'd had Pepe's pizza before and wanted to try something new.  We stopped in Tony & Lucille's as a back up. My first impression is that the interior needs a major renovation...very old school, and not in an appealing or charming way. The hostess was sitting with friends and seemed annoyed that she had to get up and help us.  Then for the entire time we were there, we could overhear her complaining about health insurance, her plumber and other life problems that a diner really shouldn't have to listen to. Our server was extremely friendly and accommodating and was very helpful in trying to find a dish that would meet my partner's dietary restrictions. We started off with salads, which were standard house salads, the lettuce was fine but the olives tasted like they were canned. I ordered the eggplant rollatini and a side of penne.  The rollatini was very mushy and the sauce was overly salty.  Instead of penne, I was given linguini.  The linguini was al dente, but again, the sauce was overly salty and over-cooked for my taste. My partner got linguini with chicken and spinach.  His linguini was over-cooked and he said the spinach tasted like it was frozen and not fresh.   While the portions were generous, I still felt like it was over-priced for the quality. I can't say enough how wonderful our server was, but that's not enough reason for me to ever go back.
