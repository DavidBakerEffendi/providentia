I've eaten here twice. Once for drunken cheesefries which were passable (I'm a connoisseur) and once on a last minute dinner date. The place was borderline obnoxiously packed on this Thursday evening, we we banished to the cold and not comfortable lounge area. Not just chilly, I'm talking we didn't take our coats off until we were two drinks in cold. Five minutes after we sat, a man dropped off two waters at our table. Ten minutes later the bartender comes to take our drink/appetiser order. The drinks arrived promptly; a dirty martini on the rocks severely lacking the "dirt" and a room temp glass of pinot grigio. The couple next to us was seated after our drinks arrived, and managed to be halfway through their meal before the server noticed that we hadn't received our calamari appetiser :( Silk City gets the 4-star rating on the strengths of general coolness and tasty potato gnocchi and hamburgers. Service (in the lounge, at least) was just ok.
