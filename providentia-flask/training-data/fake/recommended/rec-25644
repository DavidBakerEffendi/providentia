No frills type of joint. You order a beer. You order your burger. You eat. You pay. You leave. The menu is on the wall. The burgers are well cooked and cooked perfectly to your liking. The portions are perfect. Exactly the right cheese/bacon to burger ratio. The fries are pretty good too. There is always a line to be seated. So I suggest coming at an odd hour to eat. We got somewhat lucky, showing up just before 7 on a Saturday night and only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. If you're looking for an inexpensive, low key meal. This is the place.
