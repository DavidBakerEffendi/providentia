Really wish I could add more to this review. However, it's been said over and over and over again in the reviews prior. All you need to know about this place is #37. You won't need anymore :) They also have some funky lime, soda sugar concoction that was pretty good, but can't say it was worth the $3.50 they charge for it. Service is superb. Quick to offer menu suggestions, keep your drinks filled, and even give you little tips on how to eat rice with chopsticks. Def worth the trip into West Philly on a cold winter night!
