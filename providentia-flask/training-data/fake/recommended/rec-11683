Mi corazon and I got to Tia Pol in the weird time between lunch and dinner, curiously called "Bar Hour".  Even curiouser is the fact that they only close down the kitchen from 5:00pm to 5:30pm, ostensibly I'm guessing to prepare for the dinner rush.  After having worked on cooks lines at several busy restaurants, I can say with some certainty that even a half hour respite from the unwashed hordes of hungry diners is a godsend. Anyway, despite the limited menu, I was very impressed with the quality and breadth of the food available.  NYC coming correct again when it comes to small plates dining, and after walking around the High Line for an hour and a half, we were necessarily hungry.  In no particular order, we had: -  croquettes -  fried garbanzo beans -  pan con tomate -  patatas bravas -  chorizo al jerez -  a couple of glasses of vino tinto although the producers names' escape my memory Not a bad selection in the bunch.  Especially toothsome was the chorizo plate and the croquettes, although to be fair, I am an ardent fan of both tubed meat and deep fried taters of any/all varieties. The service was a bit disjointed as it was obvious there were shift changes going on at the time, but despite waiting around a little longer than normal for order-taking and food-running, things went swimmingly. Considering it was only the two of us during "bar hour", I would definitely like to hit Tia Pol up again with a larger crew during their dinner serving, but all told, I was very happy with our dining experience at this restaurant.
