Probably not the best Japanese food in the area, but the prices are extremely reasonable and highly recommend for someone that doesn't want to spend $50+ for dinner and drinks for a change. I love the Gari Gari Kun Chu-Hai. Reminds me of home and is a good prop for photos :) Definitely check it out if you are in the area!
