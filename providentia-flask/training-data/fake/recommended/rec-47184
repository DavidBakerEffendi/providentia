This is a little hidden gem and the only reason to trek down to fido for some drinks. This place has multiple levels for any type of experience you want to have, fancy speakeasy, regular bar. The energy is great and the cocktails are delicious. The service was top-notch with attentive bartenders and staff. The only reason to be in Fidi!
