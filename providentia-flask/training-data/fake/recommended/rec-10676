The crab cakes are amazing,  the shrimp and grits were also very nice,  just ask to have the gravy for the grits on the side,  I preferred the grits without the gravy.   Service was very good,  we were a party of 7 and all of us were very pleased with our meals.  Nice setting about 50 yds from the waterfront,  multi level,  very spacious with great views.    A good selection of craft beer,  the Nangarresett lager was very good.   Moderate price and the food is worth the visit.   Next time we are in NYC we will definitely visit again.
