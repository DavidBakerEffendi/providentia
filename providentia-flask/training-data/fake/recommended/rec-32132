Wow ordered a strip steak, on the rock, which is a 2inch thick steak that you cook on a lava rock to your liking. Uhm pretty frickin awesome and delicious! And I'm picky about my steaks so this was great, didn't have to send it back because I'm cooking it! After we ate that, ordered an apple pie and a slice of cheesecake.... Both were to die for!! The cheesecake was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. And some other reviews on here we're saying the water tasted funny? Tasted like normal water to me. Service was good, price was good.
