This Halal Cart defines what and how food should be cooked and served to a bunch of hungry and sometimes even intoxicated patrons after a night out in the city. Every ingredient just ties in together and makes sense -- from the rice, to the lamb, and to the sauces, it's all brilliant. I'm a huge fan and this will be a must go-to place on my next visit. Just an FYI, sometimes there is a line but it is completely worth it. For all you skeptics, don't expect gourmet or top quality food. Think of the target market this cart is trying to appeal to and then it'll make sense why they're so successful.
