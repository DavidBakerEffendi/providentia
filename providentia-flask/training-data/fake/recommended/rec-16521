There are few times that you walk away from a Halal cart and just same "damn." Actually it only happens at one place and this is it. Simply put, it's the best Halal food. Period. It competes with restaurants around the area and is only $6!! If you're traveling or have friends that are, it would be a shame not to partake in this NYC staple! Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.
