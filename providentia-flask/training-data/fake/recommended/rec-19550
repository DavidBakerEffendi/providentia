If I were to rate El Camino Real as strictly a bar, I'd give it a much higher rating. Good atmosphere, good drinks, good prices (half off this particular night). After waiting at the bar for an hour, I was finally met by the rest of my party and grabbed a table. It was all downhill from there. After sitting at the table for a half hour, we had to ask for a waiter. We were finally served. Fine. Easy mistake to make. It was Cinco de Mayo, afterall. A little busy. We got 2 picthers of margaritas, endless chips and salsa, and 4 burritos. Let's start with the margaritas. Even at half the cost, I felt ripped off by two pitchers that were 99% ice. We enjoyed the margarita-flavored ice as much as we could. The endless chips. They were only endless if you were lucky enough to be visited by your waiter a second time. When we managed to track him down, we got more chips (but no more salsa; apparently, that wasn't so endless). The second serving of chips were obviously from the bottom of whatever bag they came out of. I guess it's easy to afford an endless supply of chips when they're all crumbs. To give credit where credit is due: the salsa verde that came with the chips was the best I've ever tasted. However, that was counter-balanced by the pico de gallo, which was the worst. Now the food. Another reviewer described the burritos here best when she called them "puny." I received two puny shrimp burritos were the flour tortillas where cold and clammy, and the filling was almost non-existant. It was the worst burrito I've ever had, and for that matter, the worst shrimp I've ever had. Still and all, we had fun. Because it's not so much the places you go, but the company you keep. So to make a long review short: I would come back to EL Camino Real to hang at the bar and drink, but my god, I'll know next time to get my grub somewheres else.
