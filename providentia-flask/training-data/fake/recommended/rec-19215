I wish I remembered our initial server's name so that I could give her 5 stars. She was the ONLY bright spot in this dining experience. My party changed tables so got a different server before we placed our orders; the experience immediately went downhill at that point. It was obvious that our new server didn't want to be bothered with a large party and it showed in the service. When we complained, the manager was even more indignant. To make matters worse, the food was mediocre, at best. No one really enjoyed anything that they ordered. No one had any alcohol so I can't really speak on that aspect of the establishment. Needless to say, I'll never step foot in there again.
