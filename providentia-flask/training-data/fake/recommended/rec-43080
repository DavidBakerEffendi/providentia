Went here with a great group of people and had a great time.  This place is classy without trying to be.  Nothing is "over-done", it's simply  a nice place.  The food is great of course...but there is my favorite drink ever at this place...i think its called the concord crush.  It's crushed grapes w/ ketel and something...i dunno but two of those and i'm done!  Me and my roommate smoked a cigar with her uncle after dinner outside...nothing to do with the restaurant just a fun memory popped into my head.  :)
