Marrakesh is located on an alleyway with a locked door (tip: knock using the metal knocker)! However, do not let appearances deceive you. Marrakesh is not just a meal, it is an experience (great for people new to the city of Philadelphia). 7 courses over the span of two hours: -1st vegetable course - make sure you take plenty of pita, and the eggplant is FANTASTIC -2nd powdered sugar and egg filled pancake - sweet and savory! -3rd spicy / not spicy chicken - try the spicy! its not too hot, but has great flavor -4th lamb and/or beef kabobs - personally, I love the lamb -5th couscous - I was so full by this course I did not even have a chance to try it -6th fruit dish - pretty standard with apples, grapes and strawberreis, I skipped this as I wanted to save room for dessert :-) -7th baklava and honey mint tea - best way to cap a great meal (see below!) The food is absolutely delicious. Make sure you try the lamb for your fourth course! The baklava at the end is icing on the cake - very crispy and oozing with honey. The staff is courteous. They made sure to come check on us often. The owner even came over and greeted us because it was many in our group's first time. They were more than happy to take photos of us as they washed our hands at the beginning. If you have a large group of people trying to bond / create new friendships, this restaurant is great because nothing like eating with your hands will bring together a group of new friends. The atmosphere is lively and exciting, so it adds to the energy level. As a FYI - Marrakesh is BYOB, which makes it that much better. If you have forgotten to bring a bottle, the house wine is very reasonably priced (~$12 for a carafe). After about 6 carafes / bottles of red wine, our group of 8 became great new friends. TL;DR? Quick summary - BYOB, very traditional and delicious Morrocan food, lively atmosphere, courteous & knowledgeable servers and great overall experience. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
