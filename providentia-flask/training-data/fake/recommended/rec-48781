I have lived in California for a very long time and eaten my fair share of Thai food. I am visiting and through yelp we decided to pock a place locally. This was it. The food was absolutely amazing. Everything. We got a salad, a curry and the pan fried noodles. The portions were a very good size (big if you're from Europe or Asia) I can't fault anything. The Service was courteous. The decor is nice and not corny as a lot of Asian places tend to be. All in all a definite thumbs up.
