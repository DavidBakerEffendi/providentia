Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent experience. There was an Eagles game yesterday and we wanted to have a great experience watching the game. We drove from DC to Chickies to watch the game. We were not disappointed. It was so awesome to watch the game around Eagles and not Redskins fans. The crabfries were awesome! Def. Coming back A+++
