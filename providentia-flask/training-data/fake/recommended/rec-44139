I was walking through Nolita yesterday, bummed that the store I was trying to get to was closed down, when as I was passing the window of this place, out of the corner of my eye, a part of me sensed my proximity to a special something. Was that guy holding what I think he was?  I do the double-take and bingo, I spot one of those things that makes my heart beat faster--grilled Mexican corn. For $2, I get a grilled cob of corn, coated all over in what I suspect is a blend of mayo, cotija, and spices + 2 lime wedges.  Now, I should tell you I love corn.  Corn soup, corn on the cob, pop corn--all of it.  But when it is grilled, the flash of heat caramelizes the sugars and makes it even sweeter.  Like I said, special. I ate it all up and left--toothpick in hand and a smile on my face.  Not even caring that the store had closed down anymore. BTW, dear readers, is it rude to pick your teeth on the go? Or is it something you should do in the privacy of a privy?
