Went for dinner on March 2.   Midway through first plate girlfriend notices roach big enough to drag off a newborn baby walking right on the buffet ( the one next to the grill).  Fork down, immediate exit.   Even after pointing out to the staff still had to pay full price for dinner.  Won't be back.
