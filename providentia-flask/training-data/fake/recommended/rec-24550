I love this spot on the UWS! Last time, my friends and I couldn't get a seat at Jacob's Pickles so we went to Slightly Oliver next door. Slightly Oliver was okay but I can see why Jacob's Pickles is always so busy and packed! Both my friends had already came to Jacob's Pickles before in the past and they both said they liked it. They've tried the honey chicken and said it was really good. Tonight they got the buttermilk fried chicken caesar salad. The salad was a good portion and they both couldn't finish it. I didn't really ask them but I don't think it was really anything special. I chose the Southern BLT for my meal. It was reallyy good! Growing up in Atlanta, GA I've always had an appreciation for southern food. The southern BLT is a biscuit with beer battered fried green tomatoes, niman ranch bacon, pickle slaw, and buttermilk fried chicken. It also comes with a side of cheese grits. YUM! I loveee biscuits and cheese grits! Everything tasted really good together but I had to take out some of the pickle slaw bc they give you so much. I really want to try the other things on the menu so I'll def be back! I hear the fried oreos are good but we didn't get to try bc we were all pretty full. My friend and I each got a beer and she tells me the beer selection is great here and she hasn't tired a bad one yet!
