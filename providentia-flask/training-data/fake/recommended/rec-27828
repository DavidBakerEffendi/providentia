Just enjoyed what I believe too be one the best Brunches I've Â ever had. The stake and eggs were mouth watering, the plantains were so juicy and delicious. The best part about was the price, it was very cheap and the meal came with a free cocktail. I can gladly say I walked out of cafecito beyond satisfied.
