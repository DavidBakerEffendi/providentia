After reading a NY Times article about Sea Witch, I decided to check it out for myself. I must say, I really like this place. It has a chic, non-cheesy Maritime decor replete with waterfalls in the backyard patio area. It attracts a hip but unpretentious mixed crowd. The prices are great, and with the Scoutmob app I got Â 50% off my entire bill. This is one of my new fave spots, so needless to say... I'll be back!
