This is a winner. Beautiful, hip, warm, romantic, (and a million other cool adjectives) place. We were seated in the "greenhouse" area that felt like outside but was really inside. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing, and they had the most unique idea of putting small paper bags over the votive candles! A beautiful effect that also seems like a potential fire hazard. Everything from the food, wine, and dessert were amazing. Our waitress was extremely helpful while we were making our food and wine choices, and was very attentive throughout the night. I ordered and would definitely recommend the gnocchi - which was perfectly cooked, flavored, and well-portioned. One of our friends got the Mac and Cheese. The waitress warned us though although the Mac and Cheese is delicious, it's also decently heavy - so be forewarned! We were also recommended the Caramel Budino which tasted like something Duche de leche-like (which is another word for amazing). DO get that. The only negative was that we made a reservation, but our table wasn't ready until 20 minutes afterwards because the party before had not left. It's not a huge deal, but it's definitely worthwhile to work out the kinks of the reservation system. Would definitely recommend coming here! PROS: atmosphere, food, wine, dessert, paper bag votive candles, service CONS: reservation was delayed
