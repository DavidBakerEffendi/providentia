One word for this place: FANTASTIC! The wait isn't that bad even though it's always super packed during brunch time. The food is good and it's so cheap compared to other places. I usually add a bellini to my entree for $6 (normally cost $9). I always get their steak and eggs for brunch. It comes with home fries and their creamy spinach sauce is perfect for the steak. I can never have enough of their sauce.
