The burger was big and very juicy, but there was so little cheese on it I could barely taste it.  The onion rings were awesome, they had that flaky breading and the onion didn't come out of the breading like most onion rings do.  The pickles had a nice crunch but they were super salty.  I am assuming these are the same ones they use for the fried pickles.  Also, our table, and the one next to it were super wobbly.   The rotating draft beer selection is awesome!  Victory, Russian River Brews, Rogue... all amazing microbrews.   Service was pretty good though.  Overall it was good but not amazing.
