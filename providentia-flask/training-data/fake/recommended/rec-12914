Yeah....not so worth the line.  It was ok. Nothing special, really.  The line was about an hour at 2pm on a Friday.  Go in pairs - it takes forever to seat a large table but pairs get called in first.  The bathroom was disgusting.  I know, you don't go for the bathroom, but the toilet seat was cracked and it was dirty...yuck.  it doesn't  take much. I would go for Lombardi's before I waited in that line again. I did like the local Brooklyn sodas with real sugar.  Also, the line is the same whether you eat in or take out.
