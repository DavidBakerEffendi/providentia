I find it pretty crazy that so many people know about this little food cart serving "chicken & rice" on a street corner.  And apparently people love it so much that others have created imitation carts serving similar foods!   We went on a Saturday night around 3am and the line was SO LONG.  I can't believe so many people are willing to wait in line in the freezing cold.  Seems like it would be more ideal in the summertime.  Regardless, we waited, and got the combo plate with lamb and chicken.  Since no one lived around that area, we ended up huddling up on the benches nearby and scarfing our long awaited food.  I don't know why people call it "chicken and rice".  I preferred the lamb part of the combo much more.   FYI- that red hot sauce is SO spicy.  My mouth was seriously on fire, no joke.  Don't be a hero.
