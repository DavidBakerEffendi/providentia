Went to Philly for a day of sight-seeing.  We did the usual, Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell.  Also on the list, an authentic Philly's cheesesteak.  So naturally the first place we chose was Geno's. Prepared for the cold weather, we ventured to South Philly and waited in line, which was out in the middle of the street, Literally!!! The big neon sign displaying Geno's Steaks is prominent.  And so is the smell of steak wafting through the air.  They were clearly popular!  The line was fast, considering it was a saturday during lunch rush.  We pulled up and ordered two steak sandwiches with onions for around $16.  The next window down we ordered cheese and "freedom" fries (really?  Freedom fries?)  in any case we were ready to eat.   The sandwich was tasty, steak is cooked well, cheese-whiz was good, not over powering, the bread chewy in texture, which went well with the texture of the steak.   This place is good if you want to eat at a place synonymous with pop culture.  Their devotion to their political ideals is a bit much, but respected. Good steak!  Interesting place.
