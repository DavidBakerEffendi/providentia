Best italian restaurant in philly...although i have not been to his other restaurant, vetri. Order the ravioli...there are two different kinds...one is with mushrooms. I recommend ordering both. They melt in your mouth. Remember half orders of the pasta dishes are available. Pizza cannot be missed either.
