Recommended by a friend....hands down this is an awesome eatery in downtown Bklyn! The food portions are ridiculous--come to this spot with an empty stomach!! The dollar goes far here between the food/drink specials and combos!! On the weekends you get some music entertainment from the house DJ!! When it warms up, the backyard turns into a candlelit dining area--simply an extension of the main area...Gorgeous!!!! It fills up quickly so get there early!
