The food was very good, though maybe little salty (maybe because the burger was on the salted pretzel roll).  I definitely did not leave hungry as the portions were large and filling.  I did try the beer that was a deal on Yelp and it was good.  Glad there was a suggestion as there were more pages on the beer menu than the food menu :) This definitely is more a bar than a restaurant, but the food was very good and I would return.   Parking was what I expected, and yes, there is one tiny water closet...
