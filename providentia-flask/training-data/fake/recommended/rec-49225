The toughest part about writing this review is trying to decide which of the many delectable things I ate last night was my favorite -- the steak tartare or the pork hock or the brussel sprouts or the hash browns. If I absolutely had to pick one it would be the steak tartare -- perfect flavor -- but luckily I don't have to only have one favorite and am looking forward to going back and trying more. Great at details -- the salad aside the pork hock had lovely crunchy capers, don't know how that's done but what a treat.
