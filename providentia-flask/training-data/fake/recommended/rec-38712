Gotta try the Tuna Steak Salad.  It is AWESOME!!!  The tuna was seared to perfection with a tasty ginger dressing.  The menu is still full of fried seafood, but I was able to find this salad.  It was tasty, fulfilling, and satisfying.  I guess I wont give up on the Chowder Pot yet.  Good job on creating this dish.
