In one sentence I can say this place is a nice small place with average food. I am giving this place 4 stars soley on the fact that the manager was super nice to us. We had arrived and had a drink at the bar, then requested a table in the back  (the place was pretty empty at 7pm on a Saturday night). We sat down at a nice table where I got to sit next to my boyfriend, the manager came up to us not even 5 minutes later saying "I do not know why the hostess sat you here, we have a large party coming, I'm very sorry". He was extremely professional and apologetic, he even got us a round of drinks and brought out chicken lollipop appetizers (which was probably the best part of my meal). They were very, very tasty. He brought out  a mix of the buffalo ones and teriyaki ones. Definitely recommend them. Our waiter, however, was kind of douchy and seemed irritated. I asked him for suggestions and finally came to the decision to get the steak. It was OK...nothing special...just OK. My boyfriend ordered their BASH burger, he enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best he has had. We skipped dessert for once.  Overall the place was a lot smaller then I expected, I might return with a group, but I was very pleased with the kind gesture the manger gave us. On a side note the drinks were pretty good, nothing to rave about :-)
