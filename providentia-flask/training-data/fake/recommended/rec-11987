The decor is pretty nifty - sort of like they raided an old farmhouse attic, threw all the furniture and together and furnished a restaurant.  So the ambiance is pretty good is what I'm saying.  The menu gives you a relatively small selection of pizzas but the group I was with liked what we got - I remember high praise being used for the King Harry and the Regina, as well as the Gates to Eden salad.  The pizzas are just enough for one person for dinner, but might come up lacking if you're more than a little hungry.  I did think they were maybe one or two dollars more expensive than you could get elsewhere, but that's probably the built-in surcharge of eating at one of the vanguards of gentrification. Also this place doesn't have a liquor license yet so you better hit up some of the close by bars if you want to make a night out of it.  But it looks like once they get the license they should have a pretty kickin' bar.
