I don't even want to write a positive review of this place because I don't want it to catch on - I'd prefer this be our little hidden gem in the city. But alas, it's too good NOT to say it. Best Indian food I've had in the city. The price is right - for under $10 we get a meal to split (it's a lot of food) and two amazing teas. The dessert is $1 and also great. There is no seating, so to eat in you have to stand at a counter, but this is a taxi driver hot spot with a rotating group of customers who speak the native tongue, so you know it's authentic. Really really amazing.
