This place does not need another great review but you need to know that it is definitely a place you should check out. The dinner menu looked amazing and we were excited, but we went with friends and just got caught up in their amazing, I'm saying it again, amazing appetizers. We started with the brussel sprouts (and if you are one of those people who's childhood ruined these delicious veggies for give it another chance, I promise you won't be disappointed), grilled pita with three dips: Roasted Beet Skordalia, Hummus and Romesco, (we had to keep asking for pita bread), Lamb Kefteddes, and the Patatas Bravas. We were loving the tapas theme we had started so we ordered more Patatas Bravas, mushrooms, and some items off of the daily menu (which i can't remember right now, but trust me it was delicious. If you need another reason to check this place out we ordered tons of drinks and food for 4 hungry people and it came out to less then $150. So check it out. Buen Provecho!
