Came on a Wednesday evening in January around 6pm and they had several empty tables. The pizza came quickly, and it was piping hot (they are made in a 1000F degree coal oven and brought right to your table) yet it wasn't dripping oil or cheese like many other hot pizzas. I quite liked how even the plain pizza had basil. I'm not a fan of deep dish, I prefer slightly thinner, yet not limp crusts and Grimaldi's mastered it. Perfect crust, perfect fresh mozzarella and basil, perfect pizza, perfect location. I went there with high expectations after reading all the hype and I wasn't disappointed one bit.
