Great place! I found it on Open Table when I got a gift card and Graffiti stood out among the other choices. We started with a great bottle of Italian wine paired with the three cheeses. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but thats a personal preference and the other two were great. We then had the pork dumplings which were my favorite of the entire meal. Followed by the pork noodles in a lemongrass broth. Also great. We then moved on to the bigger plates of the shrimp and skate. I never had skate before, but this was a great fish coated in chickpea. The place is small and may turn some people off...but look past the size. It's part of the charm. The small room paired with the decor made me feel like I was in a place you'd see Anthony Bourdain visit on one of his travel shows.
