This burger was pretty alright. Got the bacon cheeseburger and friend got the chili burger. We were extremely lucky to catch free seats right by the door on a crowded Saturday night. It's a grungy, no frills type of place, which is an environment I do like. The bacon cheeseburger was pretty juicy and seasoned well, but the chili burger had a very bland chili on top. Douse it in the Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle more salt and you're good to go. The patty for the chili burger was fine though. I was surprised there was even bread on the bottom of all that chili. Not a bad place. Type of place to go to just to throw back some beers and eat a good priced burger with friends. For top quality burgers, I would probably head elsewhere though.
