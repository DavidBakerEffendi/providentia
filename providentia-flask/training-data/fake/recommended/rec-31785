My boyfriend and I realized we were starving and it was cold out, our hotel not having room service we decided to look for somewhere close to our hotel. The hotel offered a book of restaurants in the neighborhood and Race St Cafe was the closest being only five minutes away. Reaching the cafe, it was a hole in the wall that my boyfriend nearly passed. Entering it was a lot bigger than we had expected. Walking past a crowded bar the owner told us to sit anyway. A few minutes later, he warmly greeted us with two menus, a late night snacks menu and a drink menu. He often came back asking how we were doing if we needed anything at all. Our appetizer, the buffalo shrimp was delicious. The plating was perfect, the buffalo sauce was light, the blue cheese was also something to die for, when we finished the shrimp I remembered only wishing there was more. We ordered two Jon Daley's which was an amazing drink and reminded me of an Arnold Palmer, it also went great with dinner. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, which was excellent, and my boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich with cheddar. The sandwiches were great, but the fries that calm with the food, I thought I could eat these french fries for the rest of my life. They came with ketchup and a homemade sauce, which my boyfriend and I fell in love with. Everything was good to the last bite and I can't wait till we go back to Philly and I'll definitely go there again.
