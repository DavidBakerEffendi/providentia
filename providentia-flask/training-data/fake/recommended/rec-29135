This pizza place is great. Â The atmosphere is like a typical pizza place with a bar..who could ask for anything better. The pizzas on there menu range from traditional to unique. I typically do not order off the pizza menu but I did get the cranberry salad once and it was outstanding. The pizza is very tasty but has a strong garlic taste..I'm a big fan of garlic so I liked it but if you are not you might want to consider this. I went for their brunch one time and was not thrilled. There was a limited selection and the service was slow. I enjoy their dinner/lunch menu and highly recommend this. The price range is very reasonable.
