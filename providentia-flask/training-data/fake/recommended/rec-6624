Went here for a "work" dinner the other night and by work, I mean we gossiped about boys the entire night. Err, I mean, technology and stuff... The space itself is incredible with soaring ceilings, dark woods, separate bar (which I noted for when I'm jonesing for an after-work martini) and several, separated dining rooms. Â My only ding in this instance: I could only get rez for 6:30 or 8:30 - even calling a week ahead - yet the entire time we there until we left after 9pm, there were plenty of tables open. But now at least I know to push a little next time I call... Anyhow, once seated, we got right down to bidness with the cocktail menu which focused on fresh infusions like basil and cilantro or citrus bevvies - though it seemed they had something for everyone - and with the help of our waitress, ordered the "Petit Sampler" plus a side of sprouts and fries (I'll get to those later). Let's just say there was nuttin petit about this sampler. It said it served from 3-5 but our group of 3 hardly made a dent. And at $60, I also think it's the more affordable option than ordering straight off the menu. Now the fries. Listen, I know I'm in a Greek/Med restaurant - with an incredibly authentic menu - but when the waitress said these were the best fries she ever had, I listened. And yes, they were damn good. Although we were clutching our stuffed bellies, of course we finished off the meal with dessert! We got the Mediterranean candy bar and you better believe we finished every bite. That sucker was incredible. Would I go back again? Absolutely - but would definitely recommend you hit Illili if you, too, are entertaining clients or biz associates, or celebrating sumpin special. This joint is upscale and worthy of an occasion - not just a quick bite.
