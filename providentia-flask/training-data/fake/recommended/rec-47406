I came here for Sunday brunch with a friend and it was great. We started with the chicken lolipops (ancho chile bbq) which were sweet, not spicy at all.  I had the Croque Monsieur which was delicious and my friend had the tomato soup with grilled goat cheese sandwich.  My friend tried the bloody bacon maria and enjoyed it, but I stuck with a mimosa. Would love to come back to try dinner here.
