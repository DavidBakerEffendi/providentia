My experience at Hana is what finally prompted my Yelp membership.  The experience was great, but the restaurant needs more people to know how good it is.  I am not a expert on Japanese cuisine, but my party of nine were all thrilled with their meals.  Our ages ranged from 20 to 87.  Our sushi experience was nil to best U.S. has to offer.  Everything was great.  Portions were reasonable.  I can't wait to return to Burlington to visit Hana again.  Another review commented that Hana is as good as Koto....be serious, it is soooo much better.  I will never visit Koto again.  Great food, good service, reasonable prices, clean and comfortable!
