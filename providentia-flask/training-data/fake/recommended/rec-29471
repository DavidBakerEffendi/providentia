Yep it's me Douglas K. here, typing away in LA (CA)  .... i'm a-gonna review Dalessandro's in Philly (PA) cuz I was just there. My friend had a show at a music spot near here last weekend: when I realized we were close, I walked eight blocks to get four cheesesteaks for assorted band members.  And me.  I had heard about Dalessandro's for years but never been. The best part about the place is the vibe.  All the other best-of type spots in Philly put the demand for performance on the customer.  You have to order in the right way, they always make you feel like you're holding up the line, etc.  That's cool. But this spot is like a little lunch counter and they're super nice.  The steak is different than Pat's/Geno's/Jim's: chopped much finer and more uniform.  No fatty chunks.   I really really enjoyed it.  Even the grilled onions seemed more succulent.  They also have way more hot/sweet/etc. pepper selection.   Dalessandro's has my current cheesesteak crown.  Too bad it doesn't help if I'm down in Center City.   Douglas K. over and out.
