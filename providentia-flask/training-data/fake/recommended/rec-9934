This is a difficult review to tease apart from the great joy I have from being reunited with some lovely friends of mine who I haven't seen in many years (but have held the love of in my heart). But top off a reunion with old friends with corn cakes and perfectly poached eggs, paired with a mild yet flavorful tomatillo salsa & a salad with mushrooms (and all the coffee I could drink) for a $16 brunch (usually $14, but had the special, so extra $2, totally worth it) and...I don't know. The East Coast with its gross muggy weather, impending snowy grey horrible days, lack of pristine beaches and friends within walking distance seems less horrific. It's gonna be okay. There will be friends. There will be brunch. This place says "It's gonna be okay." Thanks Rose Water, thanks.
