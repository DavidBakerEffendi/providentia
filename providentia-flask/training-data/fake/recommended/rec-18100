There are so many great restaurants in this amazing city and for me to return I really need to be impressed. Russet has gone above and beyond to make a lasting impression. I can honestly tell how passionate the Chefs are just by looking at the Menu. With beautiful presentation and QUALITY ingredients which correlates into each bite standing to be better than the last.    I do agree with another yelper to the tone of Russet having the best brunch in the city. The Duck terrine panini in my own opinion is the best brunch item in the city.   I will never forget my dinner which started off with a  delicious house cured Coppa dish so astounding it still makes me scoff at the others imported by Di Bruno's. My main dish was a perfectly seared pork chop, which I never wanted to finish. With thoughts of calling a psychiatrist to alleviate my depression after I finished and when our server took away the plate my heart was broken. My party moved on with my mind still stuck in the immediate past. Dessert menu's were gracefully dropped off. While reading the dessert menu, the words "Maple ice cream with Bacon brittle" jumped off the page and in this very instant I knew I could love again. This was above and beyond breathtaking.  Bacon brittle, Bacon brittle ohh Bacon brittle.   Both times Ive come into Russet nothing was out of place and I've left very pleased not only with the food but the knowledgeable serving staff whom are all friendly. I look forward to my next meal here and am anxiously awaiting the next time I can take someone here who still hasn't been. Thank you again Chef and staff.
