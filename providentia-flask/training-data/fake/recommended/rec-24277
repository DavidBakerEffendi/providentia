Before I moved back to NY Johnny Brenda's was my neighborhood spot.  Before I moved in Fishtown it was one of my favorite bars and venues in the entire city. There's a relaxed vibe in this place that allows each patron to do what the fuck they want with who the fuck they want and no ones gonna give a shit.  That being said, most of the people here are pretty cool. HIGHLIGHTS -Decently priced brews -Decently strong well drinks -Tasty tasty food -Lights that change color inside the booth tables -Hard oyster crackers with horseradish to dip in at the bar that no one touches but me About the venue:  It manages to be multi-level and remain intimate.  I've seen a wide range of bands here from local acts to bigger names and there's something about the space that heightens the level of interaction between musician and fan.  Even when it's crowded you can find your space to dance plus it's always cheap!
