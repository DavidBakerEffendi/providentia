The food, service, beverages, atmosphere, everything was top notch!  We ordered a lot of different dishes and while none of them were sent back with food on them, the razor clams and cockles and the artichoke and manchego wrapped in ham and the choriza and chocolate were all amazing and deserve a special shout out! We got there early enough that we didn't have to wait for a table even though we didn't have a reservation on a Sat night and everyone was super nice and friendly and attentive, although I would highly recommend making a reservation on the weekends, it did get really packed really fast.   I highly recommend this excellent restaurant!!
