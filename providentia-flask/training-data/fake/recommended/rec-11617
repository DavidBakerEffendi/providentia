I was a little underwhelmed by this place after hearing rave reviews from colleagues and friends! Ordered the Plato don, a massive platter with shrimp, tilapia, and additional condiments (guacamole, black beans, rice etc) but taste wise it wasn't anything special. I couldn't quite put my fingers on it but it tasted similar to Chipotle tbh. On the flip side, lovely ambience and decor. I probably would not come here again.
