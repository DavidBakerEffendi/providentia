Dropped in here after a flight from San Francisco.  Many places closed on Sunday night but this was a real find.  Really nice atmosphere.  An excellent selection of beers on tap and in bottles.  For food I had the bbq chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun.  Came with fries and a pickle.  All good.  My friend had the soup of the day, tomato.  The bartender said that it was her favorite soup there and she was right.  She was also very friendly and attentive, keeping up a running conversation with everyone at the bar.
