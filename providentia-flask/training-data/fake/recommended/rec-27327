Barrio Chino is one of the many things that I really miss about NYC. It was one of my favorite spots when I lived in New York and I regularly grabbed lunch or dinner here. This place is really unique but I feel like it takes a certain type of person to appreciate it. From the street, it doesn't look like anything special. It's tiny, and the decor has a gritty feel but if you ask me it's one of the best spots in NYC. It has so much character and soul. And more importantly their food is delicious. Especially their tacos. It's not easy to find good Mexican food on the East Coast so if you're a Californian living in NYC, you really appreciate how authentic their fare is. And their margaritas are pretty yummy too. My favorite is the Tamarind Margarita.
