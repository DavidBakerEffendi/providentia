Food: Five stars!!! The tacos are absolutely scrumptious. I have had the carne asada tacos (nicely charred, savory smoky flavor), tacos al pastor (tangy pineapples balance a savory fatty meat), catfish tacos (soft fleshy white fish with slight spice), and the fried chicken tacos (adequately fried with white meat, less spice, more BBQ flavor). They are all good, it just depends what you feel like. Queso nachos with carne and queso nachos with tomato salsa are good too. Great snack to go along with the happy hour margaritas! $5 from 4-7pm on weekdays. The tacos are the highlight of this place! I've eaten at Chavella's for the last two years, and I think it's refreshing to have tex-mex tacos and support a new local business. I prefer Gueros any day! Drinks: Amazing frozen Margaritas! Be sure to get them and even better if you do during Happy Hour! Atmosphere: Slightly crowded. Tables turn quickly.
