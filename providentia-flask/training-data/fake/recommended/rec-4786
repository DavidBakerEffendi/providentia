I have really mixed opinions about El Camino Real. The first time I went the food was phenomenal!  We got the veggie wings and fried pickles and they were perfect.  I'm a vegetarian, and they have A LOT of options for me there.  The watermelon margarita was really good too.  I liked it so much I decided to go back for lunch with my husband. The second time (said lunch) was completely different.  I got the vegetarian barbecue sandwich thing (I don't remember the name) and it was incredibly greasy.  Like grease running down my arm when I bit into it greasy.  It didn't taste all that great either.  The margarita this time tasted like there was no tequila in it at all.   I'm not sure if they're just better at dinner and their lunch is to be avoided or what.  I had a few other friends that had the same experience as me as well.  First time was great, subsequent times no so much.   I'd be willing to give it one more try but if that doesn't work out I'm done.
