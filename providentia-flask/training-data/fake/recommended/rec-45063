Late night dinner on Saturday after a show. Reservations are needed here. It was standing room only at the bar at 10. We got there early and after about 5 minutes we were seated early. Nice! Tables are tight and this place is loud. No real insulation to absorb noise with wooden floors, walls and tin ceiling. It just ads to the ambiance. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. They have a nice wine selection and a few interesting cocktails. Someone ordered the Cherry Masher cocktail. It was delicious! For a restaurant whose website plays Willie Nelson, I was a bit surprised that the bar lacked Jack Daniels. I was offered Jim Beam as a substitute, which any bourbon drinker knows is a poor substitute at best. I'm pretty sure I made a face of some sort. Oh well, Makers Mark filled in as his second suggestion. On the plus side, they had these fantastic marinated cherries for my Manhattan. They made the drink. For dinner I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon, with warm Brussels sprout salad, carrot ginger puree and walnut pesto. I don't even like Brussels sprouts. They were delicious! Clean plate club. My dining companions ordered the mussel appetizers, Fontina macaroni, herbed french fries, oven roasted cauliflower. I could go back just to work my way through the appetizer and vegetable menu. Service was excellent, prices very reasonable. I would not hesitate to go back here again or recommend to anyone needing a dining option in or near Chelsea.
