I really tried to love HipCity, I really truthfully did; however, every single time I come by to give it another chance and purchase a "groothie", it's always lukewarm and doesn't sit right with me, or my coworkers. What's the deal, HipCity? I'll give it another try the next time I come by. Hopefully this won't be a disappointment.
