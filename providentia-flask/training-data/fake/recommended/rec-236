Got the garlique chic crepe with a whole wheat crepe after much consideration...everything on the menu was so good looking, I didn't know what to pick. Emphasis on local ingredients is great. Adorable inside and nice outdoor seating. Pay at the counter and they bring your food out to you. The frumple cakes were also a big hit with my group. Loved it!
