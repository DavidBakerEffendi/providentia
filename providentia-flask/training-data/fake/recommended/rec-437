This place is all kinds of awesome! Food here is delicious ~ the mac and cheese has potatoes and panko in it, holy cow! Seared octopus was amazing, so were the muscles. Basically I've never had a bad dish.  The date cake is so sugar-coma inducing it must be shared with a friend. The drinks are plenty with great choices. The wait may be long depending on when you come but the service is generally fast and very friendly.  There is definitely a vibe here - think "Sleep No More"-esque meets steampunk. You can't help but play into its charm. The decor is amazing, including the quirky bathroom downstairs - complete with a haunting ghost, apparently. So be careful when you flush. My favorite time to come is on chilled spring evenings with the doors open, Baby Soda playing in the corner, and some port in my glass.
