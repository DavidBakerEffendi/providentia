Ok, just to prove I have a heart, I'm going to exercise discretion and not tempt ill karma. Stopped in with my partner the other day and the place did me a solid.  I'm gonna leave it at that. The least I can do is say my partner and I are sworn to protect the public, so my advice would be to go elsewhere.  Enough said
