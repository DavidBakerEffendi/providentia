One of those sunday nights I was literally dragged to Sweet Afton....and surprise , surprise I did not regret a minute spent out there....This bar is very much so warm and friendly...atmosphere is so laid back and chill.....you just want to be there ,all right that sounds a little  cheesey  but hey ,it's all about good , friendly surrounding and enviroment...which in my case is crucial.They have a variety of beers,and all sorts of crazy shots concoctions ,which can surprise you every now and than, prices-wise I can't really complain,not very expensive...It's a good spot to meet new people ,and the staff will make sure ,that you feel comfortable,even if you are flying solo :) Highly recommended !!!
