First off, I'm a vegetarian.  It's hard to find a good vegetarian meal... usually it's pasta, pizza, or a salad, all of which I'm quite sick of.  When I saw the veggie meatballs on the menu online, I wanted to try them.  I tried several times to get in here, but it was always too packed to even be worth waiting.  Finally, I decided to eat at the bar, where there was no wait.   I got the veggie meatball hero with tomato sauce and mozzarella.  I have had frozen veggie meatballs before and hated them.  These were nothing like the veggie meatballs I've had before.  They were amazing.  The tomato sauce was quite good too.  The sandwich was so good, I felt guilty using a napkin to clean my hands.  I can definitely see myself coming back here.
