I was pretty excited to visit Eight Turn Crepe after seeing so many great reviews about this place. My experience wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I ordered the Chicken Thai crepe. It was quite different than the crepes I had in Harajuku Street in Japan. What's great about the crepe is that it's thin and cone shaped. What I dislike about the crepe is that it didn't deliver the crispiness I was expecting out of a Japanese crepe. I would hear the crunch from every bite from the crepes in Japan. The crepes from Eight Turn Crepe are far from crispy. The crepes in Japan had a lot of sauce. As for this Chicken Thai crepe, instead of it having a lot of sauce, it had a light drizzle of sauce, making the crepe a lot drier than expected. Aside from the Japanese comparison, the crepe was a little on the spicy side. The sauce was delicious, but I wish they gave more sauce. White meat chicken is dry, so I wish they would add more sauce to make up the dryness. I also ordered the royal milk tea. It tasted great. Would I recommend this place? Yes, if you haven't eaten the crepes in Japan. Because if you can't compare these crepes to something better, you will think these crepes are awesome. Would I go back? Maybe not. I'm not sure if spending a total of about $15 on a crepe and drink is worth it, especially after paying only about $4 for a crepe in Japan (compared to spending $8-9 on a crepe from Eight Turn Crepe).
