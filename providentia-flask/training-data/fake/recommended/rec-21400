Shake Shack is one of my favorite burger spots in Philly! It can be a tad bit pricey but so worth it. There are always going to be people walking in and out so it'll probably take about 10 minutes to get your food. I order the shack burger with cheese fries and get a side of chopped cherry peppers (adds a little kick to the burger). It's a great place to go when it's your cheat day!
