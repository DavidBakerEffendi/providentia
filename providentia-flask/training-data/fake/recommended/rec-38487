Similar set-up and menu to Chipotle but feels less commercial and more authentic, and food is better. The carnitas burrito with black beans, guac, corn, lettuce, and salsa verde might be my favorite quick grab-and-go meal in the city. Â Seating is limited, so at a busy time you'll most likely need to take your food to go.
