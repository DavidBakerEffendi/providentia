Very disappointed in our dining experience here, especially after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  The food itself was good. I had a wonderful ravioli appetizer that just melted in my mouth, but the mushroom pasta that everyone raves about was not as good as I had hoped.  Good, yes.  Great, amazing, the best thing you've ever had?  No way.  I probably would have liked it more had I not read all of the hype on Yelp first. I'm taking away so many stars because the service was ATROCIOUS.  Our waiter was an African American guy (I wish I asked his name) who was rude and weird.  He made snarky comments when he asked him questions about the menu, and was not at all friendly.  He was also not a good salesman -- when we asked him about a dish with beets, he responded, "Well, I wouldn't order that because I hate beets."  I guess I can appreciate the candor, but it was just a weird response. When we told him that our dessert was overcooked, he did not apologize, nor was that item taken off our bill (we should have insisted).  Management, if you're reading this -- please hire more professional staff.  I expect more of a restaurant that charges high prices.   Finally, this place is LOUD -- I'm fine with noise, but we were yelling across the table to be heard.   All in all, I'm sad to be giving this place such a poor review.  I had such high hopes.
