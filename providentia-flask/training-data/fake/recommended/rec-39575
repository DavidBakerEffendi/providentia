Can't beat BYOB paired with excellent food. The prices are incredibly reasonable considering (a) how lovingly the food is prepared, and (b) how attentive and friendly the staff are. Buster's is an absolute gem in New York City - the food is creative, fresh, and flavorful. It's worth a trip even if you're coming from another borough. I haven't had lunch, but it's adorable for a dinner date.
