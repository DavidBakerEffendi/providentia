I liked the down to earth feel of the restaurant and the staff was pretty friendly. Prices were also pretty good. However, I believe I've had better fried chicken before (and what is up with the gravy?) and the fried okra was less than desirable. I'd come here if I wanted to stay away from the Bedford Ave crowd.
