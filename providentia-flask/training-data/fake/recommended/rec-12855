So I heard great things about this place, so I decided to check it out on my trip to NYC. My friend and I arrived around 10:00am and had to wait over an hour for a table. I heard about the wait time, so we waited for it. Needless to say, we had high expectations for these pancakes. They didn't meet our expectation. They were good, but not worth the wait and price. I paid about $18 for pancakes and water. Honestly, I can get better deals for food just as good somewhere else. They charged me automatic gratuity of about 15%. Honestly, I am a generous tipper (I worked as a waitress for quite a while before), but this was insane. 15% tip for breakfast, and it was MANDATORY. I understand automatic gratuity for large parties or high class restaurants, but this was incomprehensible to me. Like the Yelp rating says, "Meh. I've experienced better."
