I'll keep this short: SERVICE Pretty good, fast with food, a little slow with the bill. They were able to accommodate a group of 10 really easily, which was great. FOOD Surprisingly good. Flavors usually worked well; the dish with the scallops was a little heavy on the goat cheese, but the squid ink pasta was good, and the short rib ragu pasta also tasted good. Plating was done well; portion size was really small though. Their desserts were pretty good as well; their chocolate cake was dense but very tasty. Black raspberry gelato was delicious with little bits of raspberry in it. PRICE Great pasta, but honestly a little on the pricey side for me. $17-22 for rather small portions. Would I go back? Probably not, but it's a decent place in a decent location for decent food, and one helluva catch for anyone with eating restrictions.
