Service and atmosphere were excellent. Nothing you can get picky with. Dishes were not that surprising comparing with reviews I read here though. Some dishes combine Asian style, which maybe interesting for people who don't know Asian culinary well. If you have known Asian cooking well, you would find some dishes using Asian materials only to be interesting, not to best their taste. One other disappointment was souffle. It was a..... soft brownie. Can't compare with other ones I had.
