there is SO MUCH HYPE about this place, it's kinda crazy. i've had it a few times over the last few years and although its good - don't get me wrong - its certainly not my favorite place in the city. anyway, now that thats aside, lets get to the food - ive had the chicken & rice as well as the chicken/lamb & rice - both are great, don't think you can go wrong with either. they essentially mince up the meat so it all kinda ends up tasting similar anyway. comes with sauces - ones like a ranch and the other is SUPER SPICY! this is really what i love about the dish! i def ask for extra, because you get a LOT of food and one packet of each wont suffice. its also REALLY cheap - $6 and it lasted me 2 meals, though doesnt taste as great the next day when its cold.
