Took my daughter late afternoon for lunch and something sweet;  we had a great time.  Good mojito to warm up the cooling down ( it was 98 degrees outside). She raved about the peach iced tea, which I tasted, and agreed was spectacular.  Emma had the BALT and waffle fries - I had the Max burger or Brennen burger - enough with the naming items after oneself, please.  But, excellent burger.with an onion ring, perfectly cooked.  OK, I am a burger snob.  I do not want anything but good, real meat, cooked perfectly medium rare, and this place delivered.  I hate to send food back, and I will not eat burgers cooked beyond MR, so I studiously avoid chain restaurant burgers.  Applebee's only serves their burgers medium and above (trust your meat source much? yuck). Ok, dessert for me was the Suckao(?) warm milk over a votive with an intriguing metal shovel/straw for loading the chipped chocolate (choice of dark, milk, or white) into the warm milk to stir and melt.  More warm milk on the side to adjust and savor.  Very nice.  Sweet Emma was too full after her beautiful BART for the lusted after deserts, and had a milk chocolate granita with orange.  It was the sweet she craved when she walked in, and the cool the weather demanded. She loved it. Max's was entirely empty when we went (at a seriously off-time on a Monday), but we thought the place was terrific.  The music soundtrack really worked for us - REM, Bowie,...) and we were very comfortable at our table.  Looking forward to a return visit to work our way through the crepes and mac and cheese as well as the fondue and other desserts. Service was very nice, not too "hovery", and there when we wanted it.
