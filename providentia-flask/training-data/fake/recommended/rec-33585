I ordered the whole bronzino which was cooked perfectly - perhaps second only to Crispo on 14th. My friend got the steak which they managed not to screw up (happens to me all the time when I eat out). The girlfriends both got pasta, and bot dished were.... out of control! j/k. they were excellent though. Our server was fast, efficient.
