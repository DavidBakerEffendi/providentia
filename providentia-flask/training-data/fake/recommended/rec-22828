I went there on New Year's Day after I heard some Korean friends raving about the place, and I can see why. The ambience in the restaurant is nice and cozy, don't take the latter too literally though, since as other reviewers have pointed out the place can be a bit cold because of the vent hoods. We got the BBQ combo for 5 (you get 14 sides with that, most of which were various types of kimchi and salads) and one person in my party ordered sushi. The food was delicious; the parts of the meat that were marinated were just right and the sides were nice and authentic. The experience of cooking meat on a grill on my own table was new to me - and totally fun! Their sushi got good reviews as well. Prices are a bit high, but not too unreasonable considering the quality. My friends noticed that some items disappeared from the menu since the last time they went to the restaurant, so I guess the restaurant still needs some time to get to run really well. Still, the food came super fast and the staff we interacted with was very nice.
