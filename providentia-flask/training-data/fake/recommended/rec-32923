Everything I've tasted was pretty good, but I crave their penne vodka like a pregnant woman...like writing this review makes me want some... Their pizza is alright but I don't think of this place when I crave pizza (oddly enough), but for anything else on the menu I think they nailed it. Inside is clean and comfortable. It gets to be pricey when you want to order more than one thing, but the portions are big. The only thing I DO NOT like is that I went there with the yelp coupon for 30% off and they seemed really annoyed with giving me the discount...like why offer your patrons a coupon if you don't want them to use it? Now I'm much too intimidated to use it again, oh well! I still love that penne vodka!
