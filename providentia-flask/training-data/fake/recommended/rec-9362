I like the atmosphere and the vibe but honestly I'm not sure why the place was so busy. The food was very mediocre. I felt like everything left me wanting more. I will say the rotisserie chicken was the exception; great flavor and the meat fell off the bone. I also had rice and beans, fried plantains, French fries with small sausages and a side salad. All of these were lacking flavor. I felt like everything needed sauce. I would not recommend this place; just don't believe the food was that great.
