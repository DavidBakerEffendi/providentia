This place was pretty good. I went there for a very early dinner/late lunch last week. The service was solid. Our waiter was not hesitant to make recommendations and made sure we were in good shape the whole meal. We didn't feel bothered but did not feel ignored, either. Overall, the service was outstanding. We had a jarra of sangria, which was very, very good. We had a couple of appetizers, which were uniformly outstanding. The cebiche limeno was very, very good, as was the palta rellena. The latter could have been a little more flavorful, but it was very good. As a main couse, I had the Camarones Cuzco. Thsi was good but bland. I think it would have benefitted from being spiced up a bit. My dining partner had the Chicken Pio, which was absolutely huge, and apparently good. For dessertm we had both the flan and the tres leches. Both were outstanding. We didn't expect to eat both, since it was so early, but we couldn't help ourselves. In the end, I'd go back certainly for drinks and appetizers. I'd have dinner there, again as well, but I might order something different.
