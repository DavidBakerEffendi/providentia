I'm specifically writing to call this restaurant out on the shortcomings of its delivery service. As other reviews correctly note, Bodhi Tree offers great food at a great value. I have ordered from them countless times during the 3 or so years that I have worked in the neighborhood. It is only recently that their delivery man has begun pulling this stupid stunt where he calls ahead and lets the phone ring exactly once before absconding with my food. Every time this happens, I call him back but he does not pick up. I call him several times, then end up calling the restaurant to send him back, which results in my food arriving late and cold. This is not the patience of the Buddha. It's happened so frequently during the last 4 months that I decided to stop ordering from them altogether. Today, I decided to give them another shot. Well, guess what happened? The previous time this happened, I got a call back from someone who I assumed was the manager, who was very rude to me. So it's my suspicion that the apple doesn't fall far from the Bodhi Tree.
