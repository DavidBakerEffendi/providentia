Its fine, nothing more. I appreciated the quick cafeteria style vs. the "20 minute wait" at lots of other BBQ places on the block. Food may be room temp, but there is a microwave at the condiment station. While "low cost" keep an eye out for the alcohol, which is right up there with market prices, $5 and change for a large Sapporo beer.
