We were new to Burlington and despite being busy at 6pm on Saturday night, they made an effort to squeeze us in. Big plus to l'Amante. Waitress was very friendly and restaurant gave an upscale first impression, although the music was so quiet it could hardly be heard. Then we came to the food. Guys, you need help in the kitchen!! The Calamari came very quickly and was so undercooked we had to send it back!!! The second batch was charred and chewy like it was frozen!!! The main courses (chicken and grilled prawn risotto) were both reasonable but our side of Brussel sprouts were charred black and again were sent back. Our waitress was very accommodating when returning the food items but but it seemed that some of the other waitresses had more diner than upscale restaurant experience. All in all, our experience was ok but the restaurant could do better in the kitchen for the prices it charges. It does have a decent wine and cocktail selection though...
