The reason people don't go to this spacious friendly restaurant is because it's ok but mostly it's so over-priced. I just picked up a Sopa de Lima (Chicken Soup) for $8.71, it had one drum stick in it! Tomato broth and tortilla strips. I had a way over-priced meal there last summer, 3 people over $100, for Mexican food, not sure why I went back, probably because it's across the street from my apt. I can get 3 packs of drumsticks at the over-priced Foodtown.
