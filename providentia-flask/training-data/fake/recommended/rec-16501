Stop the reviews people! This place is as good as it gets. Small and intimate yes, as Mehta's food provides some of the most eclectic flavor profile combinations you will run across in the city! This place provides a terrific ambiance for romance or friends. One absolutely cannot dine here without trying the "Zucchini Hummus Pizza" or the "Braised Pork Buns w/Apple Chutney"! OMG....if one could make love to food this would be it! Me being an uptown guy have to go on to say it's well worth the ride downtown! What's even greater is that he also offers a great burger as well for those easy going diners. Looking forward myself at returning to rent out their new private dining space they just acquired next door! AMAZING! LOVE THIS PLACE!!! While it could stand to be bigger, there is definitely something to be said about the simplicity of this space. It's all about the food people!
