I have a 10y/o daughter with Autism and we went to this place to have lunch. She started having crying spells and almost immediately the Host came up to us telling me that they have to move us to another table because the other customers are getting scared. There were hardly any customers at that time. I explained that my daughter's a special needs child and she will soon calm down. The Host said, "Well try your best to work it out so that everything will be okay". He could not care less. So I said, "if you cant accommodate us then we will leave".....I stood up and left. I will never come back to this place again. There food is not that good, expensive, and the place is not family friendly.
