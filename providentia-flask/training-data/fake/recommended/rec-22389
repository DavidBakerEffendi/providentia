Holy Cow!!!!!!.....after we finish puking I'll come back and write a righteous review.  That is assuming wwe live thru the night!!!!!! One month later I return to this...i.e. completing review of the worst "sushi" I've ever eaten.  I've been all over Asia, eaten the best in NYC and SF where I hang and I have never seen anything that rivals this.  I mean I actually gagged on the putrid shad that was stuck in one of the more "creative rolls".  BTW folks, sushi rolls are the mac and cheese of the sushi world!  Without wasting any more of my time on this, just note that the 5 star reviews all cite the alcohol (sake bombs, specialty sakes, etc) that should give you some sense of who thinks this stuff is "da bomb"!
