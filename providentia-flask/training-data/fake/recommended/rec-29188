Best cheesesteak in philadelphia. Finely chopped steak served on a very large roll (great bread!), with all kinda of toppings and extras to choose from. Everyone has their personal cheesesteak requirements (how the steak is cut, type of cheese, etc.), but Dallesandros is easily my favorite in the city! Always very busy with line out the door (small area). I would suggest calling ahead to pick up your order. But if it's nice out, they have plenty of outside seating. Note to the new customer: walk right up to the counter to order, as most of the restaurant is filled with people waiting and you could be standing in a non-existent "line" for a while!
