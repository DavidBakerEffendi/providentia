Supper's brunch is awesome. This place is a great East Village spot. I like to community table in front, but I prefer to sit at the bar that faces directly in to the open kitchen. The grilled polenta with poached eggs and the french toast are the best items on the menu. The french toast is thick and luscious and comes with pecans. The grilled polenta is a little bit bland, but sometimes that's exactly what you want when you're hungover and have a bloody mary in your other hand. Great brunch spot, been here for dinner too and it's really cute. Service is always good, wait is never too long, and the vibe is very comfortable and neighborhood-y.
