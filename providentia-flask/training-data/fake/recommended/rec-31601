I don't agree with a lot of reviews on yelp, but this place is pretty damn good. I recall trying it a while back, maybe a year, and thinking it was not that good. I don't know if it has changed owners but I have been there several times recently. The pieces of chicken you get here are twice the size of disgusting KFC and Popeyes. The mashed potatoes are real and a good size order. The sauces you get for the tenders are really tasty, honey mustard and BBQ. I'll save the best for last and wish they provided a bigger piece, the cornbread is awesome. Â I have forgotten what all other cornbread even tastes like. I will be back here, a lot.
