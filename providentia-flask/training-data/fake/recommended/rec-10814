This place is awesome! The Dungeness crab clusters is an incredible way to enjoy crab without the work of full blue crabs by the dozen. Sit on the third floor deck, you're surrounded on 360 degrees with windows that open like large garage doors to create an open air deck. The view of the harbor and statue of liberty are great. We were there last night and a random fireworks display took off! Bottom line, great food, great view, really nice staff.
