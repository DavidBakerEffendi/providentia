Ate here the other night for the 3rd time and it was even more amazing than ever - we had 9 different dishes on the menu and all our table could talk about was which was the best dish because one was just as delicious as the next. I highly recommend eating here, particularly if you enjoy exciting and flavorful food, and trying lots of the small plates as well as the desert with shaved ice - I'm still thinking about the chicken wings on special the other night, Wow.
