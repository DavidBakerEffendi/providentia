Very nice. Coffee excellent. Get the bottomless brew especially if you have a meal. Nice food choices. Lots of vegetarian. Table had Sriracha. Perfect for the breakfast burrito I failed to capture a picture because I jumped in and started chowing down. Restrooms clean. Good sign. Gets busy. Parking and narrow streets only hassle.
