Enjoyed a very flavorful, seasonal, and hearty meal here with three friends on a recent cold Saturday night. The owner and a very capable crew -- all warm, smiley, good-looking young people (as my Dad might say) -- made the place hum. Customers seemed in a good mood. Lot 2 reflects a strong commitment to the owner's culinary aesthetic, including at the bar. And while the martini-craver will be annoyed at the no-vodka sitch, they may very quickly find themselves surprised by the great bourbon cocktail that one can only describe as "carefully hand-crafted" by a patient and pleasant bartender. We also had a thumbs-up bottle of reasonably priced wine. Manhattanites might find the crowd to be "a little hipsterish," but seriously don't be intimidated by the unassuming-but-cute-Brooklyness of it all. There's a lot of love in the room. Heck, the night we were there we sat one table away from Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, and everyone thought it was so cool, (though of course would never show it). Â  One star off for over-reliance on salt and butter. Y'all don't need to use as much of either -- I think your food would be even greater with less!
