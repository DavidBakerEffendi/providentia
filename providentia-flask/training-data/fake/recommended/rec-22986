Easily the worst sushi experience of my life. The fish was pale in color overall, not vibrant. The taste was okay, but the rolls were roughly constructed and just kind of sloppy. The appetizers we got were fine, but tiny for the price. Overall, just a bad value and the decor, waitress and entire experience lacked authenticity. We hit a sushi restaurant every time my son and I travel to one of his summer lacrosse tournaments. It's a tradition. Recently, we were at a superb all you can eat sushi spot in Ontario. For $50, we left stuffed and happy. At San Sai, we just left feeling ripped off, kinda hungry and $110 poorer. Don't bother!
