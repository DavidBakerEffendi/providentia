My husband and I had lunch here during a recent trip to Burlington.  There was about a 20 minute wait at around 2pm on a Saturday - but it was well worth it.   We tried two of their in-house brewed beers which were both really excellent and - although all of the pizzas looked delicious - we went with the New Vermont Sausage pizza, which was really excellent.  The sausage was more like breakfast sausage than a traditional Italian sausage that you would normally see on pizza.  Paired with the caramelized onions, mushrooms, and thyme, it was just the perfect combination of flavors.
