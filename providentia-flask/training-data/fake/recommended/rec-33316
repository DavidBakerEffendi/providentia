Love this place one of my favorite places for brunch.  The staff is very friendly the service is fast and the food is very good.  Some dishes have a nice kick! The decor is very cozy and the bathroom is too cute! You must try their banana pudding and the tastiest  chicken and waffles ever!  They use chicken breast which makes the whole thing easier to eat !
