I came on a Thursday afternoon and it was empty except for one other girl drinking a beer by the door. I walked straight to the counter and looked at the menu. I got the half salad and half sandwich and was directed to sit anywhere I wanted. I was brought utensils and water immediately which was efficient. My food came quickly and it was surprisingly pretty good. I wouldn't say it was the freshest lettuce I've ever had in a salad but it was definitely good. The Caesar dressing wasn't over powering and the turkey wasn't dry. It was good for what it was. I would come back again for the quiet atmosphere which is nice to study since it is right across the street from City College. There is also free wifi and the waiter provided me with the password before I even asked.
