I must say the lobster roll at the DUMBO flea market was utterly amazing...it was worth every penny! The  lobster tasted fresh, not too much mayo, the buttered toasted bun ...as Molly stated "everything was just perfect."  I think I'm going to have to stop myself from going there every sunday to get one. ;-)
