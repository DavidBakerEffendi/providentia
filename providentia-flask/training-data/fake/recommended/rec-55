More like 3.5 stars. The place is small, it feels cramped. And it is very loud. We ordered the pork special, but when it arrived we realized it had 1 ounce of meat and 4 ounces of pure fat. They told us that there was no mistake: the Chef expects us to eat the fat too (and die of a heart attack before dessert, apparently). But they were gracious about offering to take the dishes away and bring us something else. So we played it safe and ordered their chicken dish, which turned out to be piping hot (don't know how they get a chicken to be this hot. We could not touch it for several minutes), huge, and pretty good. It was supposed to be served with some sort of risotto, which was not really one (not creamy), but it was still enjoyable. Overall, it was an OK dinner, but not memorable.
