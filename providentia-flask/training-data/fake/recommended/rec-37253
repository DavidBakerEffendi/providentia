Everything looks good on the outside, I heard the interior was remodeled beautifully. The food Â was TERRIBLE.....TERRIBLE. The Caesar salad was just leafy greens with a few strips of chicken for $13 bucks. The buffalo wings were awful my husband put them back in the oven with sauce from one of our favorites. I will never go back! I much rather had spent that at stop & shop to make us our own lunch at home. By the way the portions are toddler sized, save your money.
