I really like this place.  Food is reasonably priced for a bowl of hand drawn noodle soup.  And you have to get the hand drawn noodle - it's what they are known for.  The first time I went, I didn't think it was anything too great.  They offer 2 types of noodles - pulled or shaved.  I went with pulled and really didn't notice much of a difference compared to other noodles. The next time I went, I went with shaved and oh what a difference!  The texture is not like regular noodles.  Definitely go Shaved when you go. I get the braised sparerib noodle soup today, and it usually is very flavorful.  The broth tastes clean, not too greasy or MSG-ish.  Today, it was clean, but rather bland. Cilantro helped, but couldn't make up for all the blandness.  Noodles and beef were perfect.  Maybe it was just an off day. The spicy pig ear sounds weird, but it's pretty good.  Waaaay too spicy for my taste, but if you like spicy, give it a try.  I ate more of it than i usually do to make up for the soup's lack of flavor. This place only takes cash too, so make sure you have the green on you.  They do have an atm inside for your convenience. I'll give this place another chance in hopes the broth tastes better next time around.  Still love the shaved noodles.
