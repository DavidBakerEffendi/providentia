The light of my life. The first time I went to Risotteria, I knew I would move to New York City. It was magical. It was the first gluten-free restaurant I had been to where I didn't have to qualify the food as "good, for gluten-free..." and to this day, it is the only gluten-free restaurant that I go to where my non-Celiac friends crave the food as much as I do. The space is small and cozy, but you can usually be seated within 20-30 minutes at peak times. The breadsticks are delicious and complimentary! Try as I might, I typically eat between 2-5... My favorite pizzas are the Margarita and the pesto, arugala with feta and goat cheese. They are heavenly. The thing crust is entirely authentic and the ratio of sauce to cheese and topping is perfect. They also re-heat quite well if, like me, your eyes are bigger than your stomach. The paninis used to be sort of crumbly, the way gluten free products can be, but they have seriously improved and now have a crusty and crunchy texture. I enjoy the pesto and oven dried tomato one very much, but haven't tried many of the options. I tend to order a cupcake or cookie at the end of my email---just because I can. But, in all honesty, the gluten-free cupcakes at the various gluten-free bakeries around the city are better. The one dessert that is unbeatable at Risotteria is the lemon cheesecake. It is light and fluffy and delicately infused with lemon flavorings. Here is my confession: I have never ordered risotto at Risotteria. I find that because Risotto tends to be one of the things that I can actually order at a non-gluten free restaurant, it does not excite me to order risotto at a place where I can have pizza or a panini! Overall, an NYC treasure, I highly recommend it.
