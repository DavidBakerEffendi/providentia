The space is beautiful! The restaurants before Pagani were gross and they came in and made the place beautiful. The bar area is cute and the dining area in the way back is very cozy. Now into the food. This was my second time here. First time we ordered the salad with apples to share and it was good. Nothing fantastic, but good. We both had pastas which were good although a little bit overstated. Still yummy though. Second visit we had the beet salad which was really yummy. I usually don't order the beet salad on a menu because, well, it's totally overdone. But I was having a little craving and in glad i ordered it. We also ordered the arincini. I didn't order it, friend did. I don't like smoked mozzarella, so I wasn't a fan of thai dish, but it looked yummy and my friend enjoyed it. The little piece I tried, though, was cold, hmmmm. For entrees, I ordered tortellini and friend ordered the chicken. Bothe were good sized portions and yummy. Again though, I thought my pasta was a little over salted. Cocktail menu was interesting. My drink wasn't strong enough though. Overall, this place is so cute and staff was really nice. The noise level was a little annoying in the beginning but it quieted down at about 9:30 (res was for 8:15). I'd totally come back for food, I want to try brunch and I'd try just having a drink at the bar. With so many fair restaurant choices in the area, I hope this place makes it. As Â long as their food and service is consistent they should have no problem staying around for a long time.
