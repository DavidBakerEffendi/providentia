My cousin and I come here about once a month, to fulfill out Mexican craving. It difficult to find good Mexican food out here in Philly. (We're from Cali) anyways we always start off with the nacho! And they never disappoint, we get them with black beans and steak, ooooh they are delicious! This time we got the s'mores pudding for dessert. We wanted the peach cobbler but our waiter said we should try the pudding. And Oooh myyy I'm glad we did. It was amazing. Well worth the wait. It was topped with roasted marshmallows and marshmallow ice cream and the bottom was a hot brownie it was divine!! I wanna go back tonight!
