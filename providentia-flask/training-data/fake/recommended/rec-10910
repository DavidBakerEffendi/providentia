Cocktails and good, comforting food. Applewood continually delivers in those categories. You aren't going to find a menu laden with obscure ingredients or new and inventive cooking techniques here and, frankly, you shouldn't expect that given the general ambiance of the place. Going to Applewood feels like attending a large dinner party. The decor is traditional with a very modest touch of country influence and being at the table really reminds me of eating with my extended family. Except, you know, my family doesn't employ a waitstaff and give me a bill at the end of the meal. As to the food, it's a well prepared assortment of what I consider comfort foods. I guess you might consider it New American, but whatever. I'm typically looking for meat, potatoes, and a dark leafy green here and I'm always satisfied with what I've found. I'd also recommend trying the house made charcuterie as it has always been spectacular. I'll also mention the cocktails here. They have an ever changing selection of cocktails that is generally interesting and delicious. I'm not much of a cocktail person, but my wife and friends always love them and the ones I've tried have been pretty exceptionally crafted. The one time I was let down by Applewood was the one time I went for brunch. I had heard rave reviews, but I just wasn't into it. It felt like the menu was just a bunch of omelets and I was expecting some interesting hashes and things like that. Maybe I hit it on the wrong day or perhaps it's just not my style of brunch. It used to be that there were only a couple of places that were worth going for a nice evening out in Park Slope and, thankfully, that trend is starting to change. But, despite the increased competition in that space, Applewood still ranks highly for me and I've always enjoyed my trips there. Sure, try the other places as well, but make sure to give Applewood a go at some point too.
