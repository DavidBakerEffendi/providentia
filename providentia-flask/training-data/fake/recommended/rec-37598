It's alright. Reasons? The food: It's decent. Nothing to write home about, but I've never eaten a bad meal here. The prices: Top-notch for the Philly area. Probably the cheapest decent Korean food you can find here. You order at the front counter and you wait for them to bring it out for you. No tips here. The atmosphere: Pretty dingy eating space, and populated mostly with Penn and Drexel students who live in the area. Still, it doesn't deter me from coming. BOTTOM LINE: When I want Korean food for cheap, without paying tip, food prepared quickly, AND if I want to be able to eat alone without feeling weird, I come to Koreana. Plus I think their bubble tea is quite good, and they even have a frequent bubble tea buyer's card where you get a free bubble tea after buying five.
