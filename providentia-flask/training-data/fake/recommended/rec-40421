Arrived Saturday night and We had a long day. There was a dj which was pretty cool. I came in well knowing this is an Asian fusion restaurant and not a legit Vietnamese/Chinese/Taiwanese restaurant so comparing them to the ones back in my hometown New York would be unfair. My high review is mostly because our waitress Briana was great. She was attentive and sweet and very patient. And the dj was pretty cool too. The food was decent. My group of five ordered the chicken soup, skewers, the pho and the banh Mi. The pho's broth wasn't the delicate savory type of normal Vietnamese restaurants but even the small was filling. Some of the dishes are either massive or tiny. The banhmi was smaller than average and could use some more filling especially the meat and pickled veggies to give it that memorable punch as was the skewers but the large soups were HUGE. The chicken soup my friend had was really quite nice And the free table side sweet potato chips and dips were Wonderful. Another issue was the restaurant tends to have a lot of things sold out but Our waitress apologized so often and was so willing to accommodate/checked us regularly I happily chose other thing off the menu. It's a shame I wasn't in a drinking mood but the money I would have spent I gave as a tip because she really earned it. Thank you briana!
