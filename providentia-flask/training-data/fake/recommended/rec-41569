this just might be the happiest place on havemeyer. it oozes adorable french feelings and lavender field nostalgia all over your breakfast. while clearly the crepes are the talk of the town, they're also oozing with gluten (including the their buckwheat). so as an alternative there's the omelet, of which i tried the classic ham and cheese. the texture is perfect and doesn't wear you down like the greasy undercooked versions you find at the college caf. looking beyond the solids, the coffee is outstanding. these frenchys certainly know what they're doing.
