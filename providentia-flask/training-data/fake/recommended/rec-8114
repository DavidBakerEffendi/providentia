I had to write about this place once more because I went again today.  Last time i had a sweet crepe, this time I had a savory crepe.  Grilled chicken w/ ranch. delish.  this place has become a favorite of mines now, and if i ever attended temple and lived in the peabody hall, i would go there everyday. I like the savory crepes much more than the sweet crepes even though I only had 1 from both types.  They're just more.. flavorful :)
