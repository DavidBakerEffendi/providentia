The ramen here was so yummy. It was exactly what I needed for lunch to kill my hangover. I got the miso and it made me so so happy! The noodles were nice and chewy, the broth was rich and flavorful, the egg was a nice touch. I just wish the pork was a little more tender, though the flavor was great. The chef/owner (? i think) came out to ask my opinion about my ramen and seemed like such a nice guy. I'll definitely be back.
