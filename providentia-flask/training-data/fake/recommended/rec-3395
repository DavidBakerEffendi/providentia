This IS my favorite restaurant I've ever been to. I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but I'm really serious. We've been to a lot of places and I think that Korean cuisine is my absolute favorite now. Shhhh.. Don't tell my mom. Now, this is next level Korean so you may need to save up unless you've got it like that. I love how the flavor combinations of everything is so well thought out. From the amuse bouche shot of mushroom soup to the macarons, the flavor profile of everything was stellar. The octopus appetizer is not to be missed in my opinion. We get it every time. There is usually some kind of rice dish with pork jowl that is a treat. The mushrooms are amazing even though I'm not a huge mushroom fan. The other stand out on the menu, that is a must, is the lobster. We were disappointed that it wasn't the Thai scented lobster that we have had before and loved. The menu changes with the seasons and the lobster on the menu was different but equally amazing. You had me at raspberry coulis. The perfect special occasion restaurant or just regular night if you live around the corner and work on Wall Street or some other Internet startup.
