Was here on work travel. You wouldn't believe how nice it was based on the outside appearance. And by the way, it's located inside a Hampton inn. That being said, the restaurant ambience is incredible. Very spacious and comfortable. Staff is friendly and the patio is no joke one of the best I've seen. Fountains and garden set up, it's really nice. Now to food, I came by during happy hour (half off bar menu and drinks), good deal. I had the jalape√±o peppers and asparagus wrapped with prosciutto, ended it with the chicken parm. It was a 6 out of 10 across the board. I will be back and give them another shot. Cool restaurant.
