This place is a sh*thole.  Half the games don't work.  It's unsanitary.  They charged me $1.69 to give my kid a glass of water. Is that even legal?  This place is disgusting. I'm so sorry that I brought my kid here instead of the better, independent pizza, games and prize restaurant options in the area.  I'm so turned off by this place that I won't be returning any location of this franchise.
