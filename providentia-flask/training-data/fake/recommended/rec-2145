When in fishtown, do as the fishtonians do.  And that means go to johnny Brenda's.  With a rotating beer list, extensive selection on tap and above average menu selections for a tavern (e.g. grilled octopus, mussels..), this is a solid neighborhood go to place.  Funny that it's only a few steps away from Frankford Hall but with a completely different clientele.  We missed out on the live band but the crowd outside is a lively scene on Saturday nights and kept us entertained.  "Authentic Fishtown" claimed a local.
