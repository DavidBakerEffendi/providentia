"Sour cream pancakes, will you marry me," I thought. Then I tried the biscuit with its layers of buttered up dough and instantly thought..."hey, we could make this work between the three of us, right?" Loved the breakfast here! It was a bit crowded, the day after New Years - wouldn't expect it any other way. I had the eggs, bacon and grits. Their grits were perfect! I would have given two more stars but service was slow and inconsistent, when I got my eggs and bacon, I literally had a strip and a half of bacon. That alone could have been cause for two stars as I love me some bacon...if you can't already tell. Had a bite of my friend's sour cream pancakes and they gained half a star for that and another half for their biscuits. Totally willing to go back and readjust my star-power as I also wanted to try the pies/desserts, but had no time.
