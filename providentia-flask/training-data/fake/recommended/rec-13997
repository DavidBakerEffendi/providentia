Waited in line for about 1/2 an hour.  SO worth it.  There was no menu, so we had no idea what to order.  We just copied everyone else in line who seemed to know what they were doing.  Mixed Grill it is.  DO squirt on loads of white sauce.  We went back to saturate our food with it again.  Guaranteed you will overeat.  You may or may not feel guilty afterwards.
