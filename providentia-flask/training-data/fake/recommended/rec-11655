The burgers are tasty and flavorful but I'm leaving a review about the brunch menu they have on weekends (!! They have one! Who knew.) it's extremely mediocre -- the small portions of umami burger but without the heartiness of the actual burger. I got the truffle poached eggs, which sound great in theory but is underwhelming in reality. The cheese tastes overprocessed, the tater tot is a bit too salty, and the sausage links are just... Regular sausage links, nothing special. Maybe the other options are better, but skip the truffle poached eggs.
