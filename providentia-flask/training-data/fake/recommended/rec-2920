I'm giving Aldine 5 stars for the awesome service!  I loved my drink - I had the rye cocktail. It was perfect and exactly the kind of drink I wanted.  As for food- I'm a vegan, I know, I know.  But the menu is very accommodating!  We had a few plates to share and the servers and the chef veganized item for us. The herbivore tasting menu looked very Veg friendly but very dairy heavy so we stayed away from it- but next time I would consider that because I feel like they would be open to substitutions.   Over all - loved my dining experience at Aldine
