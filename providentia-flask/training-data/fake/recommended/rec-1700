It's a place to go to say that you've been.  But other than that, I don't get the hype.  The service is quick and good, considering how busy the place is.  The pie crust itself is excellent, but the rest was nothing special.  We had the basic margherita  with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms.  The best I can say is that the fresh basil was nice.  In short, don't expect the pizza to blow you away.
