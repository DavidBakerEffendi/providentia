Not bad. But not transcendent or anything. Bread for the banh mi is too doughy---more like an Italian hero roll than the proper light and crispy baguette. Also fillings not quite as thick and flavorful as say Saigon Shack.  With the doughy bread and rather thin fillings the banh mi is just too bread heavy.  But for $6 the lunch special is reasonable calories to dollars.
