Great local neighborhood spot that really has helped elevate the area.  Good fish; nice ambiance; good service. Why not 5 stars?  Beware of the tzatziki which is good but a 100% garlic bomb.  Also, the greek salad is just cucumbers and tomatoes which I don't view as "salad".  The lemon potatoes are also tasty but oily as fk.  Other than those complaints, you'll dig this spot.
