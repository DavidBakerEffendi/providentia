4116 Ridge Ave. has had its share of reincarnations, and nothing ever seemed to work. That is, until Arthur Cavaliere showed up in 2011 and opened In Riva. There are three things that set In Riva apart from the previous occupants of this space: 1. With it's patio and bike racks, Â it's a no-brainer for anyone biking along Kelly Drive 2. A pup friendly garden with picnic tables, so you can bring your canine companion along when you dine 3. This place puts out some really fantastic food The menu changes fairly regularly, and while I realize this will throw some people off the fact remains that this is how a restaurant can continually deliver fresh and seasonally appropriate dishes. I'm currently obsessed with the Sea Bass Annerito-- a blackened spice crust, pickled red onions & a caper aioli.... seriously, I can't even write about this dish without getting hungry. If you've never been before, the Whipped Ricotta & the Mushroom and Zucchinni Pizza are a must. If you've been, and you haven't tried those two items yet, I really don't know why you're wasting time reading this review. Go, now. No seriously, go. P.S. Hang out with Dawn at the bar. She's the greatest.
