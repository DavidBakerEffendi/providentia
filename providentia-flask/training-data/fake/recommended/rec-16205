Fantastique!  Such a cute space with excellent service (even smiling)  and an interesting, varied menu.   I had the spinach ravioli, which was a surprisingly huge portion given the price and the French leanings of the place.  My friend had the assorted pates and loved them, as well as one of the dessert crepes, which he inhaled.   We both loved everything.   Totally worth the trip into Williamsburgh. The cappucino and french press coffee were also delicious.   Will be back.
