Plain old awesome spot. This Los Angeles themed taqueria has it all going for it, in my book. It's got a great ambiance and they play sweet music. How can you be anything but happy when the soundtrack to your dinner is Country Grammar by Nelly? Aside from that, just a great vibe. Attentive but super respectful and chill waitstaff each time I've been. But honesty, it's the food that matters, and Taqueria LES does not disappoint. For the location and the vibe, the value's unbeatable. 2 (delicious and filling) sopes at a sitdown spot for $6? Yes please. The guac is some of the best I've had, definitely on the creamier side, and it comes with unlimited chips. Anyone I've come here with has been pleased. My one critique would be the margarita. I found it to be a bit underwhelming--not weak but not quite as strong as I like, and not large.
