Went on a Friday night early 6:00 summer dinner with my 2 college aged kids.  We had 2 starters - the warm ricotta with toast and a crab Toast. We loved them both, especially the ricotta which was served with three pieces off the toast. Our server noticed we may want some more bread to polish of the ricotta and she brought us more slices.  My daughter loved the arugula salad with pears and hazelnuts and my son and I each enjoyed the wedge salad. The bacon on wedge was salty but the chopped beets added sweetness needed to balance.  For entrees we  had a burger, steak, and gnocchi.  The burger was well cooked on a toasted roll but came with lots of bitter lettuce greens. The strip steak was properly cooked but also covered in local greens. The gnocchi and shrimp were very good. We tried to share a side of asparagus & zucchini  fries- none of us loved them and they were not easy to eat - came in a fried lump like "fried food from the fair".  Overall, we enjoyed the meal and the location was easy to get to - parking on the street or $7 valet in front of the hotel which is similar in style to a W Hotel.  Will try it again. The kids really liked that all ingredients were local from CT and there a chalkboard identifying each local farm or supplier.
