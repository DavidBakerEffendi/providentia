BCD's back, alright!  Went with a friend for dinner on Monday, their first day back in business, after waiting anxiously for their long-delayed re-opening.  There was a 10-minute wait and the little buzzer/beeper things are doled out so you don't have to hover around the host desk.  The tofu soup is as good as ever, went with the mixed which had beef and seafood at the medium spiciness level, and we split a seafood pancake which was a wee bit greasy but still delicious.  The ban chan was solid, including their trademark little fried fish for each diner.  Nice decor, reasonable noise levels, and for their first day back online, the service was surprisingly good.  I look forward to going back while under the influence (i.e. drunk) which may warrant a bump upwards to five stars (the tofu soup tastes better while on the sauce and has magical restorative powers).
