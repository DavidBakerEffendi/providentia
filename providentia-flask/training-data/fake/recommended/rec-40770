I can't imagine what this place is like when it's crowded.   If you weren't looking for it, you would most certainly miss this little hidden gem.   We decided to go here for breakfast since it was listed as a place that was good for kids.   I'll admit, when I first walked in, I was a little skeptical, just due to the size of it.  When it's crowded, I'm sure no one would care if your kid was making a racket, but it was after the breakfast crowd and before the lunch crowd, so we got pretty lucky.     As many others have said, the place is tiny, and also very cramped.  You can maybe fit 30 people in here, and that may be over estimating.    The decor is hippish.  Modern retro.  Very inviting.   The staff are completely laid back, and friendly.  Very low key, which I loved.  Also?  They are very cool, and here's why:   They got wind of us wishing our two year old a happy birthday, and they brought his french toast out with candles, which I thought was very cool.   There's also a few toys and some books for kids to keep themselves occupied with as well, which was nice, because there really isn't anywhere for anyone to go.   Another thing I loved was that they make fresh juice for you, which was kind of the highlight of our trip.  Fresh green apple juice, and it was really good.   Food is also decent.  We all got the creme brulee dipped french toast.   The sour cream dip that it came with was awesome.   I wish I lived closer to this place.  It's a great place to become a regular and just hang out.   Oh and one thing that I didn't realize, which might be worth mentioning, is that they only accept cash.  I know it's listed in the additional info, but I didn't even think to check.  So if you're going to stop by, make sure you have some cash.
