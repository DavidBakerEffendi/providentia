Wow !  This restaurant was awesome. My hubbie and I have eaten here bunches of time and have never been disapointed with the sushi!!  I love to sit by the open windows in the summer!! I will post some pics too. The sushi we had this past sunday was FUN ominal!  Hehe-  we had taken a friend with us who is a califonia roll girl, (if ya know what i mean)  but she was willing to let my husband order. WE started with the Kumo salad. Very good and plenty to split. Then we had  a tuna roll with lobter and crunchies inside on a plate of the most delisiuos sauce.  We also had a yummy roll and - well a bunch of the "fancy" rolls.  Our freind loved it all ! Then one of the sushi chefs came to our table to check on us...  he said he would like to supprize up with a special dish.....  he came out with some kind of kobe beef tartar with scallions - and then noticed we hid not hve hot sokki-  and served us some !! I mean this was a wonderfull experience !   I am not impressed by habachi ( choo choo onion train- booooring) But the rolls here -  at 50% - very very good Three soups, one salad, the lobster roll, and four more rolls, the tartar platter and the sacci-  $98 !!
