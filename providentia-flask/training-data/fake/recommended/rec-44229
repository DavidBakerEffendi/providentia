First time I went there, I was meticulously piling the peanut shells (from the complimentary peanut bowl) in a small plate. The waitress came to get our order and just tossed the content of that plate on the floor. After that, I wasn't quite sure what to expect in terms of food. I was pleasantly surprised 'tho-everything was great (I usually have the mozzarella/tomato combo with their amazing steak fries). The desserts are also very good. If you ignore the floor full of peanut shells, the place is very clean. After going there a few times, I really am a fan-food, service and prices are great. 4 starts because it gets reeeeeally cold inside during the winter.
