This is by far my favorite spot to grab a glass of vino in NY. Cozy, cute, and LOTS of character. The wine list is extensive. Offerings by the glass are a plenty which is nice for those who would rather not commit to a bottle. The menu is also nice with a variety of different options. I heard their pizza is very good although I did not try it myself. Great music always playing and the crowd is always having a good time. I adore Sofia's and will return over and over!
