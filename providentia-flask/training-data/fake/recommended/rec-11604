I went here last Friday for an early dinner with two friends (we needed to be somewhere by 6pm).  I made a reservation which was not a problem at that early hour, but they still called that morning to confirm, which I thought was good service on their part.  We all ordered a variation of the same meal, the "entree with two sides" deal for $21.  Two of us had the salmon and one had the chicken.  Everyone was very pleased with the food which arrived quickly and was delicious.  The place is cozy so I imagine it might be a bit more cramped when packed with people, but for us the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great.
