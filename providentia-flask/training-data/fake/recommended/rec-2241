Memorial Day Monday. I'm in Coney Island and hubby is craving BBQ. Yelp leads me to this place. The line was sick and we actually waited over 45 minutes. Our hunger totally got the best of us, so we ordered the brisket, spare ribs, potato salad, mac & cheese and cornbread.  Overall I wasn't super impressed. I was waiting for this amazing flavor explosion and I didn't get it. The brisket was soft but I added sauce for some more flavor. The spare rib was okay. The potato salad had way too much vinegar in it and it was too smooth (I like to have chunks of potato in mine). The mac & cheese was nothing spectacular, it has some hot pepper which was a nice addition, but my mom's mac is wayyy better. The best part of the meal was the cornbread. Super buttery, sweet and cakey but not too sweet. It was a huge slice and I wanted more. Overall the meal was kind of a let down since we did wait over 45 mins, which for us is unheard of.  The beer was good though, I had a pale ale and hubby was excited because they had ole smokey moonshine. I might come back here on a slow night to try the chicken or the brisket sandwich.
