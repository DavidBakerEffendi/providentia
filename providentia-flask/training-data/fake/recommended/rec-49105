Weekday dinners, party of 2, walk-ins, 7:30 or 8pm, no wait Wheelchair Accessible: Yes I love Bistango! Been here a couple of times and always left feeling full and happy. I've tried: Cavatelli -- great if you like spicy food! or you can ask them to add less cherry peppers if you can't handle it, SO GOOD!. I love spicy food and I've never had spicy pasta, so I enjoyed this dish and thought it was entertaining and eye-opening. It felt like 1:1 portion for pasta : sausage -- I love it! Tortellini - I usually don't order things without meat, but I go back to Bistango just for this dish. It has a very light sauce but enough to compliment the natural sweetness of the butternut squash and sweet potato. Their tortellini is also very chewy and delicious. Fusilli - pretty ordinary dish, great if you just want some comfort food. Pasta itself is great, sauce is alright, and you can't go wrong with chicken, broccoli, and sun dried tomatoes Ozra - great if you like seafood! Generous amount of lobster and shrimp :D 1:1 portion with pasta. I'm not a fan of pearl-shaped pasta, so that was the only thing (I don't know if I can ask for substitute). Love love love. Great little gem around the neighborhood. No stairs, but a slightly steep incline ramp from sidewalk to restaurant. Aisles are decent size, pretty sure they can accommodate if you made reservation to get to your seat. Noise level was alright -- generally busy but not crowded, good for family, friends, group dinners, etc.
