I was greatly disappointed the other night.  Green curry should be less salty.. For twenty dollars a plate, please give me more than one puny slice of overcooked duck. I sent it back, much to my waiter's horror..  I told him at that point that I had reviewed the restaurant several months prior for a local newspaper and that the food at that time was pretty darned good... But the food on Wednesday was  grim indeed. Sorry to say, but if you charge the BIG $, you must be held to task over the expensive items...namely, "where's the duck!"
