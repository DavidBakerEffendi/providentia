I don't feel like writing a crazy long review so I'll keep it straight and to the point. I had a dream about the chicken burrito I had there last night. I wish I was still asleep because it was so perfect- filling but not in that gross, instant stomach-ache way, and it made me wish I could eat the rest. I should have just taken it home to treat my drunken appetite, but I was clearly not thinking ahead. The jalapeno mac and cheese we ordered was also really good. I love coming to ECR.
