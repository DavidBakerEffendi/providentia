Avoid the pizza. It's a greek bis-quick based, oily crust that will just disappoint you. Any of the greek offerings, hot subs and anything deep fried are yummy. Milkshakes are HUGE and made with Hershey's ice cream. I always get one. Their gyro is the most authentic I've had since living near Philadelphia. They have handmade pita, and gyro meat on actual spits - nothing frozen and fried on a griddle here! Fries and onion rings never disappoint. I can't speak to the dinner or late night crowd, I've stopped in here only for lunches during work. Salads are OK, but sometimes the lettuce is really watery. Chicken tender appetizer is a lunch in and of itself. The regular and long time waitresses are great, but some of the newer ones (students perhaps?) are clueless and can/do mess up orders. Prices are fair considering the portion sizes.
