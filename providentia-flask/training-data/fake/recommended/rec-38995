Good food, sometimes a bit stroller city with groups of couples meeting with their babies. Landmarc egg sandwhich is very good, but avoid the sausage, its like an english Richmond sausage, not an american breakfast sausage. Â The poached salmon sandwhich is excellent. The eggs benedict is some of the best in lower manhattan - real hame and no tobasco in the hollandaise!
