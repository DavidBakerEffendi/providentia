I just got back from this restaurant and it is the epitome of mediocre. Please let us not continue to support restaurants like this one who simple take your money and offer nothing in return. I ordered their omelette and it was heavy, the cheese they chose added nothing to its flavor, the other veggies they used just had no life left in it. It was a struggle omelette point blank. I hate restaurants who do not seem to even enjoy cooking, instead they are simply trying to get meals out, just no standard. Once again if u are in te area just go to peaches. The service was horrible, I felt rushed the entire time, even though the restaurant wasn't full and there were no potential customers waiting. She repeatedly forgot to bring certain items over to the customers, I heard other people reminding her to bring their items over. In short, stay home and make ur own damn food, you would get better and fresher ingredients. The mimosa lure ain't worth it. Save your money and don't support mediocre places like this, help make New York better.
