So I was in New Haven for a Yale reunion. Not a Yalie myself, but HB (Hot Boyfriend) claims Mother Yale as his own. He was all, "Oh my God, we HAVE to go to Bar. They have this watermelon beer, and these pretty copper tins, and this awesome mashed potato pizza..." And then I stopped him. I'm sorry, but mashed potato pizza? Why would someone ruin a perfectly good pizza by putting MASHED POTATOES on it? That is weird and we are not ordering that. So we arrive, another Yalie and his girlfriend in tow. The place is surprisingly not packed for a reunion weekend, but busy enough that we had plenty of time for the Yale Boys to convince me that ordering the mashed potato pizza (add bacon) was a good idea. I acquiesced, as long as we got a pepperoni as a backup. Fine. So we get our house flight of beers: a pale ale, a stout, an amber, a toasted blonde, and the famous watermelon ale. All were delicious, but that watermelon was astonishing. I want to make watermelon ale myself. Right now. Then the pizza comes. We ordered a small and a medium, and I made her confirm three times that we received a small and a medium.... because this was the biggest "medium" I'd ever seen. Indeed, folks, a medium is fine. I happily dug into my pepperoni... thin crust, spicy sauce, good cheese. Nice and floppy. But then the time came to try the mashed potato pizza. I was pretty freaked, but feeling brave, and I wanted to fit in among all this Ivy, so I took a bite. Holy deliciousness, Batman! Mashed potatoes, garlic, bacon, olive oil, and mozzarella should ALWAYS be together on pizza! It's a match made in heaven! The potato was creamy, but crisp on the top. Not mushy like I thought, but a really nice consistency. The bacon is a must-add, and the garlic really brings it all together. Order this with a watermelon ale.
