Some of the finest and most authentic Chinese food that I have had anywhere including Philadelphia and New York waitresses are very helpful as long as you can speak Chinese ,if  not they have a manager  that speaks perfect English who is pleasant and very knowlegeable.The food Is skillfully prepared with moderate use of garlic and other strong seasonings so each dish is distinct and well balanced.Their dumplings both soup ,steamed and panfriedare outstanding as is almost every  dish .Standouts are thesoups especially the Shanghai wonton soup ,scallion pancakes and any noodle dish. It's a husband and wife team that run the restaurant the husband works in the kitchen supervising the hot preparation and the wife is in the front Supervising the preparations of all  noodles and dumplings which you can see behind the glass wall. I would strongly suggest you experiencing the pleasure of real Chinese food
