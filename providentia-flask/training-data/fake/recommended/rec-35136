Adorable place with lots of light. The espresso is solid, but the fresh biscuits were the winner. They were fluffy but not crumbly and buttery in all the right ways. It's a grand place to do work (fast wifi) without being bothered by waiters trying to flip your table. The staff is friendly and casual, just as they should be.
