meh burger ok nothing great, big yes great and full of flavor not so much, I had the beef burger with bbq sauce, bacon, grilled onions and cheddar cheese and it was just ok, with out the toppings it would have been rather unremarkable. the place is very small and hipster paint and little sketch covered walls only slightly mask the run down feel. def felt out of place not wearing skinny jeans. I would say its more of a take out place w/ the option to eat in, esp since they don't even have any fountain drinks, just bottles and cans. prob wont go back, would rather go to the place down the street, better food and full bar!
