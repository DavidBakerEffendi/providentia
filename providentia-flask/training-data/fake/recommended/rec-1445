The food is top notch. There is no better grilled baby octopus anywhere in the city. The prices are reasonable. However, long waits aside (unavoidable at dinner time), the service is hit or miss. I have had great service and nightmare (waiter flirting with my date, winking, blowing kisses, etc.) service. For the record, I'd like to have laid him out, but the whole getting arrested for assault in a restaurant seemed a bad idea. However, even with that experience, I don't think I could stay away. (If I see that waiter again though, it'll be a bad day all around.)
