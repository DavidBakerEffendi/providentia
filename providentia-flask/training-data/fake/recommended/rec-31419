First time ever going to this establishment...overall it looks dirty...that's first impression. My friend wanted to go to the salsa night which is in the far back area. The woman collecting the $5 entrance fee, who was sitting so close to the bar she could have been serving drinks, insisted I was too close to her and even went as far as having a metal pole placed directly behind me to prevent me from moving! No class, no etiquette and not worth the dirty looking facility! I was not impressed at all...thumbs down!
