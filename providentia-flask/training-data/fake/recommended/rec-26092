Nothing is hip about paying top dollar food that can be made in a dorm room on a George Forman Grill. Their kitchen stove and sink is no bigger than a street Halal cart, seriously! I heard so much about this place and was looking forward to trying it out. I know Brazilian food very well, and I can say this spot is mediocre at best. I did have an so-so grilled sandwich (Bauru) that did not remind me of the town or the ones my father-in-law makes. The Caipirinha's were not impressive, but the wait staff attitudes were. Â I had about 6 people; we left a nice tip but were never thanked or told to come back again. At least at Miss Favela you will get food as good as a local spot in Queens plus live music on Saturday.
