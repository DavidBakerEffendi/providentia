We came here for Valentine's Day and it was pretty good, but not amazing. The service was quite nice, as well as the ambience - it's upscale and comfortable without being frou frou.  I remember liking my meal at the time, but it was far from memorable (as I literally can't remember what I had a couple months later).  I would definitely try this place again to give it another shot.  The overall quality was pretty good and I remember loving the bread and appetizers, but I felt that the dinner entree price was about $3-5 too high for the portion size and for being in Queens.  My husband left hungry and I was barely full.
