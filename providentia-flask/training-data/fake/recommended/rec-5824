met my friend here for brunch because she lives @ 23 and pine and i was at my (now ex-ofcourse) bf's house in grad hosp. It was packed and it was a freezing morning in december. we wanted a table but settled quickly at the bar. I remember there being a woman and a guy bartending. We, unfortunately, had the lady. She was errr a bit bitchy. But she (or maybe it was the guy?) made a mean bloody mary. my brunch staple. nothing makes me feel better on a hungover sunday (maybe it was sat? you Â get the idea...GAWD) morning...We both had two. Perfectly spicy and delicious. I had the eggs benedict. WOLFED IT! amazing. Definitely will go back for dinner. Can't wait to check out Kraftwork, the sister joint opening in FishTown...
