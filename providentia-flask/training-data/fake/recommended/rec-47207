The food is good and the Mac and Cheese is truely the best I have ever had in Manhattan, however, the portions are very small and extremely over priced.   The same story applies for the drinks.  They sound great on the menu but when they arrived i was very under impressed by the size and by their strength. The atmosphere is one in which yuppies disguised as hippies civilly dine on overpriced cheese dishes in a cave like setting but oddly enough it did not put me off from the place.   I would recommend to check out this place during happy hour which is mon to fri 5 - 7 pm.
