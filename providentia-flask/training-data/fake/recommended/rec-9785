My dinner (and abundant leftovers) were so good, I took work colleagues back two days later for lunch. The ceviche was fabulous. My dinner companion ordered a dinner that realistically served four. Our waitress warned us! The chicken and all the sides were delectable. My work colleagues loved their lunches. Ate upstairs and downstairs - both have great ambiance. I'm very sensitive to noise otherwise would have given 5 stars.
