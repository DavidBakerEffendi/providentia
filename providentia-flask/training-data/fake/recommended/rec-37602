I knew that we were in for a treat when they brought the freebies before we ordered:  peanuts and pickles.  I.e., what REAL Chinese restaurants serve.  Then there was the fact that we were the only Caucasian customers.  And then there was the fact that upon opening the menu, I saw little in the way of Americanized General's Toes crap. I have eaten my way through Chinatowns in San Francisco, New York, D.C. and elsewhere.  This place is the best Sichuan resto that I have been to.  We ordered a bunch of apps, a soup and an entree.  Everything that we had was very good or outstanding.  And yes, they use real Sichuan peppercorns, not just additional chilies for the heat. Our food was: Cold Apps Spicy Veg Salad  (Off the hook) Spicy Seaweed Salad  (Very good) Beef and Tripe in Hot Chili Sauce (To die for, beef stomach only, NO intestine) Spicy Rabbit  (excellent, meat is on-the-bone, eat with care) Soup for Two Tofu and Veg (well done, light broth doesn't overpower the tofu and greens) Entree Pork with Chinese Long Hot Peppers  (stupid yummy, da bomb) Even the freebie Sichuan pickles they serve are amazing.  We plowed through three dishes of them!  Service was good.  We took a lot home.  That stuff didn't see the light of the next day. Yum, yum, yum and yum.
