Went to dinner with the family, Â was a little weary about a 5 star review place but it really is great. The atmosphere is prime. After you see how trendy it looks one can only wonder if the food is going to be bad. But no. It was phenomenal. Everything was delicious and highly recommend getting some ice cream dessert.
