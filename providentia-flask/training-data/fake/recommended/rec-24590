I was walking down the street when I noticed a girl wearing a gorgeous floral crown and traditional dress, and knew I had to walk in to this charming bar and restaurant. I was greeted by one of the most charming, personable and animated bartenders I've ever met. Alex is a true artist. An amazing mixologist. Having been a bartender and inventing several of my own concoctions, I was truly floored. His drinks are out-of-this-world, he combines flavors and balances perfectly. I ordered the "Vladimir Putin," an infusion of peach tea, peach schnapps and whiskey and I literally was so happy. It was sooo good. It's so hard to do whiskey well, but Alex is a true master. I also ordered the "Mojito" and having reviewed several bars and restaurants for New York and Boston publications, I can honestly say, it is the best mojito I've ever had. Alex infuses green grapes and lime and mint for a truly incredible cocktail. What an experience. The hardest part was choosing a cocktail because everything on the menu is amazing. Check out the "Ukrainian Beauty" and try the homemade vodka infusions. As for the food, the potato crepes and caviar were sooo good paired with sausage and horseradish. I love this place. It's such an amazing find!
