Terrible Terrible Terrible. This is the first time yelp reviews let me down. I went here last night expecting to finally get some decent tacos in the city and boy did I get my hopes up for nothing. I went with my boyfriend and we ordered the pork, squid, and skirt steak tacos - the skirt steak was so dry, the squid was disgusting, the only decent one was the pork and that's because the apples made it moist. Honestly I've had better Mexican food at an airport. The best part of the meal was the guacamole and I've had way better. Save yourself the wait and go someplace else.
