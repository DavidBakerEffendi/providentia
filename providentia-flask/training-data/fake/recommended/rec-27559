MY FAVORITE PLACE IN NY!! This by far is the best place in New York City. And I love how off beat its location is.  Tucked away in a Chinatown/east village Nook. The Staff have become family to me as my friends and I are usually there every Sunday.  Which bring me to my nest point.. I don't know how but their food is the best hang over cure.  The Sopa Azteca is Heaven.  This place is so good I come all the way from the Upper east side to enjoy this every sunday!
