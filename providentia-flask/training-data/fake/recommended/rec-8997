Late night food at its finest. Walked in at around 2:30ish...Was a little crowded... but thats only cause of how awesome it was. Was with two others and we got glasses of wine at the bar and sat at the window seat for about 15 minutes until a table freed up. Intimate, cozy setting. Dark with candles. Crusty bread served to you. DIVERSE MENU. Really, I mean it. I couldn't believe the variety on the menu. There truly was something for everyone. I mean I saw Tofu Ravioli! The three of us only got apps, but they were damn good. Oysters, the bone marrow and oxtail marmalade (comes with grilled challah bread!!!!) and matzoh ball soup! Generous portions, and decent prices for the city. Especially for the quality of food this place is serving. I CAN NOT wait to eat there again! I saw perogies Â and a foie gras terrine that i am dying to try. oh and the bathroom was immaculate. believe me, that matters for ladies.
