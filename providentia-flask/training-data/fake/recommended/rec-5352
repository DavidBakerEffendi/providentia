Food is excellent and always comes out quick. This place is always consistent from the drinks to the food. Great for outdoor seating on the rooftop. Place gets packed and they don't take reservations so don't come too hungry! Everyone here is really nice and professional minus a few of the hostesses. Snobby girls who just stare at everyone and laugh and giggle to themselves.
