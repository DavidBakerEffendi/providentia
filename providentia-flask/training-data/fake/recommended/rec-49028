First off this "cafe" just opened. They charge $2.75 for a small ice cream when in reality its $2.75 for a scoop. The scoop is super super small. The size of a scoop is about the size of two quarters side to side. The ice cream is nothing special, the containers are almost all empty. How can a newly opened cafe/ice cream shop look this horrible when opened. The shakes are priced at $4.00 and thank you but no thank you, I didn't want to go for that because it would of turned out even worse than the small ice cream. Don't go here just for the convenience, I rather get ice cream from the super market. Horrid place and will probably not last more than another month or two.
