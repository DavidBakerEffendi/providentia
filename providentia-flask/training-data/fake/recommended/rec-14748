Solid Pho place. Probably the best in the area. I opted for the house pho and the food came out quickly and was reasonably priced. It is much better than the korean Pho32 chains I have been to in Pal Park area. The broth was great, the noodles weren't soggy, and they weren't too stingy with the beef. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 star is because the beef quality isn't the best compared to other pho restaurants I have been to. Otherwise, Binh Duong will most likely be my go to pho place from now on.
