anything less than 5 stars for this place would be absurd. the food is wonderful. i have tried the jerk chicken, jerk shrimp, curry and bbq chicken and mac and cheese and they have all been delicious. their BBQ chicken and mac & cheese, in my mind, are the top of the mountain. the staff is great . . . the place is run by two super-nice, sassy ladies - and everyone else that I have encountered there has been friendly, engaging, and amusing. the only small con is that they tend to run out of certain dishes, though I think this is more due to the seemingly lengthy preparation than not having enough on hand. the tiny dining room is up steep narrow set of stairs (almost a ladder) - i love dining up there but it isn't for everybody . . . but if you don't like it you are probably lame anyway. all in all, i love this place, i crave it almost daily, and I love introducing people to it.
