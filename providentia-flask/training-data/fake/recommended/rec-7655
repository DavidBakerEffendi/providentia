This place is not good at all. Obviously I could chosen much more emotionally descriptive adjectives, but let's stay classy! First, the food is only OK. Definitely not terrible-tasting, but it just wasn't good. All their soups were incredibly thick with cornstarch, the raw food left on the grill bar, even though placed on ice, just stunk something awful. Walking to the restrooms, I passed some foul odors that resembled a mixture of raw and old foods. Place is dingy, barely clean. Some of the English translations of the food gave me a good laugh though.
