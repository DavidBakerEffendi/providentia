Every time friends visit, I make sure to take them to Memphis. =) Draft beer never disappoints and the menu is DELICIOUS. I love love love the port richmond platter Â (as an Ukrainian the perogies are incredible ;p). My favorite bar and restaurant in Philly =) I am so glad that you are away from the old city bs and the tourist hell.
