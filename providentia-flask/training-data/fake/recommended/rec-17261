Best Italian pulled pork I've ever eaten. This is the only sandwich I need to eat when I come to philly. There other sandwiches are also fabulous but the pork is by far the best. You can get with or without cheese and greens ( broccoli rabe or spinach). Whatever you get will be amazing. They have seats at the counter or in the center of the market. Best $9 you'll ever spend.
