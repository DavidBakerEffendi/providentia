Four bucks doesn't usually go a long way, but here you'll get two spicy cups of chai and a pair of samosas for that much. Makes an especially splendid afternoon snack when eaten on a nearby stoop with someone you love. A couple evenings ago I got a little lesson: Dil-E means "heart of" so translated this gem is the Heart of Punjab Deli.
