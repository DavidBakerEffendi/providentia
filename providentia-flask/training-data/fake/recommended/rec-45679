Food was ehh ...nothing to rave over Service was decent in time My sis chicken was undercooked.... Collard greens were decent... Potato were ok. They had a live band so that was cool but a lil loud I would never come back here again. If others were to like it congratulations. But between the undercooked and overcooked food, and the wine choices I would not come back. Sorry.
