After years of walking by the most disgusting McDonalds on earth, I was SO excited to see the amazing transition of fast food sludge to one of the coolest restaurants the 802 has seen in a long time. Food Must Haves: VT Cheese plate House Mac 'N Cheese Steamed Price Edward Island Mussels Misty Knoll Burger Drink Must Haves: Allagash White Allagash Vrienden Original Sin Cider This place is the definition of a farm-to-table gastropub. They are 100% dedicated to showcasing and supporting the amazing local farms and food producers. It's a pricy compared to most other places you'll find along Church Street, but it's definitely worth a try!
