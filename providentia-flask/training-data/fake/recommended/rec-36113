I can't say I wasn't warned.  Brother said I probably wouldn't like it more than the other places I frequent here in LA.  And I knew better.  I've had some damn good ramen before.  Ippudo definitely came well-hyped and well-recommended by some.   I have to say, I was disappointed.  Sure the decor was beautiful and trendy.  And yes, it was impressive that the non-Asian employees were throwing out Japanese phrases here and there.  But the star attraction, the noodles...just didn't live up to the hype. We were there at 4pm... waited for 15 minutes to get a couple seats.  You definitely still get the "churn and burn" feeling when they rush you to take your order and give you a weird look when you're not ready.  Our server couldn't crack a smile to save her life. What we enjoyed the most were the pork buns.  They're too rich to have more than 2 a person but they were definitely a pleasant surprise given that we were there for the ramen. I'm glad I can cross this off my list now.
