I just moved into the neighborhood and was really excited to find this little cafe just walking distance.  We are pescatarian but also limit our dairy intake, and this place has it all!  We ordered take out and the food was ready to go in 20 min like promised.  We both had the United Kingdom - Sole sandwich -- it was delicious! It comes with greens, tomatoes, avocado (which I love), a really yummy dressing on a toasted bun.  It was a large sandwich, I couldn't finish it!  I get to save some for later :)  I also got the green lentil soup, which was excellent, and my husband got the NE clam chowder, which he really liked as well.  Yes, prices are higher than other cafes, but thats because its really not just another cafe.  Its super healthy food for really reasonable prices.  Totally worth every penny.  I can't wait to try more off the menu!
