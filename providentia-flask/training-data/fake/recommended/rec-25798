My girlfriend bragged so much about this place but what a waste of time and money and on top of that the food was not all that good. Service was horrendous, the server never came to greet us, it took 10 minutes before any one approached us and when some one did it was the bussboy who took our drink order. That was the only time, we got a drink, our entrees came and no drink order was taken. We went through the whole meal with out a drink on our table. The only time someone came over, bussboy again, was when our meal was over. When I confronted the bussboy, his answers as to why we didn't have a drink is that he takes an order when the guest first sits. I guess as a guest you are only allowed one drink. The food was so so, I don't know why everyone brags about their food. Fish was dry and pork was bland. No one ever came over to apologize or even made an attempt to find out what was wrong. All I can say is that, I will never be back at this place.
