I love KC Prime. Their lunch menu is very reasonablly priced for takeout. You can find some very nice wraps and burgers on there. I know this is a steakhouse, but my favorite for dinner is actually their burger. Cooked perfectly using a mix of fresh ingredients that combine so well together. The bacon and cheese on it are so tasty. Get one of their nice draft beers, a burger, and get out of there for under $20. Looking forward to trying their brunch.
