My husband and I enjoyed our first visit here very much. We went with a living social deal and the next time we were looking for a local place to go, we came back. While they do not sell alcohol you can bring your own, which is a big plus for me. I would rather do that and keep my bill down. It is in a bit of a senior area, but younger people and families can be found there as well. They also have fresh homemade pasta :)
