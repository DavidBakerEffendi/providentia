So I heard about this place from a friend. I was skeptical, being very familiar with good southern food, and having been disappointed with the lack of it since moving to NYC. Nevertheless, I gave it a try. Walking in, I was quite surprised by the warmth and welcoming of the quaint, almost unnoticeable place. There's no sign on the door, but the decorum inside spoke volumes about the hothouse identity in an organic, non-pretentious way: it was clean and sleek, but cozy. I felt at home. My friend and I saddled up to the bar. It was happy hour ($5 cocktails, local beer 2 for $5) Â I ordered the Sister Rosetta and the Hot (not extra hot) chicken with the collards. My friend (vegetarian) ordered the fried green tomatoes and Mac and cheese. A-MAZ-ING!!!!!!!! The chicken was crispy with a wonderfully, spicy flavored breading. The meat was juicy, hot and flavorful in its own right. Obviously marinated. It was literally the best fried chicken I've ever had. Not just in NYC. We also orders the bourbon cake for dessert. Just as flawless and yummy. To add, the staff was crazy nice and friendly, offering suggestions and hoping to help in any way possible. I will most certainly be back. Is it wrong that I'm kind of glad that it doesn't have a sign outside? I wanna keep it all to myself. Lol...
