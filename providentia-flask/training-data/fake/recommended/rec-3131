This is a spot I frequent in LES, and I typically bring friends out here. Plus: The quality of meat they use for the meatballs is really good. The service is really attentive, and the atmosphere is really cute. There's also an option to sit outside if it's a nice day. I usually get the classic meat with the parmesan cream, which are to die for. The good thing about this place is that it is really affordable and cheap. Delta: So after coming here several times, I stopped ordering the sandwiches because they have a tendency to overtoast the bread. I started ordering naked balls and just getting a side of mashed potatoes to eat with it. The mashed potatoes are a little bit on the watery, bland side though. Hm. So I'm actually quite unsure what I'll order next time since this is a common meeting spot for some of my friends. The wait time actually kind of really kills the place for me. The fact that this place is small doesn't help either. I know I'm going to end up coming back with my friends and hopefully I'll have a better report.
