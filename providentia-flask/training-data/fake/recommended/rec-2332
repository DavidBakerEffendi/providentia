I'm basically writing the same review for Pat's as I am for Geno's because they're basically the same restaurant.  Only the photos are different.  What's more, I was fairly unimpressed with either place. I was introduced to Pat's and Geno's in Rick Sebak's 2002 PBS documentary, Sandwiches That You Will Like.  Well, the cheesesteak at these two places I can't really say I liked. I had a "provolone wit" (i.e., cheesesteak sandwich with provolone cheese and grilled onions).  The bread was stale and the cheese not melted.  Frankly, I've had better cheesesteaks at the mall in Albuquerque (seriously!).  For a better cheesesteak in the Philly area, try Dalessandro's.  Or skip the cheesesteak and get a fantastic hoagie at Primo's!!! .... Maybe I should've had it with whiz. Of all the Rick Sebak documented sandwiches, Pat's and Geno's have been the only disappointments as of yet.  Still, these are both institutions in their own right, so I'm glad I came --- only because now I can say I've been here. Oh, and be prepared for ridiculously long lines and a long walk to find parking.  There is no indoor seating.  Tables outside only (if you can find a free table).  Also (and I don't mean this as a criticism) if you're not from the area, you may perceive employees' manner as rude.  It really isn't.  It's just part of the South Philly 'tude.  Just roll wit it.
