The best indian fast food in town. They make the most amazing rolls/wraps. They recently added new rolls which taste amazing. Expanding on the set of amazing rolls they already had. It is a pretty quick eat, unless you hit them when they are really busy. but it is worth the wait. I have only had the vegetarian rolls, but my friends recommend the other rolls as well. Tastes best when hot.
