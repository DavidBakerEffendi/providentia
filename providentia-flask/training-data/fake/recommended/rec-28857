I came here for the first (and last) time last night for dessert with my boyfriend. The place is so small and crowded that we were practically on top of the people next to us. We ordered the fondue for two which came with two different chocolates and caramel (?), I think, because our waitress just threw it down on the table and walked away.  I didn't taste it.  They gave us strawberries, bananas, store-bought marshmallows, and extremely bland brownies and cookies.  The table was so small and rocky that there was barely enough space for everything.  We ate the fruit and marshmallows (about three of each was provided) and then the waitress just came and put down our check.  Never checked in to see if we needed anything, how it was, or if we wanted anything else.  Just put down the check.  Not only was the service terrible and the place too crowded and uncomfortable, the dessert wasn't even good (especially not for $25).  The receipt had tip amounts for each percentage (18, 20, 22) and we had to just laugh.  We had finished dinner earlier in the night at Misconduct Tavern around the corner and left a 25-30% tip because our waitress there was extremely nice and helpful.  At this place, we left around 11%, and even that felt like too much.  Everything about Max Brenner's was terrible and over-hyped.  I would not recommend Max Brenner's at all.
