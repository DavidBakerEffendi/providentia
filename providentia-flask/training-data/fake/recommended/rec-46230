I've been coming here for years, born and raised in Hanover Neck, Golden Touch diner was always a staple for great food hands down. They wouldn't of lasted as long as they did if they weren't pushing quality food at affordable prices. BUT WAIT FOR THE DISCLAIMER: This is not GOLDEN TOUCH ANYMORE!! This was actually picked up by my more favored diner in the area, Brookside down the road in Hanover. This was my 3rd time coming here for breakfast after church on Sunday morning. The early bird specials are great because they offer you juice & coffee with your #1 special of 2 eggs over easy, hash browns, bacon, and a side of toast for an all-inclusive price of $7.99. It's great because you get it all for under 8 bucks instead of buying everything a la carte which usually runs you up well over a 10 dollar bill. There's comfort in knowing that you can order a breakfast plate (before 11 am) that comes with so much as far as portion size and they don't nickel and dime you like IHOPs and other diners serving comparable fare. The food as a whole was great, eggs perfect, bacon crisp, and hash browns on the money, even the toast was buttered and on point. The service was also a high point as I have a 2 year old finicky at that, taken care of in a great manner with true professionalism. Â I think the only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they don't offer a lobster omelette at this diner!! But seriously, great place to eat a great meal with awesome down home service, they get it at this place. They know food like breakfast is not complicated and they do a great job at making you want to say those 3 most important words, "We'll be back!!"
