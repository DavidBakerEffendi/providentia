It's a tiny place with huge flavors.  We ordered scallops (daily special), lamb skewers,  Spanish tortilla, chorizo and some almond and olives. Everything was great as the fellow yelpers suggested. The Sangria was very delicious as well. I think I could drink that whole pitcher by myself if my friend would let me to drink her half :)
