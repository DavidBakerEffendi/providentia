I'm obsessed with Perilla.. I wish I could go more often. I've never been here for dinner, but I go for brunch.  It's totally like an upscale brunch.. it's so good.  The stuff is all very simple but Harold adds this special touch with his expertise on mixing different ingredients to make it something superb. One thing I've had that stands out is this chicken sandwich..but I really don't know what was in it.. or what it was called.. it was just really good and I crave it all the time and wait for it to come back onto the menu. Also, I had the best red velvet cake ever from here.
