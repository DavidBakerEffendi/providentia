A great selection of beers and cider on tap. The food was pretty good. Got the fries, tots and their special the strawberry jam and pate were excellent. The grilled cheese with bacon jam was buttery, crisp and melty. The sausage and biscuit was good bit had some pickled onions and green beans that complemented the dish but I am not a pickled fan in general. The portions were pretty good sized.
