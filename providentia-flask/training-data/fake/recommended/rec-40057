I seriously just signed up for yelp just to write a review for this place. Some of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. Everything was delicious. I don't think I will order another sandwich from anywhere in the Fairmount area again. Why bother?? I'm delightfully surprised at how good these sandwiches are. Soup was great too!! The only thing they forgot was napkins in the to-go bag, but I aint even mad at em!!!!!
