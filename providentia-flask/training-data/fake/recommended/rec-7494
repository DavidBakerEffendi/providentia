Went with a few friends and was able to do a tasting of about half the menu.  This place is very good and gives each dish the necessary attention required to get five stars. Ambience- great, everything is nice and new, we sat outside in the backyard.  Its spacious and youre not on top of each other. Food- delicious, and i got to taste many dishes.  I suggest ordering a side of coconut rice and jasmine rice and then mix it in with the main courses, like the Sisig.  I also had the quail and the chinese sausage salad (spicy!) and all were delicious.  But the lamb ribs stole the show- you basically make your own lamb tacos with yogurt and pickled beets.  Best dish of the night. Dessert- tried the banana and then the shaved ice, both recommended. Service- our server was friendly and very helpful.  They didnt rush us, in fact, they let us sit all night eating and drinking.   The chef even came out and said hello to us.  Well done P&K!!!
