Is it nuts to just write about the AMAZING HOSTESS and leave out the PHENOMENAL FOOD?  I loved this place and I have to say it's because the dark haired cherub like hostess...wish I knew her name.  We've been to this spots several times and I have to say there's nothing like feeling like your at home from the second you walk in the door by the hostess.  Let's just call her Angel.  Angel has a bright smile and the greatest memory EVER.  She remembers everything about her guests and that is a huge advantage in the restaurant business.  I hope Angel is there for a long time or until she's happy to move on to her next job where I'm sure she'll continue to shine.  Angel you are greatly appreciated. Okay, the food is incredible fresh and I can't decide if the Plato Don is supposed to be shared or for one person, but I'll put it like this...ORDER IT!  This dish is the size of a dinette table and full of rich flavors.  WARNING, the Cactus and Jalapeño salad is not for the novice mexican diner.  Only a professional mexican food consumer should attempt the delicious but SPICEY greens.  Last words, Margaritas on tap...DO IT!
