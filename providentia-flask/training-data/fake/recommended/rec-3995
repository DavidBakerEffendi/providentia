This is a great sounding brunch place... that isn't open on Sundays!!! Good luck finding that useful piece of information on the door when you arrive on a Sunday for brunch and the place is locked up like a bank. Â You'll have plenty of company on the sidewalk as everyone else walks up ready for brunch and then wonders why a great sounding brunch place is closed on Sundays. Next time I drive to New York for brunch on a day that isn't a Sunday I'll give Tom's another try - there are some great reviews here, but I'm still befuddled by it not being open on Sundays.
