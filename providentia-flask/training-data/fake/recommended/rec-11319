This is my favorite sushi place in Philadelphia. The special rolls are creative, and their spicy rolls are just that. . .when they say spicy, they mean it! These are rolls with a kick! They are also large and very reasonably priced. Spicy Tuna melts in your mouth. Hako is my all-time favorite: inside Spicy Tuna and Crunchy, on top Eel & Tobiko with Eel sauce. Mmmm! Another delicious creation is the Volcano: inside Crab Stick, Cucumber, Avocado and on top Spicy Tuna with Wasabi Tobiko & Crunchies on the side. The Dancing Vampire is another winner: inside Cucumber, Asparagus & Crunchy while on top is Tuna & Salmon in Chili sauce (Sweet & Spicy). I've taken out-of-towners here who have loved it. The bad part is that it's now become quite popular, is no longer BYOB, and is not very large. So the last 2 times we tried to drop in, we were met with an hour or more wait, forcing us to go elsewhere. And this is even during the week sometimes! So reservations are suggested.
