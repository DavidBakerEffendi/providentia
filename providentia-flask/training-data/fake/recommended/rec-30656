I eat brunch here a lot. The atmosphere and the food are both great. Even though there is usually a line, it is well worth the wait. In addition, Cookshop is environmentally friendly. They are BigGreenG approved in four categories. Cookshop uses sustainable foods and has a great recycling program as well.
