We arrived here on a Saturday night around midnight for some food. From where it's located and some reviews, I was expecting to see hoards of hipsters gettin their groove on but instead found a pretty tame, eclectic bar. There were 20-somethings in plaid and skinny jeans and 40-somethings in oversized Phillies gear and I liked the mix. As we walked to the back, we found a cozy nook to sit. We started with the beet salad and then the falafel sandwich & cheeseburger. I found the service to be super nice but slightly trying to rush us which is fine cuz it was late. I did not like that the wall menu gave no descriptions about what's in each dish. I don't want to ask what comes with what with everything. Anyway, the beet salad was ok. Bland mostly. The beets were big chunks and soggy, there were not enough greens to balance the sogginess and the greens tasted like they were just tossed in evoo. It was like eating colorful air. Definitely not worth 8 bones. The burger was quite delicious though. I adored their huge thick- cut pickles and their sweet chopped caramelized onion. Falafel was a crunchy good time. So with hits and misses, I'll def be back, esp for oysters!
