I really like the Hearth and I too been coming here for years. They have plenty of variety from burgers, rotisserie chicken home Made roast beef and turkey. This is a real family restaurant but the cheese burgers to me are really great the cheese is toasted onto the roll which to me makes it less greasy. The food here is charcoal grilled and they have been doing it long enough to get it right. Yea they changed owners a while back but the food and the cooks are the same so I still trust them for a really good inexpensive meal. You really can't go wrong at the Hearth.
