Went here for a quick tasting after reading reviews! I tried the cottage cheese cookie which I wish I bought more of (it was amazing! Flaky and crunchy but still moist! How can this be?!) I also got the cranberry (or apricot?) scone which I have yet to taste. It smells amazingly of ginger! My boyfriend said after sharing a slice of Napoleon cake that "it was worth double parking on Bergen Ave." It wasn't just creamy, but it had a zesty after note! My only qualm is that the flaky pastry part was kind of gummy, probably because it soaked up the moisture from ring refrigerated. I'll be sure to go again and try the cake when it's fresher. I'll definitely be back!
