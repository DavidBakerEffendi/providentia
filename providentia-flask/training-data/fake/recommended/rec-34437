L'amante just doesn't do it for me! As an Italian myself, I do tend to have high expectations for Italian cuisine. Despite positive reviews, L'amante feels like it is trying too hard, the food is grossly overpriced for what you get, and the atmosphere is sterile. The staff are attentive, but unfortunately our food came out extremely quickly for a restaurant touting itself as upscale. My glass of wine was skimpy, and the food was overall mediocre. Without a doubt our favorite thing we ordered were the squash blossoms drizzled with honey and truffle oil. It was delicious, but I wish for $11 that there had been more than four tiny squash blossoms on the plate. We also shared the grilled calamari, which I couldn't finish. For $11 I had to weed through the charred, overcooked radicchio doused in balsamic vinegar to find four measly pieces of calamari. Disappointing. The orecchiette with broccoli raab and sausage was good, but it should have been great. Overall the dish was bland and nothing special. I suppose the menu didn't lie when it said orecchiette with broccoli raab and sausage, since that's pretty much all it was. With Delia in town, it's hard to imagine ever returning to L'amante.
