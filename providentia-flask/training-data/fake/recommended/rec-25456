Been craving food from south of the border for quite some time and am so glad I discovered this place via Yelp!  The cuisine is Mexican/Peruvian with pizza thrown into the mix for all us gringos.  I decided to try the Taco de Bisteck con Queso (beef w/cheese) and it was awesome.  Shredded beef loaded into two soft tacos and topped with Mexican cheese.  The meat was a little spicy, but not overwhelming.  If you purchase the taco combo you'll receive four tacos served with a guacamole sauce, a tomatillo sauce, and a red sauce that I believe was made with a chipotle as it was rather smokey.  The staff is very friendly and it's obvious this place is the real deal as the clientele was very much Hispanic - I was the only gringo in the joint! Give it a try, you won't be sorry!
