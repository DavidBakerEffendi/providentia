I visited this place the other night for the first time with friends for a late dinner, (probably 10:30 PM) It was like a pretty cool place, the hostess looked like a rockstar, greeting us with a fur coat and the atmosphere was dimmed with a touch of small Christmas lights. The cuisine seems to be your traditional food with an artistic and modern twist. I ordered the caesar salad which was really good, not too salty, with big leafy pieces of romaine lettuce and very filling. Although I was borderline full between that and the complimentary biscuits (YUM!) I snagged a bite from my entree, a Salmon BLT, which included avocado, arugula and a pesto mayo. It was great! Overall definitely recommended, prompt and friendly service, great food and cool atmosphere. and Open 24/7!
