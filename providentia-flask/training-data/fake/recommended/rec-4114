Ate here once at the restaurant itself & the food was delicious. However, just placed an order for home delivery & two words: NEVER AGAIN! 45 minute wait they told me on the phone, turned out to be an hour & 20 minutes AND, the food wasn't even hot!!!!!! You want this food, just go there yourself because the delivery service SUCKS!
