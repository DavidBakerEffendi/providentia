You may think that 5 stars for a beer and sausage bar is a bit extreme, but coming from Wisconsin, I value a good sausage served with good beer.  This place is definitely worth traveling out of your way to if you don't live in the area and it's the perfect place to plan to stop by after a day of walking around Prospect Park (still a bit of a walk from the Park, but worth it). When my wife and I first visited Der Kommissar, I sent a text to my Austrian friend in Chicago that said "We're currently enjoying kasekrainer, gruner veltliner and Gösser."  His response to me was "Wow! I didn't know you were visiting Austria. How long will your vacation be?"  Needless to say, he was quite jealous when I told him we were only in Brooklyn. Tips: -Order your the kasekrainer and always order your sausage to be served in the bun (even if you get one of the sample platters). -Try some apricot schnapps. Overall, it is like visiting Austira... or Wisconsin... or someplace awesome.
