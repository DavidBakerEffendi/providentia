Good selection of pizza by the slice. The staff is friendly and they bring the food to your table so you don't have to wait at the counter. I can't give a higher rating because the crust and cheese on my Margherita Pizza doesn't always seem as fresh as I'd like and we usually get our garlic knots delivered to us after we're almost done with our pizza, when it's supposed to be an appetizer in our opinion. The food is pretty good though and my family loves the variety of pizza slices they offer. A good family stop after church, very quick and enjoyable.
