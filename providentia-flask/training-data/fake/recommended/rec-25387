I wish I could recommend a restaurant whose credit card machine was broken one day when my family and I arrived, and the very next day neglected to give me back my credit card after I used it. And then didn't bother to tell me as I walked away to exit, "Sir, excuse me. Here's your credit card." But I can't. When I called later that day, the first manager (John) told me he'd mail me back the card. When it didn't arrive after four days, I called back. The manager said, "Oh, yeah. My manager told me I can't mail it because of liability." No attempt was made to contact me. I asked that that manager please call me, so we could sort this out. No call was received. As I live eight miles away and didn't feel like driving the 16 miles roundtrip to retrieve my card, or to take a train to SO and back, I had to report my card as lost. This prompted me to have to change at least six linked accounts. Ironically, my family actually enjoyed the waffles and croque madame, but needless to say with service standards such as these, we can't ever go back.
