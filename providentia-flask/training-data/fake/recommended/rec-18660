They give you a lot of food. Otherwise it doesn't live up to the hype. I had the lamp over a rice for $6 even. It was spiced ground beef served over rice with a few pieces of pita and lettuce. The portions are large, and foolishly I ate all of mine. There are far better middle eastern options in this city. BZ Grill and Duzan in Queens to name two. Both at a similar price point. Halal guys is a reminder that the favorite activity of New Yorkers (or at least many of them) is to wait in long lines for food (see cronut, ramen). Fortunately, that is not all there is. There are plenty of wonderful places for those who do not their restaurant choices validated by long waits.
