I've been here a couple times and only ordered a chicken cheese steak and pizza in the past.  Both were very good.  What will make me come back in the future is their customer service.  The people at the counter have always been so pleasant and friendly, which goes a long way for me.  I was so surprised the last time I went there when I saw one of those booths outside of the entry way to keep customers warm during their waits - how thoughtful.  I also appreciated the sign on their door requesting customers to be mindful of the neighborhood and throw trash in the trash cans - how conscientious!
