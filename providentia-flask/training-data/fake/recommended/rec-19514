This is the best sushi I've had in Philadelphia so far. In my experience, sushi tastes the same pretty much anywhere you go (disclaimer...I've never been to Morimoto, where I'm sure the sushi is amazing), but you could tell how fresh the fish was here. It had a different flavor, superior to the other sushi I have had in the city. The tuna pizza was awesome and refreshing, and I've never had better shrimp tempura rolls (Olde City roll). Though the rolls were a bit on the smaller size, they were satisfying and priced reasonably. I will DEFINITELY be heading back here many times.
