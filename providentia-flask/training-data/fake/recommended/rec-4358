visited once over the summer, and once this week....I felt compelled to mention that I really like this place....well worth it for the price. Good service, fast and good food.  Everything I ate was good if not excellent. Disclaimer --- This restaurant is not for you if you  are the type who frequents and needs a pretentious atmosphere, waitstaff or overpriced menu typical of most olde city restaurants.... This place feels very down-to-earth euro bistro fair-- and not "sex in the city" glamorous vibe....so go down the street to the local Steven Starr place if you need that. And to the guy who flamed them because he didn't get a job....really??? Seriously? You want to work under the table and then get pissy because they don't like you or don't comply to some set of rules? how long have you been in that industry....hmmmp.
