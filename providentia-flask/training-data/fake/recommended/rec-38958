I should not being eating at Als French Frys. But I do. I love it. One time I had a business conference in So. VT. I took a day and drove the length of the state to have Als French Frys. Another time I was on a Boy scout trip. I talked the bus driver into swinging by Als French Frys. See how many excuses you can think up to get to Als French Frys?
