Very cozy and chill atmosphere  with a nice staff with a huge wine selection!  I was hoping to get seated at one of the "movie theater" tables but got the table right by the register, wasn't preferred but still really enjoyed the place nonetheless. Also, I tried duck liver for the fist time here, yum!! Prefect casual place to grab a drink and apps! Definitely will be going back! :)
