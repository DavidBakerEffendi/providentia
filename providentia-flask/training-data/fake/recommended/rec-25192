I am a BANH MI lover. It's in my blood!! I was hanging out in Bushwick and me and my friends came across this place. Normally I go to Ba Xuyuen- best Banh Mi place in NYC. We came here because of convenience. The Asian lady greeted us and service was prompt and she spoke proficient English. This place is tiny and there's no bathroom. I ordered the classic one for $5.50 and a pork chop with noodle - no soup (bun in Vietnamese). It was okay. The bread was toasty and inside was soft. They had daikon, and cilantro with headcheese, barely notice the pate, and there was some more pork meat. The spicy level was a joke. Not spicy at all. I asked for very spicy and there was only a little bit of sriracha sauce. My idea of spicy would be raw jalapenos or thai chili peppers. But then again this is Bushwick so most people would not care. The bun was okay. The noodles were very standard and the pork chops were not as flavorful as the other places in Chinatown. This place does satisfy the craving and this place is obviously catered to the non-authentic taste buds since banh mi and Vietnamese cuisine is very new to this area.
