Stopped in after walking the streets of the 2nd Northern Liberties Street Festival. Great outdoor seating and enjoyed the bands while eating with a friend. I only had appetizers but was very pleased with my selections. Had the guacamole and chips which were awesome. I am a NEWBIE to 'guac'... The guacamole was creamy and I could taste the lime and tomatoes. Not sure of all the seasonings in the guacamole but it was soooooooo good. Â Can't believe all these years that I told myself I didn't like it. Well now, I want to eat it all the time. Today was no different. The chips had a red lightly spicy seasoning on them which were tasty and the chips were also crispy. I had to stop myself from eating the whole bowl which I believe was for 2 but it was so fresh and "delish"... My second selection was the Mexican corn was sweet and had a distinctive yet delightful taste with the cojita cheese. I am a fan and would order again. I always love grilled corn that has been carefully "de-silked". My teeth were very happy and my tummy as well.
