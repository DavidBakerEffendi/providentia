Wow...  REALLY enjoyed this place.  It was the kickoff to a 3 day weekend celebration with a group of 6, 3 of which were skeptical of my choice of Lebanese cuisine.  Everyone was blown away.   Started with Hommus, Baba Ghannouj, Filafel...  all good.  Then the Brussel Sprouts arrived...  these were unbelievable.  Roasted with Fig Puree and grapes.  Warm eggplant was also amazing. Entrees included a number of kebabs...  all good.  Also tried the Lamb Makloubeh, which was a pulled lamb with eggplant and cucumber yogurt. The restaurant is beautiful and has a really terrific bar area that would be fun to hang in. Service was good.  Started off having to get our servers attention a number of times, but once she figured out we were ordering a lot (and drinking a lot of wine), she stepped up.   The fact that we were there from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m and never felt the need to move to another bar or club speaks for itself.
