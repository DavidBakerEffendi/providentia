I loved everything about this place..... from the service, the food and the drinks.... Lets start with the build your own guacamole... which they have a card at the table to check off your ingredents... can I say nice touch. The blood orange margarita was very good.... Had one.... Pork confit tacos aka carnitas..... just amazing.... Marc had the Pollo Frito very tender and a great sauce.... and the side dish of cornbread and greens very good pairing.... Being a girl from California who has had her fair share on Mexican food..... The Chef Gabriel Montalvo came to the table a few times it was great to talk with him about all of the wonderful things he was doing...... to finish we had the fresh doughnuts with two dipping sauces.... which I had the Cafe Coco Martini with YUMMY
