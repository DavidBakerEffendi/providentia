An out of town friend was hosting a dinner/meetup, and he decided upon here, for some reason. The prices are New York prices, the area is definitely restaurant area, lots of other places/choices. We were a party of 18, and I came to this location to eat.. after a long day. I didn't need to be lecture about the menu in detail. Sure the waiter was definitely trying to milk the party for all their $'s worth, but yeah didn't really need that lecture, when I was trying to make some conversation with my friends. Their wine menu is quite extensive, desert menu not so much, pasta and entrees are all right. Check out their website for definitely seeing at least what type of food do they have. I ordered a sword fish dish, after debating over a salmon dish, and the fish was quite all right... if not unremarkable... I forgot if there was a lemon to squeeze over the fish, but the taste was okay, average. The dish took later than all my other dinner companion's to come. I kinda feel that this is a touristy spot. Unless if a friend invites again, I really don't believe I'll come here again.
