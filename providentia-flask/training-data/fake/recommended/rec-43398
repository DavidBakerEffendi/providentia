Had been dying to try this place for a long time. I'm always down for an awesome burger and corner bistro seemed like a good choice. The place is small and dark and smells amazing at the same time. It gets busy so be prepared to wait and if you choose kick back and enjoy a fresh on tap mcsorley brew. I ordered a bistro burger which is an oversized lump of juicy meat served with bacon and cheese. The thing just looks amazing. My buddy ordered the chili burger which you have to see in person because it's insane. The burgers are amazing and the brews are good and its All very affordable. I loved this place!
