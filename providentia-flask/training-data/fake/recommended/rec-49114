Really cute place to come for brunch. Ambiance is great and service was top notch. I ended up getting the saucisson a'ail and my friend got the egg sandwich. Both of us were happy with our choices. Thing to keep in mind is that this place gets pretty packed so if your coming for brunch make sure you come earlier than the rush otherwise you could be waiting around for a while.
