Can't say anything. Went here with a friend for dinner on Sat night without reservation but we waited for an hour and it's worth. My friend comes here frequently so he knows what to order. Our plates were gnudi, bomda di riso, cappelletti and spallina. Everything was great. Waiting to come back soon
