I was a little skeptical when I first went in, as the decor gave off a very 'hip' ambience.  Be that it may, the food was excellent. The lychee sangria was slightly too sweet for me, and I didn't like it very much.  The fried calamari was cooked perfectly: crispy and tender (sauce wasn't good, and I didn't use it). I also ordered the Andaman  Basil for entree, and it was delicious.  It was a plateful of seafood: calamari (they are really good at cooking calamari), mussels, shrimps, and clamps.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  The dish was actually spicy, which was a nice surprise.  It wasn't super hot to the point where you couldn't taste anything else; but there was definitely a kick to every bite. Great place, will definitely be back.
