We came on a Sunday night. The restaurant was not very busy. We waited about 20 minutes to get served. The waiter spilled the expensive beer all over the table without offering another and left a sopping mess and never returned. A food runner brought our food and we had to flag down a hostess to get our check about 30 minutes after we were finished. The food was great but we won't return due to the horrible service!
