I have eaten here several times and had nothing but good things to say until my meal there last evening. It was empty, 1 other couple in there and a full staff. They were all too busy talking amongst each other to get our drinks and they messed up the order. The ray's spicy shrimp which is usually delicious seemed like it was a double fried left overs and smelled very fishy. My husband returned Â his entree because it was a blob of grease and was not edible. The only decent things were the drinks and salad. It's a shame because we were looking forward to a good meal and it was anything but. We won't be going back anytime soon.
