Love ippudo esp the service since NYC has so many great ramen joints, service and how you feel you have been treated is key to an exceptional experience. I like that they text you when your table is ready, staff seem to genuinely want to do their job in a courteous manner. Plus they take credit cards,unlike totto ramen down the street over. Pork broth is rich and luxurious. I wish the pieces of pork were more decadent like the pork belly at totto ramen. Â Pork buns are amazing. The amount of spicy mayo is perfect. A bit pricey but good for tying you over if wait is long
