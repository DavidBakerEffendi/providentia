Full disclosure I was here for restaurant week.  Got the lamb burger which was really good- juicy and flavorful on fluffy pita.  Also had the calamari la plancha which was decent, tender.  The strawberry rhubarb cheesecake was also good, not mind-blowing.  It was a good meal but I think I just didn't love the atmosphere.  Maybe it was the high ceilings and decor, it felt a bit cold and not as cozy and inviting and I prefer when I dine.  The waiter was a bit forgetful as well.  Just felt like a lunchtime rush, I guess.  Maybe dinner is a better experience... but I definitely would not sit on the ground floor again, maybe there's another more comfortable seating area.
