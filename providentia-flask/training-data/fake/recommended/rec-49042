I've now been to La Boca about 5 times and am yet to have an experience that was anything short of amazing. Each pizza has been cooked perfectly, at least in my opinion. The chipotle honey with chicken has already become my personal favorite. The beer selection is purely local, including a selection from Simple Roots (a home-based operation in the NNE). I'd recommend La Boca to anyone and everyone. Great pizza!
