if i could give this place zero stars i would. i have NEVER ever walked out of a restaurant having refused my meal because it was so disgusting but i did here. both mine and my boyfriend's orders tasted like watery, mushy dog food. and thai food is my FAVORITE. they offered to remake our dishes but they were so awful we didn't even want them to attempt. Â at least they waived the bill, but i would NEVER go back ever.
