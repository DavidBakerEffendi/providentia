Though I didn't try the food (yet), my friend and I ended an impromptu Hoyt Street bar crawl at Bijan's for one final drink. Upon the advice of the bartender (who was awesome), we tried two of the whiskey cocktails. The place was pretty quiet, with a few other customers at the bar late on Sunday night, and one table occupied. The bar space was cool, the lighting was romantic, and the music was perfectly chill. It was the perfect end to a fun night out. And I will be back to try some of the food next time! P.S. The bartender called a cab for us, and we really appreciated that level of service!
