This place is located inside the Excelsior hotel in NYC's Upper west side. Nice interior, the decor is supposedly 'Miami meets Manhattan'. Did appreciate the free glass of Sangria with the Yelp Check-in. They have quite the selection of Sangria's at this place. I ordered the 'Spanish Harlem' which had Peaches, Mandarin, Cinnamon and Dark Rum I tried the Lobster empanadas (good, not memorable) and the 'Vaca Frita al Caballo' for my entree. It is Cuban Skirt Steak, Latin Pork Fried Rice, Fried Egg and Avocado. Reeeaaallly wish the steak and the rice had been more flavorful, as one would expect of a Cuban restaurant. Now, I'm not an expert on UWS restaurants/eateries but surely NYC has got better, more authentic Cuban eateries than this place. It got the job done (I was hungry and craving some Cuban food!) but really didn't leave me with enough to bring me back anytime soon.
