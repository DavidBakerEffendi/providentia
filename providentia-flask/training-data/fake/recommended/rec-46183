Terrible....what a disappointment....Went there on a recommendation...however I can not even muster up one star! Chips- greasy and heavy, almost stale. Red salsa was HOT and tasteless, green salsa had some flavor, however only served about 1/2in in a tiny bowl, hardly enough to dip! Ordered "tableside" guacamole but NOT MADE tableside and portion very small and BLAND! Went on to order chile rellenos hoping for some redemption (the inside of the space was interesting by the way)... But alas the rellenos was a roll of something in the middle of the bowl covered with a sauce that tasted like spaghetti sauce . Inside what seem like 1/2  of a pepper mixed with spinach and breaded and deep fried? Did I mention the word bland yet? That was it. A roll of something in a bowl. We ate it (at this point hungry) . But the kicker was after we had finished the waiter came by with a bowl of rice and asked if we wanted some. Not knowing rice was an option I looked at him somewhat shocked and asked if we got rice with the meal and why not WITH the meal. He stated we could get rice and beans, (now he tells us upon request) however the beans were not ready yet so we could only get rice. And the rice was cold. At this point I had enough...  I complained... Waiter at this point seemed quite bothered that I wasn't accepting what had just happened. Beans not done!  Strange way of building customers. Waste of money for mediocre food and obviously the customer suffers from a mediocre kitchen system !
