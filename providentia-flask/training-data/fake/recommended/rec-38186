Where do I begin this place is great, we walked in to a warm friendly smile! Got a table next to the fire place, it was so cool, our server was so friendly and helpful. We order the table side guacamole and the spicy blood orange margarita. The guacamole was made right at our table and boy was it good. The margarita was spicy and oh so good. All the food was great and the staff was so attentive, it was a very busy night but it did not affect our serves, they were always there making sure all was good, even the manager came over to see if all was to our liking. They have a patio and it that is open all year round and get this its heated! We will definitely be back and have dinner on the patio! You have to go to Geronimo its a place you are going to want to go back to again and again!
