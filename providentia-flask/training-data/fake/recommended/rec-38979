Came here for lunch during my annual trip to the city. Immediately, I felt at home here. The vibe is casual and lively and the staff is friendly. I ordered the special Brussels sprout salad and it was divine. I also got their signature omelette and I have to say it was cooked to perfection. My pet peeve is when I order any egg dish and it comes over cooked. This place knows how to make an egg dish and won't disappoint.
