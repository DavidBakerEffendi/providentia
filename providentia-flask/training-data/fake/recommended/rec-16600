when people say this place is small, they mean holy smokes this place is SMALL. we squeezed in through the front door and told the hostess we were two. she replied, "follow me please" and literally TURNED AROUND to place our menus on the table. i use the term "table" loosely as it was not so much table as it was an attractive slab of wood bolted to the wall in a one-foot by four-foot recess. perched on two stools at our bar-table, we were right in the flow of traffic and were bumped, brushed, or otherwise touched by just about everyone in the restaurant, staff and patrons alike. that said: the food was very good and creative. Green Mango Paneer was interesting and had a nice spice. Chili Pork Dumplings and Braised Pork Buns both delicious as were the Scallops. we also had the strawberry/pepper icecream dessert, which i liked in theory, but the truffle oil was a little overdone. ultimately the food tasted good and was reasonably priced. the wine was nice and not too pricey. the wait staff was very friendly and attentive, but i wouldn't go back unless i was guaranteed a real table (of which, there are three).
