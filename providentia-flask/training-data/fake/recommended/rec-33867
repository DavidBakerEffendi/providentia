Ordered take out from here last night and food was good. I ordered guacamole w/ chips and a turkey and cheese hoagie. Pros-  Place is very clean and I liked the way how the hoagie was wrapped neatly, so I would't make a mess while eating it. Hoagie was on the money and guacamole was very tasty and fresh. Cons - forgot to put onions on hoagie, asked for fresh mozzarella cheese, but they put american on there without calling me to ask what other cheese I wanted on it since they didn't have it. Price of half hoagie is $6.50 which is a good price for the size. The Mexican portion of the menu is so overpriced, 3 tacos or enchiladas for 8.50  and that doesn't include rice and beans! In LA Mexican food is hella cheap and hella tasty! Overall, the food itself is good and the prices are good. I just don't agree with the high prices of the Mexican food.
