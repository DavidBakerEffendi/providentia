I was told this place is THE place for ramen in NY. I've had really good ramen at many different places (including Japan) so I was a little skeptical. I also heard that the wait is insanely long so I decided to go on a weekday, around 2pm for lunch. To my surprise, there was no wait! Once you walk in you are immediately greeted by a loud, almost chorus like, "Irashaimase!" which totally made my day.  The staff were all very friendly and the shop reminded me of the ones in Japan. I ordered the Akamaru Modern Ramen which was very delightful and flavorful. I love that it wasn't overly salty like some tonkotsu broths tend to be. The noodles were very thin, a first for me but I enjoyed it.  Usually places serve thicker, chewy noodles but these were great and really fresh. You can see the chefs making them from behind the glass. The pork that came with the ramen was very tender. To be honest, I think the egg took the show for me. It was the PERFECT soft boiled egg. PERFECT. Minus one star because the price was probably $5 more than it needs to be. But good food. Good service. I'd do it every once in a while (as long as there is no wait).
