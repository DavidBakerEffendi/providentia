They are lovely for gluten free people! I got their gluten free pasta bolognese...with a dollop of ricotta cheese on the top. It was unbelievable. I seriously cannot wait to go back--their gluten free pasta is awesome, and this dish was prepared so well with such fresh ingredients. Salads were lovely, the ambiance is trendy and pretty. Went for my dad's birthday and go every time we are in the area. Keep up the good work!
