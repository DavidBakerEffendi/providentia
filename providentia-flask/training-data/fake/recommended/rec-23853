I dunno what the haters are looking for, because the Wishing Well is a solid bar. As of 7/25/2010, they're running specials on Kenzo, wings, and oysters during Phillies games. Good beer selection on 12 rotating taps. It's never too crowded (like every other freaking bar on East Passyunk) and there's no smoking (I'll never go back to Ray's and I'll never step into 12 Steps Down). Yes, it's poorly lit: it's a bar. If I wanted to see who I was hitting on I'd get on match dot com. Yes you might not like the music. If everyone had the same tastes as you the world would be a pretty boring place. I agree that they should probably give up on the gastropub charade and just embrace their pub status. I really hope the Well has enough capital to even out their menu, build a regular crowd, and stay open a little while. Bella Vista, especially right around the Well, is a barren wasteland between Passyunk East and Center City. The Wishing Well is a great oasis.
