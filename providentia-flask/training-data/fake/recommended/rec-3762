I am one of the LUCKIER Brooklynites to live ONE block away form this neighborhood treasure. I am absolutely in love with everything about this place. The great staff, the wonderful fusion of down south hospitality and Ã¼ber Brooklyn cool, the AH-mazing cocktails (try Lightning Hopkins) and the DELICIOUS, DELECTABLE (I cannot stress this enough) food....and to add gravy to an all ready incredibly satisfying menu, the Bourbon cake is to DIE for.....If I ever move from this neighborhood, I'm leaving with some happily acquired love handles..#gotopeacheshothouse
