ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PHO IN PHILLY! This is my go to spot and first recommendation for pho and viet food in the city.  Everyone in the restaurant is so pleasant and the menu choices are mouth watering.  Having an option for bubble tea and alcohol makes it a nice mid day stop or even a date spot. I have never, ever had a bad experience here in the 3 years I have been enjoying this establishment... which has been almost every Sunday.
