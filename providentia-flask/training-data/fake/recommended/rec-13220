Hands down my favorite Thai place to eat at! The environment is absolutely stunning, and while this place is tight and always packed, it's worth it. I take all my NYC visitors here to eat and they love it. You think you are walking into a pricey restaurant, but it's actually really reasonable. I just love this place so much! It really is a great Thai choice in Hell's Kitchen.
