Nice bar but the service here is terrible. My friends and I come here at least once a week. Last Friday we unfortunately had the most nasty and rude waitress. Throughout the night she constantly kept asking us sarcastically if we were ok, which seemed really weird after the 6th time she asked within an hour. Then when we left she asked me why we tipped her less than 10%. Which was crazy because we tipped her 20%. I don't know why she had such a nasty attitude all night and questioning our tip before we left was extremely rude. This isn't my first time having to deal with this waitress and I'm not the only one who has complained about her to management before. Needless to say I will not be coming back here. Be careful if you do come here the waitres said her name was Adreana, I'm not sure if that is her real name but she is the Asian waitress.
