It's a hot summer day? That means meatballs are in order. Preferably with cheese and sauce on a bun. Yum. I'm not really adding anything new to the mix here, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here. Highlights - 1) We got to sit outside on the sidewalk. Yay! 2) Server was friendly and cute. 3) Prices totally reasonable. I got the Meatball Sandwich on Brioche (with beef balls, mushroom sauce and mozzarella) and a side of the Market Salad (greens, corn, avo, tomato in a cilantro-lime dressing - Yum!) And it was only $8. What?! 4) Yum food, great prices = great value. Cons 1) Screaming, unruly children. Really, who thinks it's appropriate to bring children who can't sit still and be quiet out in public? Time for the paddle I say. Definitely a great place for lunch. Will be back. Accepts cash and cards.
