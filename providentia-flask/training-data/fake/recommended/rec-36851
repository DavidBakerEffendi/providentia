I recently taught myself how to make really good pizzas at home. I love seeing the pizza dough rise and smelling the yeasty beer smells when I punch down the dough and begin to work with it. I've learned to appreciate a good pie. Romeo's is one of my husband's favorite lunch spots when he's is in Princeton consulting. He likes it because it is wicked cheap, they don't skimp on toppings, they use good sauce (he's funky about pizza sauce), and it is really tasty! He wanted me to try some pie from Romeo's. His favorite is a slice of bacon and Roma tomato. My observations from said pizza: 1. This crust is solid. It can stand up to takeout (he brought pizza to our hotel) without getting soggy or gooey. 2. This crust is made from delicious dough. 3. This crust is perfectly thin and crispy, despite ample toppings- consider it the Dixie ultra of pizza crusts. They pile it on, but you never lose your picnic to gravity. 4. The toppings are fresh and of good quality 5. They have a lot of pizza choices to choose from, I mean A LOT 6. They sell slices at a steal of a price (our entire meal was less than $10. 7. They use good cheese. 8. Did I mention the crust? What is interesting, is the rest of their menu looks pretty solid as well. With more time in town, I'd have to check 'em out. Not bad for a little pizzeria. Love me some Jersey pizza.
