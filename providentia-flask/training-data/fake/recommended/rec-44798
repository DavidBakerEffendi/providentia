The beignets were amazing!! If we hadn't had dessert, I would have raved about the special, which was somehow both delicate and hearty, or the soup, or the heart of palm salad, which was delicious, or my wife's lobster risotto, which was just about perfect. But all of those delights were eclipsed by dessert.  Cinnamon beignets with raspberry sauce and nutella was like a religious experience.  I'm not a dessert guy, but I would go FAR out of my way for a dessert like that.  If I could steal their dessert chef and bring him back home with me, I would. The rest of the meal was also fantastic, I don't want to sell it short.  If I lived nearby, this could easily become my favorite restaurant.  As it is, I want to plan my next trip into town around a dinner here.
