Completely authentic, no frills mexican food. It's good and worth the trip if you don't live nearby. Haven't found a place that compares yet in Philly. Can't give it five stars because I lived in San Diego for a long time and know what excellent Mexican tastes like. Get the steak tacos. Enchiladas aren't that great here.
