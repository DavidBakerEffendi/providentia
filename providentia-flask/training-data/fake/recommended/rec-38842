I enjoy their food. I've had better, but I've also had far worse. The portions are fair, the food is tasty, and the price doesn't kill me. If you're in the neighborhood it's a good place to get some chinese. I always do take out. I can see the negative comments about the restaurant itself. It's definitely family owned, and they're not to worried about showmanship on the inside. I'll take off one star, but it doesn't really make a huge difference to me personally. Also, their Thai Iced Tea is really good.
