Ah, "The Chicken & Ribs Joint". I've been coming here either by myself or with my dad for about 25 years, mostly on Tuesdays. If you think this place is a "hole in the wall" now, you should've seen it 15 years ago. But for what it is, there's no better place in the area. The fried rice here is the best i've ever had. It is fried and then left to steam in covered pots instead of sitting on the side somewhere or over a low light on the stove where it could dry out. So it retains its moisture while keeping some of its oily goodness. The chicken is amazing as well, especially with the green sauce. The green sauce can make anything taste great though, even mom's overcooked pot roast...that's saying something. What's great about the ribs is that they are very meaty and they use a dry rub spice, so it's cooked in its natural juices without the need of bbq sauce. This place also does not use MSG to enchance its flavors like so many other places do. I came here with my girl and had 2 chicken and ribs combos, drinks, x-tra hot sauce and plaintains for $22. That's recession proof, even with their recently inflated prices. People call me on Tuesdays just to ask me if i'm going here and can I pick them up something for them....that's how good this place is. Plus, the DVD lady comes around with all your movie needs...gives it a little extra charm...actually, that's why I usually order take out....
