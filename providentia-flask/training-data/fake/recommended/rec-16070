I came with a friend on a Saturday around 1pm for brunch and had about a 20 minute wait. (Make sure you go to the back room to put your name on the list) We happily waited in the front room at two window seats with a round of Blood Marys which were very horseradishy and topped with pickled green beans - yum. For my meal I ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy with scrambled eggs and was thrilled with the large portion size and delicious gravy. I don't even like scrambled eggs and I ate every bit of these, they were incredible. We ordered a round of Bloody Bulls (bloody mary + beef broth)...which were interesting... but I preferred the original, personally. I'd definitely come back for the low key atmosphere, affordable prices and incredible food.
