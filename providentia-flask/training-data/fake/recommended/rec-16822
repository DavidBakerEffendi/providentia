Hey Mercato! Omg short rib ragu. I don't know if I'll ever cheat on this delicious dish on a future visit. Thank you. This small BYO can be loud but the conversations are hushed while devouring the buttery artichoke app (I highly recommend) and the previous mentioned ragu. The staff is super nice and I enjoy their team approach to serving. Any process simplification method that results in yummy food getting into my stomach quicker is fine by me. This is one of my new favorite dinner spots in Philly.
