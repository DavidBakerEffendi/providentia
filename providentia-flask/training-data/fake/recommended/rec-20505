I love this place. I don't go there for the décor. This place is a jewel in the rough. The food is of excellent quality and always fresh. The quantity of food is an exceptional value. The complaints of poor décor are valuing trappings over culinary artistry. This is a wonderful eatery. The waiters are professional, engaging, and can rattle off a laundry list of specials offered that day. I was reluctant to write this review because I want this jewel to remain hidden in E. Hanover.
