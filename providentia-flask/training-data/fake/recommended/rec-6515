I'm not a fan of the UWS, but I'm a fan of Kefi. The sheep's milk dumplings are unique and have a very flavorful sauce.  I actually preferred the sauce with the tasty bread they provided, but appreciated the lightness of the dumplings.  Could have used more sausage though. The real winner was the rabbit pasta.  Seriously, this was one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.  Shredded rabbit meat (I hope) and plenty of it, mixed with perfectly-cooked flat noodles in a tasty sauce.  What more can you ask for? Also, I can recommend the galaktoboureko.  Not the absolute best I've ever had, but actually very, very good.  Much better, for instance, than the much-touted galaktoboureko at Pylos. Did I mention how reasonably priced the food is?   Kefi may very well be a reason to make a special trip to the UWS.
