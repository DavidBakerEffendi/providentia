Bakehouse has amazing bacon, just okay food otherwise and really bad service. We had brunch there on a recent Sunday; the place was not every crowded, but it still took about 40 minutes for our food to start *dribbling* out of the kitchen. I mean, they would bring out one plate, then two a few minutes later, then another two after that. One of our group--ironically, the only pregnant one--was left waiting more than 15 minutes after everyone else started eating. For an omelet!!! Other than that, our waitress was essentially absent. We had to ask her multiple times for coffee, milk, etc. The busers kept trying to whisk away plates while we were still eating. This place is so cute, but I wouldn't come back; it was such an awkward experience, a few of us left a pretty low tip.
