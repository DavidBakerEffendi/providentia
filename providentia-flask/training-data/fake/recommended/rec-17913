Lunch gets packed on weekdays. Usually filled with cops from every agency in the area. The owners are great and always greet you with a smile and a handshake at the door. I recommend the grilled chicken with rice and beans. Great Cafe con Leche. I have never had a bad meal here. Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Dress is very casual. Â Parking is tough.
