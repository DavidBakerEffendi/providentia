I love eating in neighborhoods, I could never afford to live in. Jack the Horse was a great lunch spot on a day trip out to Brooklyn Heights. It's roomy - good decor and the food was pretty good.  Not amazing by any means but well worth what we paid for.  I would def come here again if I'm ever in the area.
