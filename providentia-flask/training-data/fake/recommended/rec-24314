I ordered for a part vegan, gluten-free, paleo, normal eating 30 person production crew for Elle Magazine; and the variety and food itself was exceptional. The staff listened to my requests and made inventive pairings, was on time (so important), brought everything needed to eat including disposable tongs, and was not that expensive (and let me tip and pay in advance so I Uber'd out). The food was really delicious/healthy and everyone was praising me...because I'm amazing.
