Food was excellent - biscuits and gravy was delicious. Service was mediocre at best. Slow to get drinks, and had to closely look over the check as they charged us for a round of drinks that was to be included with our entree. Overall a good experience but with so many other brunch placed to try, not sure we will be back.
