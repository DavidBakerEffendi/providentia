My husband and I tried to visit El Matador a couple of months ago based on a couple of recommendations from his boss. We arrived during normal business hours but the doors were locked even though there were people visibly inside. The only responses to us at the door were stares... Still... We decided to go back last night because we were craving authentic Mexican tacos. We ordered the sopes to share in addition to our tacos (chicken and steak). The sopes were good, but more explanation on the variety that is available would've been nice when I asked about them -- a guy at the next table had some that were different and looked even better than ours. Â The tacos were very dry and had little flavor, but there was no salt on our table to help boost what flavor there was. The green and red sauces were good but still couldn't make the tacos moist enough to enjoy. Apparently there are other things to order than what is on the "to go" menu we were given to order from (that was just a plain paper menu with much wear and tear). My husband's boss said he'd had some very good soup and there were empty tables holding semi-empty dishes with beans, rice, etc. Neither was on the menu nor offered to us -- if either were part of the "special," They weren't mentioned. The man serving us was very brief and didn't explain anything even when asked, but two other customers who came in speaking Spanish were treated very nicely. Probably won't return. Total bill was over $30 for not a lot of primarily bland, dry food.
