Overall a good meal, but I wish I had just taken the girlfriend. The "Good for Groups" classification is used too liberally on Yelp. Yes, this restaurant does have a large space in the back which is available for group reservations. No, it does NOT have many options for group dining. The "sampler" appetizer options are tiny, like most of their portions, which is unideal for sharing. Their bartenders are superb. The bloody bar is a good idea in theory, but I'd bet the health inspector wouldn't approve. The waitstaff wasn't anything to write home about... I almost wish we could have all sat at the bar. I'd recommend doing that if your party is small enough. But their burgers made everything "A-OK" overall. YUM.
