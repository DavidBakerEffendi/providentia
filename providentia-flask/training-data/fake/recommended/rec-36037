Another one of the places we had to hit up in New York was Balthazar, one of the most famous brasseries in the city. Conveniently located in SoHo, I could not say no to a day of shopping and eating. It was really quite busy and bustling in the restaurant, and after a lengthy wait (I think we shopped, so that was fine), we got a table in the corner. The food looked delicious. We were both excited. Camille went with the steak frites with béarnaise sauce ($37). The fries were heavenly, especially with the sauce, and the steak was perfectly done as requested at medium rare. Yeah, those fries were really good, the more I think about them. I opted for the sautéed skate with raisins, toasted pistachios, capers, beurre noisette and celeriace purée ($29). This was really, really good too! The fish with the beurre noisette -- which had such a great umami taste with the raisins and capers -- was just so good. And the pine nuts on top added great texture to it also. That was not enough! We stopped by Balthazar Bakery next door. So many pastries! The bakery smelled delicious. To be honest, I can't remember what this was (bad blogger.) but I assume it is a tart of sorts. (Edit: It was an apricot tart.) I know for a fact it was delicious though, because the next day we went back in the morning to pick up more pastries: Including this chocolate croissant. Not the best I've ever had (that would be at Tartine in San Francisco), but pretty darn good. Oh, and the coffee at Balthazar Bakery was great too. Pretty much made me a coffee drinker. All in all, definitely pay both the restaurant and bakery a visit.
