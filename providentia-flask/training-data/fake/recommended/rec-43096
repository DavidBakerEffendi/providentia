The appetizers were great (we got the sampler), everything else....not so much. The service was very slow and disorganized. Random food came to random tables. The Servers and food runners looked lost . We got the full rack of ribs with sides. The food was was just ok, the sides were barely warm and really not great. We also got some wrong sides, which took about 15 min to correct. Also, as the waitress was bussing the table, she dropped used utensils on my boyfriends back, staining his shirt with BBQ sauce. With so many other options in the area, I doubt I will be back.
