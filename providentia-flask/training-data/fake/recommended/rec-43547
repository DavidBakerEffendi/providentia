This is one of the places you have to stop into if visiting Burlington. In fact, I used to make a lunchtime habit of pointing it out to tourists who I saw looking over menus in the windows of other restaurants. But, now I just consider it so-so. There are a few standouts on the menu, but quite a lot of it is passable. The beers, however, can be very good. And the overall vibe is very Burlington. Keep in mind there can be a wait to sit outside in the nice weather. If they say the wait will be more than half an hour, I would just sit inside or move on. The wait could be much longer, and in my opinion is not worth it.
