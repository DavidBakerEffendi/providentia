So good! So cheap! So fresh! Found this place a couple nights ago to get sushi takeout, and not only was I able to get many rolls for a super decent price, I only had to wait a few minutes while I watched them being made and they were amazingly fresh and delicious! Oh, I'll be back, and it will be a fearsome feast to behold! I also randomly liked that they gave soy sauce in plastic dishes instead of those really annoyingly hard to open packets, it made my life so much easier!
