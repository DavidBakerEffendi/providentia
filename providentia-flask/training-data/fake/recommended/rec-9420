You should have "Room Service Pad Thai", not the ordinary pad thai with chicken or beef. Yes, it is a bit more expensive than the normal pad thai menus, but it definitely pays out! One of the most authentic and best pad thais I've ever had! The thin pad thai noodles and other toppings are wrapped by fried egg white, and inside there are jumbo shrimps with sliced squid and mussels. SO GOOD. The seafood is very fresh; the noodles are thin but perfectly flavored with the pad thai sauce. I had this with a glass of cocktail. Costs about $24. What a great deal for dinner in Manhattan! The service is good; interior design is very luxuious. What else can I expect more in this place?!
