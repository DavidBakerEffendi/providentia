Maybe I shouldn't even be reviewing this place because I only go there for brunch. But I love the atmosphere and the service is super friendly. I like that I can control their music with my iPhone. Of course the food is always good. No surprises on the brunch menu which is good. Nobody needs a hard to navigate brunch menu with a Sunday morning hangover. Â I'm sitting here right now and I found my new favorite table. Here comes my food. Yum!
