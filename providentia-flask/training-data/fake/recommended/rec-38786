If I could give this place 10 stars I would, they deserve it! By far the most amazing crepes you will ever have ANYWHERE. As a Temple Alum I ate at The Creperie almost everyday I was on campus since my building was right next to it. Alex and the guys who own the truck are amazing and always so nice. All I have to do is come up to the window and they already know my order, Chicken cordon with ranch dressing and feta with all the veggies! When I'm in the mood for sweets I LOVE the Berries Cheesecake Crepe, it's just heaven for your mouth! These crepes are massive and packed with meat and veggies or sweets and fruit and for $4.50 & $5.00 for a crepe and a drink you can't beat any meal on campus for that price. I've searched and searched for crepes as good as these and nothing compares at all. My boyfriend LOVES this place and tries a new one every time and hasn't been disappointed once. We both moved to Southern California and still search for a decent crepe place but like I said for the price, quality and size nothing will ever compare. Make sure if you're in Philly you check this place out!!!!!!!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
