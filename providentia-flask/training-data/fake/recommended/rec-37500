If your mom can't make you breakfast, this is the next best thing. The ladies are friendly and the food is delightful!  Lemon ricotta pancakes? Meatball parm omelette? Yes, please!! There's not a ton of seating but there's not usually a wait.   You can always take it to go if you're in a rush.... Otherwise enjoy a spot at the counter!
