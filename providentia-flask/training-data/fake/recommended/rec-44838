Went on a 6:00 saturday night.  The one thing preventing the 5th star was the fact that they did not have my reservation.  I had called and confirmed two days prior but they seemed to have lost it.  So this incident (hopefully isolated) suggests they are not buttoned up.  They however did seat us right away despite the confusion Food: awesome, 5-star worthy.  Started with the lamb meatball slider and kale salad.  Kale salad was awesome (this coming from a guy who doesn't really like kale). I had the "Chicken for 2" (which I was able to order as a single dish).  Tasty, moist, like butter.  Probably the best chicken I've had.  My wife had the girondole pasta which was great as well.  Wait staff was professional, friendly. This place is popular for good reason.  It comes recommended.
