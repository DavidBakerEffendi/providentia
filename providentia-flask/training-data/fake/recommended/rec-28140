Almost 4500 reviews and 4.5 stars? What else is there to say except this place is AMAZINGGGGgggg! Cheap, delicious, generous portions, reliable, friendly. It's mind blowing that you can get a kick-a$$ experience from food carts, while so many regular restaurants can't even figure it out. I always get the chicken and rice plates, no extra sauce or specific requests required. I love em just as they are ;) They've given me free "Halal Guys" reusable totes a couple of times, too!
