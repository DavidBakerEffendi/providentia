This place has existed in some form or another since at least 1876. Let that sink in. It's also a prior stop on the underground railroad and a safe place for gays since at least the early 1960s. Now it's a bar and restaurant with a sort of a small towny, neighborhood feel. Went there for the first time after doing some Christmas shopping at around 5:30p on a Saturday.  The place wasn't busy but there were plenty of obvious regulars. The food isn't fine dining and doesn't try to be. We had chicken fingers,  a burger, onion rings, spring rolls and a couple of Stella Atrois. Everything tasted fine and was prepared well.  The waiter and other staff were super, duper friendly and the other customers were too. The crowd was early 30-somethings and up. The ambience was quiet and the decor was nice. Unusual restroom - most narrow I've ever seen! Hope to try the drag brunch one day soon.
