UPDATE I went there again with a friend...TRY THE SCALLOPS if you dig seafood.  For an appetizer, I had the caramelized melon and Serrano ham.  I'm a HUGE fan of charcuterie and fall instantly in love with well presented cured meat appetizers. One thing which has stood out to me is that since it is a large dining space, the staff can be "on edge."  Though I completely understand, the tightness of the atmosphere does not go well with a sangria.
