Walked in on a Friday night and seriously was seated in 30 seconds. Fast Service, mE and my family had Pork Katsu, Chicken Katsu, and Salmon Katsu and all were amazing! I am not a fan of Curry and this place really smelled like curry that is the only flaw that i have its not really a complain more like a preference im sure some people enjoy the smell of curry all around. the bill was a little under $100 for Midtown i say thats a steal! also the dressing for the cabbage, it is stellar!
