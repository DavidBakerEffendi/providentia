I really love this place for brunch. Decided to try the dinner menu which is wasn't great and here is why I'm giving it a 2 stars. Food: Scallops - Â where cold and hard on the inside. It was basically a soup of butter with salt and a few scallops. Brooklyn calamari- where really hard and rubbery. The red sauce is on top therefore by the time you get to eat it all the bottom is soggy. I recommend the sauce on the side. Decided not to order anything else since the appetizers where bad. Environment It's very loud, more like a bar environment. You basically have to yell out your order and hope the waiter got your order right. Dim lighting for the people who like a more intimate environment. Seats: Comfortable and spacious between tables. There's no elbow to elbow tables like you will usually find in the east village. I would come back for brunch but I'll definitely rule out the loud dinner/bar scene.
