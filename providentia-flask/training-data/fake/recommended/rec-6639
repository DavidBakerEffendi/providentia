Came here with a couple of friends last night. You HAVE to get there early in order to get a table! We still had to wait about 45minutes even though we showed up at 6:30. The staff were, of course, extremely polite and friendly. The ramen was as good as expected, and much more filling. Also, Â they had a noodle salad for my friend who is a vegetarian and couldn't enjoy the pork broth. She liked that. We had no room for dessert, but the table next to us got the Matcha Creme Brulee and it looked amazing. Will be back soon :)
