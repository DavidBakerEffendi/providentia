I came here for my friend's birthday dinner a couple of weeks ago. I trusted the reviews on Yelp that this place would be exactly the kind of place we were looking for. And it was! The small plates (I forgot the name on the menu) that were 4 for $10 were small but delicious. My favorite was the Jerusalem bread. For the entree, I had a dish with eggplant and ground beef. I tried my friend's chicken dishes, which I want to have for myself next time! They seem to have a decent selection of wines, although I am not an expert by any means! We went on a Friday evening and it was relatively quiet and relaxed. Can't wait to come back.
