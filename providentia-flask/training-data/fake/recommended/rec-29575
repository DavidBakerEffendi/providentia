Bello has become our " go to" restaurant when staying close to home. Always good food. Staff is attentive and friendly. Owners always make you feel welcome. Fun to eat at the bar--- always filled with nice locals. Some real characters too, which adds to the experience. And occasionally, an appearance by the guy from Bayonne that put Ali on his butt.
