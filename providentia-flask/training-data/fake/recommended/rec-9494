I usually order in from this place and the food is absolutely fantastic. Chicken is moist, rice is delicious, their sweet plaintains rule and dammit i don't know what that green sauce is called but by god i would kill for it! I would giv ethis place 5 stars but their customer service is pretty bad. I've literally been told by someone on the phone to call back later because the person who usually takes delivery orders stepped away......what? I'll give this place 4 stars only for the food.
