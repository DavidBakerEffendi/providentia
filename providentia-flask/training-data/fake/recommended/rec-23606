The food is great! Very interesting menu, you can taste the freshness.  The service is very good, if you have any questions or want a recommendation definitely ask your server.  They are all very knowledgeable and will work hard to make sure you're happy. Grab a table in the back during the spring/summer and early fall, the view is fantastic and the atmosphere is very relaxing.
