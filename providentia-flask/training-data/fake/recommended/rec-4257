I used to live in pepes backyard...seriously. My house was like 30 ft away so I would get tempted with the smells of baking pizzas all the time. Great pizza, but too hyped. Wanna come on the weekend? Fugetabowdit! You'lls be Waiting for at least an hour. So be patient. Or Try a weekday night instead.
