Go here for breakfast or lunch!  This covered market has 30+ food vendors and offers everything from crepes to Afghan kabobs, to tasty gyros!  You can also get some fresh produce, a beer at the beer garden, sample some amish cooking or get a Grand Marnier truffle!  Looking for fresh fish or lobster?  They've got it!  Want some fresh lasagna or pulled pork?  Yeah, that's here too.  I went around 11:00am on a Wednesday, it was busy, but not crowded like other reviewers have mentioned.  We were able to find seats easily and enjoyed our lunch while listening to a live piano player.  Gotta check this place out if visiting Philly.  It's just a 7 or 8 block walk from the historic district.
