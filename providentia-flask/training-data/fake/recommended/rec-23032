Slightly spendier than the two dollar signs might lead you to believe, but the food was excellent. The crab cake is highly recommended. I had never had Bananas Foster before, so I can't say if theirs is what it's supposed to taste like, but if it isn't it should be. The wait staff was attentive, without being intrusive.
