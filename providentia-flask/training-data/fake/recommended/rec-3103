The place was a little hard to find because it's not near any subway station.  The food there was incredible though.  I was filled up and I was satisfied with my meal.  The reason why it gets three stars is because of its terrible service.  It had a homely feel but not necessary in a good way.  The waitresses were arguing in Spanish on who had to take our table.  The food took so long to arrive and my mom never got her meal.  There wasn't a lot of room to sit so were were a little bunched in.  I think think this is a great place to eat if you just want to take out but not if you want to sit down.
