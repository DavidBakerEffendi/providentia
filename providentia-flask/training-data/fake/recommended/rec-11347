The service here rocks and the food is all right too. I went here for brunch with a group of around 20 or so after skating in the City on Sunday. The staff had setup a row of tables on the patio for us but then realized that we were sitting in the hot sun. The staff then proceeded to drag the row of tables into the shade for us. Kudos for recognizing that we were already hot and sweaty from skating and didn't need to bake another minute in the sun. One waitress took our orders for drinks and brunch and served us with amazing accuracy and speed. She was running her butt off for us and was sweating just as much as we were by the time she delivered all of our meals. My bf and I each tried the bloodies as they were on special. Nothing special but they weren't bad either. I opted for my basic brunch standby of bagel, lox and cream cheese with a side of capers. It was perfect for me. The bf had an omelet and homefries. I noticed he did not eat the homefries. I had a bite of my friends scrambled eggs with mushrooms. They were made with canned mushrooms but I actually happen to like canned mushrooms as much as fresh ones. Overall it was a nice brunch with great service.
