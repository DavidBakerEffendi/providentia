Went here last Saturday for dinner.  The staff is very helpful and attentive.  The food is very high quality and delicious.  It's a great place for a date or for a casual hangout.  I will say that it's a bit odd paying $20 a plate for Mexican food, but it's not their fault, it's just the way of the world in New York City.  Will definately be back.
