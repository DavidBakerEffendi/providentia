I ordered take-out from here and tried the roti and Chow Kueh Teow. The prices are all very reasonable. I loved the roti, the bread was soft yet crispy and the curry sauce it came with had tons of flavor. The noodles were good but nothing out of this world. A decent place to grab some quick Malaysian food. The person who took the order was not the most friendly though.
