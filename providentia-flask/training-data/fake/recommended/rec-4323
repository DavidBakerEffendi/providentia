Food here is generally delicious - some good vegetarian options: avocado wrap, falafel burger. Always interesting and tasty specials. One note to management: either make the "seating instructions" sign larger or enforce the guidelines. The last few times I've visited, I've walked in when there were a couple tables available, ordered food to dine-in, and turned around to see some rude customers behind me had put their sh*t down at the tables before ordering... Not sure if it is my place to inform them.
