My schnitzel was great but let's talk about the burger. I convinced my sister to give me half her burger for half my chicken. Â The schnitzel was crunchy, tasty, and cooked perfectly, along with the super well dressed salad, beets, and mashed potatoes. But the burger! The burger! I have a weird rule that I really only eat a burger a year and this was not the time I had planned for ... But I tried a bite of her burger-especially after I saw how different it looked than anything else I had seen. Then negotiations began for half. So. Completely. Worth. It. Go for the burger if nothing else. But the everything else is pretty fantastic too.
