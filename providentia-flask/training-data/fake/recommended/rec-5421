Holy awesome.  My HUGE beers were $3.50 each, my burger was $6, and all were actually FANTASTIC.  I mean, I'd pay that much for crappy food; I do nearly every day...so when I bit into that tasty, thick, juicy burger I think I had a few moments of shock. My one complaint?  Our table was covered in graffiti.  Literally COVERED.  So my friend and I whipped out some pens and began adding to it, and totally got snapped at by a waiter.  Um, dude - don't like it?  Clean your tables.
