I had some of the best food I've ever eaten at Masala Indian restaurant in downtown Hartford. While it may be a few dollars more per dish than your average Indian restaurant, it is because they prepare each dish from scratch and use all their own ingredients. I dined a few weeks ago with a party of four. We ordered and shared the following items: Lamb Rogan Josh, Shahjahani Murg (chicken), Lamb Boti Masala, and Gujarati Salli Murg (Chicken). Each dish was absolutely incredible and is not only the best Indian food I've ever had, but quite possibly the best food I've ever had.
