I ordered panko-crusted pork chops with a mushroom rosemary sauce. This sounded fantastic on the menu. To my surprise there was no panko-crust. These were clearly just plain grilled chops.  I didn't feel like putting up a stink about it as they were very busy and it wasn't the fault of our waitress. Additionally, the asparagus was way too mature (thick stalks).  The chops didn't seem to be brined and were way overdone. The mashed potatoes were bland, lacking butter and/or cream, and in desperate need of salt. On the plus side, the mushroom rosemary sauce was amazing which made the overdone chops bearable. The service overall was very good. It is also a fantastic location. Just don't have your hopes set to high on the food.  I have no doubt that I will return again. Maybe they just had an off night.
