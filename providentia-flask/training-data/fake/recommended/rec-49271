I'll give it a 3.5 stars overall. Have been here several times with friends and my husband. Service: weekday is fine. Weekends are terribly slow especially with a big group. Food; generous portion but flavor really depends on what plate you ordered. I had had their special brunch called The Miss Dutch which is a pancake souffl√©. I really don't like the heavy chemical taste in that cherry jam, it makes me think of the cheapest birthday cake. Price: as the most famous and fancy brunch restaurant, the price seems fine while you enjoyed the cozy atmosphere. But somehow you need to watch your budget. Probably will come only if a friend invited you to come!
