We came for dinner on a Saturday evening and Megan was our waitress. All we can say is...great dinner! It exceeded our expectations, and they were high. The hummus was the best we have had, and sampling the variety of mezas (small dishes), even the brussell spouts were yums! The duck shwarma was delicious! A great meal!
