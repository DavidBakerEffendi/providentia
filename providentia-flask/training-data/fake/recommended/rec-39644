I loved Alta. My sister was visiting from DC and we wanted to go to a tapas bar to get drinks and some food to snack on. This place was perfect! It is adorable inside! We sat upstairs on the cool little balcony that overlooks the downstairs dining area. We ended up ordering entirely too many tapas for two people lol but it was fun to try everything! Everything was delicious! My sister has a gluten allergy (womp womp) but we were still able to order a ton of yummy tapas (sans gluten) and I didn't even have to complain because everything was still delicious! I will definitely be back to Alta. Maybe with my boyfriend next time. Definitely a good date spot.
