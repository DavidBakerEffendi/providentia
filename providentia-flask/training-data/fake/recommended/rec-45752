This place opened very recently. It looks clean and cute with a few tables to sit down. The menu offers a lot of different choices like burgers, fish and chips, platters, salads, even home made desserts. I didn't know what to order and they recommended wafcos, tortillas made of waffle batter with meat and veggies inside. We had a pork belly wafco and a brisket wafco. Wow! They were so good. The thin waffle was crispy and melting in my mouth. The beef and the pork belly were tender and tasty. The pickled veggies had right amount of sourness and crunches. A few slices of jalapeño left some spicy flavor in my mouth, which I liked. The home made cheesecake with apricot topping was also perfect to finish our good meal. The quality of food for the price definitely beat my expectation.  I'm definitely coming back for wafcos and try other dishes on the menu.
