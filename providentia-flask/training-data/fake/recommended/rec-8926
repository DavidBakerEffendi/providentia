We started off the dinner with the lobster soup and the porkbelly. Both were tasty. Then came the second courses, the trofie nero and ravioli. The ravioli was just ok, but the trofie nero (squid ink pasta) was really good, easily the best thing I had that night. I wish I could have eaten that for every course. Main courses were the cod and the venison. Venison was decent, the cod was mehh. As for the desserts, nothing sounded very appealing, so I went with the olive oil cake because it sounded interesting. And it was ok. The other dessert I tried was kinda blah, something with dark chocolate in it, I forget. Overall, the dinner was good, but with those prices, it left something to be desired. If I'm going to spend that much, I'd rather go to Daniel or something. It's still better than your average restaurant, hence the 4 stars, but I expected a little more.
