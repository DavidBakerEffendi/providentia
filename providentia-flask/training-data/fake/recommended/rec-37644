This review isn't about the food, but simply the service. My girlfriend and I went here to have a cocktail at the bar, because we heard they were great. Because it's an open kitchen, the chef served us. It's weird that they have the chef take the role as a server as well. As soon as he heard we weren't getting food, he left us alone for something like 15 minutes before we had to flag him down to order something. When we did order drinks, we noticed he didn't put them in immediately. "You're not eating ANYTHING?" he asked again, and walked away. Finally, we placed an order with another woman who worked there, who was really nice. The chef wasn't busy at some point and just gave us the cold shoulder when we did inquire about the food. Kind of a dick move. Also, because of the seating arrangement and poor ventilation in that place, we left smelling really bad. Not coming back here again.
