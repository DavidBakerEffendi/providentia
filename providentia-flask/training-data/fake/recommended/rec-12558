Great cafe in between midtown and central park. I live and work nearby so was surprised to know there is a cafe serving Stumptown so close. The baristas are not quite on the same level as The Ace Hotel, but they get the job done. The cashier was extremely friendly and welcoming and their pastries were quite good. The interior is pretty big with ample seating, plugs, and a bathroom. So needless to say I'll be back with my laptop over the weekend to see what kind of vibe they have.
