YUM! So glad this place finally opened its doors! While there is no shortage of wonderful Vietnamese Sandwich shops in the East Village, this place has already won me over in 3 ways: 1. Deliciousness: their classic bbq pork sandwich... I'm no banh mi connoisseur, but I could definitely eat that every day. 2. Service: the owners are SO friendly. 3. Location: super close to my apt. Now if only they served pho too... Regardless, I'm so glad they came to my neighborhood!
