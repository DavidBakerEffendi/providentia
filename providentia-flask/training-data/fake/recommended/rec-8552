I was, quite honestly, expecting a lot from this place based on the Yelp reviews.  We arrived around 5:30 on a Friday afternoon, so we didn't have much trouble getting seating.  Space is definitely tight, with minimal maneuvering room between tables for the waitstaff.  We weren't too put off by the fact that it was a byob, since we're not big drinkers. First off, We both thought the service was only so-so.  Our waiter did at least warn us that the pizza dough had duck fat in it (fiancée is vegetarian) and was semi-helpful about the veggie options. We were surprised by the lack of vegetarian options.  After pointing out the wine shop, the wait did not offer any alternative beverages.  His attention to our water level was laid back, to put it politely.  And on our way out, I was almost run over by a staffer delivering food to a table. The food portions are small.  For the amount that you pay, they could be more generous with the entrees.  My fiancée thought her pasta was good, while I was disappointed that the lamb seemed mostly fat and was salty to boot. All in all, I was glad to go because he is an Iron Chef after all.  But I wouldn't repeat the experience and I left feeling like I'd been overcharged for average food.
