i'm a huge fan of maialino and would eat here everyday if i could. it really captures the simplicity yet flavors of true roman food, and the decor makes the space inviting with a down to earth feel. the pastas are amazing (i am fond of the carbonara or spaghetti with clams). Â the tripe is really good, coda, fried artichoke, salumi, bread is definitely better than in rome, pinenut torte, cappuccino... and of course try and share the maialino!
