Awesome little spot that I walked by more then a few times before stopping in. Had The Hatfield wrap, which contains hot roast beef, swiss, onions and horseradish served with an arugula salad. Everything was fresh and tasty, and we got a very awesome preserves/cheese stuff pastry at the end. Can't wait to eat here again!
