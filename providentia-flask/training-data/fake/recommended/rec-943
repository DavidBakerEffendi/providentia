Let's put it this way. It is not authentic at all. (at the same time I saw some Indian customers - couples and families). Yes, smb here called it upscale. It is upscale in American terms. But is it Indian? No masala chai? It is fusion and it is delicious. The food presentation is great. Got tiny quail (wasn't impressed),  fancy samosa, saag paneer (spinach with cheese) Yumm, and carrot cake.  (Saag panner was the best item I got). They charge extra for rice. The service is really great: fast, super polite and high-energy.  The ambiance is nice. Don't remember if there was any music. The unisex restroom  confuses customers at first, but the design of it is really high-end.. The price for all of it was about $70
