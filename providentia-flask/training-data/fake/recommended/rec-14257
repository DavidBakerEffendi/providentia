*Warning: the following review contains within one sentence a mixed metaphor of two separate, seminal but completely unrelated movies (in period and genre).* Sometimes I am something of a restaurant ranger, studying the lore, tracking the trends and hunting down the most elusive table.  New York is the ultimate culinary wilderness, a target-rich environment for my Strider-esque gastronomy.  And on previous excursions I have given due diligence to researching the best places to eat, via Yelp and certain offline print publications anachronistic on account of their non-electronic medium.  Some call them magazines. And then there's Mamoun's, the place I wandered by, wandered into, and was completely mindblown by.  Seriously, after eating I wanted to write an 80's butt-rock ballad to their babaganoush but instead, i just went back there every day for the rest of my trip.
