Went to becco, enjoyed it enough and think it is a fine establishment for italian food, especially in the neighborhood in which it resides. Almost everyone at the table I was at went with the pasta sampler, which i got to..sample from.  I thought it seemed decent, but not amazing.  I decided to get the polenta with mushrooms for my appetizer and lemon chicken for my main course.  All in all I would give the food 3 stars.   The service we had was really good, the restaurant setting is nice and the prices are not so crazy.  I'm a fan of Lidia's show and for this I say 4 stars.
