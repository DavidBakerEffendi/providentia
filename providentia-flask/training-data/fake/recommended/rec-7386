TLDR: Great food, great prices, posh, but yet casual This place is definitely in my top 2 list of Thai places. I'm picky as I've grown up on this food all my life and there are things I ordered to see how good the restaurants are. One of those items is papaya salad. Sometimes I order something that's different, but that I would know what it is. A lot of people order pad thai, but I haven't really seen anyone mess that one up. My friend got the pad thai (he'd never had thai before and I told him that was a good place to start). He loved it and finished off his place. I got the roasted chicken with rice and sweet chili sauce with a side of spinach. The chicken was fall off the bone good. The papaya salad was 2 thumbs up.
