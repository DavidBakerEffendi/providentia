First of all i must mention that they have my fave beer from my Philly days: Witte! I was so happy to see it that it alone will be reason for going back. Friend and I debated getting the All you can eat deal but neither of us could eat more than a pot of mussels so instead we split the $20 moules frites (with tomato/basil). It was good, def some hearty mussels and plenty to fill us up! Warning: Creme Caramel dessert = flan. Apparently the waitress has never heard of flan so she had a super hard time describing what it was when we asked. I'm going with the creme brulee next time!
