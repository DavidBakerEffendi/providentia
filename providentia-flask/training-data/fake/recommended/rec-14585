I'm with Alan T.! I came here on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend with my friend who was visiting from CA, and we only had to wait about 20 minutes to get in around 11:30 a.m. (I guess being one of the few suckers stuck in the city during a 3-day weekend has its advantages!) I ordered the miso ramen and my friend ordered the karaka miso ramen (spicy version). The noodles were cooked well, the pork was incredibly tender (and there was lots of it!), and the service was good, but for me the broth didn't quite measure up to nyc rival, Totto. The broth was too thick/pork-y (and my friend said the same thing!).  The ambiance in Ippudo is much nicer but when I'm going out to eat, flavor is the first (only?) priority!   If you are rolling with a large crowd, then this is probably your place. If you're just grabbing a meal with one or two folks (or a larger number of foodies) and don't mind enjoying your meal in a hole-in-the-wall, then head over to Totto for ramen with more delicious broth.
