I like this place. I've been twice and have never been disappointed with the food. It's tapas, so it can get kind of expensive. But I think the unique combinations are pretty good. It's good, but something about it isn't completely overwhelming. A good date restaurant for sure. The bacon popcorn is pretty awesome, and the standard plates are pretty good. I believe the ice cream dessert changes periodically and I recall it being good both times. Overall solid, but something is missing that doesn't quite push it over the top for me.
