Went here for my bday with a couple of friends. Tuome is a good restaurant but not really terribly different from a decent Chinese restaurant.  We started off with drinks at the bar-unfortunately, they don't carry liquor so they didn't have cocktails.  However, their wines are excellent and reasonably priced. We moved onto appetizers where we got the octopus, the mushrooms and the deviled eggs. The octopus was awesome-totally worth the price. The deviled eggs were an interesting spin on regular deviled eggs-the eggs white is breaded and deep-fried, adding a crunchy texture and richer taste. However, they didn't taste particularly Chinese to me. The mushrooms were also good and perhaps the most Chinese tasting IMO of the appetizers. We ordered the chicken, short ribs, scallops and a vegetarian dish for our main course. The chicken was pretty forgettable-it didn't taste Chinese at all until you ate the charred lettuce (I wish there had been more of that). The scallops and the vegetarian dishes were decent but the short ribs were excellent, tender and tasting of star anise. Beignets rounded out our evening-they were decent but I couldn't see the connection between them and Chinese cuisine. Definitely a decent restaurant. Would I come back given the price point?  Probably not-I could eat just as well for much cheaper at a regular Chinese place. It's a pity because I feel that the chef is restraining himself from a bolder menu-hopefully, he decides to amp it up (perhaps add flavor points from different regional Chinese cuisines?) and really accentuate Chinese flavors.
