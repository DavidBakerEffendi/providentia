pluses - great ambiance, unique location, appetizers  7/10 (radishes and cauliflower the highlights), minuses - poor service, waited 30min for first drinks, then 1 hr between appetizers and entrees, entrees 3/10 (halibut meagre slop , but  artichoke, lamb just decent) previously visited here , sat at bar for appetizers and cocktails (8/10)  and the service was good) , so they've dropped the ball on 2nd visit
