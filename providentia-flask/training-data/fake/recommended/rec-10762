AH! Sophie's! We just moved into our new office recently and I'm so so so glad we did! Sophie's is right around the corner and I had the time to check it out this past week. It's absolutely delicious! I love love love Pio Pio and this is basically a cheaper, fast food type version of Pio Pio. They have that special green sauce. SO GOOD! I love it! I came here on a Friday for lunch and they had daily specials. I had the seafood in cuban sauce with rice and beans. Each special gets 2 sides. The rice was ON POINT and the beans were so so. Pio Pio's beans were much better. I like them soft and drenched in sauce. The seafood was amazing. I can't wait to try everything else. I had my meal with a papaya shake. That was good too. It's a fast food place with dine in service tables in the back. Super casual. Definitely coming back for more!
