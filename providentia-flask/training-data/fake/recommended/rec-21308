This is my favorite restaurant, and is the only meal that I reminisce about multiple days later.  After my first dinner here, I ate a deli sandwich for lunch the next day and went into a slight depression.  You can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu, but I would highly recommend going heavy on the Santa Barbara uni, both nigiri and hand rolls.  Yasuda gets his nori at a special auction, and it definitely shows because the uni hand roll is the best thing I've had in my life so far.
