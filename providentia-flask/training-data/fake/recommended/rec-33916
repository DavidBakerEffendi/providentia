The shop is somewhat unmarked, but the people working inside are great... Love the bread, it has the appropriate crunch and lightness needed for good banh mi-- however, I found the pork to be a little over salted... Too much hoisin sauce in the marinade. I also would like to have seen the pickled vegetables a bit crunchier and sliced jalape√±o is always a nice touch. I do like the Viet coffee here too, not too sweet.
