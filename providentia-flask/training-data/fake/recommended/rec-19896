I did the tasting menu and loved every dish. Â The husband-wife team stopped by our table (as they do for all guests), which made the place seem more intimate and special. Their passion for food is evident. The level of service is extremely high and the staff was top-notch. Portions are on the small side and the space is a little cramped, but I left more than satisfied.
