really nothing special about this place or the sandwiches      Not bad but I really don't understand the hype add in the long lines and piss poor service with the tons of tacky pictures of who must be Geno with celebrities and it left me a little angry that I ate here or maybe it was all the somewhat racist stickers all I did like their sandwich better than Pat's though
