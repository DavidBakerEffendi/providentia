It's strange, but it feels like the people at Buttermilk Channel really want you to eat at their restaurant. I've gotten so used to the irritated staff at other new places around Brooklyn who make you feel like you've really got a lot of nerve coming to THEIR restaurant and asking THEM to serve YOU. Really, the people were great, especially the host who had endless patience with our shrinking/expanding group and made us feel very welcome and non-nuisancey. Inviting people and atmosphere aside, a few things stood out: Vegetarian menu! They have one! Like a kid's menu but more fun! So liberating. Salt! The only times I usually notice salt is when there's too much. Here, I noticed flake salt and kosher salt and smokey salt. Each dish had salt that complemented its ingredients. Cranberry, bean and fennel stew. This is slow-food Brooklyn dining at its best. It's a thoughtful dish with the tartness of cranberries and a touch of coolness (spearmint?). Really amazing.
