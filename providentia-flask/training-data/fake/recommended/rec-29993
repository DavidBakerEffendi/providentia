I thought I liked this place, well, not any more. On my most recent visit, my friend got sick from the food and although I didn't feel particularly obnoxious from the food, I wasn't impressed either. The seats were uncomfortable and there was little room to move around. The service was a total disaster. Pretty sure I wouldn't come back again.
