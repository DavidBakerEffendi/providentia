I live in Westville so when I feel like eating out I often go here. There are a LOT of TVs, and a huge projector screen, all showing all the sports games everywhere. The menu is vast, and I've never had anything bad. The staff is all friendly (there's one bartender I usually get who is awesome everytime). There is a great vibe through this bar, I always have a nice time, whether watching a game or just hiding from the New England weather. It's a total sports bar. All I can say about the beer selection is that it's perfect for a sports bar (but they carry New England Brewery's beers, a great thing). It's also never really a hassle getting a seat at the bar. People come and go, and everyone is generally polite and will offer a seat or at least scootch over for you.
