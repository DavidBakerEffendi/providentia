We recently moved to the area and had a terrific date night there recently. We split an order of edamame I ordered the cucumber sushi and my boyfriend and I split the Passyunk Avenue Roll Shrimp Tempura with spicy Crabmeat  which was fantastic! It's BYOB so that's always a plus, and the service was quick and friendly. We made a reservation ahead of time, which I always recommend. What's great too is Capogiro is right around the corner and can provide a great dessert to end the evening. I'm excited to try this place for lunch and their Bento box soon! Pros: -delicious food, reasonably priced -the restaurant had a nice feeling to it -service was pretty excellent Cons: -restaurant is a little small so unless you're planning ahead, I'd advise groups with  more than 4 guests to call a day in advanced to arrange a table situation.
