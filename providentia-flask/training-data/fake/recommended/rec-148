Nice little place. My girlfriend and I arrived right before closing on a Friday night. Very skeptical from the start but this restaurant did the trick. We each had sushi and it was pretty decent. The service was rather mediocre however the hostess lady was extremely pleasant and even offered my gf a complimentary ice cream just as the restaurant was supposed to be closing. I think there's something to be said about friendly business like that. I'd love to give them 4 stars however the food just wasn't 4 star quality.
