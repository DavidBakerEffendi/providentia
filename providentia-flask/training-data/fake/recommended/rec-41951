I wanted to love this, I really did. In fact, I've been waiting to eat here since I heard about it in June. The meal was definitely good - but I didn't love anything, and it was pricey and the plates were small. The ambiance was awesome outside though - definitely a great place for drinks. I had the cucumber melon soup, virginia bass, and chocolate dessert. I was expecting everything to be more inspired. In truth, I was comparing it to the Farm and the Fisherman. My advice? Go here for a drink, and then grab a bottle of vino and head over to the Farm and the Fishermah for inspired, local, farm to table food.
