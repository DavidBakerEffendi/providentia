Wow. I went here for breakfast for the first time this weekend and the salmon crepe was beyond amazing. Â Then I tried what my boyfriend ordered (a muscle crepe) and that was even MORE amazing somehow. Prices were very reasonable for the quality, ($9) but maybe a bit too much to be a regular breakfast place to visit. I'll be back to try out this place in the Summer when the outdoor section is open.
