What can't i say about Frankford Hall, this is one of the best bars in the city because it offers you so many ways to enjoy yourself. Lets start with the beer, mostly a German selection and you can get yourself a liter or half liter. You cannot go wrong with either one, but unless you can slam back beer i'd suggest the half pint. Happy prices are the way to go, but it's not much more if you don't make it there in time.    Now in terms of entertainment, this place has plenty. Most of the bar is outdoors, a la a german beer hall, in addition there is a few ping pong tables and a few table soccer games as well, not to mention all the dominos and jenga you can handle. This place is just wonderful if you have a big group of friends looking to have a awesome night. Also sometimes they have firepits going and you can buy s'mores kits for like $1. Just do yourself a favor and go
