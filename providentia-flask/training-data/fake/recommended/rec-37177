GROUSE. What the hell??? Did I miss something??? I was expecting AMAZING since reviews were fantastic.... Ordered the pulled noodles and had an order of dumplings (dumplings were pretty good). But the noodles?? You must be kidding. And the restaurant is pretty disgusting. They need to clean up the tables and the condiments..... Water has no lid and it seems its been out for a long time... Esp since summer is coming around I am sure that will be a great spot for little flying buggerssss. No thanks.
