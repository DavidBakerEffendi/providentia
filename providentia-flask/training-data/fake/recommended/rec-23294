My favorite restaurant in Philadelphia so far. I was blown away the first time I visited Little Fish for their Sunday tasting menu and was equally pleased on my second visit here. They manage to throw in elements of surprise into every dish.... and of course, the best part about their food is that they do not over-use salt. On my first visit, I had cauliflower soup with scallop seared to perfection, and it was topped with red pepper chili sauce and roasted black garlic. Pure perfection. They Â served mackerel with chicken liver and pistachio as the main dish and again, it was simply excellent. This amazing dinner ended with coffee and carrot cake laced with sugared carrot slices.... On my second visit, they served potato soup with seared scallop. It was somewhat stylistically similar to the cauliflower soup I had before, but here they topped the scallop with pickled mustard seed to balance the blandness. I can't remember what fish they served as the main dish but it was excellent, and as one of the reviewers noted, they do serve their fish slightly rare (which is no problem for me) but if you want yours well-done, I am sure you can ask for it. For the dessert, they served cherry pistachio ice cream and yum! I do have one negative comment to make. The server that served us on the first night was very attentive, describing each dish in a clear voice, and never getting in your way. However, the server from the second night was somewhat disoriented.. and even seemed annoyed. Other than that, I have nothing else to say :) ah, it's BYOB and you should probably make a reservation 2 weeks in advance. The place is tiny and the space fills up pretty fast.
