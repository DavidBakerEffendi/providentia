Decent food, but the service we got was a little careless and the menu seems a bit overpriced. I had been really excited to visit Sorella since I'm a diehard devotee of Neapolitan style pizza, but then the specials menu caught my eye. (Truffle and wild mushroom risotto with a prosecco reduction? Sold!). Unfortunately, the waitress put in the wrong order for me and I received the regular menu chicken and mushroom risotto instead - still tasty, and a big portion, but I had really been looking forward to that special! And unfortunately (again), that was the highlight of the meal. We also ordered the fried mozzarella with anchovy caper butter (really good cheese, but a little too fishy for me and the portion was tiny for the $8 price, and the waitress cleared away my dinner fork and didn't bring me a new one so I ate my entree with my salad fork. : / ). My husband got the chicken/arugula/cheese ravioli, which he enjoyed (and he doesn't generally like arugula, so the filling must have been pretty good), except for the fact that he only got three ravioli for $18. To our waitress' credit, she tried to make up for the risotto error by giving us dessert on the house, and we shared the cherry affogato. The gelato had a nice fresh fruit flavor, but the chocolate sauce it came with was gummy and the espresso poured over the top was way too bitter for me. On the positive side, the restaurant has a nice cozy atmosphere with a warm and rustic yet modern decorating scheme. And there's the wood fired pizza oven at the back of the restaurant, and it's fun to glimpse over to see pizzas being made. I'd love to see Sorella thrive (I have lamented for years that there's no good Neapolitan pizza joint in downtown Hartford, spoiled as I was by having Punch Pizza in my hometown) so I'm determined to give it another chance and go back for the pizza.
