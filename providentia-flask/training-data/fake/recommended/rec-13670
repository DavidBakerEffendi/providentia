There were 3 of us and we waited for 30 minutes on Friday 2pm. I cant imagine the wait time on a weekend morning.  We ordered the eggs florentine with smoked salmon, blueberry pancakes and an egg omelete.  The eggs florentine with smoked salmon was pretty good, the pancake was good too. The egg omelete was not bad but nothing to brag about. It was just normal. Considering we had to wait 30 mins and extremely hungry, this place is overrated. After we ordered our food, we were waiting for an hour to get our food. Basically, in order for the food to arrive, the total wait time was 1.5 hours, WTH??? This is breakfast cafe, not nobu or morriomoto?? After eating, we all felt neauseatic. We were like it tasted fine while we were eating it, afterwards, we all felt like sh*t. Why? Probably because it has tons of button and unhealthy animal fat. yuck. My favorite about this experience - biscuit, smoked salmon would i go back again? probably NOT. The bill was $70 for 3 of us. Not worth for breakfast food that makes us feel nasty afterwards. We all wanted to throw up that type of feeling.
