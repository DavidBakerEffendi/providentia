Something about crappy diner food appeals to me... Maybe I have been living in Jersey for too long.  You get the usual diner selection, heavy smoking friendly waitresses and obnoxious late night crowd at most diners. I always overhear the most ridiculous conversations if I'm here an night.  Their pancakes are really good but I wouldn't say "World's best" as they claim. For the best pancakes around head to Brownstone Diner in downtown Jersey City, but at least this one is open late and you can still get your fix.   I have tried a lot of things from here and most of the food is pretty good.  This is my go to diner if I need a place within close proximity.
