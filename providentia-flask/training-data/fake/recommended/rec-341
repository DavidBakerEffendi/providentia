Whenever I have someone visit me from out of town, I bring them here. The staff is great. Very friendly and attentive. The menu is amazing. Lots of variety, fresh tasting, savory, and not too expensive. They have specials on the sangria (many kinds) and a large beer list. I've gone without a reservation, but it takes a second to make one through this site. Even the olive oil they give you with the free bread is delicious, and I loove olive oil.
