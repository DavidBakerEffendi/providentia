Came here with a group of friends after my birthday dinner.  The place is cool! The music is great, and the drinks were not watered down at all.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but it was over crowded a bit and we left early to go to another venue, due to the magnitude of people.  Not that a crowded bar is bad, because that usually means they are doing something right, but to me, I think the person taking cover needs to keep track a bit better of how many people are there. Speaking of the doorman, he was fabulous, and didn't charge me cover since it was my birthday. Later as I was out smoking, he struck up a conversation with me, and was very pleasant to be around.  I will be back again, but maybe perhaps not on a Saturday night. Love love love the funky decor in there, and the crowd of people were kick back and friendly, which I love.  Hubby liked the table in the back that were making a pyramid out of PBR cans, and even donated a can to the project. Ha ha!  We did not eat here, but, I did ask a few people about the food, and they said it was fabulous food here. Will def have to come back for some grindage.
