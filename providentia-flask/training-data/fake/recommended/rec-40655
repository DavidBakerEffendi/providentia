I can truly say I had a great experience and the food was pretty decent. We started with a couple of apetizers -- cheese 'somethings' and potato nachos 'something' - Sorry that I forgot the exact names.  However, they both were good.  My party then moved on to the main course, I had the jambalaya, a little spicy but quite apetizing. My hubby had the chicken and waffles, it was too bad but he didn't enjoy the gravy. He asked for it on the side which was smart. The rest of my party all tried something different, and there weren't too many complaints. I remember someone saying that the spaghetti and meatballs were a little bland. However, our favorite part was the Rum Punch, it was very refreshing. Bon Apetit ~ RM
