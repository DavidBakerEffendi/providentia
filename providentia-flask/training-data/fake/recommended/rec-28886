I have never seen a place with such amazing customer service! The employees here are spectacular. I went here last night for our anniversary and the server explained how everything worked. Our glasses were always filled with water. Employees came to our table to see how things were going, if we wanted any special kinds of meats to come over, and to see if we had any questions. One of the staff members even gave our ticket to the valet while we were getting ready to leave. The staff just goes above and beyond. The food there is amazing, the chicken melts in your mouth. There is an extensive salad and hot food bar. Since it was our anniversary the manager sent us over a piece of flan, while I usually do not enjoy flan, this was by far the best flan I have ever tasted! It was my first time here and I will come back without hesitation!
