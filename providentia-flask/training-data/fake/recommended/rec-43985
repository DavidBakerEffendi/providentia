Can you say Max's Paella????? The Gigantic Shrimps that come in the appetizer plate are also a treat! I can honestly say that I have not seen Shrimp that big!!! I was there this past week and the only thing that I found almost unbareable was the temperature outside in the high "TEENS"...I guess this West Coast (SF) kid is not used to freezing weather!!! Overall, if you find yourself in Farmington, CT, you have to make your way to Max's! Great Ambiance and Super Good Seafood! Off too my next trip!
