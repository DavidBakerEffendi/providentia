Oh wonderful, another over priced, useless restaurant in Princeton.! The quality of the food (unless you are getting a burger or sandwich--which you don't need to go to a place like this for) is just terrible.  My dish was bland, over cooked, and drowning in some weird sauce. My 8 year old nephew can cook a better dish!! For the prices this place charges, they really need to step it up in the quality and taste of the food. you can not act like it is an upscale restaurant and make mediocre food. Just not acceptable! I am so tired of the same restaurants opening up in Princeton just to be disappointed every time i try the food. I would not waste the time or money and find another place to eat at.  I also thought the beer selection was really poor and so were the drinks.
