Russet is a comfortable, warm space with a wooden interior that is cozy mix of old and new decor. With a menu that changes everyday, you may not know what's for dinner but you can count on it being fantastically delicious, fresh and creative. Top it off with phenomenal service (including BYOB) and Russet hits the trifecta! Two pieces of advice: 1. Make a reservation. 2. Ask for the homemade hot sauces (one is a jam-like spicy/sweet situation that is great with eggs but I'd imagine other things as well - the other is more in line with Tabasco but is at least one hundred times more substantive/tastier).
