This place is all hype. After hearing so much about the famous Pat's and Geno's, our group of out-of-towners trudged to this dirty and dodgy part of Philly for some reputedly delicious cheese steaks. And it is convenient if you'd like to sample them both at the same time to see which is better, cos they are right across from one another. The cheesesteaks are huge. But they just taste average. NOT WORTH our trouble looking for this place- it;s quite far from everything else. Seriously, just go to Jim's Steak on South Street. And the people here are not friendly. And NO BATHROOMS! I needed to go pretty badly and NONE of the shops around here would let me use theirs. how rude. (hence the 1 star)NEVER coming back.
