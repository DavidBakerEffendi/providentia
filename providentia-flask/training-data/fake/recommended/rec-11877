I loved this place! My friends and I arrived early on a Thursday, around 6:00, so there was no trouble getting a table. (They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more) When we left around 8:00 the dining room was almost full and the bar was hopping! The food is a little on the expensive side, so I would probably come back here just to go to the bar, because the place itself is so nicely lit and decorated. We tried four of the drinks, and the Sweet Ginger Brown was our favorite. I was hoping the Apricot Ginger Smash would be a delight, but the Maker's in it overpowered all the other flavors, so I felt like I was just sipping on whiskey (unless I got a piece of ginger which was potent enough to clear my sinuses). The food was quite good. Between the three of us we split two appetizers, two main dishes and a side of brussel sprouts and it was the perfect amount of food. Our favorite by far was the beef wellington - the meat was perfectly cooked (rare but not bloody) and served with magical potatoes and a little gravy. It's pretty expensive at $28 but it far outshined the pork faggot (also good but not flavorful enough). All in all it was a fun place, and though I couldn't bring myself to order the haggis, I think we got the full Scottish experience.
