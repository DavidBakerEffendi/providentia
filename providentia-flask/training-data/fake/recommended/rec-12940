This is where I go when I only have a dollar to my name and I can't take anything out of my bank account because the rent check hasn't cleared (get with it, management company). The dumplings are always tasty and their pork buns are pretty great. For a buck, you get four dumplings and they're pretty filling. (Unless you're a glutton like me and you scrounge up another dollar to get an additional four.) It's a small place and the decor is next to nil, but that's not important. It's all about the dumplings.
