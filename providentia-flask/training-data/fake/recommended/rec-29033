Best for dessert. I went to Max Brenner with a few friends for restaurant week and we had a less then stellar dinner. Half of our meals came out on schedule and the other half were served an hour later- after we asked for our waitress to bring them out. They seemed like they weren't able to handle to volume of patrons for restaurant week . The food was ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't head back here unless it was for dessert or to get a chocolate injection as a gift.
