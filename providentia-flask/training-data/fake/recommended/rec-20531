I wanted to come here because I saw how Guy Fieri thinks this place is bomb.. I ordered the handpulled noodle soup with oxtail and an assortment of other meats. The noodles were really good. Nice and chewy and tasted fresh. But the other ingredients were not nearly up to par. I also had their knife-cut noodle stir fry with shrimp and chicken. This was a lot better than the noodle soup. Lots of flavor, big shrimp, and the veggies added some crunch to the dish. The place is really small/cramped so might not be the best place to hangout with friends...i.e. eat and go type of thing. Service was friendly.
