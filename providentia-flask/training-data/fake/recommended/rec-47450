I heard many good things about Ippudo and it was said there's always a long line to prove that. Ippdo was fanciest noodle place I've ever been to with dark red lighting. The food turned out to be overly hyped. It's not bad noodles but disappointing after expecting the real thing. Go here if you want to wait 3 hours for $16 bowl of a-ok noodles. They do have a cool ramen bar with 2 for 1 draft beer specials.
