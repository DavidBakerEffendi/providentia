Was here today around 7pm cause I was straving for a nice juicy burger and my coworker recomemend this place.  It was definitely worth the 15 min wait. The place was small, packed, and filled with a couple of flat screen TVs.  I ordered the bistro burger and my friend got the cheese burger; no fries (trying to watch my figure) and a coors light.  Yum!
