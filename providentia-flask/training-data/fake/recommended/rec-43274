Found this place on yelp while on a road trip and was a worthwhile stop. Between the four of us we tried the Sanchez, Chicken Parm, Chicken Pachanga, and the Middle Finger. Seems as if the Sanchez is very popular and it sure was good (especially the sauce!). The Chicken Parm was really messy (AND yummy), and given there isn't seating in this place other than a few benches outside, as long as you have a handful of napkins you'll be fine. The other two were both specials and very unique. The hot sauce on the Pachango was perfect. We shared some Mac 'n Cheese bites which were basically Kraft Mac 'n Cheese fried up nice and good. Didn't hate it. :) I was pretty impressed with the quick service and surprisingly, the selection of canned and bottles drinks - very unique sodas, teas, etc. Overall, we're all very happy with our decision to stop here on the way through Princeton - quite the gem.
