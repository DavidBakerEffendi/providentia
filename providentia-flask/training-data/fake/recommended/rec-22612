Pretty decent spot for brunch in one of the more hidden spots in the 'burg. The space is really cool with lots of natural light and open space. It's also great for large groups. The menu has some solid items including the chicken and waffles and steak and eggs. Please DO NOT get the fritatta because it is terrible. Even the hash browns and toast that came with it were also blah. The side salad was great but very small. Three of us got it and all I can say is that it had been reheated a bunch of times and was plain gross. Some weird things though were that none of the waffle people ever got any syrup, people with toast were only offered butter even though they have jams and no decaf coffee. I also think they should offer side items. Everyone at our table wanted one but they wouldn't do it. Splitting up items and having substitutes seemed a bit too complicated for the kitchen. You all would probably make more money if you did. The coffee was also good as it should be for $3 a cup. All in all a decent place and we were never rushed. Just please get the chicken and waffles and make sure you get your syrup and you won't be disappointed.
