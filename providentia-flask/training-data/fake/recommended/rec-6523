Went there for Loco Tuesday, which was an excellent life choice.  The tapas were ridiculously good, especially for half off.  We shared a half pitcher of sangria (amazing), the plantanos rellenos (THE BEST THING YOU WILL EVER EAT), guac and chips (good), the steak taquitos (amazing flavor) and the vegetarian arepas (definitely okay, but skip it).  The total for all this food and drink, that we could not even finish? $40. That plus a great atmosphere, a wonderful server, and fun music = five stars!
