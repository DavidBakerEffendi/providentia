Does my review even matter here? Does Grimaldi's REALLY need another fan??   I don't care! I LOVE IT!! I must say, I went into this pizza joint (after a nearly 45-minute wait on the sidewalk outside - on a summer day, no less) as a skeptic.  People rant and rave about this pizzeria all the time.  It's almost like I put off the taste test for 2 years because I was tired of hearing about it all the time!  But boy am I grateful for this taste test, as the pizza is more than another Brooklyn brick oven: It's real. It's tradition. It's New York.   Also helps that you can get a cold Brooklyn Lager for $3.  : ) Brought my parents here and it was another Italian challenge (see my Luna Rossa review) that passed the test. We were lucky to have a big group who, after ordering lots of "halves", was able to taste a variety of different pizza and toppings.  My favorite are the olives - same flavor and quality that my own grandfather generously lays atop his homemade Molese focaccia. Top (and digest!) your meal with a walk across the Brooklyn bridge.  And be proud to be a New Yorker.  = )
