This place is perfect for a date night! It's a small little restaurant (as many New York restaurants go) but the food is big on taste. My girlfriend is vegetarian, and I'm a huge meat eater, so a tapas restaurant was perfect for us. We got the Arroz Murciano (vegetarian paella) that had great flavor. The restaurant has a cute back seating area that is outdoors but has branches/leaves that line the top to make it feel indoors. If you need a good spot for a dinner date, go here!
