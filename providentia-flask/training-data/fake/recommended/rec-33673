I wanted to get inexpensive food and rode my bike down to a place that ended up not being open on Sunday. Too hungry to get back on my bike and go somewhere else, I walked down the street a bit and came across Da Mikele. Sadly, the place was not very busy. Or happily. Ultimately, it was a great choice. The music was good, easy-on-the-ears; reminiscent of the mix at Soho Grand. I ordered a brunch special that came with a drink. I had poached eggs in tomato sauce and a mimosa for a total of $10 plus tax. In spite of the dish having over 200 mg of cholesterol among its 4 eggs, I scooped out most of the yolks and enjoyed the rest with the delicious and fresh, homemade-tasting sauce, fresh foccacia and olive oil in a can straight from Italy. It was quiet, pleasant, delicious, and easy on the pocket. Highly recommend.
