So I came here on a Monday for lunch at around 12pm. There were going to be 3 of us, I was the first to arrive to had to wait for the other 2 to get there before we could even be put on the waiting list for lunch. Totally understand, people can be flakey! I work in the hospitality industry at the moment. While I was waiting for my friends to arrive, I was observing the actions of the staff at the cafe. Noticed the waitresses were great, very approachable, nice and very friendly. Found the hostess, Australian girl, to be rude to the people she didn't want to be nice to. I was chatting to some guys who were also waiting who were from Australia as well and we got talking. The hostess and the Australians began talking and completely ignored the new patrons waiting in line as well as the patrons already waiting which I found rude. Was finally seated with my rest of my party outside. Was great. Starters was the feta cheese and a few coffees. Then ordered the couscous and it was a-ma-zing. Really enjoyed the flavors and the way it was served and garnished. The texture was great as well as there were moments of soft, tastey, juicey and crunchy moments. I think it plays a massive part with how food is laid out as it seems more appealing and appetizing to the eye. My friends also order the couscous and one of the sandwiches. I have come back to Cafe Gitane since but again, had to deal with the rude Australian hostess. I'm sure she is a nice person but it seems that everytime that I go it seems that she has an attitude with me whereas I wouldn't mind waiting that extra 20-30 minutes if she was nice, empathetic or at least genuine to everyone. Definitely go, its great there. Vibe was nice and my waitress was fantastic!
