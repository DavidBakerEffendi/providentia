A favorite brunch, lunch, and dinner spot in the neighborhood. If possible, time your visit during less crowded hours--their lunch/dinner options have some real stars that typically get passed over for the super-popular brunch dishes. However, if it comes down to a wait and the day outside is nice, it's absolutely worth it for well-priced food, friendly staff, and a lovely atmosphere. Favorites: their turkey meatballs are simply the best--really moist and well-seasoned, and excellent either with the arugula salad or in the meatball sandwich. Mac and cheese is good, too. Red velvet cake is just fine, but the raspberry sour cream cake is very nice.
