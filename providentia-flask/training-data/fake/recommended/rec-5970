Sent to a neighborhood with no parking to meet friends for dinner, they promptly found an un-timed, un-metered spot and had time to peruse an independant record store. Forced to slog though a thunderous down pour, they dashed through the door of Southwark. There were drinks, and sitting in the well appointed dining room, they had a delicious meal. I love it when a plan comes together.
