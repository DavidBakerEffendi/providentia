10 years ago I would have given this place 10 stars for the fun and memories as well as the food. Years ago the hosts were dressed in drag and really had a lot of fun with the guests, the fries were to DIE for and they served drinks ...there was also a plethora of interesting events every time we were there in the wee hours of the morning. I can say that the place has toned down a lot now and the host act like they barely notice you (no longer in drag, regular diner hosts)...however, the fries and gravy are still unbelievable as are most things on the menu. The prices have also not changed in a looong time. Worth a try for a drunk (or not drunk) late night out... I guess the place grew up with me and became more commercialized. Still worth a shot.
