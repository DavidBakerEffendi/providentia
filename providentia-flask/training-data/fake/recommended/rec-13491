It's about a 15 minute walk from my office to Blue Spoon but I'll make it about once a week because their iced lattes are so damn delicious. My co-worker got me hooked on their sandwiches - my go to is now a fresh basil, mozzarella and tomato panini with chipotle mayo. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable!
