A very local and charming place in the Kingston, NJ area. We tried the Bruschette, which was unique, but not necessarily flavorful and the Polpette tasted like fancy meat balls. Most people would come here for the wine, but nobody from our table had wine. We went for the draft beer which was nice. For the main course, I had the Grilled Wild Salmon, which was exceptional, however, the accompanying peas and potatoes were hard. The accompanying spring onion was pointless. The dessert was nothing quite as memorable. I ordered a coffee streaked ice cream with a pastry. Goods: Salmon Ambiance Exceptionally friendly waiter Bads: Nothing else remarkable Pricey Entree accompaniments not good May not go back for a while. However, it's a great place to try once.
