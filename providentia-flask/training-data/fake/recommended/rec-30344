LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I avoided it for a LONG time because I absolutely hate crepes, I think they are disgusting soggy things, but finally after some kicking and screaming my boyfriend took me there, as we were getting tired of going to Dumont and the tasty BK usuals. Well, I didn't order the crepes, but I ordered the chicken dijon mustard pasta - it's what i liken to a french version of penne ala vodka.  It was AMAZING and so delicious. I dream of this pasta.   After discovering it, it has become my favorite restaurant and I've enjoyed many of their pasta dishes - their duck is also the best I've ever had. In terms of atmosphere it's small & dark, but cute. The staff is a little laid back/ takes their time but I attribute that to a calm European approach to service. You must go, just save me a seat!
