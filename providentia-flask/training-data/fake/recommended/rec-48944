Our first time at Bar San Miguel was two weeks ago. Overall, I could not recommend the restaurant more strongly. My only hesitation is that too favorable a review will draw too many customers and make it hard to get a table! To begin with, the restaurant is a very welcoming environment; the service was top notch and we felt very valued as customers. We had an excellent waiter, Jake, who made great tequila recommendations. The bartender, Uriel, was also terrific. The food is outstanding and the tacos are DELICIOUS. (If you are a finicky eater like me, ask for the tacos without aioli and avocados.) The tacos were absolutely my favorite that I've had in a long while, in fact, my favorite that I've had outside of Mexico. Â The chicken skewers are a tad bit spicy if you are a "supertaster" like me, but if you are a normal person they are probably flavored well, and the chicken is of good quality. The empanadas, which my boyfriend had, were rich and delicious, tempting even to the lactose-intolerant among us. The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing; low-key, tastefully decorated; I particularly like the tiled floors in the bathroom. We may or may not have been drunk and tried to buy Jim Cramer tequila. But we are going back tonight.
