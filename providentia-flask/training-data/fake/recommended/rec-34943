I never thought to review this place until now. Considering it's in a train station it's pretty good pizza. Â The white and plain pizzas are pretty good. I agree with Mike P. that the buffalo chicken slice was really pretty bad. So just keep it simple and you should be pleasantly surprised by triponi. It's the best deal you'll find at Newark-Penn.
