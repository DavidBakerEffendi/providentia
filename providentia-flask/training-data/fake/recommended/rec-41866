Super tasty at a not too bad price. The fried avocado and jalapeño taco and the steak are my top two, and the shrimp are really good as well. The only warning I will give is to be weary of the quesadillas which are WAY overpriced. At  $7 they are already the most expensive item on the menu, but to add chicken or steak it's an additional $3.  $10 for a quesadilla would be fine, however they are soooo tiny, and they come with nothing. They are using their small soft taco shells to make them and one will not fill you up unless you are a small child. While they are tasty,  for the same price, you could go to Taqueria de los Muertos around the corner and get a quesadilla (using a burrito shell) with beans, guacamole, salsa on the side and a drink. I paid $20 for two thinking it would be a good lunch, but really it was a really expensive amuse bouche. I hope they fix that pricing error, or make the quesadillas larger enough to warrant the price. Otherwise/over all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood. Also, best guacamole in the area.
