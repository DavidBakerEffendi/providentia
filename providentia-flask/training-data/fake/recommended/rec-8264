Some good, some bad.   Here is a brief summary: The most memorable thing about the breakfast sandwich was that it wasn't good. The house thick cut bacon in back is solid. The pepperoni bread delivered on a greasy, salty melty and fatty snack...which is what one wants when buying this item. The service is friendly, helpful.   Breakfast sandwich I had was lackluster at best.  My girl friend also agreed, bland, boring, dry. This was disappointing.  The thick cut house bacon they sell in back is solid, the it seems like a much thinner, cheaper bacon on these sandwiches, probably Oscar Meyer caliber.  A good breakfast sandwich is easy to make, done right it's a great little nugget of delight.   Typical dry goods in the front end, meat selection is good in back.  It's a solid neighborhood place, but I wouldn't drive 5 miles for this.   If you value a smile and helpful workers, then bump this up a star. Food taste and food quality are my primary subjects on my reviews.
