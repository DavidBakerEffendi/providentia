New Haven has some great pizza and this is among the best. The crust is super thin, the toppings are high quality, and the sauce is delicious.  It's one of the few places that is truly worth waiting an hour for. The margherita pie and the white clam pizza are out of this world.  The only knock on Pepe's is that the waitstaff can be rude and unfriendly.  The waitstaff are like the honey badger.  They don't care.  They know you'll keep coming back.
