Really 3.5 stars.  Wandered around the village hoping to stumble upon a brunch spot and stumbled right on in to Extra Virgin.  Decor and atmosphere was right  up my alley with beautiful fresh flowers at every table.  The food itself was solid but nothing to rave about (keep in mind this is just a reflection of brunch).  I enjoyed having brunch here but I wiouldn't purposefully seek it out.
