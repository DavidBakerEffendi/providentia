Great spot. This place gives you a real "at home" feeling. Staff and bartenders are extremely friendly. Great food. Great prices. I have never seen chili so thick in my life - a little spicy but I recommend trying!! I also had a great wheat beer but I cannot recall the name. All I know is the chili accompanied by the wheat beer was a great match!
