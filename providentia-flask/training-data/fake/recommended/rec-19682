The short rib and chicken sandwiches were delicious! The beignet was ok, tasted just like a zeppoli, I'm not a big fan of those. But, the service here is warm and friendly and everything was made fresh. I was told it gets really crowded here but there wasn't anyone around when I went. I will definitely be passing through again!
