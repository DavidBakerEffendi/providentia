Great date night at this cozy, lively, uniquely decorated, dimly lit, trendy restaurant. We sat in the heated terrace in the back, which made conversation a bit more tolerable. Wonderful wine selection and Austrian-flared food. I'm not a huge schnitzel fan, but this is clearly the item to order. Brussel sprouts were surprisingly delicious. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for the following reasons: (1) decor, (2) knowledgeable wait staff, (3) quality of food. Edi & the Wolf is a solid choice and a nice evening out.
