Walked in on a recent Friday night and was told there was about an hour and a half wait for a table for three.  We left my phone number and went to an area bar to wait out the time.  After a little over an hour we got a call that our table was ready.  We started out with the soft shell crab and the baked little neck clams - both were excellent.  The soft shell crab had a light, crispy crust and was perfectly cooked.  The little neck clams were garlicky and had a very good crunch from the bread crumb topping.  My friends had  the t-bone lamb chops and I had the sangria skirt steak.  Both were cooked exactly as we ordered them and were deliciously seasoned.  Overall the service was great and the meal was delicious - I'd definitely go back.
