I'm irrationally in love with this place. I would do things here that I wouldn't do anywhere else. Just slip me some of those crunchy appetizers, like the grilled chicken skin, the pork belly, maybe a couple of the meat balls, and some wasabi octopus... and I'm game. Throw in a (couple of?) pitcher of Sapporo for good measure, and bring me the menu again. I should have been an Asian hipster. Hidden underground in the frightening Times Square area, the location works well to weed out some, although evidently not enough, as it's consistently crowded. I recommend moseying over to another inexpensive hidden gem just a few blocks away, Jimmy's Corner, for a preemptive drink while you wait (and salivate), because -- in the eternal words of L'Oreal -- it's worth it.
