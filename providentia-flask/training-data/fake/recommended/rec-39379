Had the lunch special, clam chowder soup with a lobster slider and crab slider. Soup was very good, however, the lobster slider was just ok, nothing especial. Same could be said for the crab slider. Maybe my expectations of this place were too high and they weren't met. The price was a bit high given the size of the sliders. If in the neighborhood, I might give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
