Do not see the big deal. I'm a halal food expert and just because they cycle through chicken like crazy deeming them fresh doesn't mean it tastes good. I cook better chicken than they do. It's dry, no flavor, not friendly, and the only reason people like it is because they cover the flavorless chicken and rice with copious amounts of sauces. Been there around 6 times and even wrote a college paper on them. It's more interesting to see people stand on the long ass line for the same chicken you will get at the cart right by them which is owned by the Halal guys themselves. Trust me! I've tasted both! Overhyped. P.S. One time I was really hungry but had $6 in change. When it was my turn to order and pay the guy got loud with me, "I give you good food, you give me good money!" What an ass. Had to go to the Starbucks right there and ask for bills smh. I'm done with them.
