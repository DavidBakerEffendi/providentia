Decent ramen in center city. The environment is pretty casual and you order and pick your own seating, no service whatsoever. Cash only, so remember to bring cash. Went there with a friend on a weekday evening and had to wait a bit to be seated. Overall, I would say the food is decent. We ordered the spicy ramen Karai but it wasn't all that spicy. The noodles were on the thicker side. I have to agree with the other comments that the portions are not on the generous side and it is pricey for what you get. The portions were small and even with the added portions, the meat and broth seem to be little. I would go back when I want to get ramen but do not want to go to NYC but that would be pretty much it, not so much for the restaurant.
