I lived above Clinton Street for 3 years.  In that time I ate there maybe 5 or 6 times.  The food is very good.  The biscuits they use for the eggs Benedict is always my reason for going.   The negatives; on the weekends the wait can be 2 hours.  I would never wait that long for breakfast anywhere.  The times I ate there I convinced the host/hostess to allow us to eat without waiting since we lived in the building.  It is over priced for breakfest, two people will run about $60 including tip.  The main issue I have this this place is the tourists, the hotels in the area send people there so be prepared for the taking pictures of the food crowd.  On a personal note; If you do go there do not sit on the steps of the neighborhood buildings while waiting.  It drives everyone in the area nuts not to be able to walk outside without tripping over people who act as if their doing your a favor letting you leave your building.
