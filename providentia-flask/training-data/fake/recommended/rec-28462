Regretfully, I'd never visited this place when I lived in the city. Luckily, a friend recommended we grab lunch here and I'm so glad he did. We had lunch here on a weekday so there wasn't a wait. I loved the bright white decor and the skylight really made the place seem much bigger than it actually is. I ordered the vol au vent, frites. Delicious! It was like a sophisticated and super rich version of a chicken pot pie with a side of fries. The waitstaff was nice but the guy who showed me to the table had a bit of an attitude. I do appreciate that my waiter took the time to translate the Tin Tin poster on the wall for me. I heard the brunch is awesome so I'm going to hit this place up on my way out of town. Would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for a cozy and cute place to have a decent French meal with a friend or two.
