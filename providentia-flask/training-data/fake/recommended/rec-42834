I like this place. The service is pretty much on point, the flavors and arrangement of flavors definitely has had a lot of thought put into it. My only qualm is the pricing. They could do a little cheaper for what you're getting. I hate to complain about prices, but really guys, eggs and avocado on toast? That's pretty cheap stuff! Alright, price-ranting aside, the avocado toast with a soft boiled egg was delicioussssssssss. I added a touch more of salt and smothered it with the soft boiled egg and it was a delightfully light and tasty breakfast.
