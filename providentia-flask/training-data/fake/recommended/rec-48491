Great brunch spot! been here a number of times and always leave happy. The food is very fresh, never too much and is just 'made with love' :)! I can't really say anything bad about the place. The wait is sometimes annoying but Josh is always very friendly and efficient at getting you seated. Â A+ for him. Also they have interesting, cool music!
