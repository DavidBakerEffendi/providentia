Decided to have lunch after reading some of the reviews. The first thing I noticed was the awkward entrance. The place was moderately busy and the music loud. I noticed that all the waiters were dressed the same-yellow shirt with straw hats even  if the fit was big :) and they seemed in a rush. No time for basic pleasantries. The food was tasteless and looked like it was thrown on a plate. Caribbean people are known to be warm, happy  & hospitable - their food tasty, flavorful and feast full to the eye- they failed on both.
