This place is so hip I'm surprised they let me in the door.  I was surprised to find that their coffee was so weak, and quickly regretted not walking up to Grumpy.  If you need food and coffee in a place so hip you need a handlebar mustache tattooed on your finger just to get in the door then come here.  If you want a good cup of coffee then go to Cafe Grumpy.
