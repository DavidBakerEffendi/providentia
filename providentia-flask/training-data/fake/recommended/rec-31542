This southern style Italian restaurant offers good traditional food in an upscale diner/sports bar atmosphere, with plasma screens galore.  If you can tolerate the constant sports broadcasts, (they tone this down in the evening) the food is worth a visit.  The pizza, thin crusted with good quality cheese, is a great starter, as is the eggplant rollatini, the broccoli rabe and sausage, or the crispy risotto.  The pasta and chicken dishes are all good choices.  I like the cavatelli with shrimp, an unusual mix of fresh shrimp, broccoli rabe, cherry tomatoes, and cannellini beans in garlic and oil.   They have a good selection of beers, and a reasonable wine list.   All in all, not a bad choice if you happen to be in the area.
