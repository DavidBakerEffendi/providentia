we were told the wait for honey's a few blocks away was going to be an hour so we said suck it and moseyed here for very tasty breakfast burritos with black beans, not super great but still good potatoes (I would suggest maybe not including an entire bough of rosemary), surprisingly serviceable coffee, no wait for a brunch table midday on a sunday, and most importantly an absolutely SMOKINGLY tasty waiter. who is that guy? woof. I think the food was pretty good but can't really recall because I entered a fugue state when this dreamboat cleared my plate. damn you philly!!
