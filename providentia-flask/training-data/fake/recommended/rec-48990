By surprise we were there on Taco Tuesday. Five tacos for $4.99. What a treat! We had five tacos de carnitas and five tacos al pastor. They were both scrumptious. A small bag of homemade crispy chips for each was a freebie. Also included were various sauces-- the fiery pickled onion was great. We know where we will be next Tuesday!
