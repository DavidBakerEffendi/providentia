After reading about this place I had a lot of hope in these sushi wraps. For around the same price as two sushi rolls at most place you get these burrito like wraps how ever you would like. Definitely pricey for what it is, messy soaked in sauce and not tightly wrapped like an actual sushi roll. I have to say we were happy with it but definitely glad we didn't go out of our way for it. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon just simply because you get a less sloppy and better presentation if you were to just go get sushi somewhere.
