Exploring if the neighborhood my hubby and I found the menu for this place to be interesting enough to come in and try it out. It was a Thursday night (not a busy weekend night). Seated and given the menus we waited quite a bit for a waiter to come by and take our order - long enough for Â me to start thinking of walking out and for the server to thank us for being patient. We ordered a couple of house specialty drinks which were seriously sub-par. I question the existence of alcohol in them at all. We also ordered the French beef tartar and the ceviche trio. The beef tartar was a generous portion and pretty tasty. The ceviche.... well I am sorry,but I am not sure that the chef really knows what ceviche is. Ok so it is a sampler platter of three ceviches . All it was: A tiny plate of cooked shrimp in ketchup, a tiny plate of crab meat with tartar sauce on top and a tiny plate of octopus in olive oil and vinegar... Does any of it say ceviche to you??? To top it all off there is only one unisex bathroom which forces you to stand on line and try to dive away from rushing waiters... Not that I would lower the star rating for a place lacking space. But it was just the icing on the cake.
