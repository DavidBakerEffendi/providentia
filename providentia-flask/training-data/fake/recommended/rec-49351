This is a great independently-owned bookstore with a large cafe. It's a great place to browse, hang out and study, meet up & chat, or grab a quick bite while supporting a local business. Oh, and people-watch the Yale crowd- lots of students/profs here since it's close to campus/art museums. I've never found as good a selection of bargain books (cookbooks, anyway) as I'd like here, but it's fun to browse the regular selection, complete with recommendation cards from staff members filed among the books. The cafe is more like a mini-restaurant than the coffee joints I'm used to from Seattle. The downside: no big mis-matched chairs where you can curl up and disappear for hours. Even though they don't rush you, I feel a little bad sitting there studying with a check on my table, which arrives as soon as you're done eating/sipping. Laptop outlets are also a little hard to come by, also. You will leave smelling a little more like food than coffee, but that's being picky. It gets crowded during lunch, but that's a good sign, because the upside is delcious food! The cafe offers an array of sandwiches, soups, and I've especially enjoyed the salads. What I dream about from afar, however, is the warmed bread pudding with golden raisins & rum sauce. The picture posted here doesn't do it justice- it's dyn-o-mite!!
