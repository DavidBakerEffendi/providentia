My daughters and I went to Mes Reves to celebrate my birthday.  We had been there a few years ago and the food was as delicious as I remember.  I love the decor which is modern but very warm.  I like the way the original exterior brick wall is highlighted.  When sitting inside, its hard to remember you're in Bloomfield, it could be a restaurant in Manhattan.  My daughter and I shared the mushroom tart as an appetizer and soon realized we should have each ordered our own - absolutely delicious!  We order the duck, the steak, and the salmon - each were cooked to perfection and delicious.  The warm bread and honey mint butter could be a meal in itself!. . This is a true gem and hopefully will be there for many years.  I would absolutely recommend Mes Reves to anyone who enjoys excellent food, a warm relaxing atmosphere, and a knowledgeable, welcoming staff.
