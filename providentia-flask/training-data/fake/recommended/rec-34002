I was pleased with my meal... I'm a fan of fried chicken so I got one to go with a side of Mac and cheese.  I thought it was good however I've had better... I had the fried green tomatoes but... I wasn't sold, the bacon was good though! The restaurant is incredibly small so rest assured your neighbors will be all IMO your conversation... But it's comfortable. I thought it was a cute quaint place, waitress was just alright, she didn't really pay enough attention when you spoke to her but otherwise I enjoyed my food. When I dined in I ordered  crispy fried jumbo shrimp and a side of Mac and cheese... The shrimp was damn good, I've had better Mac and cheese though. I would go back because I really love to support my local. Neighborhood businesses and their food was good.  The other members of my party loved their food Perhaps my disappointment was with what I ordered.  I want to love their food as I've heard so many compliments so I'll give them another chance.
