The food was not only wonderful, it was gorgeous. The fried artichokes with olive tapenade and lemon yogurt were one of those food revelations: I didn't know it could taste like that... Grilled octopus was done perfectly, gnocchi with pulled pork was fabulous. Pizza and a draft Peroni was spot on. Perfect place to interrupt the bike ride for a cold one! And very reasonable.
