I swear by this place on my way to work in the city. Their homemade lemonades and freshly squeezed orange juice save me during the summer. However, I can only really count on Lorenzo to make my food correctly. Whenever he's not there, I end up with burnt burgers and subpar salads. Â The weekend Chef's just aren't up to par. And I detest that they suddenly stopped delivering in the area. Their delivery boy left and they didn't bother to hire a new one because apparently they didn't get enough orders. In my opinion, for a fairly new business, they didn't give their delivery service enough time to pick up momentum. The weekday staff is really sweet but the weekend staff is kind of rude.
