ITS HALAL! If you are visiting NYC - this cart should be in the Bucket List for sure!! it is been around for over a decade and its popularity precedes it. Most fellow NYers go here for lunch. Very popular for post clubbing food. Although lines are always a full blocks length, it moves pretty fast! i can assure you it is worth it! :)
