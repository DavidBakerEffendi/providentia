Cows are among the dumbest of all farm animals. Down in the gulch of idiocy beside chickens. However, with great stupidity comes great loyalty. As much as I enjoy bacon, it is the pig who will cut you down and betray you when given the chance. Friends close, enemies closer. Even vegetarians rely on cows, milking them when they can. All people embrace the honesty of a cow even if all bovines are lacking in guile. The duplicity of the swine not to be underestimated. This is bigger than bistro burgers, which I might add, are tremendous. But they are a strange coupling of pig & cow. Be wary. They are delicious.
