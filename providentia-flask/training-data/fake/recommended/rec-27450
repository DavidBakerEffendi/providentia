To date, this place has the best ramen I've ever eaten.  So why only three stars? 1. Ridiculously long wait to get inside, on a dingy, supercrowded sidewalk with dozens of other hungry people - and I have a short temper, especially when I'm hungry 2. The spot is TINY, seriously one of the smallest restaurants ever - to shorten our wait time, we once shared a table with another couple - which ended up being great, thank goodness, but even so... 3. Cash only I can't tell you how many times I've waited on the line for at least 25 minutes, with five more names ahead of mine on the list, only to get fed up and head elsewhere.  The plus side to this is that I discovered several places in the nabe that are also excellent (Pure Thai Shophouse, Danji, etc.) but I can't tell you how annoying it is to wait that long for a bowl of noodles - even if that bowl is pure excellence - al dente, chewy and delicious ramen noodles in the most perfectly balanced salty chicken broth, and delicious chunks of rich and fatty pork meat.  The portions are huge and the service is also great - the entire staff is really sweet and patient.  So, yes... the line is merited, but ugh.  Try to get there before the dinner rush and on a rainy night - maybe the wait will only be 20 minutes if you're lucky.
