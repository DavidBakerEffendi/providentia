Excellent food, fresh and great portions.  However , I will never return.  They feature breakfast and brunch.  What a disappointment.  The menu clearly states " breakfast all day". This is a big fat lie!!! They stop serving breakfast at 6.   If you lie to your customers, you don't deserve them regardless of the quality of your food, this establishment is a fraud and should be avoided
