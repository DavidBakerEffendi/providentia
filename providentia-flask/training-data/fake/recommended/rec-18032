You know that a place is not so good when your husband has to say, "Don't look at it, just put it in your mouth and chew." We ordered two ramen bowl dishes, for me the beef with noodle and broth and for my husband, the lemon grass pork, and both orders were almost inedible. Though their delivery was prompt and complete, the broth was watery and weak and worst of all, the cuts of meat were fatty, skin-like globs. We will not be ordering from this place again.
