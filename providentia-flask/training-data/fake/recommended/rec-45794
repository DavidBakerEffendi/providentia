Finally a good sushi restaurant in NJ!  I am from CA and have been searching for a place like this for quite sometime! They have innovative dishes (favorites are the tuna dumpling and yellow fin carpaccio), fresh seafood and EXCELLENT customer service.  The waitress and sushi chef were very accommodating and attentive!  Can't wait to come back!
