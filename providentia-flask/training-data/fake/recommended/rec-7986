My boyfriend and I went here for dinner the other day.  The food was... amazing.  I don't eat meat and so I stuck to the herbivore menu (I had to ask for it) and everything I had was simply delicious.  They don't have a ton of options for those who are vegetarian and the items are Tapas but I ordered four items and was totally satisfied.  I cant even tell you how the flavors came together in each dish.  I started off with the butternut squash and I don't know what they did to that squash but it was the best I have had.  I also had the hummus, vegan meatballs and eggplant.  All dishes were fantastic.  The beer selection was great with a nice variety.  My boyfriend had fish and said it was the best fish he had eaten in a very long time.  We were both blown away. The service was excellent and the atmosphere here was really nice - cozy and very rustic.  I could see myself having an anniversary dinner here.  Its laid back enough where you can dress up if you want but don't feel pressured to do so.  We spend, maybe, $70 on dinner so its pricey but in my opinion - worth the money.
