I am not one of those people who has a total admiration to fine dining. I do not watch Iron Chef, nor care about decor. However, Tintos have a certain quality I cannot ignore. Some people will emphasize Garcés as a legend, but he is just a man. I did not find his other restaurant, Chifa, exciting; as a Peruvian, I sort of found it a bit insulting. Granted, his dedication to dining seems to be above the board, but I will not cloud my judgement based on his accolades. So, let's get right to it: The first thing I ordered was the Sopa De Castaño. The soup was smooth - let me tell you. The quality was above average, with an aroma of mushrooms that made me cringe for more. The pistachios worked perfectly with the blend, but I did not believe the quail eggs were necessary. The second entry was the Duck Confít. The cherry complimented the duck perfectly, adding a hint of sweetness to the delicacy. This was pretty much my favorite pick of the night. Just by reading their reviews, most Yelpers would agree with me. Finally, I ordered the Kobe Beef. It was a very delicious treat as the night  started to fade in. Overall, it was good. I would not have spent so much money on bites, but it wasn't bad.
