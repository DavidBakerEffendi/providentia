I had a wonderful late night anniversary dinner with my boyfriend last night at Piora. I would give the experience five stars, but to me, five stars are reserved for those truly exceptional and absolutely perfect dining experiences. Not that Piora wasn't absolutely fantastic, but it was not perfect. I only have two big complaints. One, the booths are too low. Either that, or the tables are too high. That's an easy fix. My other big complaint is salt. Too. Much. Salt. This is coming from a guy who over-salts everything he eats, but this was just too much. I had the Monkeybread (which was great except for the salt on top) and the Bucatini. The pasta in the Bucatini was excellent; however, the crab slaw was too salty. Finally, the desserts left a little bit to be desired. Now that I got that out, I have to say the overall dining experience was great. This is a wonderful restaurant that I'm sure will only get better with time. Definitely take a chance on Piora. You won't regret it!
