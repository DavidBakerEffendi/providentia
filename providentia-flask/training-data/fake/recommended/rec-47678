Pros: -Great pizza -Good beer selection -Fun, interesting atmosphere Cons: -Abysmal service, and even that is too generous. The hostess was exceedingly, horrifyingly rude, and the waitress was inattentive and ridiculously unfriendly. We asked for the check, and 10 minutes later when it still had not been delivered we asked for it again. She acted as if we were imposing upon her. But she was nothing in comparison to the atrocious hostess. We asked the hostess to please send the waitress, and her response was, "Uh, well, she's kinda busy. But I'll try to send her over." Are you kidding me?! Do not try, just do it. While the pizza was excellent, I have zero intentions of ever attending this restaurant again. The horrifying quality of the service (minus the bartender, who was actually somewhat personable) nullifies any quality of the pizza. I am highly, highly disappointed by the experience, as I think BAR has a lot of potential. To anyone who dares go here, I hope you learned from my mistake, and just order pizza from the bar.
