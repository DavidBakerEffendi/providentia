Apparently there are some very passionate reviews about the Tick Tock Diner! lol.  My experiences here have been pleasant, if not terribly memorable.  It's your standard diner fare, with good service and clean, typical diner decor. The chicken noodle soup was tasty, although it had tiny shell macaronis instead of noodles.  But it was good nonetheless!  My son very much enjoyed his french onion soup with lots of cheese.  We had "The Jersey Shore " burger which was a patty with mozzarella cheese, marinara, and 3 mozzarella sticks on top. It came with disco fries! Cheesy goodness !!!  The hubs enjoyed a grilled chicken sandwich that had pesto on it.  It looked good!   En route to the bathrooms, you'll see Guy Fieri's mug grinning at you from a gigantic poster.  No surprises here, just Jersey diner fare.
