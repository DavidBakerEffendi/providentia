Oh Boqueria, please open a new location in California. PLEASE! If I could eat here everyday, I would. My BFF and I stumbled upon this place while shopping in SoHo this past Saturday. The food, oh the food, was super delicious! I haven't been to too many Tapas places but man, I am now on serious a hunt for more Tapas places like Boqueria in LA...no joke! Since we came during their weekend brunch hours, BFF and I decided to try out some Tapas and also their brunch menu. From their Tapas menu, we ordered the Txipirones (baby squid arugula salad; see pic) and the Albondigas (lamb meatballs) ... both were EXCELLENT. I especially loved the baby squid arugula salad. It was BY FAR, the BEST Arugula salad I have ever tasted in my whole entire life. You must try this if you ever come here. The lamb meatballs were also great, but I thought it was a bit heavy for lunch. From their Spanish Brunch menu, we ordered the Seafood Paella. The Paella was super good. They gave lots of seafood and not to mention the rice they used was not overcooked and very moist and tasty. We were both so full before we were even able to really finish the Paella but we made sure we stuffed it all down because it was THAT good and we did not want to leave any behind. The service we received was also excellent. I checked into 4square upon my arrival, and was presented with a ONE FREE Sangria coupon. I showed it to our server Marcos and he was more than happy to honor it! The Sangria was also yummy!! With 2 Tapas, 1 Paella (2 orders), and 1 Sangria (we got one for free, but decided to order another one because it was good), our bill came close to one bill after a 20% tip, so it's a bit pricey for a brunch place, but TOTALLY worth it.
