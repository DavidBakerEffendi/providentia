Yummiest sliders ever. I often find myself literally going "mmmmmm" after I take a  bite. And so cheap! Cheap cold beer too.  I'm not a fan of the fries though. And that's saying something, considering french fries are my favorite vegetable. They look good, but don't taste like anything. I'd say skip them and get more sliders. I only wish this place was bigger... Friday and Saturday nights are packed since it's so small.
