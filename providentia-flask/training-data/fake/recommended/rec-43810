My first impression about this place is that they give a TON of food.  Great place to go if you're looking to have some leftovers the next day. I ordered Lo Mien and I got oodles of noodles - my take out box probably weighed around 3 pounds and was literally bursting with food. Even having not eaten for the whole day, I still only finished half.   Prices are very fair for what you get.  Their food doesn't taste greasy at all, which is a good sign.  I'll be trying more of their stuff in the future.
