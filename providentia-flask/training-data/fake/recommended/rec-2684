I had a really nice evening dinner here during a raining day in October. Notably, the restaurant was full, as I barely made it to the hostess. But I really enjoyed the experience as they honored our Open Table reservation through Yelp. We got a cozy table with some candle light. So make reservations...this was on a Wednesday night. The food was really great, Arugula pizza and a small pizza....half arugula and half caprese. It was really filling for two people. I think the pizza was 8 slices. The prices were really reasonable. And dinner was perfect with a bottle of wine. I have had better food in Little Italy. But I am a fan of this restaurant.
