Not an uncomfortable place to grab some drinks and appetizers. They had a live musician (acoustic guitar/singer) last night which was nice too. They served my party (consisting of 25 year olds, no children) water in sippy cups, which I thought was weird. Â Had to request normal glasses of water like they serve everywhere else.
