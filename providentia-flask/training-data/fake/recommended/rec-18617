Came here today with my brother and sister for restaurant week. They ordered the restaurant week prix fixe, consisting of succulent meatballs in marinara sauce, sweet potato pappadelle and the almond cake. We also ordered the mussels for the appetizer and it very delicious. One gripe I had was that the focaccia was a bit salty. Either way, I had the bone-pork chop, which was delicious- it came with whipped mashed potatoes and arugula. I will definitely come by again to order the stuffed trout or just to come in for drinks. The ambiance was earthy but sophisticated.
