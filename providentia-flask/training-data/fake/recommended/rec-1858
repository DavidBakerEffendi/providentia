Average sandwich! I was definitely disappointed! We were PRESSED for a "real" Philly cheesesteak! I'll take a DC "steak & cheese" any day! Not to mention they were the RUDEST workers ever! Worse than NYC! They almost chopped my head off when I asked for shredded lettuce and yellow American cheese!! NEVER AGAIN!! And it was definitely NOT a $9 sandwich!!
