I came here for restaurant week and it's been the favorite so far. It's a nice place to end up after a day of work. It's comfortable and the cocktails are great. Peach and Pancetta risotto - I'm not a fan of warm peach chunks but this dish was great. The peach flavor throughout the risotto was delicate and not overwhelming and the pancetta provided a great salty and chewy balance. Trout - This dish was giant but I ate it all. Nicely cooked fish and crisp green beans were a great match. Deep fried onions are always delicious. Panna cotta short bread - From the bottom it's biscuit, panna cotta, strawberries, chantilly cream, biscuit. It's floating in a pool of strawberry sauce. So good. This is a place that I'd happily go to when restaurant week ends. I love that it's high end food but a more laid back setting.
