Sabrina's used to be a really nice place. Used to be our weekend brunch place two years ago. But today, I think they used burnt oil. But I think mistakes happen and all that matters is if an effort is put into correcting it. When we spoke to the waitress about the French toast, she was very rude to us like throwing the check at the table that made us feel really horrible. I think the management has to reconsider their staff if their business has to go anywhere. Because they have good food. But if the service is bad, people are going to stop coming.
