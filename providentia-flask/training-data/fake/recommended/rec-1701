What a racist a-hole. It's obvious that he didn't take his racist hate to the grave with him since the first thing you see on his website is that infamous placard. It seems that his decendents will keep that hate going. I speak perfect English but I would be terribly hurt if my parents who speak very broken English (even though they've tried so hard to correct the accent) were turned away. I'm sure this douche has family in Italy whom to this day, probably can't order perfectly either. Will never set a foot at this place.
