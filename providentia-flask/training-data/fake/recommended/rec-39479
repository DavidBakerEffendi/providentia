Malatesta has such a old-feel romantic ambiance with amazing homemade pasta. I had to try the Spinach Gnocchi and boy was it decadent. The gnocchi is not a food that you can inhale in one sitting. The pasta is so creamy and rich that you eat each piece one by one and savor each bite. I also got to try the other pastas, and they were all extremely delicious. I loved the food, and I loved the atmosphere. Take your special date here, and you'll be sure to please.
