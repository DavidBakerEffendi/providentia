Decent service. They were nice. The Tiger Burger was good and came out hot. They made the meat the way I ordered it. Nothing really special about this place, but not a bad place to stop and eat. I sat out on the patio portion which had heaters. It is really cold out right now. The entrance is to the left of the front of the building. I should have ordered a dessert here because the cupcake shop next door does not have great customer service. I would come back again to this restaurant. I think everyone's rating averaged together on yelp really is true. Decent but nothing that stands out to tell you about.
