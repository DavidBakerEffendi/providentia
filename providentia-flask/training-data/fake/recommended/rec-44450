Does the Montclair Health Dept exist? This place is beyond dirty and should be closed. Upon arrival for lunch, we found most of the tables had not been cleaned after the previous guests had finished eating. When we asked the owner if someone could clean off a table, he barked at us and said " just do it yourself". Not only that but there was food and used napkins on the floor too. After see this we obviously didn't Â dare to eat the food for fear of who knows what.
