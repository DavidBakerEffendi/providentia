FACT: Village Whiskey has some of the best burgers and tastiest bar grub in Center City. There are over 80 different kinds of whiskey on hand. Men likey.  Men want whiskey. FICTION: The bar area is LARGE and COMFORTABLE. You typically DO NOT have to wait around forever to eat/get a drink. Women LOVE to frequent this bar. To be honest, I'm actually a little shocked there are so many reviews written by ladies for Village Whiskey, and more shocked at how high highly it's rated among women.  This place is a complete and utter man trap.  The booze, the red meat and saturated fat...  They might as well put in the old west swinging saloon doors and a spittoon. The burgers are really good, or at least the Whiskey King is.  It's juicy, sopping, dripping with appplewood smoked bacon grease and satisfying.  I can't say that it's the best burger I've had but I wouldn't kick one out of my lunchbox. Don't get sticker shock when you look at the whiskey menu: most 1oz. shots go for double digits, with some selling for over $100 bucks! The duck fat fried are killer.  I'm sorry if I sounded facetious, but seriously, they'll KILL YOU.  Thick cut french fries fried in duck fat grease.  Man, are they good.
