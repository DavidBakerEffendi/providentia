I really enjoy the atmosphere Tinto was able to deliver.  I joined a few associates of mine there last evening to grab a few drinks and appetizers before we caught a show at Helium.  First the drink.  The ladies seemed quite pleased with the vast selection of wines available.  Also, I seemed to hear nothing but praise for the gin drink and bubs they were also throwing back.  Beer selection was modest, but seemed to cover all the basic areas; stout, ipa, pilsner, etc.  The apps or small plates were all very fantastic and I would go back, order any of them and be thrilled about it.  Charcuterie, risotto, cheese plate, lemony mushrooms, crab salad, the ribeye open face mini sandwiches, the lamb skewers.  It was apparent rather quickly the pride in which the staff presents each dish, and not soon thereafter the skills and dedication that the chef and his team put into making each selection taste exquisite.  I would go back there again and plan on doing so.  Soon!
