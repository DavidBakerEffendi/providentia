Penelope, you beautiful woman! Where have you been? Or more importantly, where have I been? I love breakfast. I eat breakfast for dinner, at all times of the day at diner places. Yet I always seem to have trouble finding the truly great breakfast eateries. You know, the restaurants that only do breakfast, or just breakfast and lunch. I wind up settling for something gross and unsatisfying. But, wow. When I met some coworkers for a breakfast meeting here, I was in love. I got the "Penny Egg Sandwich," over medium with sausage. Good God. The pesto sauce, mixed in with the yolk. I was in dipping heaven! I eagerly await my next breakfast meeting and if one doesn't occur, I will find a reason for it! To discuss quarterly, something or other...productivity, um. Synergy?
