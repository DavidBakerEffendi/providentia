Sat at the beautiful brown marble bar so as not to take up a whole table. The interior is so timelessly glamorous that I was wistfully looking at the window seating.  I could imagine in decades past, the room would be filled smoke and snifter glasses. Was handed the menu for restaurant week and the regular menu. $20 for a three course lunch for restaurant week. Tempting, but I was too curious about their burger. The bartender was very personable. I got the dry aged burger. Oh. My. A little smattering of chopped Poblano peppers, some finely grated cheese, a cute little bun, and the burger itself... The meat was just so full of flavor. I don't think I've ever had a dry aged burger. The bartender says that they do all sorts of dry age and wet age here. (I'd never heard of wet aging, he explained, sounds like marinating or brining for a couple of days to me) my only thing is that the bun was a weird texture, dry and airy. I guess you need something light to counter the meat, and dry but holds together to catch meat juices, but I wasn't a fan. The manager came around to ask about the food. I told her fabulous, but did mention the bun. She looked abashed, and offered to have the bun swapped out, but I think it was more of the type of bread rather than a stale bun, so declined.  The fries were seasoned and crispy. Delicious. Am coming back before restaurant week is out.
