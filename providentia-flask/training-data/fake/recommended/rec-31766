I thought about giving DiNic's 4 stars because of the limited menu, long lines, and all the commotion going on any time of day.... BUT that's the kind of place this is designed to be; after all it's in the Reading Market so those are all signs of a great place in this area. Going to DiNic's for the first time I had to reward myself with their highly regarded Italian Pulled Pork sandwich. (I'm an avid pulled pork enthusiast and usually will only eat it homemade, exceptions are made in the NYC and Philly area when I get a recommendation from someone). DiNic's was the best tasting pulled pork I've ever had. Â There may be places out there with meat a little more tender, but the marinade lathered around every slice of pork, paired with the fresh roll, sharp provolone, and spicy Roasted red peppers (yea, spicy AND roasted... they are insanely good) came together for the perfect sandwich.
