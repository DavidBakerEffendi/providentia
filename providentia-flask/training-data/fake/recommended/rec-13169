I am not a professional food critic, but come on people, you must be homers! Why? well the coal burning oven, okay cool concept but it doesn't translate into a better tasting pizza. The pizza we receive had a hole in it (seriously about the size of a baby's fist - how does that happen when you roll out the dough? Okay so we got half cheese and half peppers and onions. The cheese was just normal and the peppers and onions was pretty good, but again I was looking for an amazing flavor and didn't find it. Maybe this area has okay pizza, therefore people possibly don't know any better??? I am not bitter about the experience, but probably not coming back to give it another shot. Bottom line: Disappointing to say the least and really didn't enjoy. If do you end up trying this place, head back up to Boston and try Pizzeria Regina in the North End (see review from last weekend). I am on tour for the yummy tasting pizza and this didn't hit the spot.
