The host was cold and impersonal as we waited for him to print out (?) where we were to be seated in the almost empty restaurant. Our party of 2 got seated at a 5 seater table which was awkward in itself, but the staff didn't even bother to clear the rest of the unnecessary place settings. We had been told great things about the Brussels sprouts but they were so rich and sweet they were almost inedible. The babaganoush was overpowered with the smokey flavor, the tabbouleh salad was wwwaaayyyy too lemony/vinegary - we didn't really enjoy it. The lamb balls were great, as were their pita breads. Terrible coffee.
