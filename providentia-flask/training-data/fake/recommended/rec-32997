Love this restaurant, the presentations are fantastic and they have great taste!!! Sushi comes presented spectacular, they are artists. Our all time favorite here is Beef Negimaki and the Beef teriyaki, the meat quality is really good. They also have the classic tempura ice cream!!!!! We even call sometimes for delivery when we have unexpected guests at home and it always makes an impression!!
