Before I write the this review I'd like to preface with, I am bartender in the same neighborhood. Now employees only is an amazing bar with stand up top shelf bartenders and staff .. It is most certainly an "indusrty" bar , a place where I go by myself and with coworkers when I'm not closing my own bar to have drinks and kick the crap with other industry folk. Yes I'ts crowded yes it's busy but never to insane , their cocktails  are great , the interaction with guests is exactly what you would expect, courteous , friendly and welcoming . Everything you want in a proper bar. I have not eaten their so I cannot speak on the food .. Speaking as a person in the "industry" it's rock and roll, good music good conversation good people ... I would recommend this bar to anyone especially "industry" folk ... I mean where else can you go after a long shift to drink and complain about your day @3am that's not gonna kick you out ? Ha ......cheers to them  and their chicken soup Sidenote: 1st floor bathroom takes forever but that's the only downside
