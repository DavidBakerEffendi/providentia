The food was outrageous! This is one of my most favorite places to eat at while I am visiting family in Staten Island.  The place is a hidden gem of cullinary genius.  The food was fresh and and tastey. The desserts were nothing I have ever tasted before.  I will be coming back again and again and again. love the beautiful cakes going in and out of the doors!! and artist and a baker!
