Came here on a Friday night and, honestly, I expected to not get a seat. Alas, we got one instantaneously! I did not try the food, but the drinks were excellent. The presentation and preparation was perfect - as the drinks were prepared right in front of us. The bartenders were attentive, friendly, and NOT overbearing, which is exactly how I like my bartenders to be. They were also well dressed for the place - which I appreciate. Good drinks, good company, nice atmosphere, no wait, and no one breathing down my neck: what more could a girl want from a pub?
