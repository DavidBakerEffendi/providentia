I moved to Rutherford a few weeks ago and this place was suggested to me by the tenants moving out. Pizza sounds easy in theory but it's actually a delicate balance of the crust, sauce, and cheese.  This had balance, except it was way off.  The cheese was thick and overpowering, the sauce was flavorless and the crust was boring.  Maybe I'm being harsh, but for the price I paid I expected something much, much better.   The rest of the menu looked promising (again, in theory), but I don't think I'll return.
