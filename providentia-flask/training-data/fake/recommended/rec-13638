A true "hole in the wall" joint. Johny's may not be the prettiest place in town, but it has a good atmosphere and lots of regulars that keep things busy and interesting. I stopped in here for a quick bite and was impressed with the efficiency of service as well as the looks (and smell) of the food. Unfortunately I only had a bagel here but Johny's serves up a ton of things from salad's to large sandwiches and quick stuff like bagels if you are in a hurry. I'm glad I stumbled across it and will venture back when I'm in Chelsea.
