MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yummy. Late. Cheap. And by cheap, i don't mean they skimp, they pile it high, and you get your money's worth. Yeah, once upon a time, pita power was amazing..and then they sold it, and then oasis filled the gap. And we all munched happily ever after. Meh. I miss good falafel..my brother still calls me to taunt me with eating late night at Oasis.
