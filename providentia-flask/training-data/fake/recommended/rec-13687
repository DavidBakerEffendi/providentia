Last night for dinner I went to Malatesta in the meatpacking.   I cant say I have ever been that far west in Manhattan but its quite the charming area over there.  Tucked away on Washington St is this little Italian joint.  I heard there are many in the area but this one seemed to draw the crowds especially on a Monday night.  The place is not big by any means, but the way they laid out the place along with the strategic low lighting. create a nice ambiance.  I can just imagine this place in the summer when they have the doors and windows open.  Rustic, is a good word to describe the feeling.  Upon arrival they stock your table with a glass bottle filled with water and a plate of wonderful herbed bread and olive oil and balsamic.  I think if I sat there I could easily eat ten plates of that bread.  So addicting!  The menu is pretty straight forward, antipasti, salads, pastas, and secondi's.  We had grilled calamari and a prosciutto salad.  The calamari was so good, its quite refreshing having grilled calamari compared to the fried alternative.  Its chewy and fresh tasting.  For the main course I had the ravioli al formaggi.  Super rich cheese raviolis in a decadent pink sauce.  I ate 90% of them on the plate then decided to eat them all would totally be over indulging.  I think I picked well, the special for the night was a porchini ravioli, perhaps the next time I go there I can get that one.  Its a lovely place for a romantic dinner or a simple outing in the neighborhood. I wish it was more inland but perhaps during the day the views of the river make the leg of the journey over there worth it. CASH ONLY
