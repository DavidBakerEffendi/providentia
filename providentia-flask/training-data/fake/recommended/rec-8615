Truly outstanding. This is a "special night out" kind of place. Our table overlooking the Connecticut River (from the 20th floor of the Hartford Steam Boiler building) was perfect. The service was impeccable. The Maitre D checked in on us regularly, and there were so many servers in attendance that I thought we were at a Culinary Institute training course. That's not a bad thing. From the Get Smart entrance procedure through to the the desserts a couple of hours later, it was superb. I even wore a tie to dinner, although Business Casual would have sufficed. I edited this review, having originally given only four stars. Two big reasons for my initial four-star rating; first, my wife ordered rabbit, which was a featured item the evening we visited. This also happened to be her birthday. Instead of the rabbit, which she wanted because she'd never tried it before, she received duck. It was very good, make no mistake...but when you're paying a couple hundred dollars for dinner, you should get what you order. Second, neither of our dinners were piping hot. I ordered lamb ribeye, presented as three thick medallions, atop a bed of vegetables and potato and/or carrot mash, with some yogurt dressing. Again...the flavor was excellent. But I'm just one of those guys that wants my food HOT. Not warm. The meat, both the duck and the lamb, were just warm. The accompaniments were hot, but the main course was not. We began with a couple of excellent, unique apps, and ended the meal with a couple of equally excellent desserts, with coffee and Sambuca. They remembered to note that it was my wife's birthday, and made a nice little presentation. I will be back, and I highly recommend On20. Despite the shortcomings we experienced (which I will assume to be an anomaly, based upon others' reviews), it was one of the nicest dining experiences I've had in a very long time.
