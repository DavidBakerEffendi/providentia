The wife and I just got back from an early Saturday night dinner here (gotta have time to rest up before the partying starts).  I really want to give this place 3.5 starts but that's Yelp for ya. So, we had the lemon pepper poached shrimp which was just great.  The shrimp tasted super fresh and the sauces served were very tasty.  The cornbread, as many others have said, is good but not the best I've ever had. For our main, we got the blackened catfish po'boy over rice.  Sad to say I was a bit disappointed.  I've been to New Orleans and am from the south, and I have to say, this ain't it.  Didn't really taste the blackened seasoning that much, and so had to lather it with the sauce that came with it (which was yummy).  The fish was also dry and overcooked.  After having such fresh shrimp, it was just a huge letdown.   Atmosphere.  Great.  In true BK fashion, people are chill, crowd is diverse, and there's even a back yard, although it was full (sad face).  Our server was super friendly and attentive, so no complaints there. We'll be back, because it's a cool neighborhood spot, and we really want to try the bread pudding and the shrimp and grits.
