I was sure Frankford Hall wouldn't live up to all the hype I'd heard. It only took me one visit to realize it did! I love the inside/outside concept, which allows for a lot of movement even when it's crowded. The fire pits in the winter are cozy and fun, even though you will smell like smoke for hours after. The inside stays surprisingly warm as well. There is also ample seating which is important in a bar without dancing, at least for me. Who wants to stand and hold a gigantic beer for hours on end?! The food was mediocre. The dip for the pretzel was some sort of dill concoction I believe, and for me, was far from appetizing. The beer selection is huge, and I'm sure everyone can find something for their tastes. This is also in a great location, with many other good bars nearby in case you've had your fire pit fill. Frankford Hall is definitely a place I will continue to return to, as it's a great place to hang out with friends, with just enough polish and class.
