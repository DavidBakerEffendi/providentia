As the name suggests, everything is "market to table". Â Great date spot since it's quaint and romantic in a rustic atmosphere. (Probably too romantic for client dinners). Everything is beautifully presented and geared towards a foodie clientele. Service is a little impersonal but friendly. Was once stuck here during a huge rain / wind storm outside on a date, which made the meal feel even more romantic from the large glass windows. Price points are a little high but not absurd. Great date spot.
