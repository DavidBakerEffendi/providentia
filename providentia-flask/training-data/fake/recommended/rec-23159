I haven't been that impressed with the local Thai selections, but this place is pretty good.  Positives: The selections are tasty, decor is beautiful, and while there's often a lively, family-friendly crowd, there's almost never a wait for seats.  Negatives:  The place sometimes smells like cleaning products--which I suppose is better than smelling dirty, and the Tom Kha was slightly disappointing.  Still, my favorite in the area!
