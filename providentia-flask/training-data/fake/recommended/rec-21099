Nice take out or eat in deli. Their bread comes from Calandra's (which is just a couple of doors down in Calandra's Plaza). Â That gives it a big leg up right there. They've always got a daily special and a soup or two. Menu is pretty big, and if you want some combination they haven't written down there wouldn't be any problem doing it. It's a real deli, not a Subway. High boy tables and a tv if you want to stick around and eat what you've picked out for yourself. Calling ahead will save you a bit of time.
