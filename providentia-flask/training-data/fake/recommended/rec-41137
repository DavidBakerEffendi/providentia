Not bad, but underwhelming. After unsuccessfully trying to come here 2x in the past (there is ALWAYS a wait), I left work early to get here before the dinner rush. Victory! So excited because this place got so many good reviews. Ordered the pork bone ramen (my standard for judging) but got totally disappointed when it came with the unfavorable thin straight noodles! When will ramen places learn that thin noodles are just useless bland carbs? They don't absorb flavor at all. If I'm getting fat, there better be a payoff. Medium wavy noodles, always! (My friend ordered the miso ramen and got the medium wavy noodles.) Roasted pork was tender, but wasn't noticeably flavorful. Overall, my meal was fine, but nothing to write home about. I certainly would never spend an hour trying to wait for a table again. (However, I will vouch for their sister bar/yakatori joint Bar Chuko across the street!)
