The service was amazing, I went with a few friends and we were completely delighted, all started with the bacon broth which was so delish and the tuna tartar was def my favorite along with the baby burgers. We needed with the bacon donuts which went perfectly paired with the toffee ice cream. They're champagne went perfectly with our desserts. If you're in Williamsburg definitely make sure to stop by, you won't be disappointed.
