I had brunch here last Sunday (1/31).  While the food was actually quite good, I had many complaints about the restaurant, which made my experience pretty awful.  I will likely not be going back. 1) It was freezing in the restaurant.  Everyone was wearing their winter coats, some people even had winter hats and scarves on.  When I asked the waitress about it, she said it was because it was in an old building, which seemed like a strange excuse. 2) We ordered the bottomless mimosas, which was a special they advertised but it was impossible to get anyones attention to actually fill them up when we were finished.  We would ask another server, when our waitress had failed to come to our table for a very long period of time and still never had it filled up until we finally made a big deal about it. 3) I tried to order a burger, which was one of two non-breakfast foods on the menu at 1 pm and they had "run out already".  Strange they would not have more burgers that they would run out so early, or the waitress could have at least mentioned it to us when she handed us our menus. 4) The service in general was just awful.  I realize this can happen from time to time but combined with all of the other issues, it made it even worse.   So in conclusion, while the food was great, the service and cold weather made the dining experience pretty bad.
