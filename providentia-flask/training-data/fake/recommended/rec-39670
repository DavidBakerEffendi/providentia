First, Hearth has to be known for it's excellent meals, prepared with the utmost sophistication and into the smallest details for presentation. The ingredients are mostly sourced locally and you can find the details of their provenance on the menu. The staff is extra friendly and attentive happy to add the extra step that will make your experience an unforgivable one. If there were six stars, this would be one of the few restaurants to get it. When eating there the price does not matter anymore.
