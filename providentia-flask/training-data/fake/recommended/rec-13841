You know what they say about food --- the sauce makes or breaks the dish. In this case, the maple butter makes the pancakes 200% better than they'd be without it. Think "caramel", but not quite as sweet and with a wholesome buttery aroma. Also, 'm not a big fan of pancakes at all, but I have to admit that these were pretty darn good. They're really fluffy and somehow they're able to fry the top and bottom so there's a crispy shell. Moreover, you get fresh wild Maine blueberries not just on top of the stack, but in each of the pancakes, as well as between the pancakes. I really loved the hashbrowns too. The potato is soft on the inside with the same crispy shell on the top. The omelette was huge, but I detest that they only allow for two toppings (counting cheese), and each additional ingredient is $2 extra. Yes, they use the freshest ingredients, but still, it's kind of a rip-off. Anyhow, do expect to walk out having spent at least $20 on your fabulous brunch meal. Also, a word of advice --- go on a weekday when people are at work (not during breakfast, lunch, or dinner time). We tried on Sunday and there was a 2+ hour wait. Today we got there at 11am on a Wednesday and only waited 10 minutes!
