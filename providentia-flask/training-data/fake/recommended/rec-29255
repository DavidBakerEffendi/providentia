One of the best fast food burger shops around. The meat is perfectly cooked, the hot dogs are good; my only gripe is they got rid of the crinkle cut French fries. I love crinkle cut, the only thing better is steak cut. Â If you get a burger fries and a drink it will run you around 12 bucks which is on par with the industry.
