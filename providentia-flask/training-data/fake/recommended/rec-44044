Accidentally found this gem while my friends and I were roaming around in chinatown. I have seen this place every time I visited Philly but never thought it would be a Burmese restaurant since it is not exactly in the restaurant area. As a native from Burma, I can guarantee this place is 100% legit. I have tried burmese restaurants in new york city, but they weren't as good as Rangoon. My friends and I tried a thousand layers bread with chicken curry, burmese lo mein, coconut rice and spicy chicken curry, panthay noodle which is influenced by chinese and indian cuisines and as for dessert, we got the burmese farlooda. Out of all the dishes, my favorites were thousand layer bread with chicken curry, and coconut rice with spicy chicken curry. If you have never tried Burmese food, I recommend you try those two dishes. They definitely highlights the essence of burmese cuisine. Burmese lo mein and panthay noodle were good but not a must have. My friends who have never tried Burmese food before absolutely loved the dishes. The prices are very reasonable as well. The amount of food is generous and extraordinary. We all left the place full and satisfied. The staff is friendly. They aren't always attentive to you but always within reach if you need something. Â The atmosphere is nice and peaceful. I absolutely recommend this place to whoever visiting Philadelphia, no matter whether you are native burmese or not. You wouldn't regret coming here.
