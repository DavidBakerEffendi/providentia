First time in little Italy and we picked an amazing restaurant to eat at. The staff was wonderful, extremely patient and friendly. The bread was wonderful!!!! The food was amazing and best of all, the owner was sitting outside sharing his wonderful stories about growing up in the neighborhood with my husband and I. I would recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends. I can't wait to go back.
