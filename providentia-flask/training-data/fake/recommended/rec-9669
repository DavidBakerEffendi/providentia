Went to Pio Pio for dinner with my wife because of a recommendation from my co-workers and boy were we both impressed.  We shared the Metador combo and I was glad we did.  We were not expecting it, but the servers came out with a barrage of about 6 different plates of food.  It came with chicken, French fries mixed with pieces of what looked like and tasted like hot dogs, plantains, rice & beans, and a few other things.  The food was very good.  I will definitely go there again.  Next time I'll be more courageous and try their ceviche dishes which seemed very appetizing.  The atmosphere was very cool and I was surprised to see that there was a whole other floor beneath us full of diners.  What was best was how inexpensive the bill was, which is always a plus.
