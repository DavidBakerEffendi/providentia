Perfecto!   I can figure out why it only has 4.5 stars?!?    The food was amazing.  I highly recommend the grille calamari app. - this is the way it should be served, fresh, light, literally melt in your mouth.  Service was over the top. Seating was tight, but I have to tell you, it was a great atmosphere! Everyone there seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their dinner and company and you still could have a private conversation.  Can't give this enough praise.  We will definitely be back, and probably will be a reason to just go to the city!  We live NW of Philly and it takes us 1-1.5hrs because of traffic.
