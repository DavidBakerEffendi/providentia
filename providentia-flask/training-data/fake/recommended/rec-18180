This bar is managed by the same people who run the Memphis Taproom, one of my favorite bars in the city.  Despite this fact, and that L44 is 2 blocks away from my place, and that I love beer and pub food, I've only been here 4 times.  The reason why?  Compared to Memphis, the menu offers pretty slim pickings.  I'm vegetarian and I've gotten the mushroom po'boy and the veggie burger.  Both were ok, but nothing special. The real kicker about this place is their seating policy.  On two different occassions, I've shown up there with 4-8 people who wanted to get drinks.  Even at 11pm, they didn't want to seat us, claiming that they have to keep these (empty) tables for dining parties only.  We practically had to beg them to seat us, and promise to order fries if they did.  I can't think of another bar that would turn away a large, thirsty party because they're not eating, especially at that hour of night. The beers are good, and pretty affordable.  I really want to like this place, and to treat it like the local watering hole its supposed to be.  It should be like shooting fish in a barrel, since there are not alot of pubs like Local 44 in the area.
