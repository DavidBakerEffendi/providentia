Enter Rye - a prohibitionist style meets hipsterdom culinary jewel in Williamsburg. Allow the skilled bearded and tattooed bartender to make you the 'rye stirred', a cocktail consisting of a delicious concoction of rye, bitters, and absinthe rinse. Make no mistake, this place is all business when it comes to food. The portions are moderate, leaving room for dessert. It was a hot summer evening so I decided to keep things light - a mixed greens salad and the halibut, served on a bed of 'tomato water' and other veggies. Close it out with a chocolate fondant and you're all set.
