As of today, October 16, this restaurant has increased their pricing for several items. These changes have not been reflected in their online menu, and you will not be verbally informed of these changes when placing an order over the phone. Specifically the tacos (+$1) and small guacamole (+$2). The restaurant states their website will be updated within a few weeks. In addition, this restaurant does have a delivery charge of $2, which I've not seen mentioned on their website or been told by the person taking phone orders.
