Definitely my favorite Ramen place in the city thus far!  Nice little Ramen shop tucked away in Alphabet City.  You should definitely bring a good appetite as the bowls are a generous size.  I usually order extra pork or chicken though as I carry a very big appetite when I come to this place. :)  My favorites are the Spicy Miso Ramen and the Toroniku Ramen (slow cooked pork).  You can choose different noodles than the ones that are usually paired with the dishes (I usually go for the thick noodles for more overall chewiness).   The cold tofu (especially in summer) and gyoza are my favorite starters.  The service is excellent and attentive as I usually get served my order in around 5 mins.  Overall a great little place you should definitely check out for some great Ramen!
