Listen ya'll, I'm not a vegtarian but JUST TRY and tear me away from a Kung Fu Hoagies and you might want to check yourself. These guys drove all in on my turf for a weekend food festival and had my food nose radar standing at attention right away. I ordered a beef seitan Bahn Mi with a little extra sriracha sauce for good measure and was not let down. I tore into that bad boy like a 5 year tearing into a Christmas morning present. It was amazing. The seitan was tender, flavorfully sweet and in abundance. The roll was soft on the inside and had a crisp crust on the outside. The pickled veggies were tart and sweet at the same time and gave that extra snap that pulled the sandwich together deliciously. A+ my friends. This is some good eats!
