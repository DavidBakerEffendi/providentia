Pizza - pretty good Marinated veggies - really good- somewhat small stamp pasta - really good but way too small for a meal (don't get it). Bread of course is brought to the table - AWESOME! Waitress had a great sense of humor.  Gave one of our guys a hard time which so too funny.  Definitely would return. If you have never tried octopus, this is the place to get it.  It was really good and tender.
