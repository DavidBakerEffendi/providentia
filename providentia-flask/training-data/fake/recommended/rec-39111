I took my sister here for her birthday dinner on a Thursday night. Very fun atmosphere with lively music and great lighting. The food was very yummy and the wait staff seemed to be on point. I would definitely recommend it for a date night with that special someone. We ordered the fresh spring rolls and they lacked flavor so we went with the fried rolls which were amazingly flavorful and came with a fun dipping sauce.
