Vegetarian sushi joint owned by an Israeli haute chef? Yep! This place is awesome! The plates are beautiful. Flavor profiles are nuanced and unexpected. Â I don't have a favorite roll yet because I want to try a different one every time I come. The place itself is small, but the ambience is nice. The guys who work there are really friendly, including the owner who has been there every single time I've gone. The prices are UNBELIEVABLY reasonable. Such a good deal. Holy. Wow. This place makes me so happy for so many reasons... I highly doubt you'll even miss the meat, but then again, I don't really care if you do because a. more for me and b. I'm sure this place will garner enough of a following without begrudging carnivores. FYI, strict vegans, you are not totally in the clear. They do use some egg and dairy, but it's fairly evident where. I think the jalapeno wasabi sauce is mayo based.... just ask!
