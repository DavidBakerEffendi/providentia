We went here the day after 4th of July and it was not busy at all at about 5pm. I noticed a few different servers, but maybe because it was a Friday night. I never saw female servers on the floor before. The service was much better from the previous times I've been here (Joao was our server). He was attentive and checked on us. The food was very good as usual and the salad, much better than the last time I was there. I had the mussels in green sauce which was excellent for an appetizer. All in all, I'm happy and one of my favorite places to dine. I don't know if parking is a problem to some, as I park down the street and walk. So you work up an appetite for all the food you get!
