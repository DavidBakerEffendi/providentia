Now I can die.   At first I must admit that I was skeptical.  I'm from the land of the hoagie.  Some south Philly joint is gunna make the world's best.  Fuggedaboutit. But much to my surprise, this is the real deal.  I was totally blown away.  I watched as they carefully prepared my Old Fashioned Italian, which was meticulously assembled.  The service was very good and pleasant.  But I wasn't there for service.  I was there for the best hoagie in 'Merica.  When my medium showed up wrapped in paper, I squeezed the bread, which seemed kinda soft.  But as I took my first bite, I was very pleased indeed.  Very nice. This was hands down the best hoagie I've had, and I am a finicky hoagie connoisseur.  My hat is off to Sarcone's Deli. As I said in the beginning, now I can die. PS - Attire?  What are you bloody kidding me?  It's a deli! Day 2 - You know I had to go back.  They never dissapoint.  Very nice.  Get the Olde Fashioned Italian.  Fuggedaboutit!
