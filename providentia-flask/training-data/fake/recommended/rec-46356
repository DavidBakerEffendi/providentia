Completely and utterly a disgrace of an establishment. The service is ABYSMAL and the host was rude and a racist. When we asked to be seated at an alternative table (as we didn't want to be packed in the back of the room) he said that this was the ONLY table or we could sit at the bar. Now, there were other tables clearly available. When my date (who was white pressed) the host said "don't play the race card with me." My date was furious, told him to go f**k himself and then we left. Some people are just not for the service industry especially if they have an issue with serving people of color.
