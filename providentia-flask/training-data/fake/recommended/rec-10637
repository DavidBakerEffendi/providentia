Boonton has a number of very interesting restaurants and here is another to add to the list.  A nice roomy place on Main Street, Latin American serves up delicious Honduran and Mexican dishes.  If you are new to the Honduran variety of Latin American food, try the Bandeja Hondurena (honduran Platter) which has a really flavorful chuleta de cerdo frita (Fried pork cutlet), Honduran cheese (queso blanco), black beans, rice, and your choice of either tortillas or platanos.  The platanos are usually of the tostone variety (more starchy().  If you prefer the maduros (sweeter), they can usually accomodate.  My wife had the enchiladas made with beef, cabbage,queso, hard-boiled egg.   many other temptations that we will try in the future - pupusas, steak with onions,  tacos, carne asada and so on. You are treated like family here and it provides a nice casual relaxing lunch or dinner.
