Okay, so in short...if you want to read an "exploratory" Menu, eat Mediocre food and spend a lot of Money then go to Cookshop.  Seriously the only things our party loved was the wine and the chocolate chip cookies.  They should probably change their name to Cook"ie"shop.  It won't cost them much to rebrand.
