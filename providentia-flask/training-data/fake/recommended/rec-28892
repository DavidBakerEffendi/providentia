My girl friend and I went to the Society Hill Society after the kitchen was closed, so only we could eat(drink) was drinks. The servers were so nice to us. However, only downside would be the ladies rooms. There were girls never came out.. Oh well, other then that, everything was so great. I tried a drink and didn't like it and the server changed my order that I am familiar with. How nice. The rejected cocktail was $15..... Thank you....
