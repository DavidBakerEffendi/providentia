I went here for dinner on a Sunday night with my gf and one other couple after a movie.  Here was my experience: We asked the waitress what she recommended and ordered the following: 1)  yellowtail (6 pieces of small fish) 2)  wings (6 wings) 3)  a rice, vegetable and egg dish 4)  mini chicken meatballs (6) One guy had a beer and the rest of us just drank water.  The bill was $140 ($70 per couple). For this I ate:  1 piece of yellowtail, 2 winds, a small plate of rice with some vegetables, and 1.5 mini chicken meatballs. The food was all reasonably tasty but nothing amazing and the portions were tiny and expensive. I left hungry and went home and had a bowl of cereal. Not exactly what I am looking for when I go out to eat!
