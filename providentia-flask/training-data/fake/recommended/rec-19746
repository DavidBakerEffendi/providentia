Awesome spot! Good selection of beers, awesome bartenders, great music, and they have a skee-ball machine.  :-) Along with everything above they also have probably the best burger I've ever had in NYC....I've lived here 10 years by the way.  Cooked right excellent beef and they have a cool variety of heater tots to complete the gut bomb that is completely worth the food coma that soon follows.  They will also melt cheese on the tots to complete the heart attack...but SO worth it...AWESOME burger....great specials...cool people....and great music....just go its a no brainer
