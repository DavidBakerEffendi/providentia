I took my father here for Father's Day and had a wonderful experience. The food is excellent and the service is great! I started with vegetable samosas... and they were the best I've ever had! I'm not sure what exactly was so good about it, but I think it was the filling that tasted so good. My wife tried a bite and agreed. For the main course, I ordered the saag paneer, which is basically spinach and cubes of cheese over rice. It was pretty good and certainly satisfied my appetite. My wife tried the bhindi masala, which is sauteed okra with other spices and veggies, and she LOVED it! They also served Gulab Jamun (cheese ball dipped in syrup) for dessert for free! I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some spicy food!
