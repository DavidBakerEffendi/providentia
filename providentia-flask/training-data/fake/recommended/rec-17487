I've been here a few times now, and it's definitely one of my go-to places in Montclair when I wanna get something quick & tasty. The falafel here is delicious and unlike other places I've been to -- the red cabbage & pickles adds a fantastic addition to something already so good. We also had the Falafel Hut wrap, which has french fries and hummus included in a falafel wrap, and it was AWESOME. It's a pretty small looking place, but they can probably accommodate larger groups if they have to. Cheap, quick, healthier than most, and delicious -- definitely gonna be coming back again & again.
