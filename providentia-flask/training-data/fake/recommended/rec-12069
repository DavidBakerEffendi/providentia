Delivers were taking over an hour in most cases, so I was curious how things were looking there at Marco's so I placed a pick up order and went inside for the first time... I may be just fussy about cleanseleanness, however my instinct tells me otherwise. Really run down inside. Staff really needs to adhere to food safty rules too.. Just sit at a table for 5 min. and observe... you'll see. BTW I waited 20 min. for my pick up phone order, and I showed up when I was told it would be ready. Â The food taste great non the less, but not worth my family's safty. Sorry Marco's we will miss your yummy pizza.
