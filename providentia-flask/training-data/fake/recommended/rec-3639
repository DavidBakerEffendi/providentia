Sorry to duplicate the review right under me but I also had the tater bowl and need to compliment Jimmy's diner on serving up the best brunch I have had in a long time, maybe ever. They aren't really tater tots but more like fried mashed potatoes, which complimented the egg and guac really nicely. The crunchy french toast may have been the highlight though which was shared as a third dish because we couldn't resist getting something sweet. Not sure if it was corn flakes used but whatever it was tasted of divine perfection. The wait was shorter than we were told originally and the service was fast once we sat. Everyone's food around us was stare-worthy and I think I am guna go back next weekend for dinner it was that good.
