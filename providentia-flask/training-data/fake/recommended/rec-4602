I always come here at 2am after the New Haven bars close. Good hookah. Not the best middle eastern food in the world but still pretty good! Mango juice is awesome! shish kebab and syrian rice are delicious. relaxed environment. cute $5 mamouns t shirts to buy that i wear all the time. the grateful dead used to hang out here. also incredibly cheap. baba ganush not the best, but still come here once a month for cheap middle food :)
