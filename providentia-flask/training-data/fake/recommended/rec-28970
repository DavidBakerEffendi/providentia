On the whole, we enjoyed our dining experience at a.kitchen. There were pluses and minuses.  I thought the hostess had a difficult attitude, so I was wary when we arrived.  However, the exceptional service we had during the meal made up for that. The service really was great.  No matter who was our assigned server, everyone in the restaurant helped in some way. This was a real plus as dishes did not sit, the check did not sit, and we received a lot of attention. The atmosphere is a bit challenging. It is a small, busy place, with one or two more tables than it should have. The server for the table next to us had to squish between our two tables.  It was frenetic and loud. The food is excellent.  The plates are on the smaller size, but priced appropriately.  Expect to order two to three dishes per person.  We started with a salad with blue cheese and pears.  The salads were large and extremely tasty.  We then had one scallop dish - perfectly prepared -- and the lamb bolognese, which was exceptional.  For dessert, we had the pound cake. A perfect size grilled with ice cream.   I would return to a.kitchen. There are so many competing restaurants in the area, but this really stood out to me.
