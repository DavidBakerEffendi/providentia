I could write a book about how good everything was at this place but it would take too long to go into the details. I cannot recommend this place more!! Easily my Top 2-3 favorite places for pizza in the city. Paulie Gee himself sat at our table and talked pizza with us after we finished dinner. We discussed all the great pizza places in the city with him and a local couple at the table next to us. He agreed with a lot of my Top 10 choices for pizza in the city. I was with a friend from out of town and he still can't stop talking about how good it was. The only downside is the location. I've only been there 3x cuz it's so out of the way in Greenpoint. But every time someone comes to town, I feel obligated to drag them out to have easily some of the BEST PIZZA IN THE CITY!!
