I can't believe the reviews this place got. I ordered from here in a pinch when I was starving. I fired up yelp even though I know everything to eat around here and noticed this Chinese delivery joint with a great rating and I was able to order directly through Yelp which was even more tempting. Another reviewer said the general tsos was good so I did that and some fried rice.   As soon as I saw the chicken I was disappointed. For the price and ratings(his place is very pricy for delivery) I was expecting some chicken on a china pavilion level. Instead what I saw was chicken covered in a thick breading with possibly the most thick, syrup like sauce imaginable dumped all over it. Every piece of chicken was chewy. I ended up going to dumbass Burger King. The chicken fried rice was also mushy and lacked any flavor or texture. Avoid.  Baos is cheaper, and better quality food, and I even avoid Baos and would rather go to china pavilion any day.
