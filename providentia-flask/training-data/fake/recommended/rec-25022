This place sucks. The wings are the smallest I've ever had, more like chicken toes. I ordered a chicken panini and when I got home discovered I was given a Cuban panini. I also ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, it was awful. The chicken was rubber. I'm usually not much of a picky eater but I took two Bites and threw the rest out. I will not be a returning customer.
