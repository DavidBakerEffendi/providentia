Had the Rye Slam here one weekend and it was pretty damn good. A tad more money that your casual breakfast might be, but it was plus quality. But then, all of a sudden! I came back during happy hour and had the $5 cheeseburger. It was all that one can ask for and more at the 7PM weekday hour. Two patties, double cheese, some greens, a light sauce of some sort - just the best. I will be back at LEAST for a hundred more cheeseburgers.
