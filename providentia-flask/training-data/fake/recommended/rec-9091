Inconsistent food, first time we went great and second time mediocre. But what is so disappointing here is the service. For price you pay one would expect excellent service. But staff rushes through order taking and it feels laborious for them to read specials. Just feels like the place is run more as a money machine versus a customer oriented venue. Shame
