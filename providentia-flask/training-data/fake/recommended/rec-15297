Normal fried rings and french fries. Chicken strips were standard. Cash only. The place wasnt super clean or super nice, bathrooms were single use. You couldn't get free water for kids, and they specifically stated "no free water". The cheesesteaks were average, nothing you couldn't find anywhere else. Chipped meat, cheez whiz, onions and bread. As a tourist, I was underwhelmed. I wouldn't say prices were 1 $ either, but perhaps that could be due to city inflation.
