Best in the state!!! Don't let the funky exterior fool ya come on in and have some down home comfort food. We have never been disappointed whether it's ribs, outrageously delicious pulled pork or crispy fried chicken. We have run through most of the BBQ place on Pigtrip.net in CT and let us save us you a trip...this is still the BEST!
