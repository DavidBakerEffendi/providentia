Being a huge fan of seafood and somewhat familiarized with Nix Mate out of Boston I was so happy to hear they were opening a location in Hartford. I was lucky enough to be be invited to the VIP Cocktail event this evening and I was extremely impressed. Beautiful bright open space and chic decor. There's a small but nice space for dancing, and many options for seating. High tables at the bar, a dining area, outside or over-sized couches that give you a lounge feel. The food especially the pan seared scallops (just a sampling) tasted great and drinks were well made. I can see this being a great place for the after work crowd and those who enjoy live music or feel like dancing to the tunes of a DJ. I plan on returning and will update my review if I need to but so far so good. This is definitely another great addition to the Front Street community!
