What, what! This place is a gem of a find. I never thought I would fall in love with a panini but I have, madly in love with the Bresaola panini. I would sacrifice dessert for this sandwich and that is no small feat. Their crostini's are super delicious! I would recommend getting their special of the day since they always look like the best thing not on the menu.
