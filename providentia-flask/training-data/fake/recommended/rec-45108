I have to say, perhaps this was an off night on the menu (since it changes daily) or maybe it was the bottle of wine I drank w/ dinner, but I was slightly underwhelmed by the food. The service and the ambiance?  5 stars. But the gnocchi that came w/ our goat ragout was not good - then again, I'm not a huge gnocchi fan, but I appreciate it when it's done right.  That being said, the scallops were OUT OF THIS WORLD. Entrees = duck (tasty), lamb (also tasty), but neither of these stood out as WOW to me.  The bf got the salmon which was by far the best of the three.
