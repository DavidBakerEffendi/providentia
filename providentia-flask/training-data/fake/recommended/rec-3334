Most of the Dish's signature and most loved dishes are nothing more than blue box and deserts.  The Dish is good for drinks, deserts and some appetizers but I would not recommend for dinner.   Dinner prices are really off the wall in my estimation.  If you are going to have a restaurant that serves signature dishes that are primarily pasta and vegtible and very few meat or seafood dishes you need to have prices that match to that.  I am really not a big fan of any of the dishes that are available on their menu.  I typically am of the mindset, if I know I can make it better at home for 1/4 the price why would i go out to eat something that isn't made as good as I could make it.  My meal was being rejected by my stomach as I was eating it.  I had the calamari appetizer and some sort of seafood pie both of which I was not a fan of and left me hungry as I left the restaurant.  Too bad because I passed on the chance to try their best food that they offer, desert.   The ambiance is similar to a building 19, you can see the exposed pipes in the ceiling which I am not a fan of, other people think it is artistic.  Our waiter did not tell us the specials or do anything other than take our order and recommend three dishes that the people at our table selected and consequently got sick on.
