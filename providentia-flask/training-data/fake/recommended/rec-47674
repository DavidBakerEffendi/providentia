It comes off a bit snobbish looks wise, but underneath it's a great place with a well thought out menu. I have eaten here multiple times now & have thoroughly enjoyed my meals! The food can be a bit pricey but I have no complaints with the service or serving sizes. Definitely worth a look! Sit outside if the weather is right :)
