Well worth the 1.5 hour wait, we got to explore the lower east side as well! When we finally looked at the menu we were absolutely stumped as to what to order- we wished we could have ordered everything! I eventually settled on some blueberry pancakes and I don't regret my choice one bit. It arrived speedily, which was great because I was really hungry after the wait. Really soft, warm, not too sweet! I enjoyed it very much. The place doesn't have many seats but I can see why this place is so popular. The variety in the menu isn't exotic but it has a good selection of savoury and sweet; there's something for everyone. We also got scrambled eggs to share. I know they are really basic and you can really do it yourself at home but.. They were just the perfect scrambled eggs! Not too milky, served with multigrain toast, a little bit of smoked salmon and avocado on the side. It hits the spot I'd come back here again
