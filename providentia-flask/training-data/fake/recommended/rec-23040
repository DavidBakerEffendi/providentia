FOOD: The food here is pretty good and on the fancy side.  I had their duck dish, which was one of their specials that day.  It was flavorful, moist, and tender.  My Dad had a pork dish and my Mom had a Shelburne Farms chicken dish.  We all shared a bit of our dishes with each other and we enjoyed each other's dishes as well.  The bread that they served before the meal was very fluffy and memorable. SERVICE: The hostess greeted us promptly and brought us to a table quickly. The waitress was friendly and helped us promptly.  I thought wait staff at the front of the restaurant was wonderful, but it did seem like quite a while before we got our food and my parents agreed.  They might have been understaffed in the kitchen that day, not sure.  There was also only two tables being served at the time we entered. CLEANLINESS: The placed is very clean.  Not sure of the restrooms since I didn't use them. ATMOSPHERE: The place is very beautiful and cozy feeling.  Even though the place is only a restaurant, they place felt like a fancy Bed & Breakfast and I liked it.  Great for a romantic meal or relaxing meal.  The place is very nice for the area that it's in and not what you expect when walking in. OTHER NOTES: They had a Visa and Mastercard sign on their door.  Not sure, if they accept other credit cards or not.  Even though I thought the food was very good I did felt like it was a bit on the pricey side for what you're getting, but maybe that's just me.  We each had a dishes, no appetizers except for the small plate of bread they served, a soda, coffee, and orange juice for a total of $74 with tip.  There is also an upstairs dining area, but I didn't check it out and we ate downstairs.
