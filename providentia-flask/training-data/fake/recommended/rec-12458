So I have really wonderful memories of my uncle's famous waffles. And as much as it hurts to say, this breakfast place probably has one of the best waffles I have every had. Busy busy busy place! We came at about 9:00 on a Monday (regular Monday) and it was packed. We only waited 5 minutes and were seated promptly. Since we are not big eaters, my sister and I shared the special Vanilla Bean Waffles and an order of sugar cured bacon. Good thing! The portions are huge and most of the other patrons finished about half their entrees. The waffle was nice and fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. It was topped with this peach/cherry compote and heavenly vanilla bean whipped cream. The whip cream alone is noteworthy since I almost polished it off with just my spoon at the end. On the side was a caramel-y maple syrup that was fun to drizzle as well. Cash only but I did see an ATM across the street. It's popular with tourists and locals alike (when we were there we noticed there were a lot of tourists) so make sure you get there early.
