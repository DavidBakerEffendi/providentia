i haven't been to china pan in years, but went over the weekend as a send-off for one of my vegan friends.  well, it hasn't changed at ALL since the last time i have been there... literally the same menu and the same decor (the bathroom looks like it's from 1985).  i guess if you have something that works, why change it right? if you like meats, the chinese food is average chinese food quality.  the real draw here is the vegan/vegetarian menu -- it is extensive.  i will always order off the meatless dishes as i know it's their specialty. our group had the vegan chicken & broccoli, citrus spare ribs & the vegan silver chicken balls -- all were delicious.  we also got two sushi rolls -- this is the first time i have ordered sushi here, and i probably wouldn't order it again.  they were "meh" and the waiter had to ask us several times what roll we wanted because their menu is HUGE.   service was good.  we had a large group and they were attentive -- our waiter got extremely flustered when we asked him to split the bills, but it ended up working out in the end.   overall, this place is solid.  if i want adventurous vegan/veggie chinese food i will come here, if i am in the area.  otherwise i enjoy my local chinese take out on the way home from work.
