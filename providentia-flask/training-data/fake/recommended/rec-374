My roommate owed me a lady-date so she took me to Tia Pol for a 5-course tasting with wine pairings. The place itself is so cute and intimate. It's very small, and most tables only seat two. Patatas bravas, always a must at a tapas restaurants. After having been to several more tapas places, I will say that Tia Pol does them particularly well. The pimientos were way overly salty, and some of the seeds weren't cooked all the way, making them absurdly spicy to eat. The Shrimp were excellent, garlicky and buttery as expected I came back again for lunch with coworkers and ordered most of the same dishes, along with a pork sandwich which was very good! Overall, I would say this is a wonderful tapas place. Can't comment of the price since I didn't pay for it either time, but Tia Pol is pretty high up there on my list of tapas restaurants.
