Came in while they were finishing up a science night. Grabbed a seat at the bar, Yuengling and a Miller light, both good then had a 12oz Ribeye Special, it was a great cut of meat and was cooked perfectly. I'd recommend this place to a young couple, not so much a kid friendly place but most of the nightlife here isn't.
