Ehhhhhhhh... Just ate there, service for the most part was nice, our waiter was friendly, attentive and polite. The food however was quite boring. we ordered the yellow rice and chicken for two, and some how they managed to suck the flavor out of the red and green peppers as well. For the prices they were asking some salt and pepper or ANY other seasonings would have been nice. Also this place is the Mamba TEA house, when we asked what was available to drink we were given our "glorious" selection of soft drinks and a "sweetened" iced tea.... aBoooooooo. So I'm sorry to say I will not be back or recommend this resturant to anyone who likes food as more than a means of self presevation.
