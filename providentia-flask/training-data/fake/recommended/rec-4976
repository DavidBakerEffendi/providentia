They get 3 stars for moist, fatty brisket; heavily spiced but lacked seasoning! Fresh cracked black pepper w coffee rub NEEDS SALT! Their pulled pork...WHAT can I say, NOT! Moist, again, but NO seasoning to be found, except for this off-putting sweet, gamey-ness. They salvaged themselves with their unctuous, well-seasoned lamb belly...they delivered! Will be back to try their ribs & sides...but no rush.
