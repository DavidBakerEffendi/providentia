Honestly the best pizza and beer in Vermont! I have been coming here for years and it is always top notch. Fresh local ingredients on the pizzas and extensive microbrews. Brick oven style pizza that will tempt you into eating every bite. The wide range of beers will please every personal taste. They let you sample and are always there to lend some advice. Great for a casual date or just to catch up with friends.
