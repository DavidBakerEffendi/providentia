I am a katsu enthusiast to put it lightly. I have gone to many places and have had some of the local katsu. There were some really great places in San Francisco and some other great ones in New York. I went to Japan last summer with my family and had some of the best katsu ever there. This place is by far the most authentic katsu you're not only going to find in New York, but the United States. The bread crumbs are absolutely perfect, the chicken or pork is really think and juicy and it makes me feel like I am in Japan again. The pricing on it is a little high for what you get. You may not get a lot of pieces, but the thickness of the meat makes up for the smaller number of katsu you get. If you are into katsu, this is the place to check out.
