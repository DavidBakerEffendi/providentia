I had my daughter's One Year Old cake for 50 plp made at this place. Every other place I had gone in SI needed at least 2-3 weeks notice. At Bruno's, chef Settepani was OK with one week notice, with changes being made up to one -night before, if necessary. Â I didn't require any changes but it was good to know. The suggestions from the chef were great. The end-result was fantastic! Fresh, delicious and looked great! I highly recommend them
