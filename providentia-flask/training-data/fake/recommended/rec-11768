DELICIOUS food, excellent service, spacious setting. I had the rack of lamb, the spread sampler for appetizer, and split rice pudding for dessert. Everything was excellent!! Would definitely come again and highly recommend. Prices are fair for the quality of food and attentive but not overbearing service.
