I'm giving this place five stars solely for the food and the service.  The decor is non-existent, but they only only opened two weeks ago, so I'm sure they'll figure out the decor and table arrangements soon.  My husband and I live in Hell's Kitchen and we have been pretty bored with the sweet/bland Thai restaurants in our neighborhood.  So, you can imagine our delight when we tried out this restaurant and the dishes were unique and packed with flavor and heat.  I mean, seriously, the food here is amazing.  We ordered the papaya salad with mixed seafood and the vegetarian duck with eggplant, basil and curry.  Both dishes were amazingly fresh and flavorful.  We can't wait to go back again soon and try more dishes.
