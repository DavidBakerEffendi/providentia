My wife and I ate outside on a Friday night. They've got Â a good selection of esoteric beers, the one I chose was $6.00 a glass. We both ordered the eggplant parm which was served with fresh mozzarella on a ciabatta roll. It was excellent. The french fries that came with it were also superior. My wife and I split a peach cobbler dessert which was also excellent. Service was very attentive and friendly. We had tickets for the sketch comedy show upstairs which ended our evening on a high note.
