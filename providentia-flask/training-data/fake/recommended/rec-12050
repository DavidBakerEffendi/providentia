I can't help but give Jim Dandy's a great review. The food is fantastic! The wings are meaty and crisp, and the ribs are falling off the bone. The prices are fair, and they have a bar next door for anyone who wants to wash down their meal with a beer. Yet, it's a family place that's clean and lively enough for the kids. The service could always be better, but I didn't walk in here expecting a fine dining experience. That's not why you go to Jim's. You go for the food, plain and simple.
