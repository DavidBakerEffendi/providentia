Completely out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood- which we don't. Also, unluckily for us, the subway line was closed and we had to take a bus and then walk abt 15 mins. Ehh The bourbon peach french toast was delicious. The fried chic ken was pretty good but not worth the hour long trip from Manhattan. The BBQed shrimp and grits were creamy and rich
