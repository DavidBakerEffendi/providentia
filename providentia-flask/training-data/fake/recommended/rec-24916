Crispy duck salad is the best!   Love this place for upscale.  trendy spot in center city with moderate prices.   Great experience.  Michael was my bartender and he had to put up with the rudest girl I've ever seen.   She waited  a mere minute for attention and then put up a fuss.    Wish there was a YELP for customers.   She was nasty.
