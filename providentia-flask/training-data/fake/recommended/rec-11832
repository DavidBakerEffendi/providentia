Honestly, one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  I came here for a special occasion and continue to have lasting memories of my meal.  It's dim, slightly woodsy with high ceilings and tall windows almost makes it feel like you're inside an aquarium being watched by curious passerbys.  Dinner included an order of halibut and skirt steak, not both for me of course, but I would order either on a repeat visit.   The meal was on the pricey side, but the experience was gratifying enough to justify it!
