I go to Masala frequently as they put up with the big groups that I often dine with.  And I know that big groups are harder for servers to manage but often times the service here is awful plain and simple.  The last time I was there the waiter ignored requests for water, opening wine, ordering more food, he would just ignore our tables altogether.   The food is good but it's overpriced for what it is.
