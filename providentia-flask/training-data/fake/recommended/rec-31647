The sushi and rolls are average. I've seen many reviews touting this place as 'the best sushi in bayonne'. I'd like to reinterpret that statement as 'the best value on decent sushi in bayonne' Had sushi app, and several rolls. My favorite was the salmon skin roll. The decor is lazy and dated but that's why the food is 50% off.
