HOLY MOTHER OF GOODNESS.  I went with my friend and my 11 year old daughter on a Friday evening (early, aronund 6ish).  It was a nice warm day so we got to sit out back in the patio area.  It was sooooo lovely!  No wait at this time. The wait staff was excellent, making great recommendations.  Drinks were great, food was SPECTACULAR!!!  Very hearty, very filling.  Just right!  They even have plenty of options for non meat eaters.  I licked my fingers like no tmrw!  I will definitey frequent this place alot!  NOTE: the location is a nice size, but not BIG at all.  On our way out, there was quite a wait.  It will be worth it though. =)
