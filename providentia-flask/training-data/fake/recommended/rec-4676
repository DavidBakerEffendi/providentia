Solid eats. Two of us walked in at 6pm on a Saturday and the place started filling up from there. Reservations are recommended. Chicken Empanadas as an app were on point and the Ropa Viejas (beef w/peppers and onions in a slightly spicy sauce) and Pollo Sol de Cuba (crisply cooked tasty chicken with a mango bean salsa) were better than I imagined reading the menu. Add some fried plantains and you cant go wrong. We got out of there full for a relatively good price. Worth it.
