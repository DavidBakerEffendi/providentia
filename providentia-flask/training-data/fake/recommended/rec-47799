I have been craving BBQ for awhile.  I didn't expect to find anything decent in New Haven, but I saw Uncle Willie's while driving toward the I95 entrance, so I decided to stop in and try it out.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the BBQ.  I had the beef brisket dinner with a side of mac n cheese and cornbread.  The brisket was well seasoned and very tender.  The cornbread was a little on the dry side, but still delicious.  The mac n cheese was nothing special, but still delicious enough for me to finish and suffer through the post-fatty-meal angina.  The bbq at Uncle Willie's satisfied my craving, and I will definitely be going back.
