The Capri and Chicken salad sammys are my favorite.  The bread is great when they have it, get there early or they will certainly be sold out.  I've heard great things about the soup too, it's a bit pricey for lunch if you are accustomed to the $5 or $6 food truck deals in the area. This was my go to spot when I worked in CC.
