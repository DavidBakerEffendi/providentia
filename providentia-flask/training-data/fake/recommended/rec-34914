My absolute favorite Indian restaurant!  I used to live in the apartment complex next door to the strip mall it's in and LOVED going over - my favorite it the Chicken Tikka Masala, and now that I am about t 20 minutes away don't eat it nearly as often and MISS IT.  Staff always friendly and happy to see us :) Don't miss out - this is a great place!
