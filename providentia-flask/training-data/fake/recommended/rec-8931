This place is very innovative in its concept. I ate all my food, I was very pleased with the taste and the service was more than what I could have ever asked for. The only reason why this place does not get a five star is because of the poor choice in entree options. I am 100% not being sarcastic when I say there were only 7 item choices for dinner. I cannot complain because the food was excellent but at the same time, I can complain because if I had options I probably would have been initially appealed by something else. I can say that each dish seems hand crafted especially for the person who it is intended for, which makes me feel so special! (joking). On a serious note, there is a lot of care put into each dish and it feels very refreshing to not be eating chain restaurant food or mass made food.
