The bistro burger is pretty good here.  Very thick and juicy in a very classic way.  By the same classic token though, the burger isn't incredibly memorable because it's just a solid well made burger.  The bacon in the bistro burger helps quite a bit. The chili burger is pretty mediocre.  It's the open face sandwich type, and the chili just doesn't have enough flavor to carry the dish. Good fries, nice and thin and crispy.
