Been here twice now. First time i had beef ribs and they were tasty, but the chicken was way overcooked and very dry. My friend ordered the T bone and was very happy with his choice. I recently had delivery and the chicken was tasty and juicy, but the pork ribs were way too dry and i could not even finish. If they were more consistent with the good stuff, it would be a sure shot spot for deliveries when i don't feel like cooking and they would earn another star. So roll the dice, get you some, and hopefully ENJOY!!!
