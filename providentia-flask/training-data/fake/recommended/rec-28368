I love Diner.  Absolutely love it.  So when the owners opened up Marlow & Sons, I had to give it a shot, especially after hearing so many people rave about it.  I did read a few reviews on here, however, that complained about the level of salt in the food...and boy oh boy, they weren't kidding.  What an absolute disappointment my meal was.  EVERYTHING was too salty.  And not just kind of, maybe, sort of too salty...but like an entire container of salt had fallen into each and every dish.  It was inedible.  All of it. I'll leave open the possibility that maybe I just hit it on an off night...but with so many other good restaurants in Williamsburg (that won't try and raise your blood pressure to heart attack-causing levels), there's really no reason for me to give M&S a second shot.  I'd rather just spend my money elsewhere, at places where I know I can get a good meal.
