Penelope was okay...I mean, it was really good, but I definitely do not think it is worth the 1.5 hour wait (although because I went at 1:30pm, the wait was actually only 45 minutes). I ordered the salmon wrapped poached eggs - the eggs were done perfectly and the salmon was tender and juicy. The green goddess dressing (not actually green, but white) paired really well with the salmon, so all in all, this was a very tasty dish - one that I would order again if I do find myself waiting an hour + for a table here. This dish was from the prix-fix menu and I ordered a grapefruit juice. I was surprised to find that the juice was warm! I mean, it wouldn't hurt to chill it a little bit (or the grapefruits) prior to serving. I appreciated that the juice was freshly squeezed, but the tepid temperature definitely threw me off and planted a frown on my face. I don't want to say that the dish didn't cost the $15 I paid, but it did leave me quite dissatisfied with the experience. I wouldn't say I'm a fan of Penelope, but the food is good and it is definitely an experience one has to go through if passing through NYC!
