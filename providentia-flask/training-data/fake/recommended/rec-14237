I walked to Chinatown from my corporate hotel and this is just on the edge of the area. It seats about 60 people and it wasn't so busy just before closing time. I ordered the chicken curry dumplings and the beef brisket hand torn noodles which everyone raves about. Pity my dumplings came after the noodle. The noodles were a Â good portion, but the noodles weren't the thick, irregular shaped ones I've had elsewhere. Not bad, just different. The soup stock was balanced, but a little bland. I spiced things up with a little hot sauce. The dumplings were greasy, but fresh. I took these to go and they tasted great the next day.
