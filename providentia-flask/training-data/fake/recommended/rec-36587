Unquestionably the surprise hit of the weekend.   Just found this resto while surfing and it was intriguing enough to try.  Showed up at 12:05 p.m. on a Friday and we were lucky to get a table, as the place was full by 12:30, not including the take-out line. Perfectly made meatballs of beef, lamb, pork, veggie and the special of the day: Thai balls - spicy pork, shrimp, thai basil and lemongrass. We tried a few sliders with sides of white beans, polenta and squash.  The meatballs were so tender and juicy and full of flavour.  The sides were so well put together too. Polenta - so creamy with shredded parm on top. White Beans - couldn't get any simpler but so tasty.  The Squash was the topper as it was so well roasted.   Great chalkboard of a winelist and beer selection. Perfect lunch, just remember to where the pants with the elastic waist.
