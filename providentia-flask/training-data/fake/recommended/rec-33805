We had high expectations from Marrakesh but the experience was average. While they make the experience interesting with the ambience and the belly dancer, the food was nothing special. We had an Arab friend with us and her response to the food wasn't enthusiastic. While the quantity of the food was sufficient, the options and the taste left much to be desired. It wasn't out of this world in terms of flavor. The seating coupled with the lack of sufficient cutlery/plates mean that its difficult to access the food as well. It would be worth it to visit once and see what its about, but if you are looking for great Moroccan cuisine, it will be disappointing.
