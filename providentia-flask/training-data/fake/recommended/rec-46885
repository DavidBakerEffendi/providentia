Oh. My.God. Went to brunch two Sunday's ago and it was absolutely amazing! I couldn't ask for better service. The wait room staff was so friendly and adorable and got us sat within out quoted wait time. There were three little hostesses that were absolutely adorable that kept us entertained during our hour long wait by small talking with us and others in the wait room. We even started singing in perfect harmonies. It was glorious and an angel came down from the sky and kissed my left cheek. Upon our actual brunch experience. Well let me just say. This tall beautiful boy with black curls took our order. In the middle of brunch I started having contractions. I told the server that I needed to go to the hospital because I was going into labor. He said he would rush my order and pack it to go so that I could eat it in the cab on the way to the hospital. The food arrived within two minutes and he even gave me a comp mini french toast for my newborn baby. I couldn't have asked for more. Incase you're wondering I gave birth to a healthy beautiful baby girl who I named Sabrina in honor of my sunday brunch experience. God Bless America.
