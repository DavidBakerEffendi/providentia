The venue is small & unremarkable. The kitchen is small too, which is what makes the volume, efficiency & quality of the noodles they produced that much more impressive. We ordered a plate of Â the fried pork dumplings and fried vegetable dumplings. The former showed up looking greasy and without the crisp brown outside that I so love in a traditional fried dumpling. My son ate 3 before he suggested I try one. The skin was quite thin & the filling flavorful. I still would have preferred them crispy brown but they were tasty after all. The vegetable dumplings were perfectly browned & crispy. I ordered a bowl of hand pulled noodles & pork wontons in soup with bok choi. The wonton were small, the skins exceptionally thin & the filling terrific! The noodles were excellent & the broth was delicious. They were sensitive to our preference for colder beer & took a six pack back to their freezer for us. The servers were all very young but also very attentive & efficient. The cost for our table of FIVE with appetizers all around, 3 vegetable sides, 5 orders of hand pulled noodles (with wontons, lamb, pork meatballs, duck & dumplings respectively), 3 beers and 3 soft drinks...$52! Full & happy all around. I will return! P.S. - The fourth star is for the absolute value of this place.
