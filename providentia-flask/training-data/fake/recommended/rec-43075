I visited Employees Only to celebrate my birthday and had a large group of people in the back room with the skylight. The decor was beautiful and got even cozier when the sun went down and they lit candles. Â The staff was very accomodating, especially when we got a little tipsy and loud. They never lost their cool. Desserts were awesome. Wine selection was good. Appetizers were decent. Entrees were hit or miss: half the table enjoyed theirs, the other half didn't. I would definitely go back though.
