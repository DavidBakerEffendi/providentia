I have a bunch of food allergies (gluten dairy soy nuts) and they were Soo accommodating!! I was able to talk to the chef personally who was very kind about my conditions. Get the kangaroo in the tacos or burgers! There fries and some of the best I've had and upon request they can fry them in the GF fryer in canola oil. All there food is made fresh to order. Grilled veggie plate gives you plenty and is Soo yummy! The kale salad is only offered on their dinner menu unfortunately. I recommend going for the lunch special. $10.95 for an entree side and drink (including wine or coffee!) can't best this deal! I won't stop being a regular here! You gotta check it out!
