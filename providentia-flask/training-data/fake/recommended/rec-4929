Food: Delicious. I don't like fish but we ordered the tilapia with eggplant. It was fantastic. Also tried a coconut chicken soup which was surprisingly delicious. Pad Thailand of course excellent. Overall very pleased with food. Ambiance: Very nice interior. I would take a date here or family/friend. Service: Service was quick but a little on the rude side. We did get there at 9:20 when they closed at 9:30 though. We ordered fast but understandably the waitress was annoyed. It didn't take away from enjoying the food but made it awkward. Normally I would not have sat down in a restaurant that close to closing(worked in food service) but we did anyway. Better service would have given it the 5th star. Overall: I will return. Just earlier!
