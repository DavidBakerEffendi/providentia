Had a great dinner here last night. Chicken fried steak and a killer Bloody Mary. Service was good, our waitress was fun and punchy, and very attentive. I know a lot of people usually go for brunch but I would give dinner a shot - we had a great meal and went for a long walk afterwards to fight the food coma. Keep doing what your doing B Star.
