Terrible and I'm not talking about the food.  It's a small place so understandably they can have a wait.  We showed up on a Monday night @ 7:15pm and were told there was a 60 minute wait.  Because we really wanted ramen we decided to wait.  30 minutes go by and we see all these empty tables inside.  I approached the very young hostess who seemed quite spacey and overwhelmed and asked why the tables were empty with all these people waiting?  She actually told me that they will take your cell number and call you back when the table is ready.  That is the most absurd thing I've ever heard, well, maybe if the system worked it would be ok but they don't call you until the table is empty and it sits empty forever.  Absolutely the most inefficient seating process I've ever experienced.  We saw 10 empty seats for over 30 minutes.  What NYC eatery can afford that? You're just creating a hole for a good competition to take your place.
