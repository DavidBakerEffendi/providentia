We came to this restaurant with great expectations, considering the press it has gotten (Bourdain, etc).  There was no wait when we arrived, which was at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon.  We were seated quite promptly, by a pleasant hostess.  Perusing the menu, we decided on: 1) fish sauce chicken wings 4.5 / 5; 2) sweet pork belly / shoulder 4 / 5; 3) wild boar 2/5 (maybe 1/5 when you consider the price relative to quantity) 4) coconut ice cream soft bun sandwich 2/5 oh yeah, 5) sticky rice, 3/5 (no reason that an ounce of rice should cost $3...) By far the chicken wings were the tastiest menu item.  Too bad they're about $3/each.  The sweet pork belly was finished well, but the quantity is on the small side.  I feel that if it was available for order in Chinatown, you would have paid 1/4 the price, or received 4x's as much food.  The wild boar was certainly the most disappointing item.  It replaced the pork neck menu item that received much praise on Bourdain's show.  The quantity was laughably small (something like 6 small pieces..).  was not flavored as good as char siu roast pork from chinatown, and the pricing was easily 3x's what roast pork in chinatown would cost for that unit weight.   At the end of the day, I would return to pok pok, but only for the chicken wings.  It's too bad it's also a bit far away in Brooklyn.  I suspect we might have a different experience at pok pok phat, as the menu items are less "overpriced," though not likely to be as unique either.  Why don't they offer chicken wings at pok pok phat?
