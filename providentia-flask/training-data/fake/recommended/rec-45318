I've been to their home restaurant in Japan, so I just want to tell you that their ramen at their home is way better than this NY place, and half the price. But I also have to say, considering how difficult it might be to keep their high standard in this very different environment here in NY, they are doing quite well. Water is different, ingredients like vegetable tastes different, it also must be hard to hire a decent cook and waitress here. So I give 5 stars, and I hope they continue to do well.
