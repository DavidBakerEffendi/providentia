Food is good service totally sucked, had to ask for drink refills apps brought out with entree and no silverware had to ask for it.  I had coupon for half price meal the waitress took off 4.00 and said she hadn't seen the coupon.  The owner came over and fixed the mistake after I complained.  As we were leaving the owner approached a table of 4 and asked if they were done they needed the table.  How rude and inappropriate!  Don't waste your time they just lost 6 customers.
