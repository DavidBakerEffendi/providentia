I'm a vegetarian so keep that in mind when reading this review: The salad bar selection was not as good as everyone here seems to claim it is.  It was mediocre at best.  Nothing was labeled and there was only a moderate selection of things.  Maybe it was because I was expecting more. The sides were lame.  For as much as you pay for a plate here, I would expect something better than anemic mashed potatoes and some fried polenta. On the upside, the drinks were strong and tasty.  The fresh bread with melted cheese inside were also a highlight Salad bar: 3 stars. Sides: 2 stars. Drinks: 4.5 stars. Bread: 4 stars. Normally, I would give a place like this 3 stars.  But I realize that I'm not the target clientele, and if I had been a meat eater, I would have probably enjoyed my meal a lot more.
