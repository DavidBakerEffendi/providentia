After reading a few great reviews we decided to check out Red Owl Tavern for brunch. It definitely lived up to the hype. I had the red owl tavern omelette which was scrumptious and our waitress was just fantastic! The build-your-own Bellinis were a great concept except that I looked like a lush with the amount of times I got up to refill the juice (loved the juice options: strawberry, peach, pear and passionfruit - we had so much fun mixing). Taliah, our waitress, was very accommodating and understanding with our alcoholic and gluttonous tendencies. I will definitely come back!
