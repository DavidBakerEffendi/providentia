This place is good, but unsure of what the big hype is about.  I would NOT wait 1 to 3 hours for this! Went on a Friday afternoon, arrived around 4:10pm and did not have to wait (for 2 people).  I saw that the line started to form after 5:30pm.  My friend and I definitely over ordered because I did not realize the "Trust Us Combo" was a meal itself.  ((I was too hungry to read carefully!))   We ordered: (1) Truffle Cheese Fries - Good, didn't feel that it was heavy (2) Tempura Onion Rings - Don't bother ordering.  Not the "tempura" I imagined it to be (3) Hatch Burger - Good, but wanted more spice.   (4) Truffle Burger - Decadent, but I'm greedy, I want MORE truffle taste Trust us Combo - The waiter picks everything for you! (5) Manly Burger - Nothing spectacular (6) Skinny Fries - Good (7) Fanta Orange Overall, maybe I expected more since there was such a big hype.  I would definitely go back in the near future to try the other burgers and appetizers...   I personally, still prefer IN & OUT or SHAKE SHACK burgers.
