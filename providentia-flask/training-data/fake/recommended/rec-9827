I have been coming here since the first time I moved to Hartford in 2009. It is a favorite of mine during happy hours, especially with their margarita specials. I have come here for dinner and lunch, and their service tends to be on the slow side, which I am OK with because when the food does eventually come out, it is very good. I've tried a bunch of different dishes and I have been pleased with every single one. One of my favorites is the grilled chicken chimichanga. I love the Mexicana Style Paella that they have too...very yummy! It is a mix of seafood (shrimp, lobster, clams, and mussels), along with chicken and chorizo in a rice-tomato broth/soup base. Very filling. I also like the the steak wrap and the sauce it comes with. The steak is always cooked exactly the way I requested it to be cooked (medium-rare). One thing I do not like, and this may be just me (others have ordered it and seemed to like it) are their yucca fries. It is way too tough and dry for me to enjoy. I am always happy with my meal and experience here.
