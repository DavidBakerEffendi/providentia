God I love this place so much. The pork chop is unforgettable and their simple spaghetti with garlic is probably my favorite pasta dish in NYC. It was difficult for me to write this review because my mouth starts watering just thinking about L'Artusi. The service here has also been very good in my experience. They were extremely accommodating when I booked a large and sort of fluid party that unexpectedly grew in size throughout the night. Though I'm sure it was an annoyance to them, they never made me feel that way at any point. I'm eager to try their sister restaurant in the near future too.
