Came here on a Friday night with a reservation at 9.  I guess tables weren't turning as quickly as they had planned because we ended up waiting about 30-35 minutes for a table.  The owner was extremely apologetic and gave my boyfriend and me complimentary glasses of wine (drinks of our choosing) while we waited at the bar.  If you're waiting for a table, be prepared to stand outside if there is no room at the bar because there really is no standing room inside. Once we were seated we had the burrata as an appetizer.  It was very good--it came with bacon which I thought was odd.  I was in the mood for classic spaghetti with marinara and asked the waiter if they had any spaghetti, linguini, etc. as it was not listed on the menu.  Apparently they had all types of pasta not listed on the menu, so don't be afraid to ask your server if you are looking for something in particular.  The marinara sauce was very tasty and I was happy with my dish.  My boyfriend had a stuffed ravioli with marinara which was also very tasty. Definitely one of the better restaurants in Murray Hill, but be prepared for some cramped quarters!
