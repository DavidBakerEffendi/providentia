Stars are earned by the awesomely glutenous italian cheeseburger & cheesecake...honey turkey sandwiches are good too...the salads are good as long as you don't allow them to overchop them...they tend to do that. The hot pastrami is pretty good as well. I recommend the chicken cutlet & honey turkey salads
