The seafood is great. I am a regular. I have zero patience for eating there so I typically get it to go. They package it nicely and I don't have to bother with the crowds. Watch out though! The prices are already increasing. You'll notice the menu on yelp is different from the site (until it is updated). 1 lb of Snow crab was once $15 but is now $18. Boo! I hate that increase. $6 increase for 2 lbs is kind of annoying. Oh well, welcome to NYC.
