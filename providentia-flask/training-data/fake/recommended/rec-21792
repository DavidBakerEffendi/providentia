after working a 12 hour shift on the day of park slope's 5th avenue fair, i figured it was an ideal opportunity to treat myself out -- far away from the neighborhood i call home. not wanting to make the trek to manhattan in my sore, battered state, a few friends & i stumbled through nearby carroll gardens & made a stop into char 4 for some appetizers & cocktails. of all the places we sampled that night, char 4 was the best of the bunch. we elected to forgo entrees & get a smattering of apps to share between the four of us instead (i think we ordered one of nearly every item on the list), & even if the pork nuggets & lamb pastrami rose to the top of the list, nothing was less than outstanding. & while a mint julep was my instinctive pick for my first cocktail (it being my favorite drink & all), the bourbon bonnet with habanero, cherry & brown sugar (which i HAD to order after tasting my dining mate's) is what really blew my mind & exemplifies this place: refreshing & comforting but with a spicy kick that keeps them miles from ordinary. i need to come back for a full dinner STAT.
