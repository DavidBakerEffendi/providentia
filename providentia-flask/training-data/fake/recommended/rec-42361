I had an amazing dinner with 10 friends at Blue Ribbon. It is so warm and the staff was really fun and funny. We got a few 'gifts from the kitchen'  which is always a pleasure because we got to try so many excellent flavors. I was visiting NYC and invited all of my NYC friends to join me there for dinner. It was great because they didn't all know each other so the conversation was varied and exciting. We sat next to M1 from the Dead Prez which was a thrill for the hip hop fans in the group.  I'd go back in a second. Yum.
