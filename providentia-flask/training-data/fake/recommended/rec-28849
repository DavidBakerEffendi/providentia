Hubby and I went here last weekend for my 40th B-day!  Wonderful atmosphere and the desserts were delicious!  I had the churros which came with three dipping sauces (milk chocolate, toffee and raspberry).  They were excellent!  We also had the European fondue which was equally as delicious.  We were both excited to find out that they have a location in Bethesda, MD.
