Great sushi without the downtown prices. Good variety of rolls...but I need my fave, the crunchy roll every time. A good selection of appetizers and you can't go wrong with the bento box either. Add fast service and byob...with a liquor store right next to it and you can't beat this place for a casual sushi lunch or dinner. Plus if you're local they deliver ridiculously fast. Last time I got my food in less than 20 minutes.
