I loved my visit to the Americana.. Our server was very polite and extra friendly (not fake friendly) I had the "little bit of everything" and it was so good!! It came with 2 pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage.. The maple syrup was warm and awesome!!! You must go there!! I will visit again when back in NJ!!!
