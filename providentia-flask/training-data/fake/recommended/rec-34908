They can't handle the pressure. It's a Saturday night, the place is packed. They're under staffed. I can go on and tell you certain things they missed like no bucket of ice to chill the wine or no refills of water. They didn't even give us them crunchy things with the sauces in the beginning. Taking the order took a while. Getting the food took over a half hour. Now the food was great. But the portions were pretty small. Come on a week day when it's slower when they can handle it.
