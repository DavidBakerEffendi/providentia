We went here on early on NYE. Host was dressed in jeans and as if he just got out of bed. Hey man, it's New Years! Put on a jacket at least. The restaurant was not full - maybe 75% - but the service was very slow, with long gaps between visits, dirty plates left to fester on our table unattended for 10-15 mins. When main course was served, dirty plates were still there, and Heidi just dumped our dirty plates on a nearby table. The steak I ordered med rare came out nearly raw near the bone, and my wife's lobster was overcooked and chewy. Other than that everything was wonderful! It's an older crowd, average age 60. Never saw a manager roaming through the restaurant to check on things and/or mingle with the patrons.
