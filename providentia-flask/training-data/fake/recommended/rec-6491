Um damn, this was the cheapest sushi spot I've been to while living in the NYC area that I was actually able to sit down and enjoy. I made rezzies here to dine with some friends before the famous Peter D's bday and I was not disappointed. For $18 I left with a full on sushi coma. Ya, no joke. Make reservations, it does get packed. Don't be a dick and show up on time, this place literally has 10 tables. I went with the sashimi platter with 6-8 pretty thick cuts of fresh salmon, tuna and .... and.... I forget the last fish type, but it was good. The bento box came with the best miso soup I've ever had filled with fresh vegetables, shumai, noodles and a Cali roll with tuna. Yep. The only flaw in this meal were the noodles. They were cold and flavorless. Friends had rolls, tempura and sashimi and everyone was super happy with the quality, quantity and of course the price. Did I mention even the sake was pretty inexpensive, because it was. I'd come again and definitely recommend you go if looking for a quality sushi meal at a great price point. I'd suggest more for a casual event since service here is rushed. They want you in and out and have no problem letting you know. Again, it's a small place so give 'me a break. Can you find better sushi in NYC? Yes. At this price? I'm not sure.... This spot's a gem!
