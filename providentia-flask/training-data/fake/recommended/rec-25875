Food was good, nothing amazing. The prices were totally reasonable, if not cheap for what you get. The standout sauces were the parmesan cream sauce and the regular red sauce. We loved the smash sandwiches, the other stuff was just allright. The wait though was very long. The waitress was a total space cadet so we had to stay on her to keep our stuff coming. In summary, it's a hot spot for now that is crowded and hopping with cheap tasty food.
