I am blessed to live right around the corner from Tom's. Super friendly and attentive staff, delicious food, and very reasonable prices. Try the western omelet with grits and wheat toast. I'm from North Carolina, and the omelet and grits at Tom's are some of the best I've found anywhere. Also, a tip: Try the bran muffin. Get it toasted. Grape jelly. Delicious. Finally: Tom's is now open for dinner on weekends! I think they stay open until 9PM on Saturday and Sunday.
