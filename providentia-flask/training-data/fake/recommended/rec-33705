Date Visited: April 17th People: Megan, Jim, Wendy My tab: ~$70 Made the reservation upon by recommendation of Ricky (also made the Travel & Leisure 2008 hot table list). Did not disppoint. Great address downtown, a block away from blue ribbon. Got the nice table at the window near the wall off to the right. My only real knock was that they didn't have a full bar, only wine and some beer. Meal started with watermelon diver scallops with red onion. Nice start to the meal, I've had larger, sweeter scallops elsewhere, but no complaints. Arugula salad looked and tasted great...everything came very well presented. For dinner I had a Deloach Pinot 2006 which was milder than I expected, probably not have been my choice again. I had the lamb shank with au gratin potatoes and escarole that was falling-off-the-bone perfection...not to mention the size of my head. I talked megan out of ordering the off-the menu burger, instead she got the arctic char with this creamy leek puree, which I thought was awesome. Also tried some of jim's hangar steak, which was solid, although I think he meant to order "skate," which was to come almond crusted. Ended the meal with surprisingly good pineapple upside down cake, with icecream, which did favorably against my break pudding from the night before. All in all, the mean wasn't perfect, but I really liked the place, the vibe, and aside from maybe the winelist, wasn't much more expensive than ol' brooklyn heights. Would recommend...if you can get a decent reservation
