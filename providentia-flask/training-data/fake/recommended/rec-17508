The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me is because of how loud and crowded it is here. There was hardly any space to move between the tables. The food and drink are exceptional! We started off with the lemonade and peach red sangria and mixed our own bottle into it. It was so refreshing and tasty that I could have chugged half of the pitcher. And it's such a money saver to be able to BYOB! The food was extremely flavorful and they give you a ton of it!! We had a coconut fish (red snapper) and garlic shrimp. Plus took home a box of leftovers. The sides of rice and plantains were also plentiful and delicious. I'd recommend this place for a fun night out with friends.
