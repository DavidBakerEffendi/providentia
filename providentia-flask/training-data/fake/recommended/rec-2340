The hubby and I walked two miles from our hotel for a taste of the infamous Geno's cheesesteak. He had been there as a kid, and wanted to relive the experience. Geno's isn't hard to miss, being in an orange building with neon lights. The food delivery time was quick, but when I took a bite of my sandwich it was completely flavorless. All I could taste was bread with the occassional hint of provolone/grilled onions. It was also completely dry. Try somewhere else!
