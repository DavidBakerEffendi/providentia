Very cool. Small and quaint, but did not feel at all cramped. Was in on a Sunday afternoon and the vibe was high-energy and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Drinks were really creative and fun. Food was pretty good too! Friendly staff in a great part of town. I'd go back with friends or probably on a fun day date.
