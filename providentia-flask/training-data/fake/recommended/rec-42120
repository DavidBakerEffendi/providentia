This place has the best general tso's bean curd AROUND. The only problem is that I'm a broccoli fiend and not ONCE in the all my ordering extra broccoli have they actually put extra broccoli in my order. Alas. But the scallion pancakes (delightfully burnt) and the veggie lo mein (I order it with egg) are also delish, and if you order over twenty bucks of food they give you a free can of soda, hooray! But don't eat the crispy noodles--they're always stale.
