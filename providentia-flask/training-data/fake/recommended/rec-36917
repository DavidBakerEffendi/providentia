Oh boy, I'm in the minority here. Yes, the fine staff at Becco got us our food and out da door on the way to the theater on time.  Points for that.   But I found the food mediocre.  No, it's not as bad as the dreadfed Olive Garden (mmm, breaksticks) but it was still mostly plain and average.  Plus, I made the mistake of allowing them to squirrel us next to a wall where there was literally no room to move or breathe.  You couldn't lift a fork without delivering a forearm shiver to the person dining next to you. Manhattan is just too damn good for me to waste my time and hard-earned food stamps on just pretty good food.
