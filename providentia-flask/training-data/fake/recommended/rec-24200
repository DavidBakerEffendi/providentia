When we finally got our food it was pretty good. My problem was the waitress was SO rude! Just seemed bothered by every request. The food took forever to arrive (sitting two hours). When it did come things were wrong. It wouldn't have bothered us as much if the service was more consistent and friendly. I think she would be better suited for working at the DMV. There she could be as snippy and slow as her ironic sweater wearing heart desires. Honestly I'm underplaying how bad the service really was. The rest of the staff was very friendly but we won't be back.
