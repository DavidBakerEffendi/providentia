Hesitate to write this review only because it is one of my favorite restaurants in New York and I don't want even more people to come and cause longer waits! Be prepared to wait a little but it's so worth it. Oyster selection is amazing, seafood is incredibly fresh and the service is outstanding. Beer menu is always interesting and the whiskey cake at the end of the meal is such a nice touch.
