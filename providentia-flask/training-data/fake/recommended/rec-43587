Due to my crazy work schedule, occasionally I have to come catch up on my reviews. This place is absolutely amazing. It's not huge in size and everything seems to be happening all around you but in a cozy way. In other words, you are comfortably in sight of the kitchen, the bar, the restrooms, the front door. It's a cozy place with amazing foods. If you are a wine connoisseur, know your regions, not your grapes. I also suggest one plate of tapas at a time.
