The wait can be a bit of a drag and the service was just okay, but the food is great here! Had an eggs Benedict and it was delicious! I loved the home fries that came with it also. Our waitress didn't seem to check on us at all though. I understand it was busy, but she never once stopped by to ask us how we were doing. The owner (or manager? Not sure) ended up getting us our check. Food overall was good, just the service was a bit lacking.
