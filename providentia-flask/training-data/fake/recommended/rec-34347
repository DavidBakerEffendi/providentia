Walked by this spot numerous times before I decided to give it a shot. And I seriously am glad I did. Absolutely loved our experience here. Food was top notch, service was fantastic. It is a hidden gem. BYOB so stop across the street for a bottle before grabbing those tapas. Stop in for a bite, you won't be dissapointed.
