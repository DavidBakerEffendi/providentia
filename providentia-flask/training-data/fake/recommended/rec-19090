On Saturday I sat down inside Sitar for the first time ever. I've had take out from here several times that I thought was perfectly fine, especially for takeout, and I have to say, getting it fresh and hot does make a difference. It was a little daunting that the place was completely empty at 7:15 on a Saturday, but it did mean the waitstaff had nobody to pay attention to but us. I'm sure they thought we were insane--ordering more bread than main dishes (only one, and we were totally predictable, chicken tikka masala), mango lassi's to go with our bottles of King Fisher, and demanding more mint chutney--but they took it in stride. The food WAS perfectly fine. No complaints. Although when you have so many great indian food options in New Haven, fine starts to sound like kind of an insult. They asked me how spicy I wanted my masala, and generally when people ask that, I think 'Oh, jeebus, it's going to be a scorcher,' so I wrongfully answered mild. Don't get it mild. It winds up being slightly sweet and it made me a little sad.
