It looks like they throw everything on the dish.  We had the Khao Mun Kai Thod, rice with fried chicken, the rice is partially cold and it is the over night cooked rice that was heated in the microwave before serving.  The tiny piece of greasy fried chicken was put on top.  We also had the Pad Kana over rice, and again the rice is just cheap quality white rice like in the Chinese take out, not a Thai jasmine rice.  The Kana with chicken was so bland.
