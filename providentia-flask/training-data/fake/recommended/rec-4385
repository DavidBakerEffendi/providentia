Chili Szechuan offers authentic cooking in the style of China's Sichuan province. For many dishes, that means both numb-y and spicy. Yes, that's right: "numb" is a considered a flavor in Chinese cuisine. I lived in China for five years and quickly became a fan of Sichuan cooking. Eating this food is a lovely work-out. You eat and sweat at the same time. So far, my favorite dishes are: the fish with Szechuan Chili Sauce Flavor (shui zhu yu) and the Benben Chicken. Both are swimming in oil, super hot, super numb-y, and really really good. If that sounds appetizing to you, Chili's is your place. If not, you can still go to Chili's; just order off the "Americanized" portion of the menu. PS. In case your interested, the Chinese phrase on Chili's storefront reads "chuan liu bu xi," which describes the never-ending flow of people and traffic. I know that I'll keep flowing into Chili's for my Sichuan food fix!
