Please make sure to bring Handi-wipes, because you make stick to the table.  Late at night the tables just seem to be less than pristine.  The waitstaff thinks you should just feel lucky to get a table.  Order as soon as you're seated, because you may never see the waitstaff again.     You'll definitely love the burger, if your the type to order American cheese on your cheeseburger.  The french fries are skippable.  This place is a divey bar, but a good spot late at night, so the darkness will cover some of the bigger blemishes.  Just hunker down and order a cheap beer and the cheeseburger pronto!!!
