If you know anything about beer, you are going to love Eulogy. Their selection is ridiculous, bottles and drafts alike. They have beers from all over Europe and most of them are reasonably priced. In my experience, the staff are definitely beer connoisseurs. If you give them something to work with they will usually recommend a beer you'll really enjoy. It has two floors, the first is a pretty long bar but it gets narrow when it runs along the wall. Upstairs is nicely sized, if you are going to eat this is most likely where you will be seated. If you go to Eulogy around 9-11 it's pretty packed but I've found that after that even on weekends it dies down quite a bit. It has a European bar feel, kind of dim with some cool stuff on the walls. I've heard their mussels are really good but I haven't actually had them myself. If you're in Olde City and enjoy good beers you should definitely stop by.
