Food is solid. Pizza(Pete-za) some of the best. Only knock for a "Sports Bar" if you will is that other then local sports they do not provide audio for other games. Went in to the NE Location to watch Sunday Night Football (non Eagles ) and asked if they could turn down the music and turn up the volume of the football game. I was told house policy was that they play music. All six of us voted to leave and go down to Buffalo Wild Wings down the street. Don't even know if they have the NFL Ticket. Great place for great casual food...."Greatest Sports Bar In North America" ????? Â  NO
