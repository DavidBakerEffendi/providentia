Nice folks but the food is meh. Got the basics--whole chicken Â with fries and rice--$11.00 so one really can't complain about pricing but seriously--the chicken was dry, rice was yellow and okay--nothing to write home about, fries were McDonalds like (thin and crispy). Traveled from S. Orange and would not go out of my way to come back again....in fact if I was in the area I wouldn't go back. Nothing terrible just average. The one highlight--the pickled veggies--yummy.
