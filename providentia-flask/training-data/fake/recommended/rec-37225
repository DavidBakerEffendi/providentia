Went to the Restaurant last night (Saturday).  Ordered cheese plate and italian meat and everything was very fresh and good, and there was bread.  The staff was aware of last review and made sure to tell me that bread was made especially for my visit.  My guests had salads which were said to be very good and another pasta dish which they excel at with the heavy bolognese.  Very nicely crowded and excellent service with John a waiter that has been there since its arrival here in W. Hartford.  Very nice meal and could not really have been better in any way.
