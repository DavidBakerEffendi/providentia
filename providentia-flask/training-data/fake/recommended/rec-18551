After doing my hair, my friend and I began scouring the streets and yelp to find an amazing taco place, we came across five tacos and thank the heavens we did. They were so good, I got the chicken taco and my friend got pulled pork, our taste buds were way beyond satisfied and the sauces they have are equally amazing. I mixed habanero jerk, coconut masala, and chipotle mayo, I also added guacamole, my mouth is watering just thinking of it. I will definitely be back on taco tuesday.
