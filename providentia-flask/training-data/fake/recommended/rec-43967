We've ordered delivery twice from Jerra and both times it was ridiculously late. I don't know the details of the first delivery. The second delivery, they were over an hour late. We called a few times to ask what was up, and they refused to estimate when the food would arrive and where otherwise rude. From the other reviews, it looks like their food is fine (I don't know, mine arrived cold and without forks, so I didn't really taste it), but order delivery at your peril.
