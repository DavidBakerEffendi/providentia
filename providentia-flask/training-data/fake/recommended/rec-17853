We were at Fernandes on Saturday night to celebrate a friends 60th birthday.   Two floors, downstairs appears to be quiet and a bit more intimate.  Upstairs looks like where they put the larger groups.  It is extremely loud, but it was fun.   Food was great, meat was very tasty.   We all did ridizio.   Only negative is my husband asked for more of one kind and the waiter took his plate, as the rest of us were done.   The bill was very reasonable.  Defintely would go back for the more traditional fare.  The ridizio comes with sides of rice, bananas and french fries.  We asked for the potato chips and they were delish.   They were also very accommodating as we brought our own cake.
