My first love, my only love. When I tell you I was happy when they re-opened, I screamed cried. I cried over water ice. They're that good. I've been coming here since I was a little kid. We use to spend all our money, before parents started giving their kids $40 a day, on water ice and hugs. I'm pretty sure I never ate real food. Just this water ice. That's how good it is.
