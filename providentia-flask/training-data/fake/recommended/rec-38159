I'd say we order from Mama Rosa's every other week or so. Never been inside, just get it delivered. The salad pizza is amazing.  Got a pizza with ricotta and eggplant before also very good.  We've tried the Hot American pizza, was rather hot! The Philly Cheese steak pizza was alright too. Gorgonzola salad - not I loooove my gorgonzola, but this salad actually had too much of it on there, never thought I'd ever say that.  My boyfriend has tried the Buffalo Chicken salad, looked great. We're Italians and enjoy getting delivery from here. :)
