While I rarely go to the bakery, I love their Olive loaf. Even better than picking it up at the co-op or the bakery itself is getting it from the bicycle delivery cart that roams through the neighborhood with cries of "Fresh Bread." Nothing is more Burlington that seeing a gang of kids chasing down the bread delivery guy.
