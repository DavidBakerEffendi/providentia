This is the diner that makes me proud to be a New Jerseyan, this place has everything you could ever imagine on the menu. Every diner in New Jersey should model after tops. You will be surprised about the wide variety of things being ordered at your table. It wouldn't be out of the ordinary to have lobster, pancakes, cheese steak and pasta at one table. Everything I've tried on the menu, from breakfast to wraps and back have been delicious. Everything is very fresh and tasty. Save room for dessert because this is where tops really shines. All the cheesecakes are unbelievable. My recommendation is the Oreo or red velvet. Stop by if you're in the area, the wait will likely be long but this is one spot I don't mind the wait ;).
