Food is mediocre at best. Very loud acoustically with not a bit of noise dampening.  Small portions and 5th avenue pricing with a view of tugs and barge filth.  Decor is mismatched on artistic purpose but they missed their intended goal of "Moroccan rustic". Our ginger-haired server, Ian, wasn't rude outright but not polite in the least. We were celebrating a birthday and ordered a slice of cake for the guest of honor but it never came even after 2 requests.  Still were charged for food and beverages that were sent back. We even told the waiter the ice tea was awful! The lobster wasn't even cracked so the sauce ended up all over the table and shirts. Save your money and go someplace else.
