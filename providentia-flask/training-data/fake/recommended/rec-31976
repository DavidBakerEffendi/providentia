I didn't try the brunch there yet so I will let you all know how that goes but for now this is what you get... What looks super small on the outside but is super long in the inside? No, not that pervert, The TT Where is the perfect place to go alone because you can pretend to read the almost 60 page menu? The TT Whose menu is filled with song lyrics, histories, tv ads for Iron Chef, and pages and pages of ::shudder:: wine? The TT Who has a bathroom door that looks like a wooden chamber before you open it? The TT What place has little hooks to hang your jackets under the bar so you don't have to sit on them? The TT Where should you go if you want to eat and not be full and spend an above average amount of money? The TT Where should you go if you are craving a delicious veal and ricotta meatball meal? The TT What place do you head if you are trying to impress your date with your extenive knowledge of cheeses and wines? The TT And now the bonus question, where is the ideal place to go to in which you will look around and notice that 85% of the entire bar is good looking? The TT
