Melograno was an enjoyable experience.   We walked in on a Friday evening (we thought that they did not take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays but were wrong - despite what their website says, they started accepting reservations sometime around the beginning of June) and were immediately sat and waited on.  The service was great, the food was solid (my girlfriend and I started with the mozzarella in carrozza which was great and then shared the spaghetti ala carbonara and the cotoletta di pollo alla senese, both of which were quite good), and the decor of the place itself makes for a great, relaxing dining experience.  Also - and perhaps most important - Melograno is BYOB, so don't forget a bottle of wine or two. All in all, very enjoyable experience.  I will be going back.
