I definitely agree with all of the boat-related comments- This place has delicious seafood and you can't beat the ambiance. I mean it's a boat. Also our waiter was very attentive. No complaints, just two thumbs up. Also, I wouldn't come here unless you're dressed appropriately and you expect to drop a significant amount of cash.
