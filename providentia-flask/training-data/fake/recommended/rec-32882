I came here a few months ago on a date ( I wish the date was as fantastic as the experience and food)  So being a meatball shop virgin  I let him guide me in the ordering process.   I couldn't get passed saying Naked Balls without a giggle ( I know  I know 25 going on 12) So I loved that the menu was a little arts and crafty where you actually get to draw on it and tick off what you want with markers! I had the naked balls (classic beef) with classic tomato sauce  and a piece of mozzarella on top.  He had the smashed balls HA! (Chicken) with Parmesan Cream ( OMG AMAZING)  I also ordered the special ( Moroccan ball as a slider)  I wasn't overly thrilled with that one, there was a bit too much going on in it and I'm fairly picky about my Moroccan food! I cannot rave enough about the Parmesan Cream sauce and the Chicken Balls.  Next time I go, I will absolutely be getting the smashed balls or naked balls & cream ( sorry!) Side note:  Their wine selection is very good and the bartenders are pretty to look at.  Nothing beats a good bottle of wine and a plate of balls served by an adorable hipster! GO!
