I've been eating at Da Noi since it opened.  It's a really delicious Italian restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Our favorite waiter is Victor.  He is attentive and always remembers our favorite drinks/food.  For drinks, we like to order any delicious martini (especially peach).  For entrees their black linguine with pesto sauce and seafood is delicious.  Finally, for dessert we enjoy their mint chocolate chip martinis.  I highly recommend Da Noi!
