Came to Philly for the day and ended up walking into this bar, we were looking for a place to sit and grab a bite to eat. The second I walked in I loved the vibe and feel of the place, it's a true authentic Irish bar with a nice fun low key young college crowd. I sat at the bar and ordered a burger and a Stella on tap. Bartender was super friendly and she had a fun happy vibe about her. Food came rather quickly and the burger was pretty good. Reason I'm only giving this place 4 stars is because the burger was good but not phenomenal. I've def had better, but it was still a great lunch and perfect break in the day to stop in. Would def go back
