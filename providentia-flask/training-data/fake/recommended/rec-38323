My wife and some of our friends were in Vermont for a mini vacation and stopped off here for lunch.  We were seated right away but there were a plethora of flies by our seat.  We had to kill them ourselves, though the waiter helped when he saw what was going on. Sweetwaters has some real interesting cocktails that are fairly priced considering the area.  The menu was fairly extensive but was slightly over priced, though the quality was good. I had the All American Burger with Bison meat because I was curious to see how it tasted (nice beefy flavor, a little dry due to low fat content, well accented by bacon).  I had a choice of Kobe or Angus as well, although this doesn't really matter as any grill master will tell you that a burger's taste is more dependent upon fat content.  There's a difference with steaks but not really in ground beef.  Seriously, look it up and impress your friends with the cheap 80/20 stuff from Shop-Rite.  Tell them a story about how hard you worked or how special the meat is or something. The fries were decent and the bacon was out of this world, it really highlighted the taste.  However, we were brought our burgers sans cheese and bacon at first and then had the items brought to us on a second plate.  Also my bison burger was dry because it was not cooked medium but was more well done which made it really dry. My wife had a spicy burger which tasted great and our friends had the chicken piccata which was also quite good.  The restaurant was good but not spectacular and the price and flies really detracted from our experience.
