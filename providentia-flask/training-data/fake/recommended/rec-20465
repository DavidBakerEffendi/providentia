I had only eaten at Palo Santo once before, on a very quiet Tuesday evening, a couple of years ago.  What, you say, does this have to do with the price of wine in Uruguay?  Well, I guess I was underwhelmed and felt a pressure of overwhelming earnestness forcing me into decisions i wasn't really interested in.  Either I didn't get it at the time, or things have changed. Friday night, by chance (one too many beers at Mission Delores leads to deciding to not cook at home), 4 of us showed up at PS, no reservation in hand, prime time in Brooklyn Resto Week (or whatever it's called).  Oops, but fortunate for us a 4-top seemingly destined for no-shows, was available and availed. I've had delicious food from this kitchen 2 other occasions, both foodie fund-raisers, so i knew that good things were happening, but I'm happy to say that first hand cooking is even better. Anticuchos is Peruvian street food, beef heart (and in this case liver) skewered.  Yum, yum, yum.   Ever had any Uruguayan wine?  Well, bully for you, 'cause I've never.  But the Vinedo de los Vientos, a blended white approximating something Alpine meets the Mediterranean, was exactly that, salty fruit.  Not that funky sometimes ugly sauvignon blanc thing; much more nuanced. Anyway, I went white boy for my main course, getting a ribeye (because I love ribeye), but it was beautifully grilled and accompanied by chimichurri and grilled onions, all things I love.  The slightly sour but brightly flavored sauce wasn't the only green I had, but it was definitely taking that earthy lovely steak to task for being too good to eat alone. I'm sure everyone else loved what they ate (it all looked great anyway). Oh, and if the stuff on your table isn't from Latin/South America, you can be sure that it is, instead, from within 100 miles of the restaurant.  These guys take local seriously, and that's, you know, a good thing!
