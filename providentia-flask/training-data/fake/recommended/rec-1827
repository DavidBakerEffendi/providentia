As I write this review, feelings of both regret and anger rush through my body. You see, Reading Terminal Market was my first Philly stop on this most recent foodie trip. I watched Adam Richman's "Best Sandwich in America" and was there for THAT sandwich. I get in a line that wraps around all four sides of the Dinic's zone. The line moves quickly. It is now my turn to order and for some reason, I blurt out, "Pulled pork, provolone, and broccoli rabe." The gentleman in front of me had ordered pulled pork, yet I knew I was there for the roast pork, but I followed his lead anyway. I then take two seconds to change my order, but the girl taking it insists that the pulled pork is better. I hate pulled meat, but I decide to listen to her since, you know, she works there. I get to the register and see an article on their famous roast pork, but it was too late for changes. The sandwich is tasty -- no doubt. Meat is juicy, provolone is sharp, and broccoli rabe adds a slight sweetness to round out flavors. I still didn't dig the pulled meat texture, though, because it was mushy and I then understood why sliced roast pork is the way to go. Sadly, my belly was 90% full and I reserved that remaining 10% for Termini Bros Bakery's chocolate chip cannoli, so I did not get back in line for the proper sandwich. Rookie mistake. Newbs, order the right sandwich and I'm sure you'll have a 5-star experience.
