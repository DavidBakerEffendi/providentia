Really creative food; small portions and thus the bill can add up, but every dish that we had there has been excellent.  No longer serving brunch, which used to be the best decadent brunch in the city.  As a dinner restaurant I'd say it's very tasty, but unfortunately not very healthy; so, good to try out for sure, but I wouldn't go there too often ;-)
