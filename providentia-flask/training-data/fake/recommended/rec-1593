stopped by in philly to try the sandwiches, on the way to a soccer tournament. 4pm -- no line.  friendly service --- i was surprised because i had seen/heard of only rude service.  but they were nice.   1st window: ordered 2 whiz wit.  bread was soft, meat was chopped & tender.  onions caramelized, whiz covered all surfaces -- meat & bread.  this sandwich was good and flavorful.  it was a bit salty, but it was still good. fries were crispy and nice too. i don't know that i'd go all the way to philly just to have another cheese steak, but it was a good experience, and the food was good....filling. OH YEAH!  also tried provolone wit.  didn't enjoy it as much as whiz because it was a bit dry.  the cheese was placed in the bread first then meat & onions placed on top of it.  so the cheese didn't really melt and mix in with the meat.
