A mixed experience. This was my second visit, and I liked it less than the first. The details: Service is uniformly friendly and helpful. I can't fault that. The space is cramped and if you sit at a table you are likely to be sitting on a stool. I don't like that. You will also feel waiters and other people swish by you if you are on the very narrow aisle spaces. The food prices seem very reasonable, but the portions are small. I thought the food was really excellent last time I went, but this time I thought it was just OK. 3 1/2 stars. The cassoulet special was a bit watery, the duck confit leg tasted like a regular non-confit duck leg, and the sausage was bland. Leeks were good as always, with a mustardy sauce. An appetizer-sized plate. Chicken liver mousse was very good, but with an overly thick layer of chicken fat on top, which was inedible and seriously reduced the amount of mousse in the ramekin. Wines were good, but priced very high in comparison to the food, about $16 a glass and up. A very light dinner for two came to over $120 plus tip. For those prices, and the cramped no-reservations, waiting in line experience, the food should be fantastic. It's good, but not great, so 3 stars for Buvette.
