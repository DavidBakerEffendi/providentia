2 Stars almost seems generous, but there were some good parts. The shack burger was pretty good, though very small. The shake was, well, a decent shake. Nothing special, but decent. Now for the other stuff, the hot dog was just not good. Here was this fat flavorless dog laying lifeless on a roll that just soaked up the grease. Very disappointing, and the service was cold and unfriendly. They just hand you a pager and expect you to figure out the rest apparently. Â Maybe it was too much hype, maybe it's not for me....either way, eh.
