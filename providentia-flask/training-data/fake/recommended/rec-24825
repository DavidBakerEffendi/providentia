This is an exceptionally lovely establishment with dishes to surprise and delight more sophisticated palates.   Jose Garces always takes care in creating cohesive menus, both in food and drink. The waitstaff are very knowledgable and genuinely knows how to pair the alcohol offered on the menu with the dishes served.   I have heard complaints from tourists while dining at times, that this placed is "pretentious and over priced."  My comment on this:  if you're coming into Amada with a fanny pack and complaining that the 'pizza place was closed,' you're probably not the greatest culinary connoisseur.
