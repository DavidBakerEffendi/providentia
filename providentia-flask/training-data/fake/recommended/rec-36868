yummmm Balthazar. It is rare that I have such a vivid memory of the crowd, ambiance and entire night, but when I dined at Balthazar that is exactly what happened. We arrived a little late for our 8:45pm reservation, you deff should make reservations, but the host happily seated us immediately. No sooner had we been seated and started to chat our server came over and asked us about beverages, wine please, thanks. Picked up a great bottle of Burgundy with a little direction and then noticed that everyone was having a great time in the restaurant. The ladies next to us were snapping pictures of their friends, people were mingling and it was a comfortable loud. I had THE BEST grilled vegetable salad of my life here. OMG!! Seriously, I love grilled veggie salads, but this had no lettuce just loads of grilled vegetables like zucchini, squash, eggplant, shallots, green peppers, and more. But, wait the best part was the salad was served with a huge chunk of fresh and extra extra creamy goat cheese. Coffee and bread are just additions that make each meal better. I have been craving a fab grilled-veggie salad since I left New York and I am scared to try it anywhere else.
