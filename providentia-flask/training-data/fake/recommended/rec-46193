This is by far our favorite Thai restaurant in New Haven. We've tried most of the Thai places in the area, and we've gone back here multiple times, despite our attempts to try new places as often as possible! The Pad Thai, Pad See-Ew, Yellow Curry, and Red Curry are all fantastic. We've tried to stray from our usual dishes and order other meals, but we feel like we're missing out if we don't order one of our favorites. The spring rolls and chicken satay are good too, and are pretty standard - nothing special, but good. Their prices are comparable to other Thai places in New Haven, but I think their food is better. The service is also always great, and we've never had to wait long for our food. Highly recommended!
