Out of all the bars we visited while in NYC and Brooklyn, Employees Only was by far my favorite. The drinks were phenomenal, and my friends enjoyed the snacks. I really wish we had come on a day like Tuesday to get a more intimate experience and really test the bartender's muscles, but instead I was amazed at how attentive and polite the bartenders were for a Saturday night on a Holiday weekend mind you. They were so aware of when an unfortunate fella behind us ladies got too stumbly on us strangers, and insisted he find Â his way out, while informing other staff members. I can't say that happens often, but I was pleasantly surprised! There may be a line, but the guy working the door is super nice. Will definitely be paying a visit when we return!
