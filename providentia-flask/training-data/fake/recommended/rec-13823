Anyone who understands that fries originated with MAYO, and not ketchup, will love this place! As a carb addict, i LOVE pomme frites! This is one of the many places in NYC that make me in LA that much more miserable! I've tried most of the sauces and my favorites are the Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo, Parmesan Peppercorn, and Dill Lemon. Always always get the Double just because when you think you are done and full, you will crave it within a few minutes. As for the place, TRUE hole in the wall. It is cramped, so think twice about standing in line if you are claustrophobic. You are most likely going to take it to go because there is really no place to sit unless you get their during an "off-hour," which is highly unlikely!
