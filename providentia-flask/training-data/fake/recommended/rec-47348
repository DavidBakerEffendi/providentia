Great place for a light dinner and opening up a bottle of wine to catch up with friends. Had dinner in their adorable garden in the back. We started out with an antipasti platter, which was an assortment of delicious savory bites. There was an artichoke with olive tapenade drizzled over, tomato over some creamy cheese, goat cheese and beets, and a couple of other things I couldn't remember. I chose the panini with mortadella, mozz cheese, fried onions and truffle butter! OMG, it was so good. I would definitely come back.
