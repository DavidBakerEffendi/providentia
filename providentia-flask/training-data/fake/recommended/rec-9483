Ippudo is compelling me to rearrange my top 5 ramen spots. It's good. Upon my most recent trip to NY, both Totto & Ippudo were on my list - for this round, Ippudo NY (East Village) was chosen for lunch. *Wait time: Based upon Yelp reviews, I was worried... for nothing luckily. I went on a Monday, arrived around noon to hold a table for 5. No wait. Lunch plans weren't until 1:30PM so we walked around to pass time waiting for friends. Even at 1:25PM, no wait. *Food: -Tako Wasabi ($5.00), the usual :) -Hirata Pork Buns ($9.00 | 2 pieces). These steamed buns were flavorful, the bit of iceberg lettuce balanced the sauce. Very good. Waitress was sweet to help us cut them in half to share. -Everyone ordered the Akamaru Modern [$14.00] and all added the Nitamago [Seasoned soft boiled egg $2]. The tonkotsu broth tastes good on its own - I made sure to taste it before mixing in the miso paste. I was excited to see the black garlic oil. Personally, the chashu is always the defining factor when it comes to me loving the entire ramen or not so much. The pork chashu here is very soft! Mmm.
