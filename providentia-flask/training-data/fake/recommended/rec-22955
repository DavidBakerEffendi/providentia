Lidia's famous saying that invites guests as if they were family may hold true in her other US restaurants, but she forgot to explain it to the staff at Becco. My business associate and I went there for dinner on Friday evening. I ordered the mixed grill and my associate ordered the special of three pastas. We told the waiter we wanted to share. When the meal came we exchanged portions of our meal. The maitre d' arrived and scolded us for sharing, telling us that she had to up charge us $9 for sharing. Evidently the pasta dish was all you can eat and I guess they thought we were going to ruin a profitable night. We told her we did not want more food, we just wanted to share what we ordered. I said go ahead add $9.00 to our tab. Nine bucks. Big deal. My associate objected on principle. A scene ensued. At one point in this ridiculous fiasco I suggested she call the police. What a great episode of Lidia's Kitchen that would have been. The maitre d' left. We finished our meal in peace. If I remove this pathetic display of inhospitable behavior toward patrons and attempt to objectively rate the meal, I would give the food two stars. Both dishes were acceptable, but unremarkable. The temperature of the food was warm, not hot. For the price one can do much better at Cellini, Tony Di'Napoli, Carmines or La Masseria. Back at the New York Hilton the concierge overhead me telling this story. Her reaction to my story was telling. Between her and the people reading this review, the pathetic behavior of the Becco maitre d' and the average food itself hpoefully pays the rewards Becco deserves. Oh, we thought about ordering dessert and sharing. We left.
