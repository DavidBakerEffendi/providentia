I understand that Ippudo's ramen has a huge cult following, but personally I was not that impressed. You often have to wait around an hour (even if you come right as they start the dinner service), and for the food and price, I personally don't find it worth it. At $16 a bowl, I was expecting a huge portion of noodles -- but after I finished, I was merely satisfied, if not able to eat more. Although the noodles were cooked at a perfect al dente and the broth was flavorful, to get more noodles or meat or veggies, it usually costs extra. Also, I came here with a vegetarian friend and she ended up getting the only ramen made with vegetable broth, which she said wasn't that good. I am also not a huge fan of the blasting techno/electronic music and dark, mood lighting... I've definitely had better ramen at a cheaper price in NYC. It's a great place to bring friends who are visiting the city just to give them the experience of trying Ippudo... but I'm not a huge fan.
