I love going to great cafes and coffee bars to relax, read, write while enjoying good coffee and food. I found the fine grind on Yelp and was happy that I visited. The cafe has a great vibe and was busy with guests when I arrived on a Sunday. It reminded me of a great cafe that I visit whenever I'm home in upstate NY. I ordered a soy latte and the quiche of the day. The latte was delicious as was the quiche. I loved that the quiche was served with a fresh salad and homemade dressing. I was able to sit and enjoy without feeling burdensome and thought the server was friendly. My one complaint was that there was only one server for the entire place. This didn't seem sufficient for the amount of tables and people that were present. I noticed many tables eagerly waiting to be helped or waiting impatiently with their check. Who knows? Maybe someone didn't show up for their shift or maybe it was unusually busy, but the service was the one downfall. I will be back!
