Went here for my b-day with my parents who aren't usually into the fancy expensive small plate kind of stuff but I gave it a shot and they liked it. My big plate of monkfish was awesome. Dad's small plate of scallops were good too but not as a full meal. Mom got the short rib ravioli. She liked them but I didn't get to try them (I guess thats a good sign). dessert was awesome - apple turnovers that came with ice cream and a shot of hot apple cider (the best part!) Cute little row home place. My only advice is to go with an app and a big plate if you are hungry or get a few small plates. I recommend the pickle veggies. a perfect start to the meal.
