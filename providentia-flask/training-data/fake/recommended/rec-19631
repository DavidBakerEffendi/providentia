Snagged a groupon for this place but I think it will be a go-to. La Panineria is a feast for the senses. It's small, but well lit and not overdecorated. The shop smells sooooo good and when you eat in, you're served on the most adorable bamboo trays. The woman behind the counter is very sweet and patient. I ordered the Alba to go. It came with a free soda and I was happy to see they had San Pellegrino, my fave. I traipsed to Washington Square Park to dine al fresco and was in love with just how amazing it smelled before I even took a bite. Then I ate: fluffy, slightly chewy cibatta, salty fatty procuitto, gooey melted fontina, and the most gorgeous drizzle of truffle oil. So, so yummy. Looking forward to making my way through the menu and trying a few pastries as well.
