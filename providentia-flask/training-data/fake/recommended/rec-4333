This basement space off of 17th street is A-OK, but nothing that knocked my socks off.  The staff was kind of short with my boyfriend and I, even though they weren't busy: there was only one other couple sitting at a table.   I got the Chihuahua and my boyfriend got the Texas Tommy; we both agreed mine was better.  The chihuahua is a chorizo style sausage covered with white queso and peppers.  It was tasty, although it really bothered me that the dogs were both kind of luke warm-- I thought its called a "hot" dog for a reason?  Unlike many reviewers before me, I didn't have a problem with the bun (maybe they changed their vendor?).  It complemented the dog without overwhelming.  The best aspect of the meal were the crispy fries, which we got a mountain of.  The garlic aioli dipping sauce was good, but strangely cold... I think Underdogs would make great drunk food, or a good snack when I have an insatiable hankering for a hot dog, but otherwise, it's just another average, somewhat-overpriced fast food joint in Center City. One big no-no: the bathroom is nasty.  Like a gas station.  Poorly maintained and no paper towels.  You've been warned.
