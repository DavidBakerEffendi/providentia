Given how crowded Cafe Henri was for Sunday brunch, my friends and I decided to check out Open Door across the street. The first thing I noticed upon entering was how empty it was on a Sunday afternoon. Nonetheless we were initially satisfied with finding a place for us to sit down, eat, and catch up. I ordered the set of three sliders - duck, beef, and pork - and a side of fries. To be honest, the sliders were quite bland that even the mayonnaise and sauces could not redeem the flavor. The sliders were presented with their buns to the side such that I could not tell which bun was assigned to which burger. Each bun had a different condiment and I forgot the menu description, so it wasn't an easy match-making process. The fries were too soft that it seemed as if they were microwaved from frozen. My friend ordered slices of lox which were salty. The general consensus among my friends was that the food was mediocre. I would not go here if your primary goal is to get a well made and tasty brunch. However, if you do want bottomless brunch for $20 (which at that point food quality is not a major concern), this is the place to go. Perhaps this is more of a happy hour joint? I'm sure it's better for drinks.
