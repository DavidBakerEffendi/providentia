Came here after catching a show at the Cellar and was not disappointed. They had seated us up front by the fireplace which was nice on the chilly evening. Would have rather sat in the "romantic" garden but ya can't always get what you want.  :) They had a great wine list and the server was quite helpful with my questions and seemed to be knowledgeable.  Food came out promptly and was delicious. Would absolutely return if I'm in the area.
