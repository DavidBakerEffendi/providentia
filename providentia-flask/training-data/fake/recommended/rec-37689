An awesome place and I am so happy my friend shared it. The small sandwiches are perfect and delicious. Just what they should be. I would have gone 5stars but the sangria is literally just wine (1/3) and Sierra Mist (2/3) - so that was a little disappointing. But what should I have expected for $3?! :)
