I am from San Diego and love this place called Bronx Pizza. This Place is way better. Modern is soooooo good. The pizza is amazing. For an appetizer you must get the garlic bread. It is delicious. I love modern pizza. It is the best PIZZA in NEW HAVEN!!!!! And New Haven is known for pizza!! I love Modern Pizza
