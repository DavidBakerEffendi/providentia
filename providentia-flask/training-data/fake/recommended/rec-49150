Best accidental discovery ever. Warm, cozy, friendly, perfect atmosphere, truly great food, superb service, a hidden gem in the West Village. Highly recommend. Best kale salad ever. Go. I felt like family in here. Oh, and the broccoli soup they gave me (*gave*) was seriously the most delicious I have ever had.
