I've left this place because of the noise level and this time decided to stick it out.  The roast pork with mashed potatoes was OK and the service was fine.  However, the noise and smashed together tables make this a tough place to come if you want to hold a conversation without yelling.  Haven't had enough of the food to comment overall.
