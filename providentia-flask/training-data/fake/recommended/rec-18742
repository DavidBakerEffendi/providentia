We went twice in one night to Riposa 72.  We were in UWS and wanted a comfortable and reviewed Wine Bar.  We chose this one for the reviews were great about the food and they were right!  We were greeted by a lovely waiter who gave us the window table.  We got wine and a cheese platter with Parmaggiano Reggiano that was beautiful and delicious!  The platter was perfect for two people and very filling. We also ordered the herbed olives.  Wow!  We were thoroughly impressed.  We are olive fanatics and not only were they fabulous but plentiful.  A big bowl of them including toasted baguette slices.   Wish I had room for the talked about vegetarian  flatbread, which I am surely having on our next visit . Our friends went back with us for more wine after a dinner at Cafe Talulah, and we had a great relaxing night enjoying a nice wine selection.
