Ever since I went to Barcelona, I've been on a search for a Spanish omelette as good as the one I had there. Nai Tapas is as close as you can get! All the tapas that we tried were excellent. I really think you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Not to mention the prices are so reasonable! I came with a group of 3, we ordered 5 or 6 tapas, a salad, and a pitcher of sangria, and the bill only came out to $88! That's pretty freaking awesome if you ask me. The atmosphere is also really nice and cozy, it felt like being in Spain. Bonus - on Thursdays & Saturdays they have a flamenco show which is really cool and entertaining to watch. Also, it was a friends birthday, and they bring all the birthday people to the stage area and give them a quick flamenco lesson - awesome!
