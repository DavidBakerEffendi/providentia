We overheard someone saying that they were short-staffed. That was the only reason that we had any idea that this was the case.  The staff was gracious, the dining room beautiful, and the food was really delicous. We went for lunch during restaurant week and I was disappointed to see on the menu that all we could choose from were the sandwiches.  How wrong I was. What we had was so incredibly tasty. The pita was really special, just the right thickness, and chewiness and tasted soooooooooo good.  The baba ganouj tasted of fire roasted eggplants and lemon- fresh, light, and exquisite.   I had the lamb kebab sandwich and it was everything it ever should and could be. I would go back again, but I think the regular prices are out of my budget. However, would def go back next restaurant week.
