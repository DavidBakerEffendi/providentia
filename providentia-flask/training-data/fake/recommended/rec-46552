The only reason this place is not getting 5 stars from me is the horrendous noise level in the dining room and bar area.  So far I have been able to sit at an outdoor table (the street is fairly quiet) to avoid the noise.  My dining partners and I agreed it would be a great warm weather place to dine--but not winter, when we would be forced indoors. Now--on to the FOOD.  Complex, creative, consistent.  Example: Perfectly seared scallops, served on a bed of corn risotto, flavored with chorizo, chipotle flakes and sorrel.  A combination I would have never imagined, yet delicious.  A flavor I will crave at odd moments, I'm sure. I was also fortunate enough to try the carrot/ginger/lime soup--jazzed up with a little kick of heat (could it be wasabi?)  Fantastic.  I'm not usually a sweet soup fan. At my first visit, the server recommended a Spanish red ($16 for the glass, and I'm hunting for a place to purchase it by bottle now...it's my new favorite.) Meals are accompanied by a crazy delicious bread--a fresh-from-the oven brioche-y roll, topped with a crunch of sea salt, and served with carmelized onion whipped butter.  Melts in your mouth. I'm looking forward to trying more from the seemingly modest, but endlessly impressive menu.
