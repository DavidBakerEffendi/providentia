Been here twice. Once for dinner and recently for breakfast. The first time was for dinner  w/c was long time ago, I remember waiting for 45 mins for a table. I was w/ a friend and we were both visiting new york and wanted some french food. We decided to come here since it was highly recommended by a friend. I had the fettucine w/ wild mushrooma and parmesean and a cheese plate that was very good. The service was not as good as the food. Our waitress that night wasn't very attentive and took  a while to get our order w/c kinda pissed me off since we waited 45 mins for a table.. The second time I came was for breakfast. Did not wait this time. We were seated right away. I had the french toast and tried my mom's scrambled egg in puff pastries. It was both very good. The scrambled egg in puff pastry was really tasty w/c was expected because we paid over $ 70 breakfast for 3 people. The service this time was better than the last. It seems like they have an employee for everything. There's the guy that refills the coffee, a different person that took our order and a different person that brought our food...so many people that served us that it was overwhelming. Since I enjoyed the puff pastry, we went to the other side after breakfast to buy some more pastries to take home. This place getsa really packed for breakfast and dinner. Reservations highly recommended.
