For the best soba on the East Coast, this is the best place to be. You all might wonder why I gave 3-stars instead of 4 or more based on my accolade on top.  Well, that is because the service and quantity fall far behind.  Let me talk about the good parts first. My favorite dish here is the Cold Uni Soba for $20.  It is ambrosia to my mouth.  The rich buttery sea urchin roe flavors the whole experience making every swallow comforting and soothing. The cold refreshing broth, at the same time,  giving you a sense of consuming a cleansing, almost healing draft. The desserts are also a pure delight. The quality of food is first rate, but the portion size is for the dieter or those well practiced on fasting.   Each bowl of soba can be consumed with three of four bites, and you must depend on the broth to fill you the rest of the way... which is about 2 metric cups worth of liquid.  I often need to order two bowls to stop my hunger pangs, which can get pricey. Now the service through the most part seems fine till you need your check taken care of, or if you want to sit down and talk to your dining partner while ordering more.  Took 40 minutes for them to get the check to me once.  Another time a server came to us and ask us to leave so others could be seated... we were going to order seconds and dessert.
