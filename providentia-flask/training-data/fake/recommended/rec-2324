I take a stroll down Italian Market atleast once a week, and I always stop at Sarcone's to pick up some fresh bread. This week I picked up half a dozen steak rolls because I was making my special homemade cheesesteaks. (Yum!) I've noticed that some people do not favor the hard rolls, but to me they embody everything an authentic Philly roll is all about. They are nice and crispy on the outside...soft, warm, and doughy on the inside. (Oh, and let me just tell you...the cheesesteaks I made were slammin. lol) I also like to stop here before I go visit my 75-year-old grandfather, a South Philly native, who for the past 40 years has lived at the shore. I like to bring him down a fresh, rustic loaf of Italian bread and it makes him smile...because nothing beats the taste of true South Philly bread.
