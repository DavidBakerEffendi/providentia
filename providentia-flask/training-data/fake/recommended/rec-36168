Damn, that was good!  Wife and i walked by this place on our way to little italy for dinner.  It was packed, so i looked it up and saw all the great reviews.  We decided to put our name down and wait the hour for a table for two. So glad we did - it turned out to be the best meal of our nearly week long trip to NYC.  Definitely lived up to the hype expressed here on Yelp and elsewhere.
