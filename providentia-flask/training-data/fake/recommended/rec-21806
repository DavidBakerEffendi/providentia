Ready for this? Petit Oven is steadily becoming my MOST favorite restaurant in Bay Ridge. It's small, cozy, and comfortable. The kitchen is truly petit. But goodness... the FOOD that comes out of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We try to come here at least once a month, because the specials and pre-fixed menu is always an evolving, exotic french-style combinaton of the most delicious appetizers and entrees. For example, on last night's menu, Â they had a MOST amazing fried eggplant cake with ricotta filling, and our entrees were a soft-as-butter braised pork in gravy and Medium-rare grilled crispy salmon with Russian Kale... the salmon was prbly the best piece I've had in a long, long time. Dessert? gosh. My baked banana crepe was on a bed of dark, cocoa chocolate cream and across from that was a bread pudding in a salted caramel to die for. Sometimes I wanna go back there into that Petit Oven and just give the Chef a big hug.
