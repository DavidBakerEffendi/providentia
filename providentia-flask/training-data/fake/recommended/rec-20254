From the very rude hostess to the mute bartenders who never uttered a sentence to me the entire time I seated in their section at the bar, the horrible service ruined my first and last experience at this restaurant. Â  I don't think the hostess saying "yeah yeah, whatever" and turning your back to a customer while they are speaking to is very professional or inviting! My meal was just ok and with so many other awesome restaurants (Prime Meats, Wing Bar, Clover Club, Frankies, Henry Republic) in the Carroll Gardens/Cobble Hill area (which I've lived in for 3.5 years), I don't feel like I am missing out if I never ate at this restaurant again.
