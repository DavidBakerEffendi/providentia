Skip the main entrees and opt for an appetizer tasting. Keftedes were delicious. Small, crunchy on the outside and tender in the inside balls of goodness.  The tziki sauce it came with fir dipping was good, but could have used a little more garlic. Grilled squid was so perfectly cooked.  All it needed was a squeeze of lemon. The Greek fries were really excellent.  They use a whole potato, not frozen and fry it and tip it with crumbled cheese and oregano.  They forgot to add the oregano, so we had to ask them to bring us a little dish of it. For the entree, we had the special, chicken breast stuffed with spinach and feta.  The filling was really excellent, and so was the rice and salad, but the chicken was a little dry. We were too full in the end to order dessert.  The portions were huge and the bill was small :)
