Forget Ippudo! :) There are two ramen places that I like in this world. One is in Tokyo and one is Tottoo ramen in NYC. My favorites are Uni Don and Vegetable Ramen. This place is not big. I wouldn't go with a big group. Waiting is about 20~30 min. Â On rainy days, I'd bring umbrellas since they don't have a waiting room inside. it is SO worth it though. :)
