Wow, perhaps we caught Oak Haven on its worst night but it's been a while since I've experienced food or service this bad. I arrived with 4 friends with the intent of sharing several small dishes and enjoying the nice outdoor seating area. Service was downright neglectful, but since the weather was nice we weren't really bothered. What did bother us though was the quality of the food. Oak Haven's salad was a joke, the pork belly was tough and gelatinous, the mussels had gone bad (literally) ... in fact seven of the eight dishes we got were absolutely awful. The crabcakes were the only decent thing we had that entire night. To the Oak Haven mgmt: there is no reason your food should be this bad. The whole point of Gastropub food is that it is simple and tasty. There is also no reason your service should be this bad. I support new businesses in New Haven, but I've got to say, avoid Oak Haven - it's supremely overrated and their food is terrible.
