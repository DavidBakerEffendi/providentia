Really, Yelpers?  The best cheesesteak you've ever had??  This is the first time Yelp's led me astray in quite awhile. Just not good.  At all.  I know cheesesteak is an institution, which means anything resembling an "ambiance" will be an afterthought, but this was ridiculous.  It's an order, wait, pickup kinda place, with nowhere to wait.  So I had to hover over the patrons at the bar to the right, trying to give space to the line of people to the left. With high praise here and the out-the-door line, I was looking forward to great cheesesteak.  What I got was... well, not.  We went out of the way for this one (it's out toward the 'burbs), and I wish we hadn't wasted that time.
