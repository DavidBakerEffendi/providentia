My date suggested we dine at Tia Pol, I have had this place on my mental list of places to try but it is seldom that I am in this area to spark my memory. It was Saturday the place was bustling but we managed to get a table after about a 5 min wait. We were seated towards the back by the bano, kind of annoying because it's a onesie and while everyone waited to go in they kind of lingered staring at our table. Â  The acoustics led to a few, "huh what was that you said" moments but the part of the evening that was a win aside from my date was the music, they played the entire Purple Rain album...awesome, for me anyway. We enjoyed several tapas but the stand outs for me were the artichokes wrapped in ham and the fried pot roast that was the special of the night. The sangria was a little on the sweet side but good. For dessert we tried the almond cake it was a little dry I was expecting it to be more like tres leches. Overall it was a pleasant experience there is a cute little room in the back where you could possibly have a small dinner party with friends.
