This place is amazing.  My wife and I went the Sunday after Irene was supposed to wreck NYC (if there was a storm, we slept right through it...and apparently the cleanup too).  Gramercy was one of the only nice restaurants open that night, so we headed over. They weren't taking reservations and only the bar area was open for dinner, so there was about an hour wait.  We grabbed a cocktail and stood near the bar trying to get two seats together.  First impression...the place has a great ambience and hot damn their drinks are good.  One of the best Old Fashioned cocktails I've ever had. I had the meatball and my wife had the pork shoulder.  Both were absolutely amazing.  I finished mine and then cleaned my wife's plate. In the top 5 dining experiences of my life.
