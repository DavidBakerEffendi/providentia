This is by far my favorite restaurant in the West Village. I may be a teeny bit bias because I live across the street but every person I have brought here has been utterly enchanted by both the ambience and the service. There is a garden in the back of the restaurant that is open year round (covered in the winter) with beautiful flowers and vine. It is so romantic and does not feel like you are anywhere near NYC. When I got to Palma I always get the meatballs, these little browned cheesy balls of amazingness. The burrata is fantastic ( if they have it) and the fried artichokes for starters. They usually will have one or two specials usually some type of fresh pasta or fish and I have never had one I didn't love. The spinach filled ravioli is awesome as is the glorious homemade paperdelle with kalamata olives and lamb. ok, you get the point this place is great. On top of everything, there is this little old carriage house in the back of the garden that is available for private parties. Â I have been to two private dinners in the carriage house and it's perfect for 10-20 people in a beautiful old dining room setting by candle light. I HIGHLY recommend the carriage house for any birthday party for a loved one it will be such a great surprise and such a memorable experience. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE.
