Simply Awesome! I came here Saturday night with a group of 7 because we had heard great things about it, and boy did they not disappoint. From the amazing "quality" craft beer selection (I'm a bear snob and it's nice to see things that I don't normally see). A really good crowd mix, not hipsters, not wall street types, just a real cool, lively mix of people out to have fun and not to just be seen. Plus, an awesome drink selection! Â Add to that as busy as they were and to actually get bartenders who actively looked to give service, truly a great place that I can't wait to go back to. They nailed it! P.S. Get the shrimp sliders, high grade shrimp, and delicious!!!
