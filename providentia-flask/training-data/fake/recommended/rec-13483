Forgive me Peaches, for denying you your well-deserved review. A few months ago, I made my way to this cozy place. The regular chicken was crispy but not too greasy. I tried some extra spicy and everything I ate tasted spicy for a while after that... I heard you can ask for the Owner's Box if you want something even spicier than that! What's commendable is not only the great fried chicken, but also the above-average sides! We tried all the sides on the menu collard greens, grits, French fries, bacon creamed corn, asparagus, garlic kale, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes... The collard greens were the biggest surprise. The texture was just right--- not too mushy, and the hint of spiciness gave it a little kick. And the bacon creamed corn, as the name suggests, was just amazing. And don't let those unassuming French fries trick you... they were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The grits and mac and cheese turned out to be the most underwhelming--they were ok, but the other sides were just so awesome that they paled in comparison. Wow.. I spent half of the review raving about the sides... but the entire meal was enjoyable! I also had some kind of blueberry lemonade that was awesome.
