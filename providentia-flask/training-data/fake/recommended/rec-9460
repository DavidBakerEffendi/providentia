Food is sublime here. The apps alone will fill you up. Tip, share, share, share. I have a healthy appetite & we still brought half a chicken home. Reccomend the stuff pepper & of course the whole chicken for 2. Only thing that bothered me was the paper napkins. If you want to be upscale then have cloth napkins, paper just falls off your lap & you need to borrow from unoccupied table...haha! Waiter was very nice & I recommend trying the Peruvian beer as well as ending with the Dolce de Leche.  Will be back for more... bueno,  bonito,  barrato!
