We went to Cuban Petes Friday, January 17th with a party of 16. When we initially arrived we were quoted a 2 hour wait. After about 30 minutes of watitng the manager came outside to check on us (I do not remember his name a gentleman about 5'6 with dark hair). We told him the wait would be 2hours and he told us he could get us inside faster than that, and he delivered his promise. We waited 45min and were seated (thank goodness for the party that didn't show up). They wait staff was very accomodating to myself and our guests. I love the vibe of the restaurant and foor was amazing, especially those empanadas! Thank you so much for making my best friend's birthday a night to remember. We truly appreciate you!
