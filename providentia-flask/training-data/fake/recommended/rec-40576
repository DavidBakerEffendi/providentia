I have been on two trips to Philadelphia in the last month and came here for brunch on both occasions. I was happy both times. I love the ambiance and decor of the place. Kind of retro mid-century modern. Servers wear different color Lacoste polo shirts. They are all very friendly and attentive. The food is very good standard brunch fare. I love the omelets. They are served with tater tots as opposed to the standard hash browns one gets at a diner. Very nice twist and tasty too. My first trip I went on a Saturday morning and it was quite pleasant. This last time, I went on Sunday shortly after noon and it was much more crowded but still no wait for a table. Â I did find it to be a little on the loud side. Otherwise, it was fine.
