I had the Zon Sandwich which was excellent although I'm used to pork rather than chicken in the standard banh mi - the bread was delicious and the fresh cilantro and other vegetables, along with the pate etc. was amazing. I asked for medium spicy when asked, being concerned that full spicy would be too hot, but I could probably have gone withe full spice. I also had some shrimp spring rolls which weren't too exciting. The banh mi sandwich was clearly the high point.
