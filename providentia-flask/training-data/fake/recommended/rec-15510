Truly one of my favorite northern Italian spots. Â Great food, laid back European feel, and amazing prices. Spaghetti Al Limone is a MUST as well as the mini veal meatball appetizer. Also LOVE that literally everyone is an expert in Italian wine, I recommend leaving it up to your waiter to pair a nice bottle with your meal!
