I am a huge fan of Indian food and India Palace is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the area. I moved to New Haven from the Boston/Cambridge area where there is a plethora of really good Indian food to be had and India Palace is right up there with the best of them.   The staff is also welcoming and friendly, the food is fresh and tasty, never a layer of oil like some other places in the area.   Yes, they do offer a lot of cream/dairy laden dishes to please the American palate but that is easily resolved by reading the menu/ordering something without it.   They are also quite accommodating to special diets, you just have to ask.   Their vegetarian selection is also pretty good as well.   They offer coupons/specials as well if you order online (they offer online ordering through several websites). I've eaten both in the dining room as well as takeout (I get takeout from here quite often) and have never been displeased. I live a little too far away for delivery, but I don't mind picking food up here as the street parking is so easy.  I never have trouble finding a nearby spot on the street but they also have a lot behind the building (I am not sure where the entrance is though, they keep telling me but I always forget).   I like pretty much everything on the menu but the dishes I most often re-order are the Saag Paneer, Chicken Korma, and Kashmiri Naan (which is sweet and more like a dessert - so delicious).    The samosas are delicious as well.   My friend always gets the Lamb Vindaloo and is a big fan.   Definitely give them a try!
