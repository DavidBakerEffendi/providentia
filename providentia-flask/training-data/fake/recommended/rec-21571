Hands down my favorite pizza place in the city. Although I don't think I've ever actually had pizza from there. It wouldn't matter if the food blew, the owner and her daughter are two of the kindest people I've ever met. Luckily, the food doesn't suck! Last time I went in and they basically forced me to eat a sample of their sweet potato fries with honey mustard. I usually hate sweet potato fries. They changed my mind. My only complaint would be that it is closed on the most random of times.
