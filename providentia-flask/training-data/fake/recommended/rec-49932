We were looking for someplace different for lunch, so we decided to give Tunxis Grill a shot. We started with chicken pot pie egg rolls, served with a white gravy dipping sauce. A different idea, but a good choice. Even if the rest of the meal was blah, we'd still go back for this. I ordered the baked mac and cheese, which had homemade meatloaf chunks mixed in, and a cornbread topping. Penne noodles were al dente, cheese sauce not overbearing. My companion got a cheddar cheese burger with French fries. The burger was well-done (or rather, well-cooked, not overdone), cooked just as was asked and very juicy. Unfortunately, we were both too full to order dessert, so no review there. I looked over their beer selection and was impressed by (1) their selection of craft beer, and (2) specifically their inclusion of Breckenridge Vanilla Porter, Back East Ale, and City Stram Naughty Nurse. Overall, four stars. We will definitely be going back.
