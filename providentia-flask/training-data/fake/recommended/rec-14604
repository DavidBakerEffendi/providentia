This ACTUALLY gets 10 stars out of 5 but I have no way of showing that on this review haha. Went here on a weekday for a late lunch and there wasn't really a line but there was a steady stream of people coming in and out.  Ordered the plain cheese/basil/tomato pizza for my friend and I to share and it was literally out in 5 minutes, maybe even less.  I think that the word 'perfection' was invented after someone took a bite of this pizza.  That is the only way I can describe it. LOVE IT! If I could teleport, I would get Grimaldi's for lunch every day!
