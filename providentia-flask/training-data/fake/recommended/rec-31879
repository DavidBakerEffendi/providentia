The decor is absolutely breathtaking, the staff is great, the drinks are excellent, however I will *never* go to this place again. The reason: Dragergate 2013 (the church versus Breakfast at Epiphany's drag show). (oh, just google huffington post drag show etc. if you don't know it, I won't explain here if you don't know what I am talking about). It doesn't matter that it all turned out ok in the end, what matters is that the business owners promptly caved in to homophobic bullying from the catholic church next door. I do not patronize businesses that do not IMMEDIATELY stand up for my rights, and the rights of my gay, drag and queer sisters and brothers. OVER!
