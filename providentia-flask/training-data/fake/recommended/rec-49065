Still a big fan of Kumos -50% off deal -Some sushi restaurants like to stuff their rolls with rice and fried things, but the rolls at kumos are always generous on the filling (fish, avocado, etc) and sparing on the rice. Nice, simple, refreshing, and yum. I always get the salmon avocado roll and spicy salmon hand roll. And if I'm particularly hungry I'll also get a mushroom soup. They have big soup portions :) The gyoza is not bad either. Take note that they only accept credit card transactions for bills $15 or over.
