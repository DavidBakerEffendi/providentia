This restaurant is inconspicuous in its location and decor, but I wanted to write a review because the food here is really stellar. I'm pretty addicted to the chicken shish taouk. I've tried many schwarma places (in this price range) in many different cities, but the food really stands out in this one. Every person I've taken there has seemed to have the same reaction-- I don't think you go in expecting anything special, but then you get very tasty food at a great price.
