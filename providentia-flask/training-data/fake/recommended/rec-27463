This place was fine; the decor is decent. It's obvious that they tried hard but it somehow misses the mark. I found the restaurant somewhat soulless.  The space was too tight - they set the tables very close to one another (about 6" -8" inches on either side) and we couldn't really concentrate on our food/conversation because we were overwhelmed by other people's convos on either side of us.  The sun shone through the windows and was a bit blinding for those seated facing the window. The prices are a bit inflated. We started off with a crumpet with bacon marmalade.  For $5 it was a disappointment - it wasn't spongy. Instead it tasted somewhat bland and dense.  The marmalade was also kind of tasteless.  The portion are small.  The salt cod hash was solid.  The baked eggs were pretty good.   The coffee, though only $1.75, came in a small mug, and was not bottomless.  This is unusual for brunch (and unacceptable, actually).  We're happy to see new restaurants open up in the area, but I think we will head back to Tom's for brunch in the future.
