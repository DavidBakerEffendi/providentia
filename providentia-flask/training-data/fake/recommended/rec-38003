This was our go-to Mexican take-out for the 2 years we lived in Princeton.  I've had a variety of things off the menu and really liked all of them, with the exception of one enchilada dish that was so spicy I traded it to my husband.  He was excited to have something that was actually spicy and so we both won there. It definitely lacks in ambience, hence the take-out, but a huge win especially considering the wait.  I see a ton of comparisons with Tortuga's but it's not the same kind of place at all.
