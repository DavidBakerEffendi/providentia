Best burger in the city. Period. I've been going to Royale since it opened and the quality has always been top notch. The burgers are always just the right size and cooked perfectly. Onion rings are also great and not overly battered. Good beer selection--cheap cans of Pork Slap Pale Ale. Awesome backyard for the summertime. How can it get better? Actually, I'll give one suggestion--they should turn down the damn music a notch or two so if you eat indoors you can actually hear the person sitting next to you. But you know something, even though they won't turn it down, I'll still give them 5-stars and go back and eat with a big smile on my face. Their burgers really are just that good!
