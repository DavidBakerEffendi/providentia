Looked for last minute Thai restaurant and came across this awesome find!!! We were seated at the bar straight away, wait for table was over an hour as the place was packed! Ordered taco, spring rolls and the skewer grill for two, everything was delish! Great service, good vibe, amazing food, affordable. I asked the waitress what the ingredients were for one of the dipping sauces so the head chef came and introduced herself and shared the recipe. Really lovely people! I'll be back for sure!
