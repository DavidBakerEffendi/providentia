A casual, comfortable place with very good food. Food: Creative, fresh and tasty. Value: A little high for an egg sandwich, but it's not an ordinary egg sandwich. Service: Friendly. A little slow, but worth the wait. Atmosphere: Casual and comfortable. A little cramped. I think they only serve wine, but not sure. If in the area I will come back.
