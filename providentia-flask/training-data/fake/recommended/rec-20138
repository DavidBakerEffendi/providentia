This is a cute, cozy little place that offers bubble tea, banh mi sandwiches and free WiFi. Their vegetarian banh mi sandwich is phenomenal! Great flavor in the filling, and the bread was perfectly toasted. Definitely one of the best, if not the best veggie banh mi I've ever had. The owners were also really nice and welcoming. They mentioned that they plan to have outdoor seating when it gets warmer (or IF it gets warmer at this rate!) and will also be introducing summer rolls to their menu as well. I will definitely be back!
