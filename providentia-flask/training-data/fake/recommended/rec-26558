Their variety of beers and delicious burger combinations are what drive me to keep coming back here. Part of me wonders if they have decorated excessively for Halloween or if this is just how the bar is all year: Hell's Kitchen would have a halloweeny theme everyday of the year. Their juke box is cash only and even though it's a touch tunes brand it's not set up for for mobile phones to use. Twice now I have entered here seeing a sign outside that read "brick city burlesque" and "poleternative" suggesting that there would be burlesque dancers or strippers. They do have a strip pole in the middle of the place but their lack of strippers makes me question if it's merely a decorative support beam. Their lack of naked women aside, it's a great place to grab a beer and watch what's on their TV.
