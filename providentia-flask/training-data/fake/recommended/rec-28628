I've only recently started to navigate my way through West Hartford and happy to have had the chance to check out Rizzutos!  The restaurant has a great atmosphere - exposed kitchen, high ceilings, and sort of a European feel.  They also have a patio that looked really nice if you could get a seat out there. They had a great cocktail list with a lot of spin-off type of drinks.  As for food, I went for one of their wood-fire pizzas and was not disappointed.  The barbecue chicken and fig pizza was so good!  The combination of sweet and savory on a pizza - you pretty much can't go wrong.  My date got the chicken piccatta and was really pleased with that as well. Rizzutos is a great place for a date or just dinner with some friends.  I would be more than happy to go back and check out some other stuff on their menu!
