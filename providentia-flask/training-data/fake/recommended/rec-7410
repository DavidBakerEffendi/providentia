Waited for ages with a party of 4 to be seated, but the staff was apologetic and comped us an appetizer when we finally sat down. The food was incredible and honestly worth the wait. We got one of almost everything to share - the Khao Soi and Coconut rice topped out as my absolute favorite! Go very hungry!!
