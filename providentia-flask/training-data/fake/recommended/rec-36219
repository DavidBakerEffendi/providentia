Minus .5 star for being a pain to get a table. Went for dinner with my wife and had a fine time.  Had the Ricotta to start, followed by Pappardelle with Lamb + Pumpkin Agnolotti, finished with Maple/Cranberry Budino.  The Ricotta was lovely, just the right texture and temperature and matched perfectly with the bread served with it.  I found both pasta dishes to have excellent and somewhat complex flavors but the texture was not perfect as one would expect.  However, the dessert (budino mentioned earlier) was superb, a great finish.  Price for our dinner plus a bottle of wine was surprisingly reasonable.  Recommended (but get a reservation).
