So I'm kind of reminiscing now....going through my most missed places in New Haven since moving to Boston. My close second is Pepe's. My favorite pizza....cheese and anchovy! The anchovies melt perfectly adding just the right balance of salty and fishy to the sweet tomato sauce and cheese pizza. Boston has a looonnngg way to go when it comes to pizza. New Haven is the best when it comes to one of my favorite foods--pizza!
