Pepe Giallo is no frills, classic Italian. Meals are tasty and well made and well priced, what's not to love? The main restaurant is a one-room medium sized space with lots of tables put in. Apparently there is a garden out back but I never saw it. What I did see was a waiter who wanted to take care of us, a smallish two-sided menu with a good selection of pasta course and main dishes and a place that knows what it's doing. I got the pappardelle with sausage and tomato sauce and it was a delicious filling plate of giant noodles with sauce. My only sadness is I thought it would come with big pieces of sausage but they were actually finely chopped into the sauce. No problem though, still tasty. We also got the antipasta platter which was truly fantastic - meats, goat's cheese, veggies, so good together. They really do their meat well here. This place still considers itself old-school. There's no wifi and, as they proudly put on their shirts, no skim milk, no decaf coffee, no Diet Coke. But they do have a local homey feeling and good food, so if that's what you're after, stop in.
