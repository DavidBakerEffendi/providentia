I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. It has a welcoming atmosphere: it's nicer than just a bar, with plenty of outdoor seating. The food is very affordable. For some reason I'm in love with their caesar salad w/calamari. My husband liked his burger, and he also appreciated the good selection of beers that were on draft. One thing that was lacking both times I went was the service. While the servers are very nice, it can take them a long time to come to the table. It was worse at lunch service (even though there was hardly anyone in the restaurant), but I noticed it during dinner as well.
