I wanted to like Umi, in fact I kinda loved it early on. Good atmosphere, cool belt setup and the sushi really solid. However, we've made a ton of return visits since it's early days and the food has definitely gotten worse and worse. The new menu isn't great and the sushi is very hit and miss. One night it'll be really solid and other nights, it'll be a total miss, it' s a real shame the food quality so is so uneven because the atmosphere is really great - feels like a dance club at times with the cool music pumping through the stereo system. I've probably been here about 10-15 times in the last year or two but haven't returned in the past couple of months because the last few visits have been as mediocre as it gets so I've had little reason to keep coming back.
