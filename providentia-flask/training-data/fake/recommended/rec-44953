I've always been a big fan of the meatball shop but after today's experience, not so much.  While waiting for a table,  my friend and I were sitting the bar and ordered a glasses of wine when we were asked to move to let another two people sit because they wanted to eat.  Is this standard practice because I have never heard of this.  Wouldn't they make more money off the drinks than the food?  Plus that's just rude. I gave it 3 stars because the meatballs are tasty and reasonably priced but I'm not sure if it's worth the wait especially if I can't even wait for a table at the bar.
