I was invited to dine here when in town for work. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I ordered the filet mignon with steak fries. The steak was cooked to perfection and the wild mushroom sauce on it was the best I ever tasted. The cheesy garlic bread was amazing too! My only complaint was they failed to keep my soda filled. Can't wait to eat here again next time I'm in Hartford.
