Amazing Â ! I love they're filet mignon, french fries (which are a foot high and extremely thin and crispy), cheesteak spring rolls, and pita bread and hummus. I come ALL the time. It is a cool and funky environment. The chairs are sooo cool. If you go, ask to be seated upstairs or on the top level. On the roof, there is outside seating and an indoor one for the winter. It's amazing!
