Excellent bar. Decor, service, energy and locally sourced items were all wonderful. Mike the bartender's excellent service made us come back each night we were in Vermont. The staff take their craft seriously and continually recommended winners. We took Mike's recommendation on dinner each night and weren't disappointed once. We will absolutely be back to Hotel Vermont and absolutely make many appearances at Juniper.
