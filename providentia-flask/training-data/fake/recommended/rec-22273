I wanted to love love love based on reviews on here and it being a Coliccio restaurant. The setting is odd, in an office park in an office building. However the setting once inside is stunning as is the outside seating. The views of NYC are amazing, I just wish that the food lived up to the surroundings. The service was amazing and the plates were beautifully built, but the flavor was just lacking. We had the scallops, octopus and hamachi dishes. After one bite of each, I really didn't want anymore. I found the cheese dish we had for dessert to be the best thing I ate. For the price, there are better more centrally located places to try.
