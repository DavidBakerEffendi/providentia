I have dined there a few times and the staff have been nice and the food just OK. I go there only because I felt comfortable there when dining alone. Â However tonight was an exception. It was Saturday evening and yes they were busy. I asked if they had a table for one and despite there being at least two open "tables for two" I was informed that for "one " I would have to sit in the lounge. I certainly didn't appreciate being treated like a second class citizen because I was a single diner. They might as well have asked me to sit in the parking lot. I left there feeling so demoralized and disgusted. It was a big mistake for Elaine's as I was in the mood for a nice filet mignon and a glass of wine and I always tip enough for two. Guess where I won't be going back to visit! Can I rate with negative stars? I am only rating with one star because I have to to register my posting although it deserves a "minus 5" today.
