So i saw this restauraunt on DDD, and decided that this will be on my to do list as part of my cousins engagement festivities. So arriving in NY from Bmore i stopped by the East village where this is located. Parking was hectic but that is to be expected in the city. The restauraunt was small and cozy, they had outdoor seating but we opted for indoor. After sitting in the car for 4 plus hours the noise in the bar area was just a little bit much. Anyhow, we ordered the chicken wings those were fantastic, I probably could have three servings of that goodness. Ordered wait for it, the goats neck. That was pretty good, extremely rich and plentiful, the meat was moist and fall of the bone literrally. It was more than enough for two people. I ordered a glass of wine and the Duck Buck. All in all great restauraunt, a tad noisy and the bathroom ohh mine something needs to be done.
