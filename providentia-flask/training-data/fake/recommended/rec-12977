I ate here recently when I was on a business trip and staying at the hotel next door, right off of 91. It's really the only restaurant option in the not-so-great area. There are signs everywhere saying "Connecticut's best seafood" and has all these rating signs everywhere. I can't imagine who these people are rating this place. It's kitschy and themed like you're by the water, but you're not, nowhere close. I went alone, and waited 15 minutes for a table, on a SUNDAY night. (When my table was ready, the hostess found it necessary to say my name and "table for one" over the PA system. I was sitting DIRECTLY in front of her) My waitress was friendly, if a bit overbearing. I got a small caesar salad (the only good thing about this place) and one of the dinner specials: Lobster mac and cheese. I wasn't expecting what I got. It was like macaroni in cheese and butter soup, with a few hard pieces of lobster on top. I've not had lobster that many times in my life, but I really don't think it's supposed to taste like this. It was hard and rubbery, with no flavor, and completely un-appetizing. I left most of the dish uneaten. It was way over-priced for what it was ($14.95). At this point, I was still hungry, so I ordered a piece of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake to go ($4.95). I get back to my hotel room, and the waitress didn't include utensils!! That's the key factor in "to-go". Also, it was horrible cheesecake. Completely bland. Threw most of that away also. Lastly, although I hesitate because it's gross, (don't read on if you're squeamish) I was up most of the night in the bathroom. So grossed out. Will not eat here again.
