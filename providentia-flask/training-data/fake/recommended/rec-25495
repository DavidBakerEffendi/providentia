Restaurants like this are the reason I should come to the city more often! How have I been living 1.5 hours away from a quaint little spot like this serving to-die-for food! Ok, let's rewind. I called the night before to get a reservation as I noticed they were booked full on OpenTable. They had some openings left via phone, so be sure to call if you're unable to book a table online! The hostess on the phone made sure to ask if we were coming for dinner before a Broadway show (and yes we were, Mamma Mia!) which I thought was extremely courteous. When our waiter came to the table to introduce himself and read the specials, I was so impressed with his knowledge to recite all 5 specials and their components and sides without looking at his book once! On top of that, he was so helpful and assisted us in choosing a wine from the $25 bottle wine list that resembled Pinot Noir as we had never heard of any of the Italian wines on the extensive list. See my uploaded photo for his recommendation that did not disappoint! How can $25 bottles be beat in this expensive city?! For dinner, we had osso bucco and grilled hangar steak with polenta. My lord did both of these melt in your mouth! We paid $9 extra to upgrade to the popular table side pasta trio. That night they served linguine with clams, beet and goat cheese ravioli, and farfalle with red sauce. Ugh, this pasta would have been enough and worth the trip! To finish, we had the dessert trio and the best tasting cappuccino I've ever had. We did not feel rushed one bit even though the place was packed full of Broadway show-goers. If you're looking for some fresh, high quality, traditional Italian at an affordable price before you see a show, you must come to Becco. You will not be disappointed!
