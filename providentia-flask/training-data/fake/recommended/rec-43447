I really like Midori for Princeton-area sushi.  There is a great selection on the menu and the lunch specials are very decently priced. Although I have never had any of the kitchen items, the sushi is fresh and tasty and usually very well presented.  The appetizers and special rolls are a tad bit small for what they are really which is why I knocked them down a star.  I can't really justify spending large amounts of money on an appetizer i finish in 5 small bites like the Midori chips, which are really just Pringles with fish on them. The lunch specials are a great deal because they give you lots of options (including special rolls!) so thats usually my favorite time to go.  The restaurant is very well decorated and the service is decent.  Worth the trip up rt.206 if you are visiting Princeton for sure!
