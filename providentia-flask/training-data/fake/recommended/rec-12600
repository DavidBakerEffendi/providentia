We got here around 11:48am and it was pretty empty, with about 3-4 tables filled. I was glad we got here early because around late 12pm, it was filling up quickly. I'm also glad we came here when the hype died down a little because I wasn't about to wait 2 hours for a burger. We got the sweet potato fries and tempura battered onion rings. My friend and I got the original burger and my other friend got the manly burger. Maybe this place was too hyped or maybe I ordered the wrong burger but I felt that the burger was just okay. I've tasted better. It's good, but not as good as I expected. But it was still flavorful. My other friend who ordered the manly burger said hers was pretty good. The sweet potato fries were so good. It was a perfect mixture of salty and sweet. When it arrived we immediately smelled the sweetness, there was a bit of cinnamonny smell to it. It was delicious. The sauces were good. We especially liked the orange sauce. The onion rings were okay. Not the best. I was scared to try the truffle fries and the truffle burger because of a previous experience at another place where their truffle fries didn't taste so good. Maybe Umami's is different. I don't know. I might come back to try their oh so famous truffle burger if I feel adventurous and dating enough. My friend wanted to order dessert because of the pictures she saw on yelp--we didn't see any of the yummy looking chocolate peanut butter cookie sandwiches in the menu. Instead there was only the old fashioned ice cream cookie sandwich ( snicker doodle cookies with vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and encrusted with some sea salt), the Goodwich, which they didn't have and ice cream scoops and some pie. We got the old fashioned ice cream cookie sandwich and it wasn't that good. It was mediocre. I did like the pop of saltiness in the middle of the cookie from the sea salt. I wouldn't get it again.
