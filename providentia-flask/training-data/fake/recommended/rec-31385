The sushi is about the best quality you can have for the price. I'm not saying they have the highest quality fish, but if you take the ratio of price to quality I would say this place beats out 9/10 other sushi restaurants. Their service and delivery are great. The ambiance of the actual restaurant is small sushi place, but their food makes up for it.
