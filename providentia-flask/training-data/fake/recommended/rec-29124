What delicious food!  Well, most of it at least. So on a frigid Friday night, I get the wise idea of making a delivery order thru Allmenus, 30% off coupon in hand so I can finally try some of the Iron Chef's creations. Village Whiskey Burger with caramelized onion is the best burger ever.  Even the veggie burger was a solid 3.5 stars, but after trying both, I boxed up the veggie again and concentrated on thoroughly enjoying the moist meaty goodness.  I will never order a burger anywhere else.  Period.  5 stars! Duck fat fries with cheddar and short ribs was also very tasty.  But after finishing the burger, these did not hold up well with time and given how rich the food is, I had to look away from these.  3.5 stars Pickled cherry tomatoes - flavor bombs!  These were eye-opening and when you have a bite of the burger, then one of these, WOW!!  5 stars So while I'll never battle the crowd to get in, I won't go anywhere else for the perfect burger.
