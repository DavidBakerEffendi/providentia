Had the meal delivered. Pretty quick. I only ordered here because there was 20% off for new customers. This food is alright. The Jaipur Kofta was good. The Sabud Dum Bhindi was kind of tasteless, which is pretty unusual for Indian food, and I did request "spicy". The Naan was the worse I have had in years, basically a lot of raw dough, kind of ruined everything else since it was not really edible. We had two Naan, and even the one that was burned in spots still had raw dough within. Yuck! I would never eat here again, because would have to pay full price for only so-so food. This really seems like a meat restaurant, where the real taste is in the meat dishes and the veg are like an afterthought. I am a vegetarian and have lived in India and been eating Indian food for forty years.
