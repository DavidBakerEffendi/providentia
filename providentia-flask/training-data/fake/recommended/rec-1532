Geno's is for tourists. "But Matt, I AM a tourist!" you may say.  STILL, do not go there. Take a trip to the infamous corner where Geno's and Pat's square off if you must but do not give them your business. Go to Jim's on South Street for better quality or hit Steve's in the Northeast. They have guaranteed business from tourist saps and they know it.  Don't waste your time with them or Pat's.
