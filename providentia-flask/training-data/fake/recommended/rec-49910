Had a great time here celebrating a friends bday!! Food and drinks were delightful.  I had the arugala salad which was soooo good i wish I could have asked for more and just eat this.  I also had the London Burger which was good except i order it well done and it was really "Well Done".  Meat was dry and in a shape of a ball.  It was kind of dificult to eat but i managed given the hunger i had. Drinks were great!!! Anyhow, the waitress was good she was attentive and all our food came out at once for our large party.  I would recommend to try this place out.
