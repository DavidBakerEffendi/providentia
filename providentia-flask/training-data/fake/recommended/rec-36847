I really love this place.  But if you want breakfast/bruch... GET THERE EARLY.  By 9:30 AM they'll be quoting a 45 min wait time.  I don't haul my hiney outta bed that early only to be to told that I need to wait 45 mins to sit my pretty a** down for breakfast.  Get there by 9 and you can waltz right in.
