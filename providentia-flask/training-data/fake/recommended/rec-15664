I was going to see the play "The Whaleship Essex" over at the Hudson Guild theater and wanted to find a restaurant in the area.  I can definitely recommend Porteno.  The service was pleasant and attentive and most of the food was wonderful.  One of us had the soup, one had a salad, one ordered the risotto to start and I had the calamares.  All were excellent. The calamares, which the waiter recommended, were grilled to perfection over salad. My friend let me taste his cod, which I can be fussy about, and it was very good and my other friend had the flank steak which looked wonderful. I took one star off only because the filet mignon that I ordered medium rare came medium well so I couldn't even tell if it was a nice piece of steak because that tastes like shoe leather to me at that point. (If it was even medium it wouldn't have been so bad but it was really overcooked) I cut into it immediately as I always do and said "I'm sorry, but this is overcooked."  He asked to see it and just shrugged. He should have taken it back. My husband gave me half his red snapper, which was a special and very tasty, and took most of my steak since he'll eat steak at any temp.  I mentioned again later that all the food was great except that I was really disappointed in the filet mignon.  At that point he said "Well, let me talk to the chef.  Maybe he can do something."  I told him I wasn't looking for a discount, I just thought it was worth mentioning because I would have given the place 5 stars just for the food had it not been for the filet mignon.  We tipped him well because, overall, I can highly recommend this place.  If I am in the area again I would stop in but I wouldn't go out of my way.  I am assuming it was just a fluke because others here really seemed to enjoy the filet mignon, and the chef was wonderful otherwise, but it's the only place I've ever been where they didn't offer to take it back and give me one cooked the way I asked for it.
