I first learned about champs when I was at a  vegan popup in Williamsburg. CHAMPS IS AWESOME! Very retro diner feel (I love the décor), super friendly staff and delicious food!! The biscuits and gravy OMG! Any place that serves breakfast all day will forever have a special place in my heart. The menu is traditional diner fare, but of course vegan! Yummo! You will always feel welcome here and the staff is very attentive. I have ordered vegan birthday cakes several times and the prices are unbeatable (WAY cheaper than blossom or babycakes nyc). Their cakes and other baked goods are delicious and moist. Everything here comes in very generous portions and you can leave with a FULL belly without breaking the bank - and that's sometimes hard to do when eating vegan in this city! *Cash only and it's often crowded (especially on the weekends for breakfast/brunch) so either sit at the bar or come early. *Not far from the L train - great neighborhood.
