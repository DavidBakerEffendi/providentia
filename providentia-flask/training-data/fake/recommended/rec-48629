I really enjoyed the food at this spot. It was four of us for restaurant week, so they served us family style. The portions were on point, and our waitress was nice. The edamame dumplings were all they said they would be and more. Delicious. I can't forget about the korean bbq, sea bass, and the brussel sprouts (and I hate brussel sprouts). Cute place, nice decor. I'll be back.
