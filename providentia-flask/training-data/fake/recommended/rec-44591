4.5 stars!! Coming back from a recent trip from Manila I was craving some good filipino food. I figured what better place to find some than NYC where supposedly u can get any culinary experience u desire. To my surprise this particular cuisine is few and far between. I searched high and low trying to find a restaurant with a menu of some authenticity. Then I stumbled upon Grill 21! After some convincing I got my girlfriend to join me for some dinner here. We started of with some lumpiang (fried egg roll filled with pork). They were quite small but non the less very tasty. In Hawaii we're used to them being the size of a certain appendage that made Ron Jeremy famous. Well maybe not that small. For dinner my girlfriend ordered the pork adobo. How adventurous! J/K! It was actually really really good. I was trying to decide between the sisig, dinuguan, kare-kare, and pinakbet. I ended up getting the kare-kare because it's hard to find in restaurants, even in the Philippines or Hawaii. I also love that it came with garlic rice (optional plain rice is avail.) and a side of bagoong. A great place to eat and enjoy food family style if ur with friends, although as stated in other reviews the place is a little small. I will definitely be back here and highly recommend it. Dedicated to the boys back home, the F.B.I.'s (full blooded Ilocano) Kick the tires and light the fires! Cnobs-out
