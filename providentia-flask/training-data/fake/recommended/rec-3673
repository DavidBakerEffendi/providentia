I had a damn good burger.  I ordered the truffle burger & my bf ordered the Royale.  Both burgers were excellent.  The truffle fries were delicious but the spicy sauce was too spicy for me & I love spicy.   Unfortunately, I got sick right after I took my first bite.  I still ate all of my food but even when I got back to the office I was still sick.  Soooo, I paid about $60 for a really delicious laxative.   Oh & stick with the water.  $3.50 for an 8oz diet coke or a sode is outrageous.
