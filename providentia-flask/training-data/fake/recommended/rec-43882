I will never eat at this restaurant. On Sunday I went in for brunch with my family, we asked the hostess for a table. The hostess mentioned it is a short wait - just a few minutes. After almost 10 minutes of waiting, a party of four arrives and was seated very  quickly. I went back over to the hostess and mentioned that we were waiting as well for a table.   We were waiting for a table for 4 also. This table that was given to the party 4 should have easily been ours. She apologized but I felt that it was not sincere - she said that she did not mean to be rude she is just waiting for the table in the back to open up so we could have more space, she kept stressing the fact another party would be leaving soon and that would be our table. But we would have been very comfortable in the table for 4 as we requested.   This is not my first time at Alice arbor, I enjoyed the food a couple times before and did not have this issue of being seated, as a different hostess would normally seat us.  I want to mention that the group of four that was seated before us was white. I've been living in the fort-Greene / bed Stuy area for over ten years way before a lot of shops opened up. I've never had an issue if getting a table but I found it rude with a half hearted apology. If possible do not patronize this place, I know I longer will.
