A wonderful restaurant that is both lively and popular, yet not trendy or pretentious. Simple and comfortable. I highly recommend making reservations rather than walking in. We sat in the upstairs back room, but the huge downstairs seating area looked great as well. I would not want to sit in the front seating area next to the bar on a weekend night - way too crowded. We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine that was recommended by our server ($48, which was an up-sell on his part, because they offer a ton of options in the $30s price range). We had the Greek Salad (good but too salty) and the Fingerling Potato appetizer (perfect). For entrees we had the Branzino and Hanger Steak. Both were great. The prices are excellent. No entree was over $17. Can't beat that. Total evening out - bottle of nice wine, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert - w/ tax and tip was under $125 total. Very reasonable. For dessert, we split the walnut cake and walnut ice cream. It was delicious - almost identical to a carrot cake (w/out raisins). Yumm-O. We were worried about being rushed and table-turned, because you have to place your entire order at once, but they paced us nicely. Beginning to end, about 1 hr 45 mins. Perfect. We are really looking forward to returning - for lunch, brunch and dinner - again soon.
