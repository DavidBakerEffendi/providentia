Best cheesesteaks ever!!!!!  Juicy, tender, and extremely flavorful!!!!  Oh so good!!  Totally hit the spot for my Philly cheesesteak craving!!  I now see why they are still standing after Geno's stepped in with their big flashy decor and extravagant lighting. The taste stands out in the end!!! Pat's King of Steaks totally earned their title!  Go to Pat's for the WIN!!!!
