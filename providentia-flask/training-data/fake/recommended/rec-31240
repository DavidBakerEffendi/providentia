I found this place on an app called savored and when we first arrived the atmosphere was very welcoming, trendy, and looked like a great place. The service is really good and attentive, almost too attentive because all the waiters are your waiters and they check in with you every 5-7 min, but are very friendly and polite. The food, however, is very subpar. The fried food literally just tastes fried with no other flavor. One dish was legit fat with sauce on a stick, very unappetizing. The chicken pad thai was okay but overall not worth your time in a neighborhood overflowing with good places
