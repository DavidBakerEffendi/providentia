I've been to this place countless times, sometimes after a night of clubbing/bars sometimes with friends because we were hungry. Regardless, of the occasion, the food is always good! The place is pretty easy to spot, directly across from a Hilton and they're usually people already in line. Lines can be a little longer on the weekends, but ultimately worth the wait. If its your first time here the chicken platter is the way to go, but if you like variety go ahead and grab the combo platter which is chicken and lamb over rice, and you get a salad on the side with some pita bread (so good)! Price used to $5 but now its $6, still worth it! After you get your meal, you must engulf you platter with their secret white sauce which make the meal what it is! And if you like spicy use some of their hot sauce, but fair warning the hot sauce is EXTREMELY HOT! Hands down the best halal food I've ever had in my life!
