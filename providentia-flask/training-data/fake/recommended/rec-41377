Miriam is obviously a popular spot for brunch in the North Slope, but it left me disappointed when I finally tried it this past weekend. I've passed by the restaurant dozens of times on weekend afternoons and it's always busy, but brunching on the late side this weekend around 3 PM, our party of five was seated right away. Everyone in our group ordered a different dish, so I was able to sample a few different items from the brunch menu, including the Israeli Breakfast and the Mediterranean Crispy Dough. The Israeli Breakfast was a snore save for the labneh and the spicy harissa I borrowed from my friend's Burekas, and the tomatoes in the accompanying Israeli salad were pale, mealy, and generally low-quality. The Crispy Dough, on the other hand, was much more interesting, albeit not at all crispy - very chewy, not quite sweet or sour, and really tasty. We had a few service issues with food and change delivery, too, leaving us all feeling less than enthused about the entire brunch ordeal. In the end, I'll definitely crave labneh and harissa with my eggs again, but I'll shop for the ingredients myself rather than returning to Miriam.
