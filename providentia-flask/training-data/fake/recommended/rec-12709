This place is pretty much a landmark in NYC and has been for years. It's even more popular than the Hilton hotel which it is directly across from. Whether it's lining up for late night eats or grabbing grub on the go, the halal guys will not disappoint. Their chicken and rice plate with ultra hot sauce (you have to ask for this- it's in little containers inside the cart- not the BBQ sauce) and the creamy sauce is absolutely divine. Do not leave without trying this place. Order, pull up a seat anywhere on the street and enjoy the best C&R in the world.
