My friend and I both work in the industry, food that is. We have been loyal Morning Glory regulars in the past and loved it. However, in the past year or so we've been noticing a sad decline in their treatment of guests. Multiple times in the recent past, we have been left standing at the door without a greeting or sitting at a table without menus or waiting too long for someone to say "hi, be right with you." Our last visit started much the same, and we noticed the tables were being taken by one server, so we waited patiently to place our order. When our server arrived, he sorta demanded our order and in the middle of my telling him what I'd like to eat, he yelled out to the staff (and right into both our ears) "COMPLICATED ORDER!" We should have left right then, it's too bad their Pancakes are delish... Anyway, we both understand the stress and hustle and the endless talking with guests but the trick to service lies in the necessity of maintaining courtesy towards guests. If your treat your customers like s**t, you'll lose them. Â  That's what happened to us. From here on out, it's Carmen's we'll go to for our fix.
