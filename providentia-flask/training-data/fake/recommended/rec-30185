Went there a few nights ago for dinner--hadn't been in a while--and they just do everything right here.  We were immediately escorted to our table, met with a friendly server who recommended a fantastic bottle of chardonnay. The decor/ambiance is perfect, and although it wasn't packed that night, the room had a good vibe and the bar was fairly crowded. We had heirloom tomato salad to start, then for entrees the lumache (duck sausage pasta) and the glazed halibut.  Both were perfectly prepared and delicious, and just the right amount. Overall it was an excellent experience and I'll definitely be back.
