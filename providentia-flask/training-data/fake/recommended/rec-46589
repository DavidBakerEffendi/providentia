I've been to Alla Spina a number of times and it never disappoints. The food is incredible. Pig pot pie, fried chicken, and the poutine are some of my favorites. Make sure you try the eggplant fritti -- I never knew eggplant could taste so good. Outside of the food, the atmosphere is fitting for the neighborhood with a industrial/rustic vibe. The service is top notch... And tonight I noticed Marc Vetri expediting dinner service. Â I love the bars copper taps and the open kitchen. Plenty of beer options to choose from. For dessert, try the beer milkshakes. I highly recommend!
