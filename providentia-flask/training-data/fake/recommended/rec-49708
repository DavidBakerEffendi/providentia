I order for pick up, i ordered the Jungle curry fried rice with beef, ohhh myyyy... It's sooooooo salty :( :( :( i read the review that this dishes is really good, but unfortunately not for me. When i went there to picked up my order, the place is so packed., Maybe i'm not lucky :( And it's so overprice, $4 for small ice tea? Really?
