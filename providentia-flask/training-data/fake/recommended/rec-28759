I love this place Whenever I'm in the BK WBurg area I make it a point to stop by. The price are great and the food is always top notch. You can even get a Falafle sandwich for only $3! The only thing that I wish they'd change would be the skimmpyness on the white sauce! I mean come man! That bring it all together! I'm also a big fan of the pickles and red cabbge too.
