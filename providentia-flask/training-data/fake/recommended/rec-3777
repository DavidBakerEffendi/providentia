Delicious pizza!  Can't really go wrong!   Wait...you can? Ohhhh, you must be talking about the wait! I once waited an hour for a table.  It was someone's birthday and if it wasn't her birthday I'm not sure I would have waited.  I brought an out-of-towner when I went last week (the responsibilities of being a New Yorker!) and luckily we only had to wait 5 minutes!  It was also a Tuesday at 2:30pm.   But waiting aside, the pizza is delicious.  I thought that the large would be too much for the two of us, but we gobbled it down.  I wish they served salad though.  Nothing fancy or anything but I love some salad with delicious thin-crust pizza.
