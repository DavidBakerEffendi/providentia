We went for oysters during happy hour and liked the menu so much we stayed for dinner.  We were big fans of Blue Ribbon Sushi, so we ordered several items from the sushi menu.  The fish was top notch and excellently prepared.  Don't ignore the specials - the butterfish was amazing and the house cured eel had a perfect brine like the ocean. Highlights: * Great Service * Comfortable atmosphere that's simultaneously family friendly and special event celebratory * Good beverage list - sake or champagne - you choose! * Really fresh oysters with freshly grated horseradish in addition to the usual accessories * No reservation needed if you go early enough (6:30ish)
