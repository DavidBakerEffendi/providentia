Went back a second time last week and had an even better time than the first (perhaps because I knew what I was getting into).  Spent way more time at the bar, and realized exactly how kick-ass their beer selection is.  I ordered 20 of their wings at happy hour, and they were BANGIN', yo! The sound was a bit better this time, not quite as loud, and I could hear the instruments better.  Perhaps it's hit-or-miss in that place, which I guess is par for any venue. Got another way-friendly waitress this time, and the bartenders were courteous and friendly. I'll be back!
