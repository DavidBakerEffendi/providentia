What a great beer selection! I was here last night, enjoyed a few Rogue Dead Guy ales. The honey wings were awesome and the fish and chips were amazing, the fish was very tender and moist. Very good vibe, they had a nice mix of older and newer music, I heard about 5 Beatles songs while I was there, which you can never go wrong with.
