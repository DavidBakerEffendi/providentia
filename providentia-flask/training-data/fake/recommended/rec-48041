If Yelper reviews are to be believed in the first place, PT has taken a serious slide straight into the toilet.  After a very tasty crostini and a decent appetizer of eggplant layered with sheep's-milk ricotta, I was shocked by how underwhelming everything else was. The bolognese was tasteless and the pasta was a mushy mess. The sad sliver of branzino they served was also overcooked and unpleasant to look at. A paltry  portion, especially for the price, was accompanied by an off-putting duo of supermarket quality cherry tomatoes and black olive slices that were clearly straight from a can. The aggressively average wine list resulted in a white that was inappropriately served just below room temp and a piss-poor red recommendation from the server. Their Dolcetto, while affordable, is not worth any price. The service was very rushed, not rude exactly, but not welcoming either.  Overall this was a huge disappointment. We'll never go back.
