Ohhhh yeahhhh! I loveeeee me some late night halal, with extra white sauce. And by extra, I mean, white sauce overflowing out of the tin. Yes, it's THAT good. The white sauce is the holy grail of all sauces and there's no such thing as too much of it. But the red sauce? I eat it in tiny little drops with my precious halal. Any more than that and it will not only ruin the meal, but your GI tract as well. Just don't be fooled by the wannabes nearby, even if they have long lines. The fakers sport the same yellow and red colors. Carefully look for the original to enjoy the best $6 dollar meal in the city!
