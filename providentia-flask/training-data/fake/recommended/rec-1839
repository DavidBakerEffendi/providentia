i was down in philly recently over the weekend last week and well i went down to both geno and pats and i have to write a review for both of them. i am not a philadelphian so i really do not know what a good philly cheese steak taste like, all i know they are better than other states cheese steak who they all try to replicate it. one thing i like about phillies philly chease steak is that there are more meat than veggies which i did not expect that which that was awesome because i had "fake" philly cheese steak where i live in colorado and colorado have less meat and more veggies. but one thing is that i am not going to compare both places because 1. i do not know what is a good philly cheese steak taste like. 2. both pats and geno are good well not good but awesome! 3. for sure when i go back down there i will buy some more from both restaurant and bring them home as well. haha. overall if i have to pick 1 then just go to both of them because they are just across the street. if there is a line i will just wait even if it will be all day just to get both geno and pats because philly cheese steak are worth waiting for.
