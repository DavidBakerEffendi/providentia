I went to Bistango with really high expectations and was actually underwhelmed, both by food and wine.  I have had a lot of italian food, outside and inside of Italy and am somewhat confident I know what it should taste like.  My hypothesis is that this place is well rated because the service is extremely gracious and because the gluten free peeps need to eat too.  These are really admirable traits but I am basing my review on the food and drink only. Food first of course.  We were in a group so tried about half the appetizers and a couple pastas and mains.  The mini pizza was good.  After that, things were just mediocre.  And bland.  Now if my food were bland, I would just pull the standard trick in the book (cf. Eataly) and load up on sodium.  However, the dishes here were not only bland on flavor, but also on sodium.  If I wanted low sodium I wouldn't have gone to a restaurant, obviously. Some people have been raving about the great wine list.  It is fine, and on that basis alone, I would score it 4*.  However, we ordered several bottles that came out at room temperature.  I actually joked to the waiter about it not being cold enough and he suggested that the only way to have it arrive cool would be if they set the temperature in the entire restaurant to 55 degrees.  I definitely want him on my team.   Also, side note, they had a red wine on the white wine list which my friend accidentally ordered.  We asked the waiter when it came out red what's up and he just shrugged.  Colors.  Who needs em?
