I really wanted this restaurant to work not only because of its location but now because of the demise of Delaney's. But unfortunately there are still major problems that have not been sorted out.  When requesting a Bloody Mary, I was told that they were all out of Bloody Mary mix; when ordering the trout dish, we were told they there was no more trout. All this was at 5:30 p.m.   If they want to serve dinners they need to have the products on the menu. Also, when ordering a salad that had avocado in it, the avocado was unripe, hard and tasteless.
