You seriously cannot beat the red white and blue special. Glass of wine or beer, half a dozen oysters, $8. FYI, if you don't want PBR or the house wine, you can get something else for an extra $2. That deal alone would be enough to give it 4 stars from me, but the oysters come with four different sauces and a lemon wedge, which is nice. The 4th sauce is an interesting ginger sauce which I have never seen anywhere else - try it, it's delicious. In addition, the bartender was great, super friendly, our oysters came out very quickly, and the decor of this place is cute and cool. Seems like you've wandered in to a little neighborhood place on the shore - you would never know you were in the middle of the West Village.
