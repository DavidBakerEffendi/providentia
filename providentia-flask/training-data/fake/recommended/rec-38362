The food wasn't bad, The beer excellent, atmosphere crowded and stuffy, the service not so good, we sat at the bar and ate dinner cause there was an hour and a half wait for two, good beer selection and excellent taste sampler, the fish good and the chips cold french fries, buffalo chicken Rollie Pollie was good, wasn't pricey. Just crappy service. GET THE BEER SAMPLER
