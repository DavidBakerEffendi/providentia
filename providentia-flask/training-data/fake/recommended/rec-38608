omg!! I absolutely love... LOVE the chicken cheesesteak!! A friend of mine put me on about the deliciousness @ Govinda's.  (Thank's Margie!!) I also recommend the Sabji wrap..... it is quite nummy!!  The simple medley of veggies with indian spices and rice is a nice compliment to the chicken cheesesteak.  I usually get both, and split both with my b/f.  I got him hooked too!!   Yay for Govinda's!!
