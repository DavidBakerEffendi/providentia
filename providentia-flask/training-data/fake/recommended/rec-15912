Came to meet a friend after work and arrived a bit early.  The bartender was friendly and helpful telling me the happy hour specials as I was lucky to get a seat at the bar.  I ordered a white wine from happy hour list, which was an okay Pinot Grigio.  She did charge me $6 instead of $5, but whatever.  The Sav Blanc I had after was much better. My friend arrived and after a bit we decided to order some food. He had a burger that he said was pretty good.  I had the grilled cheese which comes with Brie.  A good choice, but did get it without the avocado and I realised after could have done with out the "chutney" - which didn't have the consistency of a proper chutney but more like diced veg.  A sweet proper chutney would have complimented it better IMO. The main bone I have to pick is that I asked for mayo for my chips.  They gave me some sort of spicy mayo, and the bartender (not the nice one, some guy who seemed he couldn't be bothered) said that they didn't have plain mayo.  I found that a bit hard to believe.  If it is actually the case, they should get some as not everyone can eat spicy things.   Overall the bar area in the back was not too loud or crowded so we were able to have a catch up without screaming.  The place did thin out a bit after happy hour.
