Vegetarian cuisine at its best.  The sandwich orders are great because you get TWO of them. Love the Chik'n, delicious.   If you're vegetarian or want to eat healthier for take out or just grabbing a quick bite, stop here!   Good prices for good food. And it's actually flatbush ave. bet. clarkson ave. and lenox rd. , clarkson becomes woodruff ave. west of flatbush ave.
