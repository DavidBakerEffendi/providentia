Came to this restaurant because we know the owners from a prior restaurant, and I'm glad we did! We went for brunch on a Saturday and the place was pretty quiet, but had some great music playing and it was the perfect atmosphere for a lazy Saturday in Brooklyn. Our bartender was awesome! We started chit chatting about music and playing various artists for the patrons because of the conversations. No one seemed to mind at all! We did the brunch special where you get a drink with it. I had the morning burger (with a veggie burger patty) with a salad while my husband had a customized omelet. Both meals were amazing! The atmosphere is very laid back and the staff was super friendly. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!
