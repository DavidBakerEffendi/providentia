$25 for ANY bottle of wine, need I say more? Fine, I'll say more. The bread/olive/white bean dip was delicious, the recommended wine was fantastic (and did I mention only $25?), and our waiter was so 'authentically' Italian that we couldn't understand a single word he said, but it sure was fun trying. The service was a highlight - prompt, charming, and super-friendly. We ended up being the last 2 in the restaurant as they began to close, and instead of curtly kicking us out (which would have been completely understandable), the manager came by, made some conversation, earned some laughs, and then invited us to continue at the bar. I liked that. Great experience overall.
