Went there after going to a gallery exhibit of Jene Highstein.  We had a large group.  The bread was good, Olive Oil was fantastic.  My cousin and I both ordered the pizza.   I had the one with the salami, he had the one with arugula, prosciutto and parmesan cheese.  We then traded slices.  I highly enjoyed both pizzas. The small is big enough for any individual. I ate off a friend's tiramisu.  That was excellent as well.  Goes with the coffee.  Overall ambiance of the place was very nice.
