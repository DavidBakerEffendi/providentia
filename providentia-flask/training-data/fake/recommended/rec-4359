This place is excellent!  At work, we often order our lunch from near-by restaurants and have it delivered.  Being in the heart of busy Rittenhouse, the food is usually overpriced and takes forever to arrive.  A coworker stumbled upon The Quick Fixx lunch specials menu one day online.  I have ordered from here 3 times (always the same exact meal) and every time have been extremely satisfied by the food, the quick deliver, the kindness of the employees and the unbeatable price tag.  Today we ordered and the gentleman delivering returned all the way back to us with the plasticware he had forgotten to throw in the bag.  I always get the Arugula Salad and the Sunchoke flatbread.  I think together with a soda it totals $10.  It usually take me two sitting to eat the whole meal- but the point is it is delicious and fresh and comes highly recommended by me.  I should branch out and try more here.  I think I will and soon!
