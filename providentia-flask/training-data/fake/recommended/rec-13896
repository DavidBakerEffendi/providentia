Right after finishing a 7am bikram yoga class, I decided to treat myself to their famous pumpkin pancakes around 1030am on a weekday -- which was a much different environment than coming on a Saturday night (which I've done in the past).  I was greeted with a friendly smile and told to pick a seat anywhere in the restaurant.  It was pleasantly quiet and the free wifi allowed me to finish up some work prior to my class. Now to the pumpkin pancakes -- believe the hype. These were absolutely delicious!! 3 pancakes topped with cinnamon yogurt and syrup on the side only $6.75.  They were crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside (actually, I would say mine were a little bit on the undercooked side--but that's actually how I like them).   On another occasion, I had the warm mozzarella sandwich (served with portobello mushrooms, spinach, and sundried tomatoes)-- which was good as well.  The portion was HUGE and it also came with a side of french fries-- all for only $9.50. I want to try more of their brunch options--but wouldn't dare to come here on a weekend.  For those who enjoy a more quiet atmosphere and not feeling rushed to get out, definitely recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch on a weekday instead-- thoroughly enjoyed my pancakes and the service was wonderful.  Will be coming back soon!
