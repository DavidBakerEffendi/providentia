I really had high hopes for this place given that Yelp had good reviews and the menu looks delectable but the experience was horrible. Came here with two friends and we got the mussels to share. They must've used some poor grade mussels because most of the ones I punctured with my fork came out black. I didn't realize this until I had eaten a good plateful and I was disgusted. I knew it tasted off and I wish I had looked carefully before popping these in my mouth. I had the lobster risotto and there was barely any lobster in there. All I tasted was the essence and the fat. My friend's steak was alright. I had a bite and it was a bit too dry for my liking even though she asked for medium rare. The other friend had the special fish of the day which was better than all the food we had on the table. Both my friends wound up staying up late in the toilet. Quite possibly from the bad mussels. I apparently have an iron clad stomach. It rumbled like the train but i wasn't sitting on the crap pot like my friends were. I felt so bad for my friends since I brought them here. It was such an awful night for them...
