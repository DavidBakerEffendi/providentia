Just spent the week in Princeton for a conference...ate lunch at Nassau Seafood EVERY DAY!! Had each of the following; Shrimp Po Boy, Oyster Po Boy, Firecracker Shrimp w/chips, Fish Tacos, Ceviche Taco, Shrimp Taco and Oyster Po Boy again...all of it fantastic! DO NOT be discouraged by the modest appearance, but DO get the cornbread for a side Wish they had a 30 star rating, this place would get it from me.
