What an unmitigated disaster. Went here for lunch the other day and we were not impressed, to say the least. Between two sandwiches, an iced coffee, and a hot chocolate ordered, only one item was delivered as expected, and that was the pre-made sandwich. The iced coffee was hot and then the wrong size, they forgot to put chocolate in the hot chocolate, and the BYO sandwich was missing half of the requested ingredients. The dude behind the counter was all kinds of overwhelmed despite it not being busy. The girl who joined him eventually righted most of the wrongs, but even then it took some doing. That aside, the menu is pretty good and the atmosphere is decent, apart from all the passive-aggressive little bitchy notes taped all over everything. Oh, and the pre-made sandwich was pretty lousy.
