This place's miso (vegetarian) ramen was life changing for me.  I remember the first time watching the movie Tampopo, wondering where the heck I could get noodles like that which made a bouncing sound, had a naturally curly shape sat in broth with the intesnse flavor reflected on the screen.  Minca is where I found this.  The broth was so intense and did not taste like a regular miso soup at all.  It filled my tummy with goodness and my dining buddy who had the pork noodles said mine was even better than hers.  I knew I wasn't missing out! :)  Minca will definitely be one of my must-stops in NY.
