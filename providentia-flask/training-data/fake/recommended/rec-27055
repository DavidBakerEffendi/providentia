I have lunch every Monday here and last time I had to wait for about 30 min because it was packed! but is ok for me, people wait whatever time to have a seat because is a great place.. Honestly I've tried all the lunch special menu  and I don't recommend any fish, tilapia has a strong dirt taste, fish is not good..everything else is fine... What I like most of this restaurant is the ambiance, italian music, people speaking italian ,  laughing, drinking wine, enjoying, many groups of people. The atmosphere here specially if you are italian (I'm not) and miss your land , will make you feel like at home.. the decor also is a plus and the owner is super nice and friendly. You can't miss the bakery next door Aroma Di Napoli, same owner..you order to your table and there;s too many choices, fresh pastries, the best in the area. Caramel cheesecake is my favorite, cannolis, pignoli cookies, are just delicious! I just came back to add something else, now in October with pumpkins all over, please taste the pumpkin soup, I just did it today and was Out of this world!!
