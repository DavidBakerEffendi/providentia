I like the place. I had nachos with steak, cheese, tomatoes (asked for lettuce. Don't know if they don't have that there or they just forgot) and sour cream. It has a delightful and authentic taste to it. She double bagged it for me so it wouldn't fall out or get messed up in the car since I asked for it to go(no napkins though) - though ended up staying to check the environment out for this review. They have high and low tables which is accommodating for most people. Clean. Fresh. Neat. I liked it. I'd go back again and plan to. I'm just a harsh critic. So like 3.5-4 stars.
