Missing the food right about now. Delicious, mouthwatering lamb and chicken over rice for only $6... can be made as spicy as you want. I'm salivating just thinking about the addicting red sauce (what is in that stuff??). The lines aren't as long in winter, and nothing like hot spicy food to warm you up.
