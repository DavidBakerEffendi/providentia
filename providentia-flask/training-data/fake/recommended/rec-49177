Oh man, this place is delicious. For you ramen lovers, you'll love all the different ways to personalize your order. First of all, the place opens at 11:30 (we got there at 11:40) and was already packed. It is more of a fancy, high energy ramen restaurant than what I am use to. Like most places in new york, the interior is done well and the service was great. I got the akamaru modern with egg, spicy and mustard leaves. I love the big spoons they give you, helps you shovel all the delicious broth in your mouth! At the end, we finished off with dessert tea. The price is pretty reasonable, $14 for a bowl. In my case, it ended up being $20 because I had to get so many extras :)
