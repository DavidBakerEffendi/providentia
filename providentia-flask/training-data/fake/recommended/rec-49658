I will settle on 3 stars here.. 5 stars for the bakery and the bread and 1 star for the deli.. The bread is some of the best i have ever eaten, especially when its fresh and still warm and crunchy, unbelievable.. and every pastry they make is amazing, my favorite is the napolean but they are all great.. amazing bakery all around and such friendly people behind the counter.. Until you get to the deli.. Great bread means a great sandwich right? Wrong.. the guy behind the deli counter should learn how to smile once in awhile and be a little friendly.. I dont want to go to a deli and feel like the guy thats making me a sandwich is doing me a big favor.. i only get sandwiches from Espositos nowadays simply because deli guy here doesnt understand customer service.. and the sandwiches are pretty light on the meat and cheese for the fairly expensive price
