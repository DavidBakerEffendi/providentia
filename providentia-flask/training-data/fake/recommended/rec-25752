This is a fabulous Italian restaurant! The meatballs are essentially mini-meatloafs. We got one as an appetizer and it rocked. I got the eggplant parmesan which was different than what I expected but much better and lighter. My wife had the linguini with white clam sauce which was good but could have been a bit more flavorful. The wine was a Luce Lucente and was terrific despite tasting it in one of those tiny "Italian Restaurant" wine glasses that I have come to abhor. My only suggestion would be upgrading the wine glasses. One of the best meals I've had in NYC and one of the least expensive!
