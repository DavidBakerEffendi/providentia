This is Mexican that seems like it will be good, and then it's not. The chips and salsas are awesome...but the meal is lacking. I've gotten the Tacos Rancheros TWICE, and both times, the beef is so fatty that I felt sick. I thought my first bad experience was a fluke, and it wasn't. I've noticed that they must use very low-quality meat, or have low quality controls on their dishes because I've also had this problem on pork dishes. I would avoid it, unless you're just into chips/salsas...then it's great. There is far better mexican around.
