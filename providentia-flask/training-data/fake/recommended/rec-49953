This is a place I try to hit every time I'm in NY, which for me is about 6/7 times a year.  The menu is always changing but their theme of upscale southern comfort food I a real hit with me because its not the typical deep fried everything you get with southern food.   I recomend: - the mushroom flat bread (always has great earthy mushroom flavor and just enough cheese) - The duck con fit was excellent last time I was there however this is a seasonal dish so I would check the most up to date menu online. - The buttermilk fried chick is always good and just about the only thing that is always on the menu, they're really known for this one so you really cant go wrong here. - The pork loin with black trumpet mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  Another seasonal item that I hope they bring back, I almost never eat pork but I have a really hard time passing this dish up. By the way I really like this place because its a great place that I like to go that I can bring clients too.  You can have a conversation here which is hard in a lot of other similar places. Big ups to their bar tender too, he really knows how to mix a drink (have the vesper). Definitely worth going out of your way to try.
