I hosted a large backyard BBQ for my closest friends and their families during graduation weekend, and Sandra helped me make it special and go off without a hitch! Her delicious, fresh, and classic food made my party the talk of the town, and her delightful attitude and helpfulness took so much stress off me as I planned the event. Â She worked with me directly to plan my menu for the right amount of people, was flexible up until the last minute, showed up on time, and even helped me set the table to look lovely for my guests. So glad the TV food world is catching on, because Sandra is the real deal! Tasty, kind, and soulful!! VERY highly recommended for catering and eating!
