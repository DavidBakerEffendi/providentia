WATCH YOUR DRINKS! I came here with my wife after a 1920's Jazz festival last summer. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered our drinks first. This place is very tight for the price. I ordered a jug of Sangria and I kid you not the freaking waiter served a cup of Sangria and put the jug on my table then (I thought the cup was for me) proceeded with my cup of Sangria to another table. RRoarr!!! I had to bite my tounge the whole time because I didn't want to ruin my wife's day..... After dinner I ordered another Sangria and that one was full, he didn't steal any. This was the worst act of Laziness and incompetence that I've ever seen in a restaurant. I couldn't taste anything after that incident... WATCH YOUR DRINKS! Overpriced!! 2 jugs of Sangria..didn't finish the 2nd one just bought it to make a point. 2 chicken combos 2 Ice creams for desert total $120.00 to feel like $h!t. I'm going to the pio pio uptown next time, better service there and in Queens.
