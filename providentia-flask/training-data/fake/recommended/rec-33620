Me and my girlfriend dined at the tavern on two occasions during our stay in NY in August. We were expecting a good experience based on the good reviews we read on Yelp but we were nonetheless surprised by the quality of the food. We tried the polenta, the braised pork belly and the summer beans with pistachios as first courses and the pork loin, the half chicken and the hanger steak as main courses ad we really loved the meals. The IPAs were also really good and the service was friendly and caring. The place is nice and quiet even with a full house. It was nice being the only tourists among the other patrons.
