I've been eating at this restaurant since it opened over twenty years ago. It was recently sold and the new owner has no idea what it means to provide good service. I've been there twice under new ownership. One experience was at best mediocre. The last time we were there it was as bad as any dining experience I've ever had. Â We had horrible service and cold food served with an attitude. I wrote a letter to the owner and got no response. With his lack of attention to detail I not only can't recommend Pauline's but would encourage you not to waste your money.
