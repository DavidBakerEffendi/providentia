I was really excited to see this place open on South Street. Aside from Ms. Tootsies, the block between 13th and Broad is completely dead. Finally some life. The atmosphere is great. Staff is very friendly. I'm not a coffee drinker, but the tea selection is fantastic. Plenty of seating, clean, cool/hip new interior. I only wish they were open a bit later at night. I am eager to try their food as they have a huge selection of wraps, sandwiches and pastries that sound great. The one complaint is that around the after school hours there are tons of skateboarding punks on the sidewalk and grinding rails right outside the window. I had to stop studying and go elsewhere because the skateboarders were so loud. I know this was not inside the cafe, but I hope the owner can find a way to keep the neighborhood punks off her property.
