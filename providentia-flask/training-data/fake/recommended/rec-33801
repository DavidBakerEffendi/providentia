This place deserves more than five stars. It has the best hand drawn noddles anywhere. The place is always packed and the food is just out of this world. My husband just recently brought it home since he had federal jury duty in Philadelphia. Thats all I wanted out of anything I could have had. I wanted the hand drawn noddles from this place because it is pure comfort food. My husband ordered the curry dumplings, the sliced beef soup with hand drawn noddles and I got the chicken stir fry shaved noddles. I really could go for more of this food. If you are looking for a place that is excellent and is quick on service go to this place. Check it out. They are cash only mind you so make sure you have cash. The portions are huge and the soup is better than any soup i've ever had from a chinese place. So if your looking for a place this is the spot to eat!
