Food is fancy schmancy mexican by gringos. Chip are tasty but you get about 10, maybe we would have gotten refills if the staff wasn't terribly rude, unattentive, and act like they wish we never walked in. Never asked if we needed anything else, droppde off water and ran. Dropped off entrees and ran. Dropped off bill and ran. When I walked in I could have taken the entire restaurant before anyone came out from the back. Ugggg terrible service will ruin any dish.
