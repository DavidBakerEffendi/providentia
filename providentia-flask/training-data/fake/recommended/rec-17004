Staff here is really nice. I have basically had every sandwich by this point, outside the tuna, vegetarian options and a few others (Capri, Sorrento, Amalfi, Diamente, Napoli, P5.) I generally prefer the Ciabatta or Baguette. They also have an EXCELLENT bresaola salad (but there isn't a whole lot of meat, but that makes sense seeing how bresaola is so pricy) P1. Parma P2. Paestum prosciutto di parma dop 14 months, buffalo mozzarella, e.v. olive oil       P3. Alba prosciutto di parma dop 14 months, fontina dop cheese, truffle oil       P4. Portofino ham, fontina dop cheese, fig moustard, extra virgin olive oil       P8. Cortina speck igp, taleggio dop cheese       P9. Valtellina bresaola, shaved parmigiano, arugula, extra virgin olive oil       In short, I have had all of these before and all have been especially delicious. Staff is really nice here. My personal favorites so far are the Valtellina, the Paestrum, and the Parma (with the Alba also being excellent.) You can also, if you are looking for more bread (for some reason) or just a quicker less expensive bite, just order 1 (or 2) of the mini Ciabattas (which have a single meat by comparison but are five bucks each.) Will be back here tonight (again) before going to the Marshall. 4.85
