While not the Tom's Diner of the Suzanne Vega song (that one's on the Upper West Side and can be seen in Seinfeld, she told the Times), this Tom's is a wonderful little diner where wonderfully friendly people cook and serve wonderful diner food. Had we found it earlier, we would have eaten here every morning of our trip. Â In fact, we might stay in the neighborhood the next time we're in NYC just so we can eat here again!
