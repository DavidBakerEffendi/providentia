WAY too expensive for the amount of Â food. I'm not some glutinous American either but it was just shameful for that area. On the other hand, it was very delicious! The interior was really cool, great wines, and amazing cheese appetizer. I got the oxtail entree which was great. My husband got the pork shoulder aka 5 bite sized pieces of fat which was pretty disappointing. It may be difficult to get him to go back for a second try but I thought the quality and pairings of food was interesting. Sadly not the prices:( OH and the menu is the horribly designed, please straiten out the content so people can actually understand what goes with what... apparently the two tables who sat next to us also agree with me on this.
