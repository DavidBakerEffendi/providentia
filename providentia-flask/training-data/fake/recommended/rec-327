Really like this place! They have house-made sangrias, live flamenco entertainment thur/sat 8:30pm and 10:30pm. The tapas recipes are very interesting, they're specifically Galician. Very cool! We did not make reservations, and I strongly recommend that you do, but they were so nice and tried their best to seat us.
