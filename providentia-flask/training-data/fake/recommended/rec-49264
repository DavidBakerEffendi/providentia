I got hungry on my way up to Massachusetts and quickly yelped to see what was in the area. Who knew Hamden, CT would be so on point??!? I'm completely blown away by this place. They don't do the buffet anymore but the food they offer was BANGING! I had blackened catfish (beautifully pan fried, not too salty) with greens (perfectly spiced and tender!) And Mac n Cheese (just like my Mom used to make, for real). A real unexpected and pleasurable meal for not too expensive. I highly recommend it.
