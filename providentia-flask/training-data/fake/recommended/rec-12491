Absolutely loved the Chiang mai fries! I had the pad see ewe which was good but not the best I've ever had. Service is not so great. Had to wait a really long time until the waiter came to take our order. He didn't really pay attention to us because of the big group of people that were there before us. Still no excuse for lack of service to the rest of the customers. But overall I would definitely come back just for those fries!
