I found the secret to this buffet. The time when it teems with Chinese customers and all the white folks look like they got lost and ended up in the restaurant by accident. Weekend brunch/lunch. Where you fill up on your dim sum/yum cha items for cheap. With fresh shrimp dumplings (har gow), leek and shrimp dumplings, sticky rice, congee (jook), turnip cakes (lo bok gow), and xiao long bao, you can get your fill easily. I mean, a plate of 4 little shrimp dumplings at most restaurants runs for $3-4 alone! Toss in some pretty tasty hot items (bamboo, fish, tofu, and the likes), and cleanse with fruit and dessert, and you have a well-rounded meal for $9.99 a head, baby! Yeah, you know that's my Asian upbringing speaking.
