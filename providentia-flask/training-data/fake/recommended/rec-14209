Authentic! My Father is as Greek as they come. This place mirrors his ingredients and yummy flavor combinations. When I eat the Greek Salad (Cucumber, Feta, Onion, Tomato, Olive Oil, Oregeno, Etc) I am transported to my backyard as a kid - eating summer dinner with the family. It is very tiny & Cash Only. I find it easy to go here right after work to get a table w/ friends. You will not be dissapointed. I would go as far to say best Greek food in Manhattan.
