AVOID AVOID AVOID Extremely overpriced.  My bloody mary, which was pretty dreadful (it should be called a Salty Mary) was $12.75 (buyer beware - cocktail prices not on the menu).  Crab cake sandwich was $12.75.  It was OK, a little cold in the center (but cooked).  The waitress asked me if I wanted fries with it, and again, I had assumed that at $12.75 it would include them...wrong!  They charged me $5.99 for a plate of so-so fries!  Are they kidding me?   I asked them to remove the fries and they did.  But I think their menu and tactics are extremely deceptive.  Go elsewhere at EWR or ask them what each item costs and includes.  This place may look nice but it just plain sucks.
