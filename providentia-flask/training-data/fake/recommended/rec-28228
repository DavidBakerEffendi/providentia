This place gets 4 for putting out one of the most ridiculous burgers I've ever had. Get this... Wagyu beef burger with Foie Gras and duck fat fries. I saw this on the menu and didn't even have to look at anything else. Who does this?!!?!?! Burger Baby. This all may seem very gimmicky, but it tasted amazing. It's almost like a heart attack in a bun, but you don't feel sick, slow, fat (well maybe fat), and lethargic after eating it. It was solid. A great bun, good beef (although I think any Great quality ground beef would have tasted just as good), foie gras (DUH!), duck fat, and beer. This is a combination for greatness. Would I have it every week? no, but once a year? Absolutely! I was honestly surprised to find something like this in Hartford.
