went with my sister at 8pm on a friday night - we were told it would be a 25 min wait so we ordered some drinks.  they had a pretty extensive wine list if you didn't mind a more expensive bottle, but not as much selection if you just wanted a glass.  and they only had 4 beers.  that being said, the glass of wine I ordered was very good.   we were seated only about 10 mins after we got there, which was awesome.  our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu and it was a nice atmosphere - the service was very good overall.   we ordered 4 small plates (lamb kebob, garlic shrimp, squid in ink with rice, and these things that were little bites of artichoke and manchego wrapped in ham) and 1 "entree" plate (scallops with peas).  Everything was pretty good.   the shrimp and squid ink rice were delicious - I would definitely order them again, the other two small plates were good but i would probably try something new on the menu if I went back, and the scallops were also good, but nothing special - they tasted exactly like the scallops i make for myself on any old week night.  And the scallops were definitely not entree sized - it was basically a large tapa.   our tab (for a beer, glass of wine, 4 small plates and one entree plate) was $100 including tip.  I thought the food was good, but not worth the price.  It was a good experience, and definitely great to try once, but i probably wouldn't go here again since it's in NYC and there's always something new to try.
