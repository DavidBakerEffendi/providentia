Let's see here... *$10 "sausage & a beer" before 7pm (INCREDIBLE DEAL!) *Sausages *$2 sides (sauerkraut, cuke salad, potato salad et al) *Soft, supple, stellar pretzels with real cheese dips (ain't no nacho cheese) *BEER. So much of it. *Revenge of the Nerds in HD. I mean I can't speak for my now-34-year-old-beau, but probably a pretty decent birthday celebration, if I don't say so myself. I couldn't have planned on Revenge of Â the Nerds blasting him back to his past, but I certainly could plan on him liking sausages (bratwurst birthday!), cold beers, a casual environment in the 'hood and sauerkraut. I have learned a thing or two in the few years we've been hanging out together. And I still like him! Der Kommissar is small. Mostly just bar seats (about 10) and about 3-4 tables in the back. No outdoor space. This is not a place to have a 50 person birthday party, but maybe 5 could comingle comfortably and enjoy the laid back, meat-filled vibe. Share plates of sausages (the sampler platter looked delicious), cold beers, etc. The service is friendly and excited about the place and the selection though small, is carefully curated. Ain't no duds. Just suds. And my Austrian sausage with cheese. I mean really, what's not to love!? It's newish (opened in the spring), but they've got this thing down. After reading about the owners via the web site, they are Park Slope vets. This place is cool and ups the ante on 5th Avenue for sure. I'll be a regular. Also, great for take-out. They even have a walk-up window to the kitchen, brilliant for picking up dinner if you've got Fido or strollers in tow. I'm pretty sure my dog would die for a bratwurst, so maybe we'll make that happen for her birthday, too. Der Kommissar = win. *accepts credit cards. *clean bathrooms.
