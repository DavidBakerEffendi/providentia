Adriatik's has been a favorite of mine for many years now.  The Tuscany bread is excellent, but be prepared for lots of fresh garlic in it.  The gorgonzola chicken pizza is excellent, and the buffalo chicken pizza is one of the best around.  I normally prefer thin pizza, but their specialties are worth the deviation. The owners are very hard-working and did a large midnight delivery for me once. The portabello appetizer is unique and delicious.   I have also done their catering orders for parties at home. The salad that comes with dinners is a little boring in my opinion, but very similar to what you'd get at most Italian restaurants. Don't be afraid to ask them to customize anything to your liking.
