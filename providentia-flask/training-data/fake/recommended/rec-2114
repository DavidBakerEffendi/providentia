This is one of my favorite restaurants, in any city.  The food is just fabulous, and I do not use that word often.  For a very reasonable price, you can get exciting, colorful, flavorful, and really well-executed cuisine. Although they can definitely pack you in tight at times, the decor is quaint and homey.  The wine selection is entirely Greek, which adds to my vivid sensation/daydream of dining in the Greek isles.  The grilled octopus is charred perfectly, the sheep milk dumplings float like clouds, and the striped bass with the long-stem capers bursts with vibrancy.  Although not usually a dessert person, I decided to celebrate a special occasion with Kefi's yogurt my last time there.  Oh My God.  The cold - stand-up a fork in it - thick greek yogurt came out in a bowl, nestled in cinnamon spiked honey, topped with toasted almond and honey soaked dried cherries.  Just surrender.   I should give this place a bad review, so that no one else goes and I can daydream in peace, but it's just too fabulous not to share.   P.S. The sweetbread is not actually bread that is sweet.  Despite some initial confusion and some momentary shock, my adorable bf still really enjoyed his first thymus.
