We visited Bistango based on the gluten free options as a person in our group has Celliac. Atmosphere felt upscale but casual and cozy. Service was friendly and very attentive regarding gluten and soy. The menu had lots of great options, I had fish, the others ordered the gluten free pizza and a salad.  Everyone LOVED their meals! We washed the food down with gluten free BEER!  YUM The gluten free desserts are AMAZING too!   I tried the carrot cake, red velvet cake and the chocolate cake.  (Yes I left stuffed!) Most importantly, my friend felt safe at Bistango. There is NO cross contamination and they take their gluten free options seriously. I will return and I do not have a gluten allergy.
