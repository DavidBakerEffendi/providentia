I was in NYC by myself and really wanted to check out someplace with great wine and cocktails where I could also possibly chat with randoms (or at least the bartender) to keep me company. I settled on Employees Only after reading a LOT of Yelp reviews and also on recommendation from a friend in the industry. I arrived on a Saturday night at 7pm and the place was packed save for one seat at the bar, which I snagged. There were some empty tables at the back, but those were actually all reserved. Note: The storefront for this place is not what you think; go to the specific address and if you see a red "Psychic" neon sign in the window you're in the right place. Go through the door, down the short hall and through the velvet curtains and you're there. The bartenders were efficient and obviously skilled, but they were not chatty at this point in the night. I was also surrounded by a couple on a date on one wide, and a group of 3 friend on the other, so my hope to chat with anybody didn't really happen. The lack of WiFi and the fact that I was roaming internationally meant I couldn't keep myself entertained with twitter either. Luckily, a friend of a friend of a friend came by and saved me from myself :) Loved the Provencal cocktail and the oysters were really good. Cocktails range between $15-20, but a glass of wine is more like $10-15 if you're wanting to save a bit of cash. If I lived in NYC, this would definitely be a go-to place for a night out with a couple of friends or a date!
