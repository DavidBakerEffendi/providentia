We came here on a Sunday night which was great because it wasn't packed and loud like busier nights. The food here is consistently delicious! The portions are also very generous, so I always end up with enough leftovers for 2 more meals! On my last visit, Giorgio stopped by and greeted our table which was great. He even offered us a FREE piece of flourless chocolate cake after we had already paid our bill when he found out one person in our group is allergic to gluten. What a pleasant surprise!
