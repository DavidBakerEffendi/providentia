Yum. I tried their brined herb roasted chicken platter and it was delicious. My expectations were somewhat low given Â that it was just a takeout but you're getting a gourmet, delicious meal for a great value. The chicken was moist, the gravy (that was extra $2) was very flavorful and the green sauce had the right amount of kick. All that plus a side and biscuit for only $12.50! I will definitely be returning to try their other dishes.
