Decent mexican food.  I got the Enchilada Huertenas to try out their red and green sauces and mole in one dish and get a good idea of the food.   The enchiladas were very well done in traditional style - overall pretty good.  I've had better sauces but I would say their's were middle of the road. I like the atmosphere of a small little sit down mexican restaurant. It would be great if they had margaritas instead of just beer and wine. The chips, salsa and guacamole where all m'eh. If I'm in the area looking for decent mexican I would probably go back.
