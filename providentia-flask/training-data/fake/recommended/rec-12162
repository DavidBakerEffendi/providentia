To call this "Thai Food" is an insult to the people of Thailand. We ordered the Chicken Satay and Chicken Pad Thai. Two staples of Thai food. Both dishes that Every thai place should have mastered. My first issue came when I found not one, but TWO pieces of hair in my Pad Thai. Two different pieces of hair. Different lengths, and different colors. Unacceptable, but I was hungry, so I pulled them out and let it slide. My main issue was that this food was just disgusting. I have never tasted food so absolutely bland and flavorless before. The chicken was dry, the noodles were one large clump, and the vegetables were soggy. Everything, both the satay and the pad thai, was just gross. There was very little flavor in anything. I will be the first to admit that Philadelphia is not the place to go for good Thai food, but this was just so unbelievably gross that we ate a few bites each and threw the rest in the trash. I can absolutely assure you I will never be back.
