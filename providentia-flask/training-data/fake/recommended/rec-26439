If there is one word that describes Taim, it's fresh. Everything I've tried here was the definition of it. The pita was deliciously light and fluffy, the vegetables (yes, I got all of them) were perfect, and the falafel itself really tasty. Honestly, this is the best falafel I've had that wasn't in Israel. I also liked the sabich, although if fried eggplant isn't your thing, then you probably won't enjoy it as much. The one other thing I tried was the greek salad, which was really good, with generous amounts of olives and feta, but for $10, it is way overpriced. The place is pretty small with the line during lunch sometimes out the door and the wait for the food could be about 10-15 minutes.
