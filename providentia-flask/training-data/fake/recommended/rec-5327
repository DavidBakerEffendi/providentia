I tend to agree with the knowledgeable Michelle C on most of her thoughts. I went in around 1:15 on a weekday thinking I would have missed a good amount of the lunch crowd. Perhaps I did, but I was still flustered and confused walking in as to where to order. My machine also kept forgetting my orders when I clicked back which was frustrating. The options were plentiful and unique and very specific (light dressing, on the side, etc). I got mixed greens with whole wheat noodles with baked tofu, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro ranch dressing. The wheat noodles definitely had a coat of oil on them which I didn't like. OD on the onions. Dressing was really good. Total $8.75. Granted I was very full after. Happy I tried this place that people RAVE about, but I wouldn't put this necessarily in my favorite lunch places in the Rittenhouse area. I do want to go back to try the stir frys though.
