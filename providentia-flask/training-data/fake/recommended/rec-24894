Since its right nearby to my place, thought I'd give this place a try. Its exactly what I expected. Slightly better... a good place to watch a football game, grab a lunch and a beer on Sunday. Service is SLOW. I completely agree with the other reviews. I had the wings which were pretty good. I really can't get excited about it. Lots of beers on tap. This place is just so so to me.
