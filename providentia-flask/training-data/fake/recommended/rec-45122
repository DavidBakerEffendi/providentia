I stopped by this place to purchase fish and chips. First let me say they do have fresh fish which looked amazing.  I may come back and purchase fresh fish. As for the take out, I came with a coupon to get 15% off.  I ordered the fish and chips and was told that the fish & chips was a special and not applicable for the coupon.  (The fish and chips is a special which is on the standard menu?) Anyway, in about two minutes they gave me my order and I drive a total two minutes home. When I got home I open the box to find the fish was just barely cooked and soaked in grease.  There was no time for anything to drain and it was soggy, greasy and completely tasteless.  There was no seasoning what so ever. After two bites, my mouth coated with grease, I could not continue.  It was by far the worst fish I have ever tasted. I normally do not write bad reviews but this was not a good experience.  I may choose to buy fresh fish but never cooked fish again!
