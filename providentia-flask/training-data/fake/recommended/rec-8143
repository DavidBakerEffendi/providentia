Following up on Carrie's review.  We headed over to Jones a few times last year when rehearsing for our Fringe play.  Great comfort food, neat atmosphere, and friendly staff.  They tolerated a bunch crazy requests and made you feel welcome.  Can't speak to the cocktails, but I did wish that they had draft beers.  Although I found the local bottled beer with historic names like Washington Porter satisfying.  Its the way the school cafeteria should have been when the Mac and cheese is something to praise not dread.
