Meet up with friends before US Open Women's Singles Final. We ordered Nutella French Toast, Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs, and Farmer's Market Omelette. The French Toast was not bad but nothing special. It's too bad the portion wasn't a generous one. It left me hungry. My friend who ordered the Salmon dish didn't think much of the dish. She thought the salmon got too salty as she ate the dish. Omelette friend was satisfy with her dish but didn't think much about the dish. Perhaps, we didn't ordered the right dishes. We did read the review that Penny Egg Sandwich was a dish to order but we all had our eyes on something else. The wait for a table was an hour. I would go back to Penelope to try other things. Curried Chicken Salad caught me eyes.
