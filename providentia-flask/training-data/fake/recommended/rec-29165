WOW great place!  Was in town for work and wanted a real cheese steak and this place did it in spades!!! It's a classic diner that is better for pick p orders but dose have some seating.   I sat at the counter and the service was great friendly and authentic Philly! I would say skip the cheesy touristy places and check this place out!!
