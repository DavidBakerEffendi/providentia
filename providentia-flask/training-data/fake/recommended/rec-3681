As a newbie to D.C., all I do is brunch and happy hour. So on a weekend trip to BK I was expecting something similar to DC brunch: overpriced, mediocre food with terrible service. I have never been so wrong about anything in my life. I had about a 20 min wait, in which I was given a fresh orange and ice water, cinnamon raisin pancakes, and vinegar fries with horseradish to taste while in line. That, is true customer service. By the time I was seated I had 3 pancakes, and they were the best of my life. Lemon zest and butter. Mind blown. Then I ordered my entr√©e - Mexican omelet with a side of bacon. My friends and I sat in silence after the first bites because our lives had been changed. Fresh, hot, home cooking - something you can't find anywhere but at your mom's kitchen, or in this case, Tom's. As if the food wasn't enough, fresh cookies with whipped cream greeted us on our way out. If I ever move to BK - Tom's is going to be my neighbor.
