A little crowded but the outside seating and table games are a fun distraction.  The beer menu is great but the food menu could be better, pretty much everything but the sausages is mediocre.  There are much better places for authentic German food and beer in the city but someone once told me this is the German place where no one is or has any idea what German is and I would have to agree.  It got the impression that the mostly younger preppy clientele had to have lots of translation and didn't know the difference between a hefe-weizen and a dunkel.
