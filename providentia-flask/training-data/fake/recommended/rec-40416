This is kind of an updated review, as I wrote the other one on the Windsor page! Went in and asked for a Mac Attack with a bed of sweet potato instead of mac n cheese. Always accommodating, they obliged and it was amazing. I ALWAYS get burnt ends. They are the truest form of KCQ and I can't get enough.
