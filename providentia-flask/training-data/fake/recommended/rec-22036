Man oh man, they have great burgers and fish and chips and the prices are extremely reasonable. They're hard to beat downtown. If you're not a beer drinker I highly recommend their Ginger Ale. It's made on the premises and is fantastic! Update: I've noticed that the food quality has gone down a bit since this was originally posted.
