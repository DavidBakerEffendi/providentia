I walked into Papa Frank's Italian Restaurant for dinner knowing not to expect anything close to what I have eaten in Rome or any other upscale eatery.....and yet I can't help but only give this establishment two stars. Let's just get straight to the biggest negative, the food itself. The biggest gripe about the food comes from the amount the line cooks actually care about the dishes, which from what I could tell is very little. A good example of this came from our two orders of carbonara. We ordered two examples of this dish, both with peas for an extra 50 cents. The meals arrived and my dish had so few peas I could count them on both hands.....while the other persons had a main dish that appeared to be peas with carbonara on the side. ALSO, the carbonara is totally not carbonara. It is alfredo sauce (which tasted like it was from a jar) with bits of bacon tossed in. Sorry Papa Frank's, I understand the price point of the menu but it's really tough to defend you when entire items on the menu are misrepresented. A variety of entrees were ordered including examples of beef lasagna, chicken parmigiana, and fettuccine alfredo. But to be honest with you, it was hard to differentiate any of these dishes as they arrived. It is really hard to recommend changes to make things better as I know they are hitting right at their main demographics. The menu features mains no more expensive than $10, so it is easy to see why Papa Frank's is very popular with families and colleges in the area. To all my fellow Yelpers who disagree, I understand your point but in my opinion cheap food should not automatically grant extra stars onto the average of a restaurant. Taking everything into consideration....I can't help but think the best move would be looking elsewhere for an Italian or family dining experience, even if it means throwing in a few extra dollars.
