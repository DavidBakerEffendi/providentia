I will begin this by saying that this was one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants and very convenient as we live across the street. As such we come here frequently and have always had great food, drinks and service. However, I wanted to write as I recently had a very annoying experience. We popped in around 6pm on Memorial Day weekend with the intention of just having a quick drink at the bar. All the bar seats were taken and so I asked if we could sit at one of the other tables explaining we would only be there for 1 drink (there were about 10 free dining tables at this point) I was told no, they were only for dining, so as a last resort I asked if we could just stand at the bar. Again I was told no, there is no room, which quite frankly was ridiculous. The ma√Ætre de who I was speaking with was new and not the usual girl, I felt she was very rude and unaccommodating, speaking down to us like we weren't good enough for her establishment. A great shame as we usually have a wonderful time here.
