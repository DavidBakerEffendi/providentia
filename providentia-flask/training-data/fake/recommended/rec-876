Wonderful restaurant, delicious food. The back has a dim, cozy ambiance, while in front you can watch the chefs prepare the food. The grilled Japanese yam was delicious and my favorite dish! The chawanmushi was pretty good (though the dashi could have been more flavorful). The sesame encrusted asparagus with pine nuts was so-so, the Wagyu beef entree delicious. The grilled chicken was very tender, and the black cod was delicate and flavorful. I would skip the udon here, as that's not what they're known for. An elegant, soothing meal with small portions! Every dish was simple and beautifully presented! I want to come back just for the delicious yam!
