My verdict in a nutshell: Great concept, but go to their sister establishment on West 43rd Street instead...  Average, rather pricey pub fare with a slight Belgian twist.  Place looks kind of inviting from the outside, but the ambiance inside is loud, shrill, and rather obnoxious. I found the service to be inconsistent and rather poor, and the beer prices to be too high for this kind of establishment. Yes, the place has a good Belgian beer selection...
