I really enjoyed this place. Its cheap, tastes good and in an area pretty sparse with good restaurants Small place, no real utensils/everything can be taken out or thrown away Had the Bun, it was fresh and good, pork was fatty in the good places. I would of prefered a little more textures, maybe throw in some crushed peanuts but thats just my preference for Bun. Also the meat wasnt aplenty but it was like... 6 dollars Bubble tea... was disappointing Vietnamese coffee was decent Overall it was good food for a good price in a barren area. Will definitely be back for their sandwiches they looked amazing.
