The burgers here are no joke!  This is a divey, dark bar in the West Village.  We sat in the back dining room at a booth and promptly etched our names and date in the booth.  It wasn't vandalism, many people before us did that.   At 3pm, it was pretty full.  This is definitely not a hamburger for the dainty or the weak!  The  patty was thick and the meat was juicy and flavorful. My sister had the grilled chicken sandwich which was also great.  Fries are pretty standard.   The menu is on the wall in the dining room and it feels like this place has been a neighborhood institution forever.  I love it!   Simple and delicious!  One of the best burgers I have had!
