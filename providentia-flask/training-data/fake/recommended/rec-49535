Light, refreshing and astonishingly good. I came here with my formerly vegan cousin and we chowed down. We both eat fish, shellfish, dairy, meat, everything... But everything is so expertly prepared and flavored you don't miss it. We got three rolls: La Fiesta (avocado, cilantro, pickled jalapeno), Green Machine (asparagus, basil marinated veg) and Spicy Mang (tiny slices of cucumber, avocado). The best was the La Fiesta as we are both cilantro lovers. We left light on our feet and satisfied. Also, grab a cucumber lemonade with mint. Perfect to wash down the healthy morsels. Only con is the place is TINY. Be prepared to share tables, if you can. I don't live in the area so next time I'd get takeout and walk to USQ and eat there.
