Props to fellow Yelpers! I don't think I would have found it otherwise. The food here is incredible. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. It's cash only, but they do have an ATM in the foyer. I gleaned my choices from fellow reviews. Here's the results. -Pork and crab soup dumplings. Must order. Pure deliciousness. Still not sure how to eat them though. -Mapo tofu noodle. Also so good. The home-made noodles have a great texture, a real nice bite. -Pickled cabbage, bean curd skin, and soy bean. This dish was not something I'd normally order, but saw it recommended here. The flavor is fresh and the textures are a good play of crunchy and soft. -Scallion pancakes. These are what'd you expect. Well done, but boring. I probably would try something else next time. All in all, this place is great food for a great price.
