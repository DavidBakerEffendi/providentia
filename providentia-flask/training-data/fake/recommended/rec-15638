Party of 6, seated immediately. Service was quite good, the beer was cold, and the food was solid if a not entirely spectacular. On to the food: yeah the fried chicken is good. Dark meat soooo much better than white meat (on the dry side for my plate). As a southern boy at heart (at least through my stomach) it was pretty authentic. It just will always pain me when I could eat an equally good (probably better) meal in the south for half the price. I did enjoy the micro green salad along side but I think it was a bit less than what was described on the menu. Pretzels are good, the bacon brittle is not what one might expect (really just bacon flavored/honey roasted peanuts. Overall a solid place.
