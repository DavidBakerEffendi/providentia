Unfortunately I can't give this place more than this. Today was the second time I ate them. I want to like, but I can't. I got the Chili Con Carne burrito. The portion size is great, but that's about all. It's bland and I don't quite understand why on earth they would put peas and carrots in a burrito. I was not impressed. We also became the forgotten table. Our server came to us three times, to take our order, to deliver our order and to drop the check. We won't be back, I'll take chain mexican places over this.
