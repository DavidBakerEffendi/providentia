OK this is my second review for this place. Â The first one got bounced by yelp because I hadn't actually been there. I assumed that since the first guy reviewed it four days before it opened up it was free game (who knew?). I had the Truffle Burger ~ yummy Deep fried pickles ~ save your money and get some from the next street fair It's pretty good but for the price it better be good!
