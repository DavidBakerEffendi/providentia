This is the classiest place in Queens. The staff is trained to serve royalty, which is exactly how you feel here. It takes time to eat here. They let you savor you experience. I cannot overstate the amazing quality of food - simple Italian done perfectly. Beware of corporate uncultured swine from the green building. Sit far from the large table. Enjoy!
