My husband and I discovered this gem in 2008 and we were blown away by their sushi. My favorite is the lobster roll and the ninja roll. The sushi is fresh, clean, tender, and comes beautifully presented with a leaf and a flower. Chinese food is also a hit. We've had the fried rice, lo mein, pineapple chicken, and orange chicken. The place is clean, decorated nicely, and they have high chairs for babies and changing tables in the bathroom. It is and will continue to be one of our favorites!
