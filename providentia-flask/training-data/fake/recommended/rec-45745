The food here is fantastic, and so thoughtfully prepared. First time here, I had the wafcos. Waffle tacos. Delicious. I tried all three kinds- chicken, beef brisket, and pork belly. The blend of flavors with the savory meat, the crispy, lightly sweet waffle, and the fresh veggies was perfect, and there are three sauces to choose from. The chicken pot pie- also delicious. A tasty blend of chicken and seasonal veggies, topped off with a soft, buttery biscuit-like crust. The owners here are so kind and friendly. Very welcoming. They have a real heart for this place, and their menu is obviously a labor of love. Real quality food, and at a great price.
