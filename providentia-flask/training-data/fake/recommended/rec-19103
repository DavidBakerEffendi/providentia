An authentic gem! La pissaladière is classic (sorry, French Roast chain, your recipe is off) and along with la socca in its peppery goodness really hit the spot for any cuisine du sud craving. The crêpes are très bon and filling. La Savoyarde is my personal favorite and is a taste of Savoie and the Alps. I can't wait to go back and sink my teeth into a traditional daube and, of course, a dessert crêpe with Nutella. This restaurant is très charmant and the service could not be more warm/chaleureux. Bravo, Pâtes et Traditions!
