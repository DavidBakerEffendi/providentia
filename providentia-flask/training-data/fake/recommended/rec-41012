I LOVE NAM NAM!!!!!!!!!! I work in the neighborhood and eat here more often than I'd like to admit, but its a cheap, filling, DELICIOUS lunch! I usually get the Spicy chicken banh mi or the spicy chicken bun, and you CANNOT go wrong with either! I have to say the fresh rolls are less of a good value, great taste, but you get two rolls for something like 4$....I guess the somewhat high cost comes from the shrimp inside. The staff is SUPER friendly and efficient, and... I LOVE NAM NAM!!!!!!!!!!
