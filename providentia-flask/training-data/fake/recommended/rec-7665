We tried this Viennese-style cafe for both breakfast and lunch on a recent trip to New York.  It's expensive, but delicious.  The coffee drinks and the desserts are fantastic, and I especially enjoyed some of the traditional German/Austrian food on the menu for lunch. I stuck to the wursts and sauerkraut, which were excellent, but many of the other dishes looked good as well.  And since the desserts are so good, I recommend eating one with lunch and getting a slice of the delicious fruit kuchen to go!
