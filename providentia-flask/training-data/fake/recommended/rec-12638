What a surprise! Truly a hidden gem and fairly inexpensive too. The place is small but everything we ordered was delish! They usually recommend that you get 2-3 tapas per person to have enough food so my friend and I did just that. We got the chicken liver mousse, tortilla, Â the veal tongue and the cockles. My favorite was the chicken liver mousse and I could not believe the price! Definitely one of the best bargains that I have encountered. It was $4 for four decently sized pieces and it truly was delicious. Can't wait to go back and order more of that!
