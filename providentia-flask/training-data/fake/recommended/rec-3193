Excellent.  From brunch to dinner this place aims to please my palate.  Great flavors, nice portions, meals cooked perfectly.  Decent cocktail selection and friendly service.  Try the cheddar waffles and pork chops for brunch.  Perfection!   The wait for a table can be long, but oh so worth it.  I took one star away because their roast chicken special on Sunday was bland, but that hasn't stopped me from continually going back.  Oh...and the pecan pie sundae is crack on Court Street...I can have one every day.
