Nom nom. Solid meditteranean food. The lamb shank was delicious with meat just falling off the bone. The chicken kebap plate was decent too with big chicken chunks, a little on the bland side but nice and juicy. Seating was a bit cramped, the place is pretty big with lots of tiny tables very close together, not very romantic. It's a great place for a casual dinner.
