I consider this a good hole in the wall find. It's not street leveled but you'll notice its sign right away. As you trek down into the small cafe you head over to the counter to grab a menu. You'll notice that nothing is priced more than $10. Lasagna, panini's are 5, salads are around 7 and other specialty pastas go from 7-10. Remember to check the chalkboard to the left as they update their specials frequently. For this review, my girlfriend and I came for brunch on a Saturday. She had the fresh pasta special for $10 and I went with the prosciutto panini for $5. The cafe was bustling and it was one woman working the register and tables (according to other reviews she could possibly be the owner). My panini was good, a little overwhelming on the cheese portion but didn't differ me from finishing it. Her pasta was great, sauce wasn't thick or too light and was a big portion enough for her to share with me. Bread on the side helped me clear the bowl of the sauce :D We also tried their lemon bars. Light treat after the meal. Atmosphere is quaint, magazines and books are found within the tables and on the shelf. Overall it's a great stop for a cheap Italian eat. You rarely see places charge $5 for a panini. Plus, there was no tax (we paid cash). If you're in the area and looking for a bite I'd recommend them.
