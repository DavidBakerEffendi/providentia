Got. to. love. Momofuku. So, so so good and always packed. Been here twice and the cuisine is solid --  extremely innovative and delicious.  And I'm sure I sound like a broken record, but the steamed pork buns are the bomb and a must-try. Every time I see steamed buns on a dim sum menu, I order it in hopes it will be somewhat like Momofuku steam buns...but it never is.  The place in general has a cool, hip vibe to it which is reflected in the waitstaff - our waitress was really personable and friendly, not pretentious or rude at all.  Service is excellent - my water glass was never empty.   For food I ordered the prix fixe for $25 - not a bad deal when you see the prices a la carte.  I went with the Pork Buns, Crispy Skate, and the Thai Iced Tea Parfait...My husband got the Grapefruit Cream Pie and both desserts were perfection - the perfect combination of unexpected flavors and textures that all blend together seamlessly in your mouth.  "Yum-o!"
