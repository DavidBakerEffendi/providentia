2 words: yum. mee. very european. big and airy room with lots of hustle and bustle--but in  a classy cafe way. it has one of those "i could sit here all day and lazily read a book over an espresso" vibes. went for brunch recently--the herbs & egg white omelet was amazing, and the home fries were excellently seasoned. one of the best brunches i've had in a long time (it was  weekday, not exactly sure how one gets in here on a saturday or sunday morning. went in another time for a work lunch, and ordered french onion soup. i know it's sort of a pathetic order but it was hands down the best i've ever had. the amount of cheese and the type of bread and everything...i was impressed and left wanting 5  more bowls. highly recommended, even from a non-european, non-socialite such as myself.
