Had the dumplings and they are deeelish, awesome thin skin, not too burnt, but it will leave you with bad chive breath for the entire nite. The beef noodle soup was ok. Very filling, but the broth, ehh, I had better. Absolutely NO ambiance and dirty tables. I would be afraid to go into the check or look down on the floors!! The noodle guy is entertaining to watch, the banging of the noodle, not so much. As I sat there eating, I kept staring in the kitchen and noticed the guy who handled the noodle also handle money. Eeeeeew!! They really should use some gloves. I'm sure the health department would give them a C or B, but heck everywhere we eat, is dirty, so. And as I left, I noticed the frig with the soda and water is outside by the door. Classic and cheap Ctown joint.
