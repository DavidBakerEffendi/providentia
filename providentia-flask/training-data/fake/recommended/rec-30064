I thought it was good for what it was - a fairly inexpensive, takeout place. The spare ribs were large and not "clean cut" like you might get at most places (e.g., they had cartilage attached), which was new for me (admittedly I don't eat ribs that often). Sauce was a touch sweeter than I prefer. Sides were good, with the yams particularly nice. For $10, I thought it was a generous tray of food. Because it's principally set-up for takeout, I was a little surprised that it took almost 15 minutes to get the food, though that might have been because we ordered some lamb chops which presumably they cook (or at least finish) to order. One little thing here that I think is very clever which other places can learn from is they ask for your initials when you order, rather than your name or giving you a number. I'd never seen that before, but I think it's a great idea, as it's much easier than giving (and often spelling) your whole name, and it's not overly casual like at Panera, where they call you by your first name. Some people may not care, but anyone who doesn't have a simple, common name is likely to appreciate the way they do it here.
