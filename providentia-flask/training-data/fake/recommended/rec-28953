A friend of mine, who's cousins opened this modern Greek restaurant in the heart of Center City Philadelphia, took me here just a few weeks after it opened...and I'm thrilled to see how successful it has become since its opening. I'm not crazy about tapas restaurants, but the food here is truly fantastic...not to mention the wines! Service has always been very good, the waitstaff work well together and have always been professional and friendly. I highly recommend it! They tend to blast the music a little too loud after hours for my personal tastes, but you can't beat the quality of food and service here!
