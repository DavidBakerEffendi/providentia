Simple sushi. Nothing fancy. No skyrocket prices. Great for my wallet! The bowls such as salmon don are all cooked fish over rice. They do not have raw fish over rice like that ( other than charashi) so don't make the my mistake! The menu isnt clear if its hot or cold But the salmon don ( cooked) tastes pretty good. I always go there for the rolls and nigiri.
