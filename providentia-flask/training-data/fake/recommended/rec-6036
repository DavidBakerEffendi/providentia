So freakin good. The fries are perfectly cooked. The sauces are the best. We got the mango chutney mayo which was perfection. The war sauce is interesting and peanuty (definitely stir it thoroughly its much better that way). We also got the roasted garlic mayo which was sooo delicious and garlicky. If you love french fries and mayo dipping sauces, go here.
