I went with my girlfriend for brunch and enjoyed mimosas and Sabrina's amazing food. We order two entrees and asked if we were splitting, we said yes and thy split it for us! We got Huevos Rancheros and Stuff French Toast. It was great! People were not kidding when they said portions were enormous. We were only able to have a few bites of the French toast, but the few bites were worth the belly ache of being so full. Yummooooo!
