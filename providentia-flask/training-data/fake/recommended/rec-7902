Really enjoyed our night out here. Good food, slightly eccentric experience, great ingredients and accommodating of allergies. Highlights: the gluten-free rolls (you have to request them) are warm and DELICIOUS. I am desperately searching for a recipe that will come close for home! Also the home made ice cream... Yum.
