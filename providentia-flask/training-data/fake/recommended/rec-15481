Phenomenal place. The food is delicious and wont leave you feeling stuffed or bloated. Portions are an ideal size. Very intimate and romantic ambience. I loved the entrance curtains; gives it sense of drama. The owner is the nicest person imaginable. He took our coats himself and had them hung. I saw him going table to table chatting with the large groups of people having dinner. This place was packed. He came over to us a few times to check up on everything. He's doing right what many restaurants owners do wrong. He's actually engaging his customers and is open to advice and suggestions. He hugged as we were leaving and helped my girlfriend with her coat. He is the restaurant. One of the best Italian places in the city. Can't wait to try his new place uptown.
