This was my first and last Cheesesteak stop in Philly.  I was in Philly for 3 days and ate here twice....in part because location was great for me (Northwest Phlly) but more so because the food was awesome.  I drove by Genos and Pats and had no interest in dealing with the crowds.  This place is small but I ate here around 5pm and another day around 11pm so there was no crowd at all.  The meat is awesome but my only criticism was that they were a little light on the cheese.  I ordered Provolone with Whiz and it was plenty cheesy enough.   My wife ordered extra American; no whiz and you couldn't even see the cheese on the sandwich....at least there is a lot of yummy meat. The best part of this meal was the assortment of pickles and peppers they have.  I slathered mine with banana peppers and red pepper relish and they were sooooo good.  You could put that relish on a shoe and the shoe would taste yummy.  It seems like a lot of the locals were ordering Provie with sauce (tomato sauce) but I didn't try it.  When I go back to Phiily, I will try the sauce and update my review. I've had plenty of cheesesteak in my life and even home in So Cal, I have a place or two that I really like, but they don't come close to this one.  Since they don't allow me to rate 4 1/2 stars, I rate this 4 stars and a hearty nom nom nom! 1 minor note....I never ordered fries but they don't appear to sell them so if that's important to you, you may want to hop across the street.  :)
