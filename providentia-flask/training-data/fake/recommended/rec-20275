I can't attest for their other drinks, but their mint julep was DELICIOUS. It was like a bourbon snocone. Yum yum. The meatloaf sandwich was delicious. I ordered the ravioli which was very very good. I will definitely eat here again. Staff was attentive, and sweet! Also, their creme brulee was AMAZING.
