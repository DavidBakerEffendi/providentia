Simple but unique menu. Really enjoyed the soba noodle salad- great flavor, not ginormous but delicious. It's in a tough spot Â (not a thriving restaurant area) and I assume most of their business will come though takeout, but if you're by- stop in. They did a nice job renovating the small shop so it's comfortable and clean to grab a quick bite.
