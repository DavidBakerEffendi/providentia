Living in the area I was curious for months about what kind of place this would be. I was excited for something new to open and i couldn't have left more pleased with The Saint Austere. My girlfriend and I went in on a Thursday night for some food and wine. There was a really good vibe going and we both were comfortable immediately. It is small plates and usually i am skeptical about the size of the dishes but i was pleasantly pleased with their size and heartiness. The bar is lengthy with plenty of seats, it also has a few tables in the back perfect for group seating. The ambiance is the opposite of cheesy which is rare to find these days. There's no lame gimmicks or mason jars used as glasses like everywhere else in the area. They offer around 15 different dishes each priced between $8 and $15. They have a variety of food from things like meat and cheese plates to a beautiful octopus dish that the people next to us ordered and it made us jealous because they were raving about it. (Unfortunately we were already full, next time) My favorite dish was the creamy polenta with spicy sausage. It had the perfect amount of spice. Put it this way, if you were at home you would definitely lick the sides of your bowl. We also ordered the broccoli rabe and little neck clams. The clams were plated beautifully and the toasted bread for dipping was a nice touch. For thirst they offer a broad selection of beer and wine. 4 or 5 beers on tap and a good amount by bottle. They have a large selection of wine by the glass and bottle as well. We spoke with the owners for a few while at the bar and they seemed really friendly and definitely knew what they were talking about when it comes to food and wine and pairing flavors. They even sent us out an order of the papas bravas (roasted potatoes with mayonnaise and sriracha) on the house. After a few hours of wine, beer and food we left happy and full with a new favorite place. We will definitely be back, i have to try that octopus!
