I am so surprised by some of the reviews on here. This place is the best Thai restaurant in the city. I went with a friend whose mother is from Thailand and it was the most authentic and tasty Thai food we have had yet in a restaurant. We had a long chat with the chef. Such a pleasant man. He was so excited we were pleased with the food. It's so lovely to go to a restaurant and see genuinely good people behind who are doing it for the love of food and their culture. This place has good food and good people who make it. PLEASE, you have to check this place out. *If you want your food really spicy, ask for them to make it thai spicy. It's the trick. All thai restaurants make their food non-traditionally less spicy because American taste buds typically can't handle it. Don't criticize the restaurant.
