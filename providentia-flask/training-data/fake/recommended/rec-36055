We were so hungry that day and we found this place on yelp. It really surprised us. All the food we got are really delicious. I was lucky enough to get the last rabbit leg dish. Since there is a big party in the restaurant that day, the server gave us free wine to apologize for the noise. He also ends up giving us free desserts. We are really treated and left good tips to thank him.
