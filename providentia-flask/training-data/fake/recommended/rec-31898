Myself and my family eat at Banh mi Zon on average once a week.  We always get Zon's version of the "Classic", one of the rice plates and a limonade and I am all but addicted to the Cafe Su Da - Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  Zon's food is authentic and all the ingredients are very fresh - from the bread they buy daily to the rice they steamed just before you got there...and, having a Vietnamese wife and in-laws, Zon, and the new place on 1st Ave (to be reviewed next) are as authentic as it gets in Manhattan.
