this was quite possibly the most overrated meal i've ever had in my life.  i came here with high expectations, as i did some research on good tapas restaurants and settled on this one. i ordered the fried goat cheese, truffle surprise, bacon wrapped dates, brussels sprouts, uni on toast, and squid ink paella. after consuming each course, i felt so completely underwhelmed.  with the exception of the uni on toast, which was amazing (but then again you could pretty much smear uni on a dried turd and it would be amazing) everything tasted good, but nothing great. this was only about a week after thanksgiving, and you know what i was thinking to myself?  all this food tastes like thanksgiving side dishes.  im in nyc, eating at arguably one of the best tapas restaurants in the city, paying this much money, for thanksgiving side dishes? i mean don't get me wrong, i knew what to expect coming in.  tapas are pretty much side dishes and i didn't expect to be full at the end of the meal, but i was expecting familiar food to be transformed into interesting, eye rolling, one bite morsels of greatness, but all i got was familiar food, prepared well, that tasted like familiar food. o, and then the bill came.  again, i don't want to complain about the amount of food that was served to me, but thinking of it in terms of the food compared to the price, I have to say that this was the worst meal i've ever eaten in terms of the quality and quantity of food per dollar. but don't get me wrong, the price would have been justified had the food been amazing.  it was not.  it was good, tasty, and boring.
