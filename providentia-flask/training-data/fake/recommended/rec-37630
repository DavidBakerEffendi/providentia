Fantastic lil' diner. Gorgeous huevos rancheros, kids love their pulled pork sandwich and pancakes. Fantastic menu and the draft ales (which I've never had) are very tempting, but not at 9 am :) Good sounds, prompt bustling service. Very low key interior. It's all about the food. It's ridiculously busy so we get there at opening time and we accept a cramped table or whatever's offered and we leave when we're finished. Upsets some people but not us. We're regulars and will continue to be as long as the food is as good as it is.
