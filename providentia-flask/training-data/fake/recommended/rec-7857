I decided to get take out this time and they don't allow you to call first and pick, you have to drive there and order in person - pretty stupid concept if you ask me, beats the purpose and convenience of a "pick up" order. Granted I only ordered the rice and steamed dumplings but it took the 30 minutes to give me my order!! Not to mention that the staff are just so unprofessional and talking about their personal lives at the bar! Never will I do this again...
