I tried this truck when I wandered around Fashion district for lunch. Apparently it's there on Tuesdays & Thursdays. If it weren't for the price, Chef Samir would have a 5 star rating. Maybe I'm just not used to NYC pricing since I just came back, but the bang for the buck isn't there. There seems to just be a premium on higher end food trucks in NYC these days. I've had Royal over cous cous and all the meats that Chef Samir prepares are SO flavorful. The chicken and lamb are marinated well. The star of the show is absolutely the merguez sausage. It's so packed with flavor that, honestly, you'll be burping it up the rest of the day. Make sure you don't have any important meetings after eating this. I'll continue to have it every once in a while, but the price is still a little high for me.
