This is not your everyday Thai restaurant, because they have their own styles First, let's talk about the location, located on 9th Ave between 47th and 48th Street I personally don't like going that way, because the closes train only stop on 8th Ave, so if you want to go some where from 9th Ave to 12th Ave, you have to do some walking, and in the winter = No Fun! lol But this restaurant is not that far, you can take the blue line which is A, C or E trains and stop at 50th Street and walk few blocks to this restaurant If you not sure where to catch the blue line, just take your train to Times Square stop, and connected from there, and I'm sure most of you, your trains stop at Times Square. I have a meeting with one of my friend for lunch, and since I never been, I have to looked around when I arrived in the area, it was during day time and sunny, and I gotta tell you, once I arrived at the front of the restaurant, I thought it was out of business. lol Because the sign of this restaurant not really stand out, the front of the building is Gray color, and the name of the restaurant is chrome and is small If someone once told me about this restaurant and I happen to be in the area, and I walk by, I will never thought this is the same restaurant someone once told me, unless you are going there because of this restaurant Once I walked inside, just like I told you before, this is not your everyday Thai restaurant, beside the 1 buddha sitting on the wall, you will not have any idea this is a Thai restaurant, is very modern, black and white is their color, you see the bar on your right hand side, tables and chairs on the left, and it goes all the way through the end of the restaurant, I'm thinking this place can probably held about 80 for sit down dinner and standing maybe 130-150 people, probably good for Christmas party They seated us kinda in the middle where the swanky chandelier, and next to it is a table, since I'm sitting on the left hand side facing the wall, and the other table in the middle with 2 chairs on each side facing each other, that's mean one of the chair back is facing my back, and is no walking space in between, so every time someone walk by, I have to move my chair, and often people kicked my chair by accident, very uncomfortable, luckily is not busy during that time, or else I will probably yell at someone. For the food Once again, they have their own Room Service Thai Style I ordered the Fried Coconut Calamari, never have them before, I had Fried Coconut Shrimp, but not the Calamari I gotta tell you boyz and girlz, you GOTTA try it when you decide to dine here, it was so....good, not only is was hot and crispy, is also very tasty because they added the coconut in it, so different My friend and I both ordered the Pad Thai (I know right, seem like that's all everybody order when they goes to the Thai restaurant) lol But not in this case, because my friend and I read over the menu, and they was writing on the bottom of the menu explaining how their Pad Thai are so different from the others, and they called it the Room Service Pad Thai If you clicked on some of the pictures on here, someone actually posted on here, is Seafood Pah Thai covering by egg white, is very nice, and is also tasted very good The presentation is really good and I like it a lot Last but not least, the server She came by and took our orders, didn't say much, never did stop by and check how we are doing and asking about how was the food etc My glass did almost went empty one time, but someone else saw it and refilled for me Overall, 4 stars I will recommend this to my friends that's for sure.
