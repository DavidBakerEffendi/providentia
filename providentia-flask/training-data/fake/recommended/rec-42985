Being a fan of the Little Owl, I wanted to venture out and try their other restaurant.  What I liked most about this place is first of all, it is larger so you are not sitting on the folks next to you (or listening to their conversation, which is what tends to happen with me).  I had a beet/goat cheese salad that was unlike any other.  Then for my meal, the hanger steak was very flavorful & juciy- and came with a grilled caesar salad.   What I liked most about it is the food had great, simple ingredients and the atmostephere was very authentic.  Our waitress was great.   It's now one of my top spots in the city.
