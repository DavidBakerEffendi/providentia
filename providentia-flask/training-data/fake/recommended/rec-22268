What I really need to do is find myself a brand new lover. And I think Bartaco is it. Bartaco is one of those places you don't expect to love, but you love loving it once you do. Bartaco, I want to run away with you. Bartaco, I wish I knew how to quit you. My parents took me there during a recent visit, and I already know I have to go back next time I come to Connecticut. Two-bite tacos are such a neat concept, and I love that you have the opportunity to experience a multitude of different flavors in one visit. We started with chips and salsa. The green salsa appeared to be homemade and had a nice flavor and kick. The chips were large tostada shells that we broke and dipped. I experienced the pork belly, portobello, fried oyster, curry shrimp and wild boar. The unexpected best was the fried oyster. Our server was polite, professional and efficient. The food was delicious and fairly priced. I will definitely come back. Bartaco...will you be mine?
