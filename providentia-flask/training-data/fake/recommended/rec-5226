The tables were old, menus stained with sticky food, and the whole place had an old mop smell. Everyone liked their lunch entrees though ($8) and drinks. The Thai ice tea was a little different than we were used to. The Ra Ma Shrimp flavor was very good. Didn't like the hard eggplant and stringy ginger pieces in it though. My friend was pleased with the Pineapple Fried Rice wt Chicken. The Iced Green Tea was the best. Vegetable dumplings ($6) were like rubber which made then inedible. Even though we didn't eat any of them, they wouldn't take it off the bill.
