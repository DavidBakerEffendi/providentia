Good clean "Fare"! Came here for Sunday brunch starting at 9am (which is a rarity in the city). Service, food, portions and price point was all a plus. Fare is a great place for those who are eating "clean". Ordered: "Fare Bloody Mary" made with pepper vodka and garnished with sweet bacon, eggs any style (def more than 2 eggs) with sweet potato and sausage, breakfast burrito (stuffed with scramble eggs, chorizo, sweet potato, light cheese, cooked spinach) with jalape√±o salsa and spring salad. The breakfast burrito was def enough to share. Next time we will just get that and add one pancake on the side. The eggs any style for $8 was very generous, my bf couldn't even finish the eggs (he usually complains about restaurants with small portions). What's brunch without a bloody Mary? It was delish, the pepper vodka added the perfect kick and the sweet bacon garish rounded out the drink very well. Service: all the servers there were very attentive. They filled our water glasses before they were empty. Checked on our table at the right times. Good friendly service for a Sunday morning. Overall: we will be back! Looking forward to trying their dinner. Side Note: I am in love/obsessd with their stemware and dishes made by Degrenne.
