BEER IS EXPENSIVE HERE! Which is fine because it's good beer (albeit overpriced good beer). But if you're going to charge $9-$11 for a glass (not a pint) of beer, you might want to put the price on the menu.  Especially if the beer in question is usually $5-$7 at other establishments. And if someone asks how much a beer costs, providing the beer list that doesn't include prices isn't very helpful. With that being said- If you order your beer during happy hour, you get a good deal (half priced drafts).  The bartenders were also nice and attentive.  I remember the salmon BLT being pretty awesome too.
