I can't really compare Pat's and Geno's since I didn't have to taste Geno's cheesteaks, but Pat's was quite good! There were so many flavor combination available but I stuck to "Steak Whiz Wit-Out"(no onions just cheez whiz)! Make sure you do your order right, be quick and have cash. @ lunch-be prepared to find parking and/or eat while standing. Don't you worry...it's all worth it. I stopped @ Pat's hours before my flight back to Cali and wished I ordered another one for my plane ride back home.
