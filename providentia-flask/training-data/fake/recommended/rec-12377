Food all good!!! Server really boring!!! Created no dinning experience whatsoever. It's always a give and take though. It's either the food is okay and service is great or the food is really good but the service sucks. Can't wait to find a place that has both. But because of the food, cause here that's all that really matters, I'll give it 4 Stars.
