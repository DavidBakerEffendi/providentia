Not good enough, especially when Sante Fe Burrito is right down the street. This restaurant is very popular with the lunch crowd, but not really worth it. When the main thing you can taste in your burrito is sour cream it just makes you feel blah. I'm not one of those people who are obsessed with burritos, but I know enough to know this one wasn't great. And the water in the soda fountain pours out so slowly, not that it's their fault at ALL, but it was 100 degrees yesterday and there were literally two lines, one for the burritos and one for the water machine.
