After a long day of wandering around Astoria I was seriously craving a sugar fix, and Martha's just wasn't going to do it. I googled "best cupcakes Astoria" and was surprised to see an Italian cafe at the top of the list. Sure enough, this place does sell cupcakes in addition antipasti, panini and crostini. The menu itself was enough to make my mouth water... I'll definitely be back for lunch or dinner. The cupcakes are indeed in Crumbs-reminiscent flavors... butter pecan or gingerbread, anyone? However they are also gigantic and delicious. My main beef with Martha's is that the cupcakes are often stale or dry and the icing too sweet. The cupcakes at Il Bambino suffer neither of these afflictions. They are soft and delicious, with just the right amount of tasty tasty frosting. They are a bit pricey at $3.50 each, but are large enough to easily share.
