We were looking for brunch on a Friday morning. I didn't actually expect a place open for brunch during the week. Maybe it's because I'm from Florida and most brunch places are only open on the weekend. The place was mostly full when we arrived. For 3 of us, we didn't have to wait long and they were able to seat us outside in the back. Right away I felt like I was in someones backyard, which gave it a very homey feel. You are literally surrounded by other apartment buildings and homes. I just sort of feel sorry for the people who live back there and want some privacy. The menu had many interesting items. I was interested in either the Lengua and Papas (grass-fed beef tongue and potato hash with pumpkin seed mole and sunny-side up eggs) and the Seared Duck Breast. I don't think I ever had beef tongue, and the waitress assured me they were good, so being the adventurous type I ordered them. I was not disappointed and I recommend them highly. The service was excellent and the food came out quick. As much as I liked sitting outside, the inside was decorated nicely too, again, as if in someones home. I don't know when I'll be in Park Slope again, but I hope when I am, I can visit this pace again.
