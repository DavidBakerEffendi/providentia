Stowe's seafood, I want to give you a hug. I want to blow you a kiss. Why? Because you are delicious. Because you are more than worth the drive. Because you are run by kind, vaguely curmudgeonly, seafaring men who do amazingly disarming gestures like suddenly throw in a plethora of free wonderful things when they heard your order incorrectly. We ordered chowder, lobster bisque, a dozen littleneck clams, and some fried shrimp and crab cakes. We got all of those things, but we also got a haddock fillet, several delicious scallops, and more sauces than you could possibly imagine. YAY
