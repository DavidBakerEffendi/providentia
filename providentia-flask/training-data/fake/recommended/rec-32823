Amazing dinner! The atmosphere was great. We were sat in a two seater which we didn't like the location and they quickly moved us. Started with the crab crostini which were amazing. Fresh and delicious. We then had the wedge salad with prosciutto which was equally as amazing. It was crisp and fresh yet again. I had the pork chop which was tender and my girlfriend had the short rib ravioli which were fresh and homemade. The dessert was the only part that we could have done without. We got the peanut butter chocolate parfait. Every other part of the meal was simply amazing! Worth every dollar. Love that its BYOB too. HIGHLY recommend.
