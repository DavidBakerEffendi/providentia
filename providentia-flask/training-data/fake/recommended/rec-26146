Lost my business!  I've ordered delivery from here many times, but will no longer after my experience tonight.  Madeline, who answered the phone, was rude and abrupt.  I said at the beginning of the call that I wanted to put it on my credit card.  When I gave the number, she interrupted me, saying "we don't take debit cards!".  I tell her it's a Visa.  "is there a debit logo?" she snaps at me.  "Yes, but it's a Visa also, I've used it for all my past orders".  She got defensive and claims there's a big sign at the register saying this, and the owner told them not to take debit cards because there is an extra charge.  Well, I've never been there, but I've called orders in, with this card that can be processed as a VISA.   She's still not getting that it can be processed at EITHER a debit card or VISA credit card. "Okay, so can you add that charge to my bill then?" I ask, trying to remedy the situation and get dinner.  Nope, she doesn't know what the charge is, how to do it... I ask to speak to the owner.  "Vinny's not here".  I asked if this was worth losing a customer, especially in a town with a million pizza places.  She was non-responsive.  "I guess I'll have to cancel the order" was met with "okay". If you are going to accept credit cards and use a merchant account, it's good customer relations to absorb the extra charge for debit cards.  But I understand it might be a burden on a small business, which I believe in supporting.  When I'm asked "debit or credit" at a small business, I always answer, "whatever is best for you".  But Madeline and Pizza Masters didn't even give me that chance.
