Horrible experience. Two of my friends and I went to meet up with friends that were already at Pennsylvannia 6 and when we arrived we were asked to wait outside unless we were with a party inside due to capacity limits.  While we waited the bouncer processed to let many other women and men in.  When I looked in the upstairs was empty and the downstairs bar area was on the crowded side.  I then asked the bouncer what capacity size was due to many people leaving and him letting other people in that were not in line.  He then proceeded to advise us that we were not getting in and I asked why and he said because I said so.  I then asked to speak to a manager and he ignored me.  This establishment is very unprofessional and rude to patrons. Hospitality is not part of what they serve up.
