My fianc√© and I had looked on Yelp a few days before going to Philly to look for great places to eat near our hotel and the attractions we were going to visit. We planned on going to the Eastern State Penitentiary (it's a museum, not a working prison) and Rybread was undoubtedly the best food in the area from what we saw. We loved it there so much that ate breakfast and then came back for lunch! We both ate Bacon, Egg & Cheese sandwiches on bagels. I am a sucker for a good bacon, egg & cheese and this is easily the best I have ever eaten. Nothing like the mass processed crappy eggs you'd get at Dunkin Donuts or big doughy bagels - they scramble the eggs fresh for you, the bagels are baked fresh, and it was toasted just right. For lunch, I ate the San Fran panini. After the first bite, the only thing I could think of was "I need a panini press at home." The blend of prosciutto, mozarella cheese, roasted roma tomatoes, and pesto was unbelievably delicious! I still think about this panini a few times a week since I was at Rybread. Bottom line - the food is absolutely delicious, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. I only wish that the location was close to my house in CT so I could go there 5 times a week!
