I went with a gluten-free friend, and we were all decidedly disappointed by the food.  Don't get me wrong: it was okay, but there's so much great pasta in New York that I feel no need at all to go back. I'm torn between giving it two stars and three because while the service was friendly and excellent, I was disappointed that they charged my gluten-free friend extra for her bread. Surely the miniature gluten-free sticks don't cost them that much more than the slices we received?  And, of course, it has gluten-free options, which is a major plus for many people.
