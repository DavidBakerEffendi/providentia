I can see why people like this place. The atmosphere is definitely nicer than shake shack, though the prices are also much higher. However, while the Truffle Burger and the 5 spice duck burger (a little too sweet) are tasty, they are also way rich and a bit one note on taste. Would it kill them to put some greens on the burger? I came away from this place feeling a bit ill. Sorry Umami, I'm still sticking with Shake Shack and Father's office in LA!
