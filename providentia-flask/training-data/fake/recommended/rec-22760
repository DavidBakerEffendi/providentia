This is it folks - real Chinese food recently opened in West Hartford near A Dong. The food here cannot be compared with any of the other Chinese restaurants in the Greater Hartford region which typically offer sugary, deep-fried "Americanized" dishes with utterly boring spice regimens.   For those unfamiliar with Szechuan peppers it's important to note that they will numb your mouth and cause a buzzing/tingling sensation.  All three dishes that we ordered were covered it them which made for a fun and different culinary experience.  But at times we felt like we were running a marathon due to the sensation we were feeling in our mouths. Strongly recommend Wanxiang Fried Fish, Napa Fish, Twice-Cooked pork. Photos were from their website.
