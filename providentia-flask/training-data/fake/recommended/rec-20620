"Get your HOT DIGGITY DAWG" Not for the skiddish, if you are, you might want to ask a friend to go and pick your order up for you. Lets just say its not fine dinning, but wait the hot dogs are the best you will ever have. Why is it so good you ask! First they fry them, i ask for well done or if you wanna be cool you can say "gimme 2 wellers". Second they have these jars of relish sour crout mixture thats just great. Put that on a bun and you got the real thing going on. But hey its CHEAP FAST and DANG GOOD!!!!! Might be hard to find but its off of rt 3 and you may pass it thinking its some type of factory but that Rutt's baby. One can also get NJ fav.. Disco Fries BABY, basically that french fries with brown gravy and cheese.. i know your already drooling.(not the best Disco Fries but you get the idea) Personally i love hitting this place up on my way to NYC from NJ especially if I'm about to have a night out... skip those dirty water dogs from the NYC vendor and get the real deal with RUTT'S HUTS
