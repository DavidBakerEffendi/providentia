Preliminary note to the hipsters obstructing my path to the counter: I am not afraid to bust ya heads. True, I may not look gangster, but when I wake up on a Sunday morning, and grumpily head over to Clinton St. Baking Company to pick up my TAKEOUT ORDER in my shorts and sweater, I don't need dirty looks from you, and I certainly don't need you standing there, stupidly, gazing like a retarded walrus at me. Â Yeah fools, I live nearby, and I can order this delicious food and take it to my home, where I will laugh at you for waiting 60-75 minutes for a pancake while I lick maple butter and sugar-cured bacon crumbs off my fingertips. Onto the review: yes, this place is all that and more when it comes to brunch. The pancakes are divine, and the Spanish Scramble is indeed an omelet par excellence. Hell, even that weird biscuit sandwich thing is good. Everything is good. If you come here for brunch and arbitrarily select 3 things from the menu, you will leave happy, guaranteed. I wish I could build a Houdini-like torture apparatus of their sugar-cured bacon, and then proceed to eat my way out of it. BUT BRING A LOT OF CASH. It's expensive, and inexplicably, Clinton St. leaves its credit card machine off during the day, so their breakfast/brunch biz is a cash-only enterprise (really inexcusable/inconvenient for a place like this). Dinner is pretty good (and they take credit cards). The menu changes a bit, but the burgers, sandwiches, and shrimp and grits are all mainstays, and are all quite good. Dinner is (for obvious reasons) a much less frantic experience than brunch.
