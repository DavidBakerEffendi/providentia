I've always been a fan of BXL Cafe.  Belgium beer and mussels.  What is there to complain about? When BXL East opened up, I was ecstatic.  Took a few colleagues here for drinks and dinner: - Fried Calamari - Mussels (Provencale - Tomato, Garlic and Fresh Basil) - Boulettes de Viande Sauce Tomate (Belgian style meat balls with fries) - Boucheé a la Reine (Puff pastry with chicken, mushroom and bacon in a cream sauce) Atmosphere seemed cleaner - not as grungy as the Time Square location. On their DRAFT beer list - there are 14 different Belgium beers.   I've tried every single one of them....... *sigh* MY FAVE?  Delerium Tremens! Other top beers: - Duvel Green - Tripel Karmeliet - Cuvee BXL
