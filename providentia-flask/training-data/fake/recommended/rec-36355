Memorable...but in a bad way I went to landmarc yesterday and was not very pleased Appetizers: bone marrow- this was the first time i tried bone marrow, so its just not to my liking. It just felt like buttering up fat onto my burnt bread Salmon carpaccio- tasteless. I had to sprinkle a good amount of salt to taste anything plus it was way too oily! Appetizers were alright, so I was looking forward to the entree to maybe live up to the 4 stars yelp had for this restaurant and I was extremely disappointed! I ordered the filet mignon. It came to my table and I saw my filet was cut right in the middle. This was the first time I've ever had a chef cut my piece of steak to see if it was cooked enough and sent it out. WORST part was that it was still RARE! I like my steak medium rare but this steak was cold and not even a little bit cooked. So they threw it back on to the grill for me took about a minute. The refired filet came back this time and just looked like burnt, dried meat. I wasnt looking forward to it but kept an open mind that hopefully some parts of the meat was good. Sadly the first bite all i could taste is burnt meat. Poorly seasoned as well. I poured my shallot sauce all over it but it could not save the burnt taste of the meat. This was absolutely the worse steak I've eaten basically because it was inedible. Chain restaurants do better with steak than Landmarc, which destroyed the integrity of a beautiful cut of steak. My friend ordered the salmon and was overcooked. However the corn was delicious. Mussels were ordered as well, they were pretty good but pretty simple white wine parsley sauce. Overall, will never return! BURNT bread and filet mignon! Oh and I smelled like smoke after leaving the restaurant because they were apparently burning everything that was on the grill that was situated within the dining room.
