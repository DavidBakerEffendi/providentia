Since everyone is gonna harp on the (amazing) chicken I will just go off on the COLLARD GREEEEENS.   Ooooh.  oh girl.  They have this  little bit of smokey meets  tang flavor that made my taste buds rejoice. Oh -- and the cornbread has the delicious top layer that is just amazing.  I can't even describe it - but it's magical. My soul is full of food.   Goooooood soul food.   #blessed.
