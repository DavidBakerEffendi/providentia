I've eaten at Ghandi (mostly take-out/delivery) for four years. The service has remained very good but the freshness of the food served has declined. On several recent orders, the Tandoori chicken was reheated and dry, the rice was burned, and the saut√©ed veggies were soggy. I hope the new management will reset the food quality to what it was before the sweet elderly couple left.
