First night back in New York and drunk, where to? 53rd and 6th! Chicken and rice plate!  Pour it up with some white saaucee!  Put a few drops of the red hot sauce on that sucker and you're GOOD TO GO!  I really wish more drunken nights could end with some chicken and rice from this cart but alas... that would be a 1,552 mile trip that well, WOULD BE SO WORTH IT!! I really don't know what else to tell you that hasn't already been said.  Thank you Halal Cart!
