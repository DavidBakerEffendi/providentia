My husband and I are HUGE Wheeler's fans. The food is made fresh on site so the meals are incredible, delicious and wholesome. The weekend brunch is absolutely delicious. My husband's favorite is the chicken and waffles. The ambiance is even better than the food. Very artsy and open. Have work to do? Grab a coffee and sit Â on the couch in the lounge area by the fireplace. Free wifi, too.
