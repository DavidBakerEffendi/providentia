Wow...my fiance and I stopped into this little treasure after seeing a show nearby.  The prices are fantastic and the empanadas are even better.  I tried the viagra (seafood medley) and the tjc (tuna, cheese and jalapenos); my honey got the spicy chicken and pepperoni pizza and loved them both...so much so that he decided to scrap his plans to get a dessert empanada and go for round 2 with the spicy chicken.  It's a very cozy restaurant but that seems to add to the fun.  My only complaints: (1) the veggie-friendly options are pretty scant so strict vegetarians might not fare terribly well here; and (2) for some reason, opting for (ordinarily cheap) toppings for a dessert empanada costs more than most of the empanadas themselves.  $2.75 for chocolate syrup on a $2.70 empanada?! Really?   Oh...and try the Romeo & Juliet dessert empanada.  Pure. Heaven.
