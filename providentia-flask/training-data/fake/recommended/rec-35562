First thing I ate when I arrived Philadelphia was, of course, the cheese steak at Pat's. That was a huge disappointment. One of the locals recommended me to go to this place, stating that locals only eat cheese steak once a year when they are drunk. Not sure how true that statement is but the sandwiches here sure are delicious. The sandwiches here are juicy and flavourful. Adding the pepper (or broccoli with garlic), sharp provolone cheese makes the already perfect sandwiches even better. Adding that horseradish on top... 5 star for sure. Definitely come and try the pull pork and beef brisket sandwiches. The only way you will regret while leaving this place is not ordering enough sandwiches.
