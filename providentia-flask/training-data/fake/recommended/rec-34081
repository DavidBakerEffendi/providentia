I was spoiled by the quality of Japanese cuisine available during my tenure in Los Angeles, so I don't really share the same enthusiasm for Momo as many Yelpers seem to. Overall, it's a decent Japanese place for NYC, and a pretty good one for this neighborhood. If you're familiar with Samurai Mama in Williamsburg, it's evident that this is a sister restaurant: long communal tables, similar menu design, even the avocado is cut into the same pattern. An interesting dish I had was the tofu salad, which uses a tofu made at the restaurant. It has a dense and creamy texture, much like Laughing Cow cheese, with a very subtle flavor.
