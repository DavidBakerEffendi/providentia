I've been to El Vez a couple of times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. I didn't notice any big differences in the menu, but the space is definitely a LOT louder at dinner. I was surprised that there are a few vegan items on the menu and some that are easily made vegan with the exclusion of cheese. Also, the guacamole is amazing! It's a fun spot for a night out or a lunch with coworkers, but I don't think its good for date night.
