I work in midtown and while there are a lot of places to eat, there aren't a lot of good, reasonably priced options IMO. Here's one. The food is good to wow great. All freshly made. I had the egg white burrito today with cheddar and avocado and it was extremely tasty. I've also had the burrito bowl with chipotle shredded chicken, which was awesome as well. Today, I'm trying one of their burgers. Normally I'm not a burger guy at lunch but I've seen them making them and they look GOOD. (I noticed that they use two patties instead of one--reason being is they stay juicier that way--or so I'm told.) We'll see with a test later today.
