I love Lidia Bastianich.  I love watching her cook and I love a successful attempt at trying her recipes.  This is why I wanted to try one of her restaurants. It is packed especially before a Broadway show.  But if you go and dine leisurely, it feel you'll get to enjoy all the food they have to offer. I almost filled up on the breadbasket.  We wanted to try so many things, but I was really craving for pasta.  They have the unlimited 3 daily pasta available.  I had 3 helping and I was done. Their  wine list is extensive with different ranges of pricing.  I was so overwhelmed with choices, the waitress asked what our preferences were and she recommended a bunch of them. I was glad the train I needed was a nice walk away because I needed to walk off all the delicious food I packed in.
