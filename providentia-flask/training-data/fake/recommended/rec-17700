These tacos are so good!! I had two sweet potato tacos and thought they might not be enough, so I also ordered a side of chips and guac. The two tacos ended up being so filling that we shared the [huge portion of] chips and guac among five of us at the table. I usually like sweet potatos but honestly wasn't a huge fan of them in tacos, and I wish there were more vegetarian options. All of the ingredients tasted very fresh and the chips were perfectly crispy and obviously made in-house, which I appreciated. I'd come back if I was in the area!
