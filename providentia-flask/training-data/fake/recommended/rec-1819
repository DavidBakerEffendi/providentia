Was in town on business and figured I'd check this off my "Eating Tour of America" list.  I got the "Whiz with" and it was a pretty good sandwich.  Was it worth $9?  No- but then again, that's part of the price for saying that you've had one of their cheese steaks.  I wish I would have had the appetite to run over to Pat's and do a comparison.
