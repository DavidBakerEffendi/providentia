Went here on a Sunday morning at 11. At that time the wait for 3 was about 1.5 hours, which is bonkers but with so many people walking away when hearinfg that, I thought we'd be okay and maybe it was a little overstatement. Nope. 12:30 we finally sat (at least they were accurate). The place is really cute, and I think is so busy because there are really not many other options in the area, and I can't help but think in that area, there's an after-church crowd hogging all the good seats. Whatever. We finally sat and the menu looked good but sadly me and my eating mates have some dietary restrictions, so I did not get nutella french toast, i ended up with an omelet that was about as good as omelets go. Nothing to rave about. Friends got the Veggie meets sally salad, and it looked delicious and hse loved it, other friend got the BLT and she killed that thing, so I assume it was delicious. Her fries looked better than my homefries. All in all, my meal was meh (though the prix fixe came with coffee AND juice, nice perk), but overall it was good food and a nice place, just not sure it's worth the 1.5 hour wait. Maybe go to church beforehand and the good lord will reward you with a table. I wouldn't know.
