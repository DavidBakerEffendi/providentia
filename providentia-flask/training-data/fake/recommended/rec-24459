The food here is amazing! In a totally chill atmosphere! The catfish sandwich is super crispy and light! So delicious! I also loved the jabalaya, is the best that I've had, and this comes from someone who's spent a week in New Orleans! It's filled with seafood and meat! The rice to stuff proportion is divine!
