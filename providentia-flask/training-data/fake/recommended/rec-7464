What a great little bar tucked away oh Hoyt. We stopped in for a whiskey before heading to the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare and were pleasantly surprised at Â their menu. The staff was so much fun and very communicative and they had everything we wanted behind the bar. I hear the lamb burger can't be missed!
