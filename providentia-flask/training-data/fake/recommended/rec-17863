I was around New Jersey, and we've decided to eat here because there are a lot of stars and reviews. The service was great. People were nice. However, the food. The food didn't do the stars any justice. Sure, they give a large portion of food, but it's nasty, tasteless, and dry. My sister asked for a spicy dish, but it was sweet. The meat was dry. I would not come here again. It wasn't that good.
