Went for Taste of Hartford last night and was very impressed!  The food was great for both a sushi lover and a non-eater of sushi.  The service could not possibly have been faster.  It is quite energetically loud in there because of all the hard surfaces, so be ready for that, but ToH was a big success for us.
