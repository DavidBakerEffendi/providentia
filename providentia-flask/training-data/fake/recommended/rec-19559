No crepe/crap jokes here, folks. I have legitimate cravings for the Prosciutto di Parma. Salty prosciutto, creamy ricotta, a little bit of bitter tang from the arugula, and smooth buckwheat crepe. The Country Herb Chicken selection is also fantastic (and puts the greens on the side). The short Rib one is definitely next on my to-try list, if only I could stop ordering the Prosciutto. You can't go wrong with any of the dessert crepes, but I have a particular fondness for any kind of fruit and Nutella. It is a tiny place, but I've been lucky so far with seating, great service, and speedy crepe-making.
