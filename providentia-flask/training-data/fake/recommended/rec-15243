Fine dining in a comfortable setting. Start to finish our meal was outstanding. My husband and I love trying new places so we tend to splurge when we have the chance. We started with the oysters, served raw with a delicious citrus mignonette, followed by the sea urchin which had the most amazing fresh ocean flavor. Next was my favorite course, a special that night, chicken liver on sourdough with caramelized onions.
