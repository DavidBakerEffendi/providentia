I moved to Mountain Lakes 4 weeks ago and have been to The Station 3 times already and I must say it's my new neighborhood joint (Hapgoods is a very close #2).   In each instance the staff have been great and the owner has made a point to say hello each time and by the 3rd visit he knows us by sight. So my first visit was with my wife and I had a very well cooked medium steak - they even did a Pittsburgh char - and I had zero complaints (the scalloped potatoes are INSANELY good). My second visit was with the wife and 4 kids (my 3 and a friend) and again everything was good.  In fact, I had their Kobe burger and it was one of the next burgers I've ever had and I've had 100s. In fact, I was so in love with it that I didn't even realize it had no cheese until a few days after.  It tasted so good without it despite me always getting cheese. The 3rd - most recent - visit also had great food - I had awesome ribs - but service was VERY slow and it took almost an hour to get dinner despite it only being 1/3 full. They also gave my wife a very rare burger when she asked for medium-well. The owner and server were extremely apologetic and in the end they comp'd the burger and desserts so it was OK. We are hoping this was an anomaly since we really want this place to be where we go weekly to get away from the kids for a bit.
