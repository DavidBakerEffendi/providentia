Excited to try this after being let down by pommes frites (overcooked frite fragments and gross sauces) REALLY REALLY satisfied! Everything pommes frites missed the mark on, la frite nailed. Perfectly cooked, long frites, well seasoned and irresistibly sauced. Saffron garlic aioli and spinach kale mayo are incredible. Looking forward to trying all the others and their soups and sliders. Best of all, no line and an awesome location blocks away from NYU. La frite I love you.
