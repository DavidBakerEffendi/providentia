Would make sense that the best French Restaurant that I've been to would serve the best French Martini! We felt that we were dining in Paris. The setting was exquisitely decorated to the epitome of a French Bistro. This place attracted the more colorful and fun crowd; celebs, models, tourists and regulars alike. I had the steak and pommes frite, an unusual choice for such a fancy restaurant. However, it was a treat prepared to perfection. We shared the seafood tray and creme brulee. Â It was such a romantic ad whimsical experience.
