This is the go-to place for burritos in Market East. It has the consistent quality of a Qdoda or a Chipotle but to me the food is infinitely better, fresher, and more abundant. The burritos at this spot are generously stuffed with lots of yum. Nowadays I don't eat meat so the veggie burrito is where it's at for me but I had the chicken back in my carnivorous days and it was awesome with just the right amount of heat. Be sure to get here right before the lunch rush - 11:45 seems to do it -- or you'll definitely be greeted at the door, by the line. It goes quick but I prefer to avoid the hassle. There isn't much seating so save this one for a day where you don't mind hoofing it over to one of the many green spaces in the area and pulling up a patch of grass. Happy burrito-ing!
