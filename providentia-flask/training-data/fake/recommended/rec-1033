I love the "Ok Produce" market here at reading terminal. I make the trip every single weekend just to go there. I can spend $10-$15 there and come back with enough produce, Fresh fruits and vegetables to last me for WEEKS. It would cost me 3X that much at the grocery store. Plus the people are super friendly. The other places in the terminal are great too. Awesome bakery shops and candy shops, excellent ice cream shops plus the Amish are there on certain days and they have the BEST goods and products. Overall, i love coming here with any out of towers and they also leave feeling satisfied.
