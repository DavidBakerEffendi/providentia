Newest update 3/15/14: Service has gotten better and I like the new menu items. I've also gotten used to the prices. For all of my earlier gripes, I can't deny that I keep coming back here again and again. The chef rules, they're always mixing it up with creative and fresh specials and desserts, and they keep me drooling with facebook photos of all their latest dishes. Â Zizi, you've won me back!
