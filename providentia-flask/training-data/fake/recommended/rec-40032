Yes. This establishment serves the best moules I've ever had! With that said, my friend and I ordered the Dijon moules and moules with bacon and potatoes. Dijon moules, definitely a must-order. It's different than the traditional herb+wine mix. The moules are plump and delicious. They also have an extensive list of beers. Didn't know what to go for, so we asked for recommendations. Ended up ordering something called a "Dirty Ho" ("Dirty Hoe"??) which consists of Hoegaarden and Framboise beer. Extremely good combo. Service was great. Our waitress gave good recommendations and was extremely friendly. Would definitely come back again to try the other flavors of moules. Also, upstairs was more empty, but quite intimate.
