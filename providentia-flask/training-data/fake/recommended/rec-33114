Becco gets five stars as a pre-theatre restaurant option.  I've been probably 10 times and only once was it not before a show.  If you're just looking for a place for dinner I would say the food is 3.5 stars maybe pushed up to 4 by the service and huge list of $25 bottles of wine.  You do need to book a few weeks in advance for the pre-theatre 5:30-6:30 window. We always opt for the unlimited 3-pasta special.  It comes with a salad or antipasti for around $26.  Servers walk around with huge saute pans of the pasta and serve you Rodizio style until you've had enough.  It allows you get in and out quickly and, most importantly, the pastas are always fresh and delicious.  It should also be noted how accommodating they are.  There is typically one pasta with meat and they are happy to specially make a small dish of it vegetarian. In addition to the army of servers and waiters, there is always a couple of managers walking around (the restaurant is has several rooms and is deceptively huge).  The one time I can actually recall having an issue with service, one of the managers took care of it immediately and painlessly. The most important indicator for me is that we keep going back.  As soon as I book theatre tickets I immediately make a reservation here.  To me there is no better option in the theatre district.
