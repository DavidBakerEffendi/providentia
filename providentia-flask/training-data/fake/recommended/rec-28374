If you are looking for a place that gives you the vibe that you are IN Italy, this is really it.  I get smiley just thinking about it. The aroma in this place is intoxicating.  All of the dishes I have had were perfectly prepared.  Service has always been attentive, nice, and European but not in a "I'm gonna treat you like crap" sort of way.   Prices are not crazy for the area either.  Again, this is the kind of place that reminds me of being in Rome - on more of the smaller side streets that is :)
