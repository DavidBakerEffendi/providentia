The food was really delicious, just walking in you knew you were going to eat well. While the restaurant is small, really a storefront, it just adds to it's charm. We had the steamed dumplings, egg rolls, pad Thai, and ba mee. The appetizers were incredible, definitely some of the best I've ever had. You need to add lemon to the pad Thai, but then the flavors are all perfect. The ba mee was excellent and the pork was soft and moist.
