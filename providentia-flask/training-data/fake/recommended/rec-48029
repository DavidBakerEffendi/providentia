I recently brought my bf to PT for his birthday dinner and couldn't be happier about the whole experience. They seated us in the garden in a quiet area and brought an ice bucket for our champagne right away (corkage fee $20, totally worth it). We started with the mixed meat and cheese plate which was all imported from Italy, it was delicious. Their bread and olive oil were great too which says a lot in my opinion. We had the PT salad which was light and refreshing with the lemon dressing and mango. I had the shrimp and ricotta ravioli, it was the special that night and they were amazing! My bf had the branzino with a potato crust, the crust was very good, crispy and seasoned with rosemary. Our server left us in peace and spaced out the meals which made the night last just long enough, like in Italy. There seemed to be a few large parties, one of them outside was smoking, and that was really annoying but beyond that PT was outstanding!
