A veggie-friendly BBQ place.  Also near the rock gym.  What can possibly go wrong?  Not too much. The veggie wings are awesome; whatever seitan recipe they have here works.  I liked the beef short ribs as well, and the margaritas are tasty. The only caveat is to sit outside, even if the "piazza" nearby has the feel of a dorm.  It's a bit loud inside.
