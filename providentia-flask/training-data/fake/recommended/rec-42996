A tough reservation to get, but our company had an in (thank goodness). Ate at 11:30 on a Friday night, and it felt like an old supper club, or something out of Big Night.   Fabulous martinis, bone marrow, pate, pork, and apparently wine that never stopped flowing.  We really liked the laid back service, and had a terrific evening catching up with dear friends in a loud room with a lot of history.  I just loved it!!  A great New York supper dining experience.   The reviews speak for themselves.  This place is a winner.
