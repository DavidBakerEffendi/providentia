The cold waited until early evening and it had been raining all day, heavily; even wet was looking for a place to stay warm and dry.  I was meeting a friend and a friend's friend for dinner at Caffe Linda to give advice on a technical business plan. I have not been here before this night but my friend dines here often.  What a pleasant surprise when I walked inside this charming and delightful setting.  It felt like places I have been to in Europe.  I met the friend of the friend and we were seated at a comfortable banquette table and I immediately placed myself into the corner, the walls around me like a blanket to warm up.  It also gave me a great vantage point to see and study this place.  I really like this place. The owner operator, host, waiter is a delightful guy (Claudio) will make your evening enchanting.  This is a no rush, stay late kind of place (we were here for 4 hours) a place you never want to leave. The service is impeccable, friendly and professional, yet relaxed as a tapas of assorted bruschetta arrived (yummy).  Below is the menu we chose.  All of it wonderful. WINE  : Barbella - I did not see the vineyard or vintage, but it was smooth and delicious SALAD : Greens, Walnuts, Gorgonzola & Apples Salad ($12) ENTREES : Homemade Gnocchi served with Bolognese sauce. ($18) : Chicken Paillard served with herbs and balsamic vinegar. ($20) : Veal Scaloppine served with white wine and lemon sauce. ($24) DESSERTS : Tartufo Al Cioccolato a delicious combination of milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream dusted with hazelnuts and cocoa powder.       : Homemade Tiramisu a classic Italian dessert with layers of lady fingers dipped in espresso coffee and mascarpone cheese. It was such a perfect evening, that even in the cold rain, I did not mind my walk home.
