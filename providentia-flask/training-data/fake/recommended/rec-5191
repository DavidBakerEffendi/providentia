***** Cash Only***** First of the bat, wasn't aware its a cash only business (there's a bank few feet away with an ATM, will charge $2 Fee). Wife and i split 2 sandwiches, the ever popular Paesano and Daddy Wad. Both sandwiches very phenomenal, but if i had to choose, i would definitely go with The Paesano with the must have sandwich at this place. The way the brisket, fried egg, roasted tomatoes, pepperoncino, sharp provolone and their horseradish/mayo concoction are married to that sesame roll is like a symphony. From the first bite you'll know you are hooked. Everything is fused together and plays very well. As with the Daddy Wad sandwich, you can taste the love in every bite. We also had Potato Arrosto, i can't really leave a review on them as the portion was way too small, Â from what we had, it was good, but definitely felt robbed. So, why the 4 stars and not 5? Few things, first,place looks like a shack in a half way home. When i say there's limited space to eat, i mean there are probably like 6 chairs around the counter where you can sit. Thats it. And the major challenge is devouring this sandwich before it gets way too soggy to enjoy.... If you take your time eating the sandwiches, your last two to three bites will be a watery-bread-meat-cereal mess. So, i can not see how people would order take out, unless you ask for it sahara dry and liquids on the side. And as i mentioned earlier, the potato side was definitely fit for 2-3 teaser small bites. Otherwise, this place is a gem. Its what Philly is all about, tough/rough/hard exterior with a loving, mouth watering, soul good feeling, interior.
