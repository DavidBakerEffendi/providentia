Went here based on Craig LeBan's 2 bell review. Ordered very simply: The bbcue and smoked half chicken w/ corn salad, and beans. Also had the fried shrimp and a cocktail. Everything was very good except the chicken - the inside was still raw. Whatever happened to using a thermometer? The inside couldn't have been cooked to any more than 120 degrees. The staff did their best to apologize and brought out extra corn salad (really good too), bread and a comped drink. It took over 15 minutes to get the chicken cooked and back on the table - however there were still undercooked areas that I stayed away from eating. Big bummer of an experience. Whoever was cooking that night was not on the ball or doesn't know basic cooking skills.
