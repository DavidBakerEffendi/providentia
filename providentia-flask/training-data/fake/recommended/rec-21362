Gross, overpriced and cash only. Beef lo mein and a soda (mostly ice) = $8.48!!!  I get that it's in a city, but wow... Cash only - I don't really carry cash unless I know I'm in going to somewhere that does not take credit cards.  I did not figure one of those places would be in a food court in the middle of Hartford!  Thankfully, my friend had a couple dollars to spare as I came up short. The beef lo mein - I beleive the beef was cooked to order as it took a couple minutes.  The beef was actually decent.  The lo mein was extremely greasy.  I picked out and ate the beef and tossed out the rest of my nearly $9 meal... Should have known as there was a line at every other restaurant in the food court except this place...
