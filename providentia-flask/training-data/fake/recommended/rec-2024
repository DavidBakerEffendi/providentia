Well, here is another three star rating and this is why . I am a native Californian so I can picture it already. "EY, Waddayanow about steaks?" Well, l may not know cheesesteaks, but I know what I like. I did like the sandwich, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. It had good flavor, and I loved the onions. I ordered it "wizz, wit" and I was surprised how FAST they get things done. I also got the cheese fries and a drink. All in all it was around $15 (!) and I ate it right there on the benches. Yes, it was cold with the wind blowing. The best way I can describe it is to draw a parallel observation with another LA landmark that people rave and fawn over. King Taco. Sure, they make good food. Sure they serve tons of customers every night and are rather well known. Sure they make GREAT late night stops. However, late night munchies are not really the best way to judge foodstuffs. Perhaps being soaked in booze from late night carousing adds to the overall experience. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just in the same way I like King Taco, I liked Geno's. I however, have had better cheesesteaks. So far, the best cheesesteak I have had in the US was at Moochie's in Salt Lake City. It is not blasphemy, and it in no way takes Geno's down for what it is. A pioneer in the field of cheeseteaks with a history only perhaps one other restaurant can rival. That rivalry I am sure also adds to the legend. Still, 3 stars for the food. -Subject to change based on intoxication-
