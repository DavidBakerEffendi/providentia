I read all the wonderful reviews and I went there leaving all other restaurant because I like trying new places and being only one of its kind, I really support them. I was geared up and excited to eat some seafood. So, with huge excitement and hunger i order lobster bisque and lobster roll. I get a ticket and I wait outside and roam around. I get the food and I was like I can't wait to have a bite. I taste the bisque....and i was what the hell is this?? It had no flavor, very oily and creamy and barely any lobster. So, I was like ohh man maybe its one of their bad days....lets try the lobster roll and I was again disappointed....I had heart burn all night eating so creamy and oily food. Thank God Tums were there for my rescue. Also, remember they don't accept credit cards, have some cash if you go.
