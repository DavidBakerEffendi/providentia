Went here with a big group post kickball victory, and we were all pretty excited about this spot.   There isn't a wait staff, so you go to different windows to order beer and food - big plus if you are really impatient and don't want to sit for even one minute with a sad looking empty glass, big negative if you are lazy and like to be waited on.  I am both - but given the short distance to the beer window, I think I'll count it as a plus!   The beer selection was pretty good - not a huge selection of drafts, but a good variety.  I will definitely be back a few more times before it gets too cold.....
