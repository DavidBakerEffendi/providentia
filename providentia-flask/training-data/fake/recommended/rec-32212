We were seated at the most awkward 2 person table in the whole restaurant... jammed between a party table and a pole... my boyfriend had to walk around 2 other tables just to get to his side of the table. The server and food runner's had a hard time getting to our table. Aside from that, it was amazing. The service was the best I've had. The server was attentive and offered suggestions and checked on us enough time to be consistent, but not annoying. She was kind and patient and described each meal so we weren't in for any surprises. Everything was perfectly cooked. Great date spot if you can get a not awkward table.
