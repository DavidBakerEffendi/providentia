My absolute favorite spot in the West Village. It's the kind of place where you walk in and you can tell it's a second home to half the people in there. I came once by myself for a glass of wine and a snack at the bar and ended up talking to the bartender and the cool lady next to me for a couple of hours. I had so much fun that I came back with some friends for dinner. The menu is full of different choices, from pub fare to fancier entrees. We shared a bunch of stuff, all excellent. My favorites were the hanger steak (Tastes like Paris to me!) and the seared tuna club, and the enormous Cobb salad we all shared. The wine list is reasonably priced and really diverse, and there is a lava cake that I would happily die for. Service was effortlessly friendly, had a lovely Irish lady taking care of us. Anyway, I love this cozy place and I can't wait to go back! Go there!
