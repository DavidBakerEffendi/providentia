Japanese restaurants are becoming prevalent in the area. However, there aren't that many that are authentic. In fact, in most Sushi joints are probably owned by people who does not even speak Japanese. Murasake, (means purple... yes, my date actually looked it up) the most authentic Sushi shop I've dined at in CT. The seafood was very fresh. They offer an extensive variety of sashimi which is very fresh and nicely cut by their Sushi chef (George) They even offer sea urchin and quail eggs. You don't see these kind of exotic options everywhere. The service was good. The interior design of the shop is original. I am impressed by this establishment and will return for more fresh cut sushi!!
