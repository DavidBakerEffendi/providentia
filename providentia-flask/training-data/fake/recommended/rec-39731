Yum yum yum yum yum!!!!! Thanks yelpers, I've found and fell in love with the best brunch in the village! Sooo I thought the brioche french toast was going to be a small portion since it included a cappuccino and an oj for only $12 (one of the brunch specials) so I also ordered the 2eggs, potatoes and toast for only $6! WOW it was NOT a small portion at all! the BEST french toast I think I've ever had! The cappuccino was perrrfect! the eggs and potatoes were excellent also I can't believe those two giant meals, including an oj and 2 capps only came out to $20!! unreal! The food is excellent!
