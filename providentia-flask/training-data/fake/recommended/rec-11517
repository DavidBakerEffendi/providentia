Excellent food for brunch, had the "farm to table" feel!  We were promptly seated arriving around 10:30 (get here early to beat the crowds!). Ordered the corned beef hash - they give you big, juicy, tender chunks of brisket meat and potatoes, with tons of flavor; one of my favorite versions of the dish!  Comes with two poached eggs, also perfectly cooked.  My friend ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, which was also very moist and flavorful.  We both left very, very full, but very satisfied!  Would be interested to come back during other times of the day as well (such as the Sunday Supper) if I'm ever back in the city!
