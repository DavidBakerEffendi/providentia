Just Jake's is your average bar and grill type place. Went to watch a soccer game- apparently there aren't too many places to do that in this area- and we ordered the chicken fingers and fries. The chicken fingers were overcooked and kind of weird-tasting, definitely wouldn't order them again, but the fries were great! We would go back just for the fries- thick-cut, potato-y steak fries. The service was slow, but our waitress was very friendly. I'm really only writing this review to tell everyone about the fries.
