In a random NJ strip mall sits Spice Grill.This is our second  visit  there.The restaurant is set up as a nice sit down eatery but they seem to do more takeout than dine in business.It lends to a confused atmosphere,as patrons come to pick up their take out as you sit at a candle lit table while kids are screaming  in the attached party room. It was disconcerting  to say the least. Out waiter actually  left our table mid order to answer the phone for a take out order!I was floored,as that has never happened  to me before. The food is definitely  the bright spot of this establishment. I would give the food a 4 and the service a 1.Our waiter never came back to check on us.The water guy was the only person on point as our water glasses were constantly  refilled. I had the tandoori chicken  which was great and my wife had the lamb.Like I stated before the food was authentic  and  tasty  but the atmosphere  and service were  lacking. The prices are moderate and I feel it's a good value.
