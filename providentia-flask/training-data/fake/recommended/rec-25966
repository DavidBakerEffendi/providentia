I've lived in East Williamsburg for almost a year and I'm kicking myself for not trying Nam Nam earlier! I came by here on a Tuesday afternoon with a friend to pick up a couple of their banh mi sandwiches and a small vietnamese iced coffee, which was perfect for the 90 degree weather we were having. I ordered the spicy roasted pork banh mi (I added pate for $1 because I love that stuff) and my friend got the chicken banh mi. Seating is practically non-existent (2 tiny tables inside) so I recommend ordering to go. That's what we did, and the sandwiches were still warm and delicious half an hour later. It's a little different from banh mis I've had in the past in that there was only shredded pickled carrot and one small sliver of pickled cucumber, no radish. I think radish would've tasted great in the sandwich, and was slightly disappointed there was none, but it was still delicious. A bit too much carrot for my liking, but I just picked some out. I had a bite of my friend's sandwich and that too was amazing. I convinced him to try mine, even though he doesn't really like pork and the thought of eating liver really grossed him out, and even he really liked it! For banh mi, it was a little bit on the pricy side ($5-$6 per), but you get a pretty big portion and lots of meat. Service was also pretty prompt. Took less than 10 minutes for our 2 sandwiches and iced coffee. Although I'm used to banh mi shops having your sandwiches ready before you're even done paying the $2.75 that it costs, but maybe that's too high of an expectation. I'm moving away from East Willyb in a couple weeks so I'll definitely be coming back for more before it's not a 10 minute walk from me anymore!
