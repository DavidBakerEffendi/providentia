Cookshop is my NY favorite! Took my gf for a special dinner, this place delivers. We had a cozy corner booth, the salads were fresh from the farm with delicious dressings, the scallops were over the top, chickpeas were a nice addition. Service from Andrew was courteous, friendly and attentive. Don't miss!
