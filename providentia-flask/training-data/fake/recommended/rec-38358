I don't give four stars often, but this place deserves it.  Fresh dumplings being served out of a food cart in the streets of Vermont (of all places)!  We got a dozen pork/chicken dumplings and finished them off easily.  These dumplings were not ones I'm accustomed to.  They had bigger, thicker skin, and more filling.  The lady (who was very friendly) told me this is Donbei (northeast China) style.  I'm not sure if they had vinegar or not, but that would have pushed the rating to five stars.
