Joey Fortunada, the chef/co-owner at this little W. 4th Street gem, has done a super job here with his partner Michele Gaton. Everything runs like quiet clockwork, even when you have to wait for a table (which you inevitably will, as reservations for parties of less than 6 aren't accepted). The food is simple and unpretentious, but full of smart flavor-pairings and fresh ingredients. Try the mushroom-crusted chicken - outstanding! Fries with gorgonzola sauce? Whoa! A lovely and price-conscious wine list will complement whatever you order. Snagging a seat at one of the charming sidewalk tables is extra special. And where else can you spot neighborhood celebs like Sam Shepard or Sarah Jessica propping elbows on the bar?
