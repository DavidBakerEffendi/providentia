Great little place! Rustic, charming, great service and a really well thought out menu. I had a delicious green bean dish to start that had goat cheese and hazelnuts. We were going all out so I had a shrimp pasta dish (pasta was beautifully cooked as were the shrimps) and the sea bass as a main - also amazing. My date had something else to start (he ate it quickly and I cant even remember what it looked like!) followed by gnocchi (some of the best he's had) and the scallops as a main. We shared a bottle of wine - it was a little less than perfect at first but letting it sit for a bit made all the difference. The service was the right balance - attentive enough but not too intrusive. It can be a bit loud inside and the tables are close together but Â its not terrible. Prices were reasonable too for potions and quality of the meal. We'd come here again the next time we are in town - it is worth it!
