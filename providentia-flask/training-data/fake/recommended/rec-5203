My favorite Sunday late morning breakfast spot in Ewing. They offer multiple choices (cajun shrimp, original, etc. of Eggs Benedict which are always cooked perfectly. My personal favorite is the cajun shrimp and grits! Nice portion of creamy grits topped w several cajun shrimp and a small poached egg. The spice on the shrimp is bitey without over powering. I've also had the frittata, pancakes, Benedicts all were tasty. Make sure to also get a glass of guava juice with your coffee.
