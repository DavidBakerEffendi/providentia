Amazing place for $5 meals.  Menu is quality over quantity, as there are really only three entree options at this point in time (each containing 4 variations), and all are great choices.  Good bubble tea and authentic ingredients (including vietnamese coffee).  Large portions too.   Also, my go-to spot for wifi.  The people working there are super nice and accommodating, I feel totally comfortable hanging out at a table for a while using wifi, and a lot less traffic/competition for a table than a cafe or a coffee shop in the area would be.
