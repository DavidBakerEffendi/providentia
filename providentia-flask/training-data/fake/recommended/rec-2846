We love the Cedar Point Bar and Kitchen. Great atmosphere, impeccable service, very well served portions and very good quality, a designated restaurant for all meals of the cafe in the morning for dinner. The belgian waffles with strawberries is simply divine. When in Philadelphia, do not miss, super recommend.
