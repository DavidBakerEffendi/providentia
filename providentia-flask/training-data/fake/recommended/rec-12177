Favorite restaurant! The food is delicious. Try the baked ricotta, it's light and airy paired with an amazing grilled bread. Don't forget the dandelion salad. The combination of the bitter dandelion and the sweet peach is a flavor explosion. The portions are smaller so feel free to order a few types of apps and pastas. Delicious! The service is fantastic, you can tell that the staff is excited about the menu, the food, the entire atmosphere. Parking is right next store, can't beat it!
