I went here last night and I was so upset. I am not a picky person but this waitress was so rude. She was so rude to us it was just so awkward and really killed the atmosphere for us. The food wasn't bad but it definitely was not good! I still can't believe how rude and awful the waitress was. I will never go back in here and this restaurant does NOT deserve anyone's business.
