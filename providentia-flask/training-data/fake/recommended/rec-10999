I've been waiting a long time for a great pizza place in my part of Philly.  The people at Bufad, from the owner to the pizza chief, know what they're doing.  Two pizzas for two people is a lot of food (I guess that explains the name).  One pizza and two appetizers will do the job.  So far everything I've tried has been outstanding.
