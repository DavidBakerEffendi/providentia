I've had some very pleasant meals here in the past, but taking my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day was a mistake. In terms of ambiance, the lights were too bright, the music too low, and the door had no curtain surrounding it, so it was frigid inside. There were about 15 menu options to choose from, however, the kitchen seemed to be waiting for a bunch of orders of each thing before making it. And then they would just make 20 plates of pork or something and send it all out, so the whole restaurant was essentially eating the same things at all the same times.It felt a lot like a factory production or a cafeteria. And the food itself was lacking in so many ways. No love in it at all. I have enjoyed this place in the past, but I do not think they are equipped for busy nights. Maybe try them on a Tuesday if you want good food!
