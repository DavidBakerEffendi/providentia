Needed a stopping point enroute from Boston to Montreal on a family trip, and decided to try Hanover. As we were reading the menu, and about to go in to ask if there was a children's menu, the proprietor came out and welcomed us in. The children's menu is written on a soccer ball (appealing to the 9 yr old) and all the choices were $4. The interior has a nice feel with dark wood tables and bookshelves on the wall. The menu is a bit eclectic. Two of us had tapas, one fish and chips, and one ate off the kids menu. The food was fine - we didn't try anything gourmet - and the service was attentive.
