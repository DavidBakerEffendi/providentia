THIS IS A SANDWICH. Forget running around the city for a cheese steak. Go to Reading Terminal Market, find DiNic's and never be the same again. Me and my boyfriend got a brisket of beef with provolone and spinach and a roast pork with provolone and spinach. both were mouthwatering, full of flavor, melt in your mouth GOOD. The wait wasn't long at all and it was great to watch them just throw a bunch of meat into a vat of au jus over and over again. I think we were lucky with the wait, considering everyone else on yelp is commenting on the line being wrapped around the counter. We got there around 10:30-10:45 on a Sunday so maybe that's why there weren't too many people yet. I honestly wish I bought 5 more sandwiches for the trip back to New York and for lunch for the rest of the week. DiNic's will be in my dreams for a long time. I can't wait to go back just for them!
