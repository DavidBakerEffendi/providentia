My husband Rick and I were going to come here before going to a Phillies' game but  instead we opted to eat lunch here.  And it was a good thing we did too.  It was crowded enough already--imagine what this place is  like before a ballgame! Chcikie's & Pete's is well known for their seafood--particularly shellfish.  I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake sandwich, one of the best I've ever eaten, but man-o-man, "Jumbo" is right.  Good thing I was able to walk it off afterwards!  Rick wnated t do the touristy thing and order a Philly Cheesesteak.  Well he went for the  lobster topped  Philly and did it ever look good too! And yes we did split ad order of their famous Crabfries!
