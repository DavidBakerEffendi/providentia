It could be a cool spot it you didn't feel you were packed in like cattle and sitting on top of each other. When the waiter pull the table out for you too sit not just to be polite but so you don't touch the person's food who you are sitting next to sucks. It's an imitate place but I wanted to have a conversation with my dinner partner not the people on my right and left. The food was creatively done but was not good at all. Plates were small and I left hungry with a nasty after taste. Just stick to authentic Mexican food please. Sangria was good. The transplants can have this place... I won't be back.
