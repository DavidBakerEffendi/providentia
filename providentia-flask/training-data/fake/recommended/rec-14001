I also waited for 2 hours in the rain yesterday for those famous blueberry pancakes. They were absolutely worth the wait. I really have no clue how Bobby Flay beat these on Throwdown. They were sooooo amazing!! Get the melted butter apple cider- it's literally apple pie in a cup. My friend got an egg white omelet. It sounds kinda boring, but it was not just any old omelet. It was the fluffiest, yummiest omelet you will ever have. This place is perfection.
