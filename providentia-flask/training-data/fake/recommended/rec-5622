Really Good, but definitely not my favorite SStarr restaurant.  It is a nice option when looking for something different from Stephen Starr, however, this restaurant did not stand out like the other SStarr restaurants do.  The others so memorable.  El Vez provided the 'expected' - good food, really good margs & good service.  Would go back, just no wow factor for me.
