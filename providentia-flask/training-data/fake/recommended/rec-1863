My wife and I stopped here on our way to see Wicked.  The decorations are really cool and the staff is very friendly. The food was excellent!  We ordered the honey glazed ribs as an appetizer.  They were fall-off-the-bone delicious!  The Room Service Pad Thai and Red Curry Chicken were great.   We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and would gladly return!
