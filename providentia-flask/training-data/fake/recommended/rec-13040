I came here for date night, and I loved every minute of it! Our server was wonderful and attentive, without being a nuisance. I had the chicken entree, and it was the best I'd had all year. I've bought their roast chickens at their bakery (before it closed) on many occasions, but this dish was on another level. Our meal came to approx. $300, incl wine, tax & tip. Worth every penny!
