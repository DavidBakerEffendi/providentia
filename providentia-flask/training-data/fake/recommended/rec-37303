This place has the best egg sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. It is ridiculous. The eggs are so fluffy and perfect and they taste great. I ask them to put mozzarella on mine, which they do at no extra charge, and there is so much of this amazing stretchy fresh mozzarella it's just bananas. All of the food is great, I love a good cheese plate and they never disappoint. The delivery wait time is like 15 minutes every time and the delivery gentlemen are always lovely. Anddd most incredibly they are consistent, it is always top notch and always greatly satisfying. I finished my eggy sandwich as I finished this review and I already miss it. I'd consider obesity just to eat one of these every meal.
