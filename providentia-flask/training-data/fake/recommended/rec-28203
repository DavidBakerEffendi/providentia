Spritzenhaus is a great addition to this neighborhood.  My two good friends live right nearby and take people who visiting here all the time!  Not your typical beer garden but I love it nonetheless.  It's a really big place with lots of seating.  They have a big fireplace in the middle which keeps the place nice and toasty in the winter.   The beer selection is amazing with a good variety of domestic and imported beers.  It's a bit pricey but that's standard for this neighborhood.  I haven't tried the food yet because I'm not really into German food and it's expensive, but I've heard good things.   This place gets super crowded on the weekends, but usually you can still find a seat after a while.  The big tables make it easy to meet people if you're interested.  And be prepared - it can get really loud inside!!
