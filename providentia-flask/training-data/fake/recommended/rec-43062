Went here for happy hour recently, the cocktails were amazing and the only downside was the price (hence the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars). I feel like Richard Pryor should have come here when he was trying to spend all his money in Brewster's Millions. He could have burned through all his cash in no time buying cocktails here. I really enjoyed their mojitos and would probably go back again but I'm thinking I'd have to impose a drink limit on myself. I'm thinking I should only go back some night when I'm drunk and just looking for a late night cocktail. I haven't eaten any food here but the dishes I saw being served looked pretty appetizing.
