Great atmosphere! We went for a light dinner and drinks, and they most definitely didn't disappoint. The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection, and our light dinner of salad and bruschetta was lovely, great wine and mixed drinks selection. Overall, lovely experience and I'd love to go back.
