Good neighborhood Peruvian place that I have been to twice now.  The service is good and the food is really excellent.  I have had a lot of Peruvian food and this is good authentic Peruvian.  I had the 3 ceviche tasting and the Lomo Saltado and enjoyed it very much.  It can be a little tight in the space but worth a visit if you are in Park Slope.
