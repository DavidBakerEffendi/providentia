One of my favorites of all time!!!! I was introduced to this place by a wonderful wonderful amiga Jennifer in 2005 and have not stopped going since! The Lychee martini's is what Verlaine's is known for and be suuuuuuppperrr careful because the next thing you know you are on ur 5th one and are feeeeling extra happy!!!!!!!! (this is always good in my book) if you get a bit hungry there is a great menu that will make your taste buds happy.  Spring rolls, dumplings (my fav), coconut rice, shrimp satay, fried chicken (for all those afraid to try the other stuff hahaha) just yummy in my tummy!   The happy hour is the best its from 5pm-10pm what more can you ask for it does get crowded Thursday-Saturdays but let me tell you I believe its all worth it!!!!!!! Its always a to-go place for me and will always be!!!!!
