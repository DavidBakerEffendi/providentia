Peruvian cuisine? I think not. Upon browsing the menu, I was excited to see many traditional dishes, yet the plates did not live up to the hype. We were served aji, but no canchita, which is a Peruvian custom. Appetizers. Ordered choros and a medley of appetizers that resembled Taco Bell rather than Peruvian cuisine. The choros were lacking heat and the aderezo was poor in itself. I under the aji de gallina, which tasted more like some sort of Italian cheese pasta than actual aji de gallina. Any way the food was rather lackluster and no where close to authentic and the service was poor and un attentive. The atmosphere however was the best part of the experience . You want real Peruvian cuisine cross the bridge into jersey and go to any corner store in Kearny.
