I've been to every Starr Restaurant in the city, and this place trumps them all. It's my favorite steak & seafood place within a 60 mile radius, so I highly recommend anyone looking for an awesome meal and wonderful dining experience to try them out. We've tried many of the dishes and they have all been delicious, and the wait service is fantastic. Their cocktail list is also very nice. Â If you're looking for a 5 star dining experience, this is the place to go.
