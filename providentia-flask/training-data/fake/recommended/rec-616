Their sangria is delicious but not strong enough.  I had almost a full pitcher and was barely buzzed.  I went there for a dinner party and they were accommodating and nice. The host was nice too except when he asked if we included a tip when we were paying for our food, which I think was rude. I hate when waiters (or in this case: host) ask or demand a tip! Dude, I've been to restaurants before I know I have to tip! Don't ask me for it. We order almost all the "tapas" (and raciones) on the menu.  I think some of them were a bit overpriced for their size.  I recommend the shrimp in garlic sauce, croquetas de pollo (these were delicious), mejillones avoa (mussels), albondigas, and the fried calamari. We had cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake for dessert. They were both average. Nothing special. I am a huge flamenco lover and was looking forward to their Saturday show.  The flamenco show was a bit disappointing. The dancers and singers were good, but they took long breaks.  It's supposed to go from 8:30-11:00PM and I think we only heard 4 songs.  Plus it was very difficult to see, listen, and enjoy the show.  This was probably due to the lack of space available and the setting of the tables.   They are good at handling reservations and accommodating large groups.  So i definitely recommend that.  The ambiance is perfect. I did feel like I was in some Tapas Bar/Restaurant in Spain!
