I agree with the other 1 or 2 (generous) star reviews. Don't believe they are interested in being authentic. I met the owner a couple times in social gatherings. Nice guy. He's definitely not authentic. Food at this joint is what passes for Mexican in Upper Montclair. More bang for your buck can be had at Taco Bell on Rt. 46.
