The perfect addition to the Cortelyou Road experience. The wine selection is very artfully picked, with constant new additions to try, and some of the most unique and tasty glasses I have ever had. The owner seems to delight in speaking about his selection, and is extremely well versed in the subject. The staff is friendly and unpretentious, with a warm feeling of camaraderie in the space, which is so nice to see. And then there is the food. Ah, the wonderful, tasty, savor-each-bite food, cooked to perfection every time. The Beef Stew is unbelievable. I can't stop getting it. Only downside is it can be tough to get a seat on weekend nights. What can I say? It's popular. Monday and Thursday have live music, which is also always very well suited to the mood, always acoustic, blue grassy, jazzy, old-timey, jug band or ukulele type stuff.
