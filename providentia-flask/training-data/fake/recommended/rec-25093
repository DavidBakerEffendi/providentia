Breakfast has been great the two times I've been there. They were out of the house-made sausage one time, which was disappointing, and they were weird about honoring the Check-In deal (they said it was only with the breakfast sandwich, but I ordered a more expensive menu item so it seemed like they could have just given me the free coffee, but idk). Overall, the food is great, the service is so-so. I've never had to wait to eat there, which is awesome.
