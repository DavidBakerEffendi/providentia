The hype is real. I came here on the last day of my trip and boy, talk about saving the best for last. We came right around 9:15am on a Sunday and the wait was already 45min long - mind you, that isn't bad for Clinton's. So we put our name down on their nifty iPad and walked over the Doughnut Planet to grab goodies from the train ride home. We got a text when our table was ready (convenient!) and were seated promptly. We got the famous blueberry pancakes and Southern Breakfast. THE BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.... oh my lord. I would want these to be my last meal on this planet. Perfectly fluffy and moist with just the right amount of sweetness and blueberries. And I am not a big pancake OR blueberry person. Worth every penny spent and second waiting. I didn't care for the Southern Breakfast too much. The fried green tomatoes were unique but the cut was a little too thick for my taste. I could only take a couple bites of the cheese grits before getting over the taste and the eggs were nothing special. It didn't help that the dish was lukewarm upon arrival. But the sugar cured bacon definitely saved the dish, yum yum. Overall, definitely worth trying out. I want to come back and try more of their dishes but Clinton's has earned a spot on my list of NY staples.
