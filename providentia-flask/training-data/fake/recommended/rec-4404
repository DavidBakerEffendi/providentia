Not sure what all the fuss is about this place.  It seems most of the reviews are about everything but the dogs/sausages.  Great fries, low cost, fresh toppings and good sauces.  The hot dogs (Dietz & Watson) are mealy and not much flavor to them.  I had the Back In the Day (needed salt) and the Chicago (you couldn't taste the hot dog) on my first try.  On my second the Chihuahua would have been great if not for the lack of chorizo.  It seems they cut one link in half in order to fill the length of the bun.  Either go with a bigger link or double it so you can actually taste the chorizo.  Definitely doesn't live up to the hype.
