Cafe 72 is has consistently good fare, a friendly staff, and is always a welcome change from the usual suburban restaurants.  We love to go for breakfast, lunch and dinner....there is always something new to order! This is probably the closest place I have found to a cozy city bistro since moving into the 'burbs...not to mention, I have never had a dissappointing meal or experience at this unassuming West Trenton gem - and I have also purchased gift certificates for local friends who have let me know they loved it as well! I recommend Cafe 72, however, don't tell too many people - it's a small place, and for now, not a long wait to get a seat. :)  PS - don't forget, bring a bottle of your favorite wine, it's a BYO.
