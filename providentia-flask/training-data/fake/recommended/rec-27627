incredible.  food is wonderful, wine list is awesome, ambience is chill.  it's a great place to come after a stressful day at work, or whenever you want to take someone for a dressy casual place.  waiters are helpful and knowledgable. the steaks are generally very good, fries are great.  mussels are tasty (good flavoring, fresh).  the burger is a little slice of ridiculous.  it's expensive ($16), but melts in your mouth.  it's the kind of burger you gladly shell out $16 for. all-time fav.
