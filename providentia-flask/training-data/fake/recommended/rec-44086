I have been eating Thai food for over 10 years now.  The food was excellent.  The menu was comprehensive and covered all major Thai dishes.  They also offer a full seafood selection.  I ordered the Pad Basil with Beef and my partner ordered the Pad Ki Mao (Crazy Noodles).   I specifically requested Extra Spicy and they served it up spicy all right!  It was fantastic.  The vegetables in the dishes were not over cooked, were colorful, fresh, and crisp.  The noodles to vegetable ratio was perfect.  For dessert, we had the fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  The fried banana with the vanilla ice cream created a perfect blend of warm crispy gooey wonderfulness.  A great part about this restaurant is that you can specify how spicy you want a dish.  If you plan to go spicy, I recommend their Thai Iced Tea - it's a sweet tea mixed with cream.  Aside from the food, the ambiance was excellent!  The restaurant is painted in warm colors of brown and gold, and feature fabric wall hangings that are lit with spot lights to highlight their designs.  The tables are dark wood, benches are lined with cushions, and tableware is modern and silverware beautiful.  The bathrooms were also clean, fragrant and modern.  The center of the restaurant featured a beautiful and sleek fountain that created soothing babbling water sounds.  The prices while not cheap are reasonable - appetizers ranged from 7-12 ($18 for duck salad) and entrées ranged from 12-26 (noodles at the 12 range and fresh whole fish at the 26 range).  Non-seafood entrées do not exceed $16.00. In sum, this is a welcome addition to an area that has an overabundance of Chinese and Italian fare.
