Owner Joe messaged me and apologized the day after I posted my review and offered a refund while still implying that I must be allergic to "something else" because the items on their menu were gluten free (yes, I am sure toasted bread under your chicken satay qualifies as gluten free). I answered and thanked him and expected an answer so I could get my money back but I haven't heard back since. I spent 4 days sick because of the gluten poisoning I got at Up Thai. Very disappointed with both the food and the customer service.
