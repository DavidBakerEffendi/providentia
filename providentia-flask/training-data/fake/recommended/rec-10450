Cafe Orlin is a good idea poorly executed: a brunch destination on St. Mark's Place with Middle Eastern flare. Lots of space and sunlight. Unfortunately, the food is less than impressive - the dish I ordered was relatively bland and came out cold. The service also leaves much to be desired: the waitresses were rushed and brusque, and we initially were charged a different table's bill.
