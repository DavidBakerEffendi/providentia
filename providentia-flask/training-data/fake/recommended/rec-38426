OK, enough negativity.  I love the place.  Criticize the decor for being dated?  I cal it classic.  Criticize the menu for being too standard?  I call it sticking to what you do well. It's simply very good, unpretentious and very well made food.  Not adventurous, but the basics done perfectly. I loved the gnocchi, the meatballs were just as they should be, chicken Marsala was absolutely perfect. If you go to the chain Italian restaurant and get microwaved factory food to get all you can eat breadsticks and salad; you're a fool.
