Walked in last night met Adam the bartender.  Terrible. Ordered two glasses of wine. Took a while. I guess we were interupting social hour.  Asked do you have mozzarella sticks. Yes we do. Why did I get a cheeze steak sandwich? Was hungry so I ate it anyway. Not bad on the food but an abrasive bartender without people skills there is no excuse for in a post Sandy area of nyc where more establishments were prevelent in the past. Management needs to evaluate personnel.
