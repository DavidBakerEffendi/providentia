Well some time after my first review of  this place I decided to give it another chance.  I am not disappointed with my decision.   They have revamped the  menu and have added some great food.  The sandwiches are amazing, especially the beer can chicken sandwich, the fries are still awesome and whatever Carmen is doing in that kitchen, keep it up.   The oysters are fresh and sustainable, something I really enjoy about this place is just that....local and fresh and sustainable for whatever they can. The bar manager Chris is a step in the right direction over whomever was in that position before.  His knowledge about beer and random crap will keep the convo going and who can forget the Wii bowling for shots! Much improved over the past few months.  If you didn't like it your first time, give the Well another shot at winning your tastebuds over!!
