Definitely have seen better restaurants. Had pork medallion and steak-of-the-day, neither was impressive. Foie Gras was mediocre. Prices are not low for the quality of the food. Can find better in the neighborhood. Quite loud, but then again it's a wine bar so it's understandable I guess. Upside, the bread was good. Above average wine selection.
