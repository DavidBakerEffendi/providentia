Found this place while looking for a quick place to eat before shopping in SoHo.  There was about a 20 minute wait (2pm on a Saturday) but we were able to find 3 seats at the end of the bar.  Great service!  We each were quickly sold on the Bash Burger, which was ridiculous.  I got mine with tots and ordered medium rare to medium.  What came out was completely rare.  I asked if they could heat it up and they were really cool about it.  Joked about my steak tartare and quickly brought back a replacement.   The burger was fantastic!  Red onion tempura rings on top, subtle yet delicious bacon onion jam, brioche bun.  Oh, and tots.  Can't go wrong with tots.  It was pretty amazing.  I'd go again!
