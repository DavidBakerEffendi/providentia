I have been here over a dozen times now and have yet to come across anything I didn't like. One of my favorite combos is chicken meatballs, pesto sauce, mozzarella and a side of the risotto of the day (if they have the mushroom risotto you NEED to order it). I love love love all of the food ive had from there the only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the wait is typically longer than they say.
