Yelp said this place opened at 9 but the hostess said 8! Clinton St. has one of the most amazing hash browns ever! Defintely order a plate with hash browns! Also try their jam! They are to DIE for! Went there twice and I was very satisfied with both of my dishes. The only thing I was a little bit upset about was the hostess seemed pretty rude. My friend and I were standing inside the see through door and she kicked us out. 1 hour later when we went back we saw numerous of people standing inside! She also seemed to be glaring at my friend. Great food but terrible attitude !
