Took the boy out for dinner here on a fly-in drive-trough at the front end of a business trip. 6:15 on a Monday night and the place was mostly empty except for a couple of patrons hanging at the bar and talking with the staff.  The space itself is small but not crowded with window seating as an option.  I liked the vibe.  Food was awesome.  We had a trio of Empanadas to start ( picadillo, mango chicken, spinach and jack cheese). They were prepared well, served warm and the dipping sauces were an excellent accompaniment.  For entrees, the boy had the Camarones Al Ajillo (see pic) with plantains instead of black beans while I had the Lechon Asado (see pic).  The boy seemed to enjoy his shrimp while I LOVED the deeply marinated pork.  Highly recommend you for it a shot.  The sides were excellent as well, my only criticism was that the Yuca Fries (see pic), while well presented, did not appear to be an item made on site.  Good, but have had better elsewhere.  We topped off dinner with a couple of expressos.  Look, any dinner with my kid these days is a good dinner, but the food here is definitely worth the trip.  Also liked hearing him tell his friends about it when we got back to his dorm, so I am sure he would have rated it 4-5 stars as well.  Three more years at Yale, so you can bet we will be back!
