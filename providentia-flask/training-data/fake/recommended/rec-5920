So, last review. Everything I said before is true. Especially the excellent attentive kind and active service. My one big critque about the place is that the food is not consistent. I ordered the Steak and Eggs (see review below) 4 times and got four different dishes. Two were good to excellent and the other two were lacking. The lacking was 1) one third the portion of the first S&E I ordered, 2) strange sweet potato home fries in the dish that completely negated the lump crab meat if there was any to be found at all. This is someone in the back doing their own thing to the detriment of the restaurant. If the managers can solve the problem with a chef in the kitchen who is either lazy or resentful toward the food they're cooking, this place would really deserve 4 or 5 stars. Until then, it's a good place, but not a great one.
