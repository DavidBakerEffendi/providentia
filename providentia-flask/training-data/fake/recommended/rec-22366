Okay, you can't walk into a place called Yorkside Pizza (that's dangerously close to Toad's) and expect Michelin-star quality. It's a college hangout, people. I'd expect that 75% of its revenue comes from drunk kids ordering pizza at 2am. However, they do have a number of items on the menu that are good anytime, day or night, drunk or sober. Here's the rundown: 1. Greek salad with chicken. If you read any of my other reviews, you know I have a deep appreciation for Greek salad. This one is tops, especially with grilled chicken. The large size is HUGE, plenty to split with one, two, or even three other people. 2. The cheesey garlic bread with tomato and basil. Heavenly. 3. Moosetracks milkshake. They even bring you the silver mixing cup with the overflow and a spoon to scoop out all that chocolatey goodness with. 4. Chicken salad sandwich. Don't question it. 5. Buffalo chicken tenders. 6. This may come as a surprise...but Yorkside serves wine. You can get it by the glass or bottle, it's up to you. And while it may not be the classiest venue, it's great for a relaxing night with your friends on the cheap.
