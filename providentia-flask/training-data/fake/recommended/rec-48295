Hi, I just got back from dinner with a friend there. The food was amazing. The beer was on point and the service was great. It did take a few minutes for the food to come but I was drinking beer in the meantime. I ordered salmon with rice and a salad and everything was very fresh and tasty. Whenever I go I always make friends with the people sitting around me so that must say something about the great clientele that comes here. Great place to eat ! Great Prices and a Good Place !! Recommended !
