Culinary art.  Truly inventive dishes mixed with impeccable service.  If you are a foodie then you have to put this on your 'must' list.  When we went - a few highlights: lamb artistically wrapped in spinach; "broken egg" dessert; and a wonderful 'white dish' that had delicately sliced garlic and almonds beautifully arranged.  Just go.
