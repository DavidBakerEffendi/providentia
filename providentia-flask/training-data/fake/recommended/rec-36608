Ahh, what can I say about The Meatball Shop that hasn't already been said? I love how you can customize your own sliders & sandwiches from the meat to the sauce. Everything was just delicious. And you must get the cookie sandwich dessert, the best way to the end the meal :) This was such a cute restaurant, I would love to come back again.
