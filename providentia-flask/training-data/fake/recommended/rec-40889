Great experience overall. Went last Saturday night. I appreciated that they took a reservation, even just for two people. We have some dietary restrictions and they handled these with no issue, unlike some other places with a fixed menu. A good selection of delicious appetizers, a farmer's cheese dumpling dish that was like perfect, cheesy gnocchi. I had the vegetable croquettes for an entree and my boyfriend had the fish. Both were really good, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. The chef herself comes out after dessert to drop off some chocolates and chat. The whole vibe of the place is people who care about good and interesting food. It's very reasonably priced for the amount of food and the quality. Highly recommended!
