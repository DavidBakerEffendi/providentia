Stopped in at the end of the Phillies home opener for dinner with my sister-in-law and our kids. We won't be back. The waitress was loud and rude and mixed our drinks up. Didn't really matter because they tasted the same anyway, cheap. The crab bisque with lump crab meat barely had any crab and it certainly wasn't lump. Pizza was OK, wings were OK. The meal was cheap and we got what we paid for. Then the hockey game came on and forget about hearing anything over the TVs. Not worth the hype.
