Came on a Wednesday night, and enjoyed the quiet outdoor seating. Service was not awesome- mainly because the waitress' tone made me feel as though we were a bother- but she checked in often, so we were not neglected. Ginger Calamari was PHENOMENAL. Linguine with clam sauce was "eh".. It's BYOB, but there are 2 or 3 liquor stores within walking distance.
