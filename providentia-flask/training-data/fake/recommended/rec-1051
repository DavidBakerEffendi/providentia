Omg! My son is attending Drexel and we were on a mission to find his favorite, cheesesteak sub in Philly. Well Geno's you suck, rude, crappy bread, don't like anything to be ordered customized, gives you packs of mayo and will not toast heir huge gross rolls. Good news tho is Sonny's! Awesome and done however you like it and they don't make you feel like an asshole for not liking it with wiz only and not speaking their lingo! Sonny's is the bomb, awesome bread, mayo on the bread, toasted and lettuce and tomatoes if you wish along with all the Philly classics! The super nice red headed lady running the joint is so nice and called me by name 3 times. As far as I am concerned our search for the best is over! Thanks for the best I have ever had in 49 years and those cheese fries with bacon rock! Thank you!
