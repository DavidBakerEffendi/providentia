Solid pizza joint - pies made fresh to order. Excellent cheese and crust that was crispy, yet "foldable". Could have used some more tomato sauce. Ask for the pizza well done. Garlic rolls were bland, but pasta dishes looked excellent. Tough to get a seat when it's busy. Service was nice. If I lived in Philly, I'd be back.
