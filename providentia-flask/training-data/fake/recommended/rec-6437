This is the perfect neighborhood restaurant for taking out-of-town guests or a nice quiet night of grazing and catching up with friends. The atmosphere is very romantic and cozy; it makes you want to stay there all night long. The hostess was incredibly friendly. We walked in, put our name in and waited at Blue Ribbon Wine Bar for about 20 mins. It's nice when restaurants take your phone number so you're not a slave to the waiting area or standing out front. The food was delicious. Listen to everyone and get the gnocchi appetizer. It was heavenly. We also got the calamari, which was pretty darn good too. The only comment I have for it is that the avocado slices seemed kind of out of place. However, I'm happy to eat extra avo whenever so it was welcomed if not random. I ordered the swordfish for my entree. It was perfectly cooked. Sometimes swordfish can get a little dry but this was just right. The corn salad reminded me of the calamari a bit because of the avocado but it was still very tasty. I don't remember what we had for dessert but seeing as the rest of the experience was so positive, I'm sure it was divine. Highly recommend Market Table - it's great food in a cute West Village setting with great service.
