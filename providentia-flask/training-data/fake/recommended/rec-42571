Am I missing something here??? Given the fact that they are a cash only restaurant, I expect that I be wowed by their food...and that it has some degree of authenticity...Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by the service and the food. SERVICE: The server (who seemed to be the manager of the place) was in a real hurry...the restaurant wasn't even that crowded...she must have assumed that I had taken the Evelyn Wood speed reading course because our dialog went as follows (with very accurate timekeeping in h:mm:ss) 8:20:10 We sit down 8:20:20: We get our menus 8:20:20.3: Manager: "Are you ready to order"? 8:20:20.4: me...thinking of something witty to say to her 8:20:25: me: "um....not really...give me another minute" 8:20:30: Manager: "So what would you like to have tonight?".... Don't think of going there if you're looking for even 1/2 a decent romantic meal because unless you're Speedy Gonzales, it ain't gonna happen.... FOOD: Since it was a BYOB, we had taken Coronas with us (Mexican Restaurant)...so we ask the waitress if she has any limes...her response?..."no..but we have lemons"...WHAT KIND OF A MEXICAN RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE LIMES???????? Â I eventually found out that Corona's don't taste good with Lemons.... The food wasn't that great either....I ordered the Enchiladas Oaxaca, which was horrible...the pork was very tender and juicy, but the dish had no flavor...the onions were so bland...it was embarrassing... All in all, I think I realized what was happening...I had ended up in an alternate universe where Mexican Restaurants a. have bland food b. THEY DON"T HAVE LIMES..... Don't think I'm making another trip there anytime soon.
