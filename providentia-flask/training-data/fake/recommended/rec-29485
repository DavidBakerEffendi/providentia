TurDucken Hoagie. That's all you need to say. I think that it was only on the menu before Thanksgiving but it would be well worth the wait. In the mean time almost all of their sandwiches are really good. The 50/50 really stands out among the rest. Also, don't think this is a Center City baby sandwich. You will get what you paid for and more.
