Starter - arugula salad Primi - fusilli with crab and uma cream Secondi - salt cod and potato purée with pesto of watercress. Nice cocktails before the meal. A wonderful armorone to accompany the meal Though the servers changed and the sommelier was gone at the end of the evening the service was exemplary.  The food was really spectacular, I tried all of my dining companions' foods too and they were likewise remarkable. The bistecca was presented amazingly for a friend and tasted wonderful. If you eat beef, splurge and get it. Desserts were good but not memorable. The one caver is that it's hard to get in. The only reservation was for 9 and even sitting at the bar beforehand was very difficult. The decor was fashionable but the acoustic was kind enough for all of us to easily speak to each other in a busy space.
