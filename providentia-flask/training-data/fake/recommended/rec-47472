Went here with 6 people on a Saturday night recently. Food was excellent, as was the service. I was impressed that after we ordered another bottle of wine and the waitress arrived with it she didn't just open it up, she mentioned we all had a decent amount left and asked if we really wanted another bottle...we decided we didn't and saved $60. Great atmosphere.
