huge portions of carefully prepared, well seasoned Portuguese barbeque at  a  fairly reasonable price. Very friendly staff. Portuguese TV was on, cool.  The owner is a lady from Portugal. They have Portuguese soda (Sumol, which I love) and also a variety of Guarana. casual environment.  I went to Portugal on vacation a couple of times and love Portuguese food.  I wish they had a larger variety of side items and appetizers available, such as simple things like an olive plate that one would routinely find in Portugal, but they seem to be working on that with recent addition of a cabbage and carrots side. Parking lot in the back, also easy to park on the street out front.  Tiramusu was good. And they make a good espresso.
