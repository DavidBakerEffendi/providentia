We love Bibou! My husband and I had delicious memories of our visits from when they first opened and our return gave us more. The food is absolutely wonderful, the service pitch perfect with nice warm touches of Charlotte (co owner & wife of Chef Pierre) welcoming us and stopping by to check in as well as Pierre making the rounds late in the meal to thank us for coming and asking how we enjoyed the meal. A truly lovely dining experience. They make all guests feel like treasured regulars.
