Ordered delivery from here through Grubhub. Got a pizza and wings and was very impressed on the food quality compared to other options in the area. I've been going to another local restaurant for my pizza and wings thinking it was best option after trying most of the locations around here. From now on I think I will order from here. The pizza has a nice crunchy crust, and the bottom has a soft yet crisp texture. The wings are very meaty and the sauce I tried was mandarin chipotle, very tasty. Price was fair as well.
