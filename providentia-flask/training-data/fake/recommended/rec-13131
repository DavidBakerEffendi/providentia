We arrived at Penn Station by 9:30 on a Friday morning, checked in at our hotel and then hopped on the subway down to Clinton Street. After poring over yelp reviews the week prior, I was absolutely determined to see what all the fuss was about. We made it by 11:00 and found a few people lingering outside. The hostess said it would be a 45 min-1 hr wait, and that we'd receive a text when our table was ready. In the meantime you can click on a link, which they provide via text, and see approximately how many parties are in front of you which helps you gauge your wait time...awesome app, and not sure why more restaurants don't implement something similar. Our wait ended up being almost exactly an hour, and we were ravenous by the time we sat down. I normally don't gravitate towards sweet breakfast entrees, but had to go with the blueberry pancakes and a side of sugar cured bacon. Bf ordered the Southern breakfast. It was all amazing, especially the bacon!! Pancakes were fluffy and delicious, but a tad skimpy on the blueberry topping. Service was extremely fast and friendly enough, though don't expect your server to come back to check on you unless you flag them down....understandable as the place was packed and insanely busy. As others have mentioned, it's cash only and you'll likely end up spending around $40 for 2 people. Not cheap, but worth it. It's a brunch that everyone should experience at least once. Glad I got to check this one off my NYC foodie list!
