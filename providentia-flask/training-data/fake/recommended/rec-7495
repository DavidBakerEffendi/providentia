SW corner of 53rd and 6th avenue is the one you want, which is easy to tell because it always has the chronic line. lamb and chicken platter $1 for two extra tubs of white sauce (it comes with two, youll want more) I also ask for an extra hot sauce because I'm a G like that cash only it's really really really rad.
