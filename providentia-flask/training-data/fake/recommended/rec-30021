Went there for restaurant week. I was impressed with the decor and service, but not the food. The appetizers were in generous portions . We tried eight different ones. I recommend the meatballs, sardines, salad, mouhamara and tuna belly. The chicken liver 's sauce was too sour, maybe too much pomegranate . Â The crispy shrimp was not crispy enough , hence, couldn't really eat it with the shell as recommended by the waitress. As for the entrees, the lamb leg was too too dry . It seems to me they might have massively cooked a bunch of them and then reheated them as orders came in. The braised beef was decent. My friend's tile fish was fresh and the sauce was quite tasty.
