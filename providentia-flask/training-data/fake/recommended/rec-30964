Awesome food, friendly service. Husband had the Crabby dick, a cracbcake/eggs benedict concoction that he absolutely loved. I had a special, it was a blueberry belgian waffle with pulled pork and bourbon maple syrup topped with candies walnuts. Outta this world! We also tried the mint chocolate chip pancakes as a side...so so delish! Also loved the french press coffee at each table and the cute, yet hipstery, mason jar water glasses. Loved that the portions were a great size w/o being TOO much. Cozy, casual atmosphere, not too many kids. We just left and I can't wait to go back!
