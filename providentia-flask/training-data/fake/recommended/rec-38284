Absolutely amazing! I found this place looking on Yelp for something "different" for lunch. Upon arrival it doesn't look like a place with stellar food but trust and believe me it's nothing short of amazing. I had the Tapsilog and it was full of flavor, the rice was cooked perfectly with a hint of garlic flavor, and the sunny side up egg yolk on top created almost like a sauce for the whole dish. The owner is a very nice guy and will explain anything to you so feel free to ask away. I recommend this place for anytime of the day if you're looking for something "different" but sure to hit the spot!
