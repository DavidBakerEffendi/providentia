Awesome. Went on Valentines. This is probably the first restaurant I've been to where I'm like "this is really my kind of place". I think a lot of people will feel that way. Bed-Stuy Do or Die. The Host was wearing tuxedo pants, white Nikes with angel wings, and drinking a tall boy, while maintaining a commanding and dignified air. The food is really freakin good. Got the "a fish and some chips". You can tell it's the real deal when they put some sort of amazing choppy pickled thing all over the fries and it fulfills and surpasses the need for any ketchup. at. all. This may sound insignificant, but I once put ketchup on a butternut squash. my date got the pork "renderloin". tender and deliciouso. the yogurt sauce that came with it was freakin amazing. I've never had sweet yogurt sauce before with meat. I would eat the sauce by itself. and the beet salad (oh wait might've been red cabbage) and the little choppy yuzu apple tasting thingies. They even had chicken hearts or beef heart as off-the-menu specials for V-day. Super romantic. The only reason We didn't have dessert is because I made dessert for us to have back home, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was also great. I'm not really knowledgeable in food categories, I guess it would be  contemporary American, and I hear the people there are alumni from other great places like The Modern and Daniel (Never been to either), but if I had to compare what I tasted to another place I HAVE been to, it would be Diner.  And Diner is awesome. The ambience place has a more Bed-Stuy Starving artist vibe, and that's one of the things  I love about the vibe because I lived in Bed-Stuy for five years on the Myrtle Stop.  I think of it as a mix of irony, hip-hop, found objects, sassy 'tude, and stellar craftsmanship all rolled into one.
