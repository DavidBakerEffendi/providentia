Delicious food, excellent service and ambience ambience ambience... What a beautiful restaurant!! The fresh flowers are amazing and the entire restaurant is cozy and warmly lit. We had a variety of tapas including the stand out crispy artichokes, patatas bravas, and pork belly. Yum! The owner came by to check on our meal- a real treat! He told us the story of the name of the restaurant and pointed out details of artwork, etc. The only slight misstep was the black and white chocolate dessert. The manchego topping was way too cheesy and the white chocolate cake part dry. Otherwise a wonderful spot and one to add to my list of recommendations.
