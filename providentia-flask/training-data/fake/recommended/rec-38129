We found this on Yelp and had a great time! We had just finished going to the local science museum and was hungry. We also had a 22 month old with us and needed a place that was kid-friendly. This was the place! Good sized portions, great service (the kind woman behind the counter even cut the grilled cheese sandwich for our little person into small triangles) and good, hearty, warm food. Loved the feel of the place and was even luckier that we found parking. Thanks Yelp for giving us the heads up!
