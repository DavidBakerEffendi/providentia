I absolutely love this pizza place.  I'm from Northern NJ and used to a certain kind of pizza taste and for Middlesex County, this place gets pretty dang close.  The pizza is always prepared just how I ask, delivery has gotten MUCH better as of late and the dinner dishes are full - no skimping here.  My favorite is the sausage roll, the dough is to die for.  The staff is always friendly when you walk in whether you're a regular or not.
