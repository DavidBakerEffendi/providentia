Mario's is usually my first stop when I get in town. This was my uncle's favorite pizza place for years and it quickly became mine. Now, it is the only place my dad will order from :) Mario himself work on most days and love to make sure that everyone is enjoying their meal. The pizza is among the best in the area and the sandwiches will really take care of you!! Keep up the great work!!!
