I have been waiting to go here for a long time ever since their billboard with pancakes enticed me. Finally we went and I didn't even order the pancakes. I got the eggs and toast and hasbrowns which was great for the price. Their coffee is good too. I'm going to go back there in a few hours to eat their blueberry pancakes and write a follow-up review.
