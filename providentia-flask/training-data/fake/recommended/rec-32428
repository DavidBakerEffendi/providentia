My first trip to Pho 501, I walked in thinking what a whole in the wall...This can't be good!  Well I was completely wrong!   So So good!  The consistency is right on every time....And it's healthy too!   We now go twice a week sometimes more.... They are also very friendly....even the waitress who doesn't speak English...she always has a smile on her face! YUM!
