City View pizza is one pizza parlor that I would not mind coming back to. One, it is meticulously clean, always a good thing. Two, the pizza is yummy! They have a lunch special that offers a small pizza for only $5. I'm embarrassed to say that it was so good that I ate the entire thing. Another plus, they offer a variety of Evan's cheesecakes and cakes. Definitely stop by if you are ever in the Temple University area.
