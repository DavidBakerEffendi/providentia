Three of us ate early here (6pm, Thurs 12/29), and the food was very good. The service was, well, frenetic in that there were so many people milling about, and the nine dishes we had seemed to come from nine different people. Perhaps they were expecting a large crowd, but it was a bit distracting. We sat close to the kitchen, and a way station. There were several glass crashes during our meal, so we were on our toes. Highlights were the Shikaari Vermont Quail, Wild Venison Tenderloin Soolay, and Royal Baby Spinach-Arugula Salad. The plain Naan came with three "dips" (one a powder) that were all very good. I tried the other dishes but cannot remember which was which. The venison was just five or six slices on a bare plate, but was so savory that I would have been satisfied with that alone. $55 bottle of wine was not worth it, but the Kingfisher beer was a cheap, tasty alternative. Would definitely try again, especially since it's in our neighborhood.
