Barbuto has been reviewed enough for any Yelper to know that the Roasted Chicken is delicious.   Additionally, the gnocchi is AMAZING!  We were debating back and forth on what to order, but the waiter told us that you could order most of the pasta dishes in a half size to accommodate small tables.  We ordered the half size of the gnocchi and we were not disappointed! For two people: I recommend ordering an order of the fantastic chicken, a half order of gnocchi, and a vegi dish - a perfectly balanced meal! Also, the price point is really manageable considering the quality and taste of the food.  Great place for a date, intimate group setting, and also perfect for those out-of-towners looking for a great New York dining experience!
