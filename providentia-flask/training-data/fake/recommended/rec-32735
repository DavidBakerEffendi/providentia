We come here a few times a month for the amazing fantastic roll and pear Martini. However if you come here an hour before closing they will rush you through your meal or drink which I do not like. The bartender Amanda is awesome and makes amazing drinks. The fantastic roll and Amanda's Martinis are what keep me coming back. Also the 1-95 is pretty amazing. Good food and drinks however some wait staff aren't friendly.
