Huge portions and the homemade roti is a must! Awesome prices for the amount and quality of food. Depending on the dish-consider ordering to split. You also get a pot of nice, hot tea at your table-waiting for you when you sit down. VERY friendly service and on a Saturday night the wait was only 15 min!
