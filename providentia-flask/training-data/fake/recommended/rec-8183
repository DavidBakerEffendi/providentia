I recently went to White Dog Cafe for University City Dining Days and I was severely disappointed.  While most restaurants use Dining Days/Restaurant Week to showcase their restaurant and to bring in new customers, White Dog's menu[while appealing on paper] was disappointing.  I started off with the Prince Edward Island Mussels with Garlic Crostini which I did enjoy.  Next came my main course, Grass Fed Sirloin with Heirloom Kale and Frites.  I have never eaten a tougher steak anywhere in my life.  Two of my companions also ordered the sirloin and they experienced the same thing.  It was like the steak was laced with gristle.  I had ordered mine to be cooked medium rare[it was more medium than rare] yet it was still tough to cut and chewing became an adventure in trying to wash down the last bit of gristle.  Dessert was fine, I ordered the Corn Fritters.  Service was not very good either, we had a guy[girl?] named Rath who wasn't very attentive and pretty much non-existant.  I think it took us 20 minutes to get bread after sitting down.  Overall the group of 6 of us came out disappointed.  It seems that my opinion goes against the majority of the reviews here but I definitely wouldn't go back,  there are just too many other restaurants in this city and to have to risk getting a bad meal again would just be silly.
