I've been here twice and can say that it's some of best Italian food I've ever had. What I love most about this place is the high percentage of unusual or non-traditional Italian dishes on the menu. The dishes and flavor combinations are unique and creative (e. g. pizza with cape may salt oysters with cucumber spaghettini and house grown raspberries), and it won't be long until you realize this is unlike most (even fancy) Italian food you've had. Ask your waiter if they're serving the assorted roasted vegetables that evening. This is probably the simplest yet one of the most delicious dishes. I've honestly never had better vegetables, ever. It's not on the menu but it's a regular special and it makes the perfect appetizer. It can get quite noisy, and the decor is somewhat cheesy, but neither really detracts from the experience.
