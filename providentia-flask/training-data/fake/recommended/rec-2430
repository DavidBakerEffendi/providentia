Best [Japanese style] ramen I've had so far. I went with the classic and added a poached egg. My husband ordered the same thing but instead of the poached egg he added pork belly. We also ordered the pork buns which was heaven. Service was EXCELLENT. We got there 10 minutes prior to opening and waited in line for a good 15 minutes before we finally got seated. The staff was welcoming and friendly and we weren't rushed at all. They knew everything on the menu and gave recommendations.
