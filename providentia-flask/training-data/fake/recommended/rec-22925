Don't be a tourist. Follow these simple rules: 1. Take the train to Canal street (parking is a toss-up) 2. Only order the soup dumplings (get one order per person, e.g. one pork, one crab, if you're with two) 3. Get Chinese beer with it 4. Bring cash (they only take cash) 5. Don't whine about waiting for a precious seat Â (you're in NYC, no one's special) 6. Don't show up with half your party (if you want to eat within a reasonable amount of time, limit its size) 7. Do get a bubble tea from next door while waiting in order to curb your hunger 8. Don't be afraid to eat the cabbage 9. You can use the sauce if you like, but it isn't necessary. I was born and raised in NYC, yet haven't lived there in over a decade. I still come back just for the dumplings. Yes, they are that good. *** BONUS: A common game played is to take bets on who spills the least soup. The person with the dirtiest plate at the end of the meal pays.
