Like an authentic Chinese hole in the wall- plated and served up with a classy air.  The dry chili chicken is almost as good as the oily brethren I've had in alternate Chinese houses- the staff is serviceable and efficient.  I've had a lot of trouble using any kind of yelp deal or groupon- so keep it simple?   Lunch specials reasonably priced but a few blocks north you can get some of the best Chinese for less fuss and same price or (at dinner) way less.  Clean to the sake of boring, but a decent spot for a drink.
