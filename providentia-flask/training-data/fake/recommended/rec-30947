Coffee Metrics: bad and only refilled once, cold both times. Hiya Hon quotient: low. Unforced service errors: five, including getting one order (for a kid) completely wrong and forgetting one (but not both) kids' desserts, which as parents know, is the cause of many nuclear meltdowns and major wars. Diner decor ratio: Denominator was 1970s, numerator was crowded Italian pizza restaurant. Comfort Food Quality Index: mediocre. Salad was surprisingly green, sandwiches were delivered hot and very quickly, ingredient quality mezzo-mezzo and originality of preparation was low. The Reuben, Patty Melt, and Soup of the Day tests were all judged to be mediocre. Summary: a tepid three stars, not worth going out of the way for on the World Diner Tour. "Regulars/Locals Only" stamp written all over it. Special downgrades: difficult to turn into off 206 under the best of circumstances.
