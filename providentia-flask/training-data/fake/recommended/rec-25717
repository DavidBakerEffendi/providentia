I only met one gaping a-hole in the 'City of Brotherly Love' -- the waiter/bartender at 'Sassafras'.  He was a brusque, stern man who did not approve of ordering a beer at the bar.  He asked us to sit and wait to be helped (weird, for a bar).  The beer selection?  About 4 beers, none of them interesting.  We drank our lackluster lager, and after waiting for what seemed like an eon to pay the bill, approached the bar to finalize our experience.  The guy muttered something unintelligible, picked up a notepad, started doing some tallies and calculations, and then walked off to the kitchen?  Bizarre, never seen anything like it.  Dropped some cash on the bar and left.  The clientele looked pretty generic, but the building itself was nice, maybe someday they'll put something cool here. Try the Belgian pub around the corner.
