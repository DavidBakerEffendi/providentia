Finally, something good on Nostrand Ave. besides greasy chinese and spicy Carribean (No offense...) Born and raised in crown heights, so I've seen places come and go - the good, the bad, and the confusing????  I'm pretty picky and consider myself a harsh, but fair, food connoisseur. So, because I believe in giving credit where it's due- I came home, DESTROYED my food, and decided to write my very 1st Yelp review. I had the duck confit torta and OMG... I got food chub. I didn't mind shelling out 9 bucks after the first bite. Delicious would be an understatement and it was surprisingly filling (a rarity, especially for me).  Almost did delivery but decided to go in person, in the rain, and see what all the rave was about.  I'm glad I did. My only regret was not tipping the cashier, she was friendly and cute ;-) The lobster roll is next... .
