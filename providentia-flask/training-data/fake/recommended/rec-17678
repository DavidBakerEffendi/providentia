Seriously, I will never return to this place again! I am tired of giving it multiple chances and spending my hard earned $$$ to receive the type of service that ruins the entire experience of dining out. Every time I have gone, the staff has been a problem - except for ONLY once!! But, I have returned for the sushi and have ordered from the menu also which has been a GREAT experience. I have especially enjoyed their recent specials - which is the only reason why I have returned despite the nightmare of wondering what server I will be getting that night! But even the food has changed since my last visit on 10/16. The scallops that my husband ordered were grainy (un-cleaned taste) and the salmon that I ordered (which I always order) was smaller than usual and burned outside. Despite the fact that it was not too busy that night, the server still lagged and instead of coming to the table to check on my family she was too busy standing around talking/flirting. When I called the girl over to complain about my dish, she seemed to have this sarcastic "niceness" as if I were wasting HER time??! When I told her that I have never had to return a plate to the kitchen before, she told me that their chef quit and they have a new staff - I don't blame him!! Who would want to work for a company with such bad service?! Â I asked to speak with the manager, she said no problem and went to get him. She said he would come over as soon as he could "because he was very busy" at the moment - he NEVER came!! I asked for my check, left cash on the table and walked out. Such a shame! I only wish I knew where that chef went lol! But, I will order one of my favorite sushi roll's (the Totowa) TO GO from now on.
