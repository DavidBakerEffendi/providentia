Ok, so here's the thing, the food is delicious! The burgers are off the hook!!! BUT, speaking as someone who was in the service industry for 20 years, if I was trying to build a business in a competetive market, I would have someone with alot more warmth and personality working here. The service was fine and efficient but I brought 5 people last night from out of town, we're thinking beers, sausages, beer garden type atmosphere. Instead we walk in, no smile, hardly a hello (that kind of indifference lasted throughout the night), the music so low that there might as well have been none and it was kind of a bummer. The Server was just not someone you would expect to find in what is supposed to be a festive atmosphere. He kind of brought the vibe down, and he was the only person working ;-( Maybe a friendly hostess, a little music, something more inviting, and this place would be jamming b/c it is super cute, the food is awesome and different, and its in the perfect neighborhood for this kind of place.
