Great Concept.  Great ambiance and interesting menu. Wait service fantastic and educated in the menu I attribute my limited enthusiasm for this restaurant to the fact the my taste and the chef's did not align.  The cucumber gazpacho was not to my liking, although it was undoubtedly what cucumber should taste like.  The risotto was not creamy, and although I asked for mushroom and not clam risotto, that should not have been an excuse for the graininess.  Not sure what went wrong here.  Otherwise, just eh - somewhat pricey, although the drinks were great.  Branzino was very good.
