$1 Pabst Tallboys.   Coming from a state that doesn't believe in happy hour (it's against the law here in uptight MA), or in its residents being very happy at all for that matter, the drink special alone did it for me.  Had a great veggie burger too.  Fun place to spend time post crust show at Troc.
