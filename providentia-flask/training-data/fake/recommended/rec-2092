Corner Bistro is the hottest corner in the city!... Let's see... - $3.00 Beer - $6.00 Juicy Freshly Made Hamburgers - Booths - Cuties (Men & Women) - Sports - Rock Music - Dive Bar I would have to say....HECK YEAH!!!! Â  If any of these things are on your check list then Corner Bistro is what your looking for! I love grabbing a beer & burger at this little west village spot. It tends to get packed here so I suggest coming here in the afternoons. Burgers are not the best I have ever had but they still are awesome. The fries are so/so but If your not a health freak I'd say slap on some melted cheese and they do the job well! If i'm in a Dive Bar Burger Mood.. I head to Corner Bistro! ;o)
