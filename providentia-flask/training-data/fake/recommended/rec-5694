This place is literally big enough for the grill to cook the sausage, steak, and veggies and for the cash register. It's also located right next to the Home Depot entrance on Columbus Blvd, which I thought was extremely random. However, hungry and anticipating an afternoon of helping my boyfriend build me a desk and shelf for my room, I decided to stop by. The men working there were really welcoming and super friendly. They offered us a sample of the spicy and sweet sausages they were cooking up. It was pretty but I was not craving that. Instead, I ordered a fajita steak (cheesesteak with peppers and onions) and it was delicious! Not too greasy and not too dry. And cheap too! Around 6 bucks for the sandwich and a drink. Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop by for the sausage. definitely recommend for a cheap, quick lunch! Â You just have to eat it in the car or take it home.
