Both the service and the food at Juventino were incredible. Friendly servers and a huge brunch menu make for a lot of excellent choices at this darling Park Slope spot. The two friends I was with were visiting NYC, and were blown away. As it was Valentine's Day, the chef provided a delicious and complementary bread pudding. Will look forward to coming back!
