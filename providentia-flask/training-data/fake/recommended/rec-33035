Filled with spice jars and tea pots, a variety of table types, and exotic decor, a nice hideaway.  The food is good, I wanted to support an establishment that welcomes vegans and I wasn't disappointed.  They offered to veganize anything on the menu.  I had the tofu scramble, which came with toast and Earth Balance butter, and a very fresh little salad.  I had a great cup of tea and left very relaxed.
