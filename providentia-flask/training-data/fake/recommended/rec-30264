Carrot cake bread pudding with cream cheese ice cream...whaaat?!?! The entire meal was a delightful journey. For apps, we ordered the deviled eggs and pulled pork croquette. Dinner consisted of the mixed grill entree with brussel spourts and cauliflower au gratin for the side dishes. Clearly the dessert was a hit as I started the review with it. Â  I don't usually order cocktails with my dinner, but their moscow mules were really fantastic too! The hubby and I enjoyed it so much and can't wait to swing by for another visit on our next trip to Manhattan.
