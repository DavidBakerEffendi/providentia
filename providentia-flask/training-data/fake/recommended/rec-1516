I am fat.  I had to try "the best sandwich in America".  I've eaten a lot of sandwiches in my fatty days but I have never had a roast pork sandwich in Philly.  So its tough for me to compare with other pork sandwiches.  However, I don't think this was the best sandwich overall that I have ever eaten in America.  When Man Vs. Food came to SF and reviewed Wexler as one of the best in the country I lost faith in Adam Richman.  Nobody is SF goes to Wexlers for a sandwich.  What a freakin noob.  The Roast pork with rabe is a good sandwich but to me it needs more fat.  Its just one note.  I need an explosion of flavors and other liquids.  nom nom.  Its def worth trying but I don't think Adam Richman is fat enough to call this the best sandwich in America.  Lame azz
