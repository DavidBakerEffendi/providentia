First off, we had made a reservation for 8 people at 8pm on a Saturday night.  If they weren't going to seat us until 8:45 because they had to take a party of 8 that arrived before us (that is, before 7:45) that didn't have a reservation, they should have said no reservations.  Because really, the place is tiny, and 8 adults take up a LOT of space.   The food was pretty good, but not all of it was created equally.  The goulash soup was, in fact, amazing.  I though the potato-leek soup was greasy and bland.  The chicken schnitzel with fries, as my mom put it, "looks like a kid's meal".  My boyfriend had some beef dish with potato dumplings and red cabbage - the beef was very bland and the sauce oddly sweet.  I had one of the "little potato pans" - how could I resist a mountain of potatoes, bacon, and onions, with my choice of meat (bratwurst - AMAZING!) on top?  Turned out those potatoes were the blandest things I have ever eaten in my life - I had to douse them in ketchup.  I had some of the apple strudel, which was good, but I really wanted Heidi's apfel cake.  Bummer.  The waitresses were nice but really neglected our water glasses, which pissed off my pregnant cousin - we had to order more booze every time more water was needed. Maybe go on a weeknight?
