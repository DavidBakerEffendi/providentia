Easily...Basso56 gave me a 4 and a half star experience with the food alone.  It was the service that put it over the top.  Everyone in the restaurant was sensational.  Who ever the management is knows how to run a restaurant.  (Hail!  I kiss the ring!)  The food was incredible.  Had the osso bucco with the mushroom risotto and it was cooked perfectly.  Husband had the filet mignon and it melted in your mouth.  So many different flavors.  As much as I loathe coming to Times Square, the dinner and the dining experience was well worth it.  If you can't find parking, there is a parking garage directly across from the restaurant.  Again...the food was awesome, but the service was phenomenal.   Ps.  Because of the location being in Times Square, I was wearing jeans and didn't feel out of place, but you could also wear a suit or dress and not be overdressed.  My type of joint.
