My new place to go for hotpot in Brooklyn? MISTER HOTPOT. I am so glad to have purchased the $10 for $20 deal while stumbling upon Yelp. Even though there were mixed ratings on Yelp for Mister Hotpot, trust me when I give this five stars! I rarely give five stars to restaurants unless the quality is top notch. I can finally give a hot pot place five stars! I ordered the pork-bone soup base (recommended by the waiter) which was $20. Trust me though, its well worth the $20. At least give this a try if its your first time coming here. I ordered: -Beef -Clams -Straw Mushroom -Cuttlefish balls -Napa Cabbage -Wintermelon -Wontons -Watercress -their own special fried bean curd I suggest ordering one type of veggie because they give a complimentary dish of vermicelli, lettuce, seaweed and straw mushrooms. For two people, total came out to be around $60 including the redemption of the yelp deal. I was already full (from drinking all that great, NON MSG soup). We also ordered a pitcher of Sapporo beer, which was $10. Great food quality and presentation. Friendly and helpful waiters. Place gets packed easily, make sure you get reservations. Even though I was half an hour late for my reservation, I waited five minutes to get seated. Make sure to check in to get the FREE fried fish skins! Can't go wrong with FREE FOOD! It was real good :) Would definitely come back!
