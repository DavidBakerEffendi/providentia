We were able to make a last minute reservation for 4 on a Friday night. As we walked up to the place I felt a little underdressed in shorts and a short sleeve button down but I later noticed homeboy at the bar rocking jeans and a hat... so although you can definitely dress it up at this place it's not necessary. We were seated right away at a high top in the bar area, but right up next to the front windows so it really wasn't that bad. Our server introduced herself and took our water order (tap, spring or sparkling) and then we got into the menu. We went with a dozen oysters which were super fresh - the blue points were huge and the Cape Mays were delicious. I had the Grouper with asparagus risotto special which was very good, my girlfriend had the branzino which was also really good and our two other friends had the swordfish and cod which they loved. We also shared a spinach risotto which my GF loved. Really glad we tried this place - nothing necessarily blew me away (although we kinda wanted to order more oysters after the first round) but I would definitely come back if craving seafood and want to stay somewhat local.
