OH MY HEAVENS!! My boyfriend and I came here on a date night, we've been dying to come, and it was amazing!! We shared a Bronte burger and pumpkin salad. The burger was out of this world amazing and that sweet chili sauce, it was gone before we were able to take a pic. And the pumpkin salad was delish as well, it was missing a tad bit more salad dressing but it was non the lest wonderful!!
