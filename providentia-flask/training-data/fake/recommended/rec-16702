There's a party in my tummy! The minute my girlfriends and I stepped inside, we knew this restaurant was going to be yelp-worthy! The decor was gorgeous and the scene was so much fun!  This could be an all-nighter!  The restaurant is spacious, yet still charming.  It's perfect for groups, private parties, or a romantic dinner for two!  Best of all, they have a large seating area around the bar and kitchen ... always my favorite spot in restaurants.  Especially here, where the kitchen is open and you can watch both the bar tenders and chefs work their magic. The service was fantastic and our server was so entertaining (shout-out to Jeb)!  He understood the menu and was very helpful.  The food came out at the right time and he never took our plates away before we're finished. The food here was awesome!  For constructive criticism, I would have to say the food was a bit too salty.  It's very flavorful though.  So manage your expectations, and don't be surprised if your food is salty, especially with the pastas.  Thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  Also, the portions are not very big.  I think they are right-sized, so you don't over eat and have room to try more dishes!
