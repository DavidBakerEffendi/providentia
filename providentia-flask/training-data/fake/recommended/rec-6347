tia pol is def a decent tapas place, but a bit too overrated... - my main objection would have to be the check. the wine list is waaaaaay to pricey and the selection of wines is not great. apart from that, the specials were mostly over $15 and were nothing special (aka paying 18 for a plate of mushrooms) - beyond the cost, the menu was just too predictable. very few things stood out and the 'staple' tapas were nothing out of this world in terms of flavor well, apart from that banter, the place did have some good things... it has a nice ambiance. the croqueta of the day was also a nice surprise and a bit out there... maybe i hold tapas restaurants to a higher standard, but tia pol simply was not able to wow me...
