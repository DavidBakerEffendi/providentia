As a non Pork eater it should have occurred to me by the name of the place that perhaps my eating options would be limited...and they were. The Spotted Pig is nothing like i imagined it's a cross between a pub and your old eccentric Aunt's house. Potted flowers in coffee cans in the window, tables and chairs where they can fit, an environment of controlled chaos. What was pleasing were the loads of hot English guys..Okay well maybe not loads but the two my girl friend and I met while waiting for our table and enjoying a healthy glass of Merlot or two. Indeed the food was good. I had some fish, which was cooked to perfection, my friend has the steak which was also delicious. The wait staff is lovely, wine and beer lists weren't bad. It was a bit pricier than it should have been and I may not return, unless I hear that hot English Guys come with wine for single girls each time they dine there... Word of advice if you don't eat pork, perhaps avoid the Pig!
