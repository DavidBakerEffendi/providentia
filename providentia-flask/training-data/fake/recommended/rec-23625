Very good burger and, although it's small, it's much cheaper than a bigger burger at Bobby's Burger Palace, for example.  You may want to order two if you have a big appetite.  Fries were average.  The most disappointing part of the meal was the chocolate shake.  Completely unremarkable.  I expected a lot more from a place that actually features the product in their name.   The restaurant was crowded when we went and there was a line to order, but they do a good job of keeping it moving.  Staff was friendly.   I'd go back if I was in the area running errands, but wouldn't go out of my way to return.
