Went to NYC this past summer for a couple days with my boyfriend, who had never been.   In search of a good falafel cart, I searched Yelp and found this one, which was close to where we would be.  As usual, Yelp did not let me down.  I had the falafel sandwich with white sauce, and it was easily the best I've ever tasted.  I contemplated having a second, but knew I'd regret it halfway through Central Park, so I passed.  I still regret that decision.   As a girl with Philly and Boston in my blood, I have never cared for NYC much.  But sweet jesus, this 5x5 cart is reason enough to go back.
