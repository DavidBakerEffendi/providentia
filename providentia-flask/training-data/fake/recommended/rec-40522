Second time here. Went with "Andrea C." the first time (5 star review). Still Great x1000. Went with six people this time. 1 star off because of the service. Am I weird for being insulted that the waitress gave the check to the older guy in our party despite me asking for it? And I'm always really, really weirded out when the waiter wants to take the check before we've left. That's weird. Hundreds and hundreds of good restaurants and that's only happened a handful of times. I still left a 25% tip, but I'd avoid that waitress in the future. 50 year olds making minimum wage don't leave $50 tips. Geez.
