We stopped in for dinner while in university city, remembering that my mother ate here years ago while attending a conference.  Ambiance is great from the bar to the dining areas.  We were dining late so we went right to the entrees.  My wife had the Hay Smoked Pork Tenderloin which was tender and delicious, well cooked but a little too smokey for her taste.  I had the Filet which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.  The accompaniments were creative and tasty.  Everything was very fresh. The bread was delicious too.  Our server was very nice and made the experience all the better.
