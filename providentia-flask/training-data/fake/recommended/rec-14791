On my first trip to Philly I was worried I'd be hard pressed to find a decent vegan meal, boy was I wrong! This place is amazing, awesome beer list, really friendly staff, and a great atmosphere! I've never had a "Vegan BBQ Pulled Pork" sandwich, but it was so amazing. It had that great vinegary bbq flavor you kinda want., I had it with the fresh mashed and I was so pleased I went back the next day! So good!
