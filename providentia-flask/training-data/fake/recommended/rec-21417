Ehhh. Not really worth the money. The atmosphere is fun though. Perhaps for lunch. Or for the loaded nachos and guacamole for the presentation. The tacos are literally bite size and like 18 bucks. Drinks are way over priced, no happy hour. I forget the name of this place, but there is an amazing taco spot in South Philly right after Pat & Geno's on 9th Street going north Closes at 10pm. Authentic Mexican. Best Chicken tacos and Chorizo in the city.
