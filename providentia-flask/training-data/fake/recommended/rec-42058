I'm fully prepared to upgrade this rating if I have two consistently good experiences. I'll also chalk it up to growing pains. But the wait post-order was nearly an hour. I understand: unforeseen things can happen. It appeared that the kitchen just got behind. Here are two reasons I wasn't more understanding: 1) The rampant takeout/delivery happening under our noses. Making tipping customers wait while you fulfill takeout and delivery orders is a bad look, and it's an ugly trend with startup eateries that want to "hedge". Read this carefully. You're risking alienating your first-time customers in the quest to to have it both ways. 2) There was no apology made or communication with us. Here's how you handle an unforeseen kitchen delay gracefully. -Let us know immediately, as soon as the delaying event occurs, and offer to let us cancel our orders and walk. -Free drinks. Soooo, relatively big blind spot on the customer service side. Not insurmountable, but I have my doubts about whether anyone is aware enough or cares enough to fix it.
