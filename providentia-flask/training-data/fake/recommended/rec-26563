WOW such a great place! Food is amazing and our bartender Jessica was even better! She was so knowledgeable and super friendly to us. My best friend and I were having a crap day because our flight to cabo got canceled... So when we walked in for a drink it was refreshing to have someone as cool as Jessica take care of us and turn a crap day into a great on. Oh and the music is pretty bad ass in here. Total must! Thanks for the laughs and the drinks Jess!
