Had a fabulous brunch for a friend's birthday! A three course prix fixe menu: lots of amazing food for $25 pp. Started with delicious granola, yogurt, and fruit. Followed with eggs, maplewood smoked bacon, and "Tinto hash ", added yummy grilled asparagus, and finished with delicious g√¢teau we were way too full for! Excellent service and a beautiful setting!
