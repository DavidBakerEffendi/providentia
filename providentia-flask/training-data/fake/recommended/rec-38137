The BF and I were visiting Burlington and wanted a good breakfast. Thanks to Yelp we found Handy's which is every bit as good as the other reviewers say it is. We were there around 10 am on a Sunday morning and there were only a couple of other customers there. The horseshoe counter was so nice and the owner himself was the one cooking the food. The food itself was fantastic. My eggs were perfect and the bacon was some of the best I've ever had (and my Grandpa raised pigs for a living!). They also had squeeze bottles of Frank's Red Hot readily available to everyone which is always a plus in my book. Fabulous, fabulous place. If I could give it more than five stars I would.
