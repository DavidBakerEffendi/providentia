Decent burger and fries. If you are a lover of burgers you won't be blown away. The first time I went I had this place pegged at 4 stars. My second visit made me drop it to two. The burger had decent quality meat but it was barely warm. The toppings aren't very fresh either. The lettuce is the shredded iceberg lettuce im not a fan of. My beer and the fries were delicious. But as for the burger, 3 stars.
