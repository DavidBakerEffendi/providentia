I recently had an unexpected opportunity to try this place and I am so glad I did.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our meals.  The portions were great and the food was excellent.  The restaurant was busy and the staff treated everyone great.  The atmosphere was perfect "Little Italy" and in my opinion had the most amazing energy that I have experienced in a restaurant in a very long time.  I was also lucky enough to spend a few minutes with one of the owners, Jimmy.  He made everyone seem like family.  I am not a "Yelper," however, I was compelled to write a review about this gem.  If you are in Little Italy, this place is a must~ They have put heart and love into all that is there.
