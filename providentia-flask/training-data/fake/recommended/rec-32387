The Montville Inn is a really nice resturant which offers great ambience and a menu that offers a nice selection of meats, fish and pastas.  They also have on their menu items that are from the bar menu such as fish taco's, pizza and burgers which you can order and eat in the main part of the restuarnt.  The calamari appetizer is amazing and a must try if you go there.  This restuarant also has two dinning areas, one upstairs and one down stairs for parties.   The bar area looks like a singles social place and their drinks are made to perfection. To sum it up, the service, food and ambience makes this a perfect place to go and be certain of walking out happy!
