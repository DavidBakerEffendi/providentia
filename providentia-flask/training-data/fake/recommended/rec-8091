Great service ... More meat than anyone should rightfully eat in one sitting -- but all tender and flavorful.  When you do find your way to the salad bar, you won't be disappointed.  Pace yourself... It's a marathon not a sprint.  Enjoy the flavor of the meats individually... Don't let them pile up the meat! Ate with friends from Denmark ... They loved it!
