Arrived here early Sunday afternoon, around 1pm and there was a crowd waiting outside the place. We had to wait a few for our full party to arrive but the host was very accommodating and welcoming. We were seated pretty quickly in the garden area and were even comped a bottle of sparkling wine. Everything we tried was delicious. I would definitely go back for the steak and egg brunch as well as the truffle scrambled eggs and sweet bacon. Definitely worth trying.
