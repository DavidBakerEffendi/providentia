I recently had the pleasure of being treated to dinner at Pauline's. It was an absolute treat in every way.  The service was as great as the food and drink.  The only down side is that it's a little too pricey for me to go more often.  However, I will make it a point to treat myself and/or guests now and then.  I had encrusted salmon which was done perfectly.  My date had scallops, which again, were done perfectly.  The crab cake that we shared for an appetizer was the best I have ever had; and I'm a foodie so I dabble in appetizers every place I go.  The cheese plate was fantastic, and local.  And to top off an already perfect evening, we shared the bananas foster dessert--I heard angels singing and saw beams of light as I took my first bite.  Amazing place and I am so grateful to have been introduced to Pauline's.
