The food is delicious, but you could literally read a novel while waiting to get your order. this applies equally to eat-in and take out. It's disappointing that a wedge salad takes 25 minutes to make. This being said, their utilizing seasonal ingredients and changing their menu with the seasons is a welcome addition to a neighborhood that doesnt need another crappy pizza place
