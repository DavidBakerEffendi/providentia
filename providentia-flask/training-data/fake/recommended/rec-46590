I'm basically addicted to the green curry with tofu. If you can handle a little spice you have got to get this dish. Also the king soup is fantastic and the Nom salad. And the coconut soup! The Mango sticky rice is also fantastic. Those are the only things I get. The fact that it's byob is super nice too. I'm giving it 3 stars cuz I've been pretty unimpressed by the noodle dishes. But it's still one of my favorite places to eat on Baltimore ave.
