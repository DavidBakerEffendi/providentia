Sitting at this restaurant writing this review. TERRIBLE SERVICE. Is this place for real? Every waiter is incredibly rude. The hostess is mean and rude. Never coming back and telling anyone I can to avoid this place. 100s of restaurants in this city, rather have terrible food than feel uncomfortable at dinner again
