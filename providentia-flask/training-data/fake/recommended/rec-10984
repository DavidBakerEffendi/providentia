Major problem with Brooklyn Crab. The blue crab didn't taste fresh. When I asked my server where the crab was from she said North Carolina. I was hoping the crab would be from Maryland. We go down to Baltimore every year for a Yankee game and delicious Maryland blue crab. Was really hoping it would be same quality but it's not. Oh and by the way if your serving cheap crab don't charge as if it's Maryland top quality. I'll go back when they start serving real crab.
