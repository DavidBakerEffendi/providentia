I went to Jane's for the first time today. The food was good, I had Benedict Johnny which is chicken a apple sausage pattie and egg on a sweet muffin. Delicious! My girl had the vanilla bean French toast, which was very thick but fluffy, also very good. The service was only ok and our table was wobbly in all directions but overall the atmosphere is great, good light and nice big pictures of outdoor textures. I was surprised they don't really have brunch on Saturdays with just a few brunch selections available. We'll have to go back on a Sunday to see the whole brunch menu.
