Who knew Brussel sprouts could be so good?  Really great wine recs from our server, sexy atmosphere, tasty menu items.  What a find-- I will never be able to do tapas anywhere else.  For about 60 bucks each, my party of six ate to their hearts content and each had a cocktail and a few glasses of wine.  Service got a little slow toward the end-- maybe they wanted us to leave.
