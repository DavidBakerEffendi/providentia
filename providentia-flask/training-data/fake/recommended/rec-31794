This is the second time I've been to Race Street, and it was a confirmation of my views on the Cafe. The food at Race Street is excellent and they have a large and varied selection of beers, but the service is deplorable! Both times I've eaten here the waitresses have taken forever to do anything. I understand that on a busy night there will be some amount of wait, but it wasn't busy and it took her over 30 minutes to finally come back to pick up our check. So, if you have hours to spare you should go, but expect to wait ages for anything.
