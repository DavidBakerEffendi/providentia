I went here with a group and the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced! We were in the bar area and it took the bartender literally 5 minutes to make my margarita as he made other people's drinks that ordered after me. And he knew I was waiting! Them he started telling other people in the group that it would be 5 minutes any time they ordered drinks or when we said we needed the check. The margarita I ordered wasn't even very good. What's worse, they put a drink on the bill I had already paid for in cash. I also had a "baked eggplant" that definitely seemed fried.
