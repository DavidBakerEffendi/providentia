I'm glad to see that Plan B's rating is gradually increasing - I don't understand the bad reviews.  We've been to Plan B at least 5-6 times since they're grand opening and have never had anything other than great food.  Occasionally you'll get a hiccup and eat something that just isn't your cup of tea... but the food coming out of the kitchen is solid - fresh, tasty and well made.   Even when the place is packed on a Friday night, it's nice to be able to head to the bar while you wait for your table.  The service is rarely slow, but hey, it happens.   The fried pickles and peppers - amazing.  I just always forget how hot they are and burn my mouth...
