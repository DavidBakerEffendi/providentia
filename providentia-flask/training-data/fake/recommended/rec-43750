Came here 10PM on the hottest day of the year when it was still 91 out... After 10 minutes wait, got a seat in the back, far from the blasts of heat coming whenever someone opened the door. A lot of things weren't available, and apparently the calf liver may be gone forever! However, what we did have came reasonably quickly and was delicious. The portions are small but that way you can try more things. As others have said, service is a bit slow, but that's what happens when business is booming right? I expect to be back in the future.
