By far one if my best Thai experiences. Being in New York for the first time I wanted to find a local Thai place that would makes taste buds scream. I found Noodies on yelp and I was very impressed. It is a hole in the wall restaurant typical New York size where everyone is cramped up in a tiny space. I didn't mind it because I was here for the NYC experience. We started off with fried vegetables. It was an assortment if carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, snap peas and onions gently battered and deep fried. The veggies were truly fresh and delicious. We had the chicken pad thai, perfectly cooked and the flavors were spot on. We also had the basil fried rice. Probably one of the most delicious fried rices I have had in my life. It is definitely a place to visit! Good presentation was also spot on. Their decor seemed to be better than the other Thai places around the Hell's Kitchen area.
