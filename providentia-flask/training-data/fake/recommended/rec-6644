On our way to Rice n Beans, we stopped at this little restaurant to see what all the kerfuffle was about - it had a great vibe to it therefore we were immediately drawn in... However as we initially planned to hit Rice n Beans for dinner we decided to check that restaurant out before settling in at Empanada Mama. Needless to say that Rice n Beans was a pale comparison to this little gem on the West Side. The food was brilliant, we decided to taste as many different empanadas as possible with a bit of white rice and we could not have been more right in doing so. For starters we had some plantain chips which were yummy! (currently deciding on whether we can make these at home... although knowing my cooking skills I am better off encouraging the chef). To drink we had a nice sangria - although not as delicious as the ones I have had in Spain, it was refreshing with this hot weather! Overall the evening was exquisite despite the tardy arrival of the chips (I was starving - almost ate my foot in the wait). I do not however recommend the place for groups bigger than 2 as its a narrow nook on 9th Ave.
