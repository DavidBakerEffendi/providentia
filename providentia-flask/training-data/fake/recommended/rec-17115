Nice family owned Italian restaurant.  The owner greeted us on the way in and was very friendly and welcoming.  Service was good.  Food is great and the prices are fair for what you get.  I had the lobster ravioli which was tasty and my wife ordered a grilled chicken fettuccine alfredo which was not on the menu but they made it for us anyway.  The restaurant has a dining room side and a bar side.
