Pat's or Genos? I believe that's the dilemma every visitor faces when visiting Philly. For me this was one of those bucket list things I wanted to do and also follow the steps of millions before me. I made a special trip to Pat's as I was heading back to DC. I arrived around 12 PM on a Easter Sunday (This morning) and found the parking right in front. There were no lines so I was excited. The young guy at the window looked and sounded like a Philly punk. I don't believe customer service is their thing or maybe they stopped customer service since 1930 as well. Not so sure. I ordered the original cheese steak and before I could say fries and a drink, the sandwich somehow magically appeared and I was asked to pay $9 bucks. I said, what about fries and drink? and the guy almost killed me with his eyes and loudly said, "Next window "SIR"!" Â It must be nice to make your customers feel stupid. So I went to the next window and met with other genius who was just as happy as the first dude. This "gentleman" had the same attitude but a bit less intensity. An order of fries and drink will cost you another $6. So I got my cheesesteak and took my first bite. I waited for something magical and what I felt was chewy bread and unchewable steak! You have been serving this since 1930??? I really hope not. Maybe they have cut a deal with a local dentist. Maybe there is a statistic somewhere that talks about "TMJs and Cheesesteaks in Philly"... We need to call the local news channel to look into this further. The meat was hard to chew and the bread was chewy. I think the cook woke up on the opposite side of the bed. On my next trip to Philly, Geno's will be my next stop and I am hoping it will be a lot better than this experience.
