Went to this place for my birthday with a few friends who are also big on Tapas. The prices were pretty steep for what you are really getting. I was not impressed with the food, the sangria was horrible, waitstaff were rude dropping our food off on the table very loudly and to top it off i received a call from the dept of health a week later stating that the pastry chef was diagnosed with Hepatitis!!! Dont be fooled by the romantic Â looking ambiance ... this place is not worth your money!
