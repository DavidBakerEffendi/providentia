Dosa night was way too much fun. The dosas we chose were DELICIOUS and came out fast and crispy. The Semiya Kesari dessert (included in the price) was such a lovely end to huge tasty dinner. We all were so incredibly full by the time we left. All the staff members were very friendly, smiley, and they really appeared to care about the customers. The restaurant itself isn't especially beautiful but the relaxed atmosphere, delicious food and lovely people are the real reasons to go. Overall- Highly recommended. Completely worth $11.95.
