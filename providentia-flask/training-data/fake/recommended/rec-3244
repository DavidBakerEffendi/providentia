One of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I love the Crab Guacamole, Braised short rib burrito, Mai Mai taco, the churros and the pineapple canela. The service is ok. Some times they don't use enough staff for large parties. I would ask how many staff people are they going to assign to your group ahead of time. Enjoy!!!
