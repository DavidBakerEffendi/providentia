It's time to finally give this place a review. I don't know where to start with this review, everything is just simply amazing. I'm not really the type of guy that goes for Panini's or Crostini's. Hell I didn't even know what a Crostini was until I came here awhile back, I was definitely missing out. Reason being I've never had a Panini that was made the way they do. Normally places take a sandwich they made and press it, then call it a Panini. Not this place. Everything here is made with such detail. To the taste of the food, right down to the way it presentation. I serious applaud these cooks in working such a tight space, and pump out food the way they do. Last night is what really stuck with me but I should have made my review sooner. Here's what happened: My friend Paul and I work at a restaurant downtown and after we finished closing shop we were starving (Ironic right?). We both live in queens and decided to shoot over to Bambino. Half way there we realized that they would be closing in 30 mins, so we gun it to the restaurant. Upon arrival we were greeted by the adorable young lady at the register. She had polity told us that we aren't seating anymore. We respond by asking if we can grab take out. She said "not a problem", we decided to order quickly so not to hold them back any long then they need too. My default order is always the Truffle egg salad crostini. I can eat that for the rest of my life and die happy from all the cholesterol. I forgot what Panini I ordered as well but it was yummy as well. I feel the crostini's are always a better choice than the Panini because they are always amazing. The problem I have with the Panini's is everyone I have has it was a bit salty or not balanced. Hey, I can't complain, they're still is the best Panini's I've ever had. All in all. Hands down the best Panini's and Crostini's I've ever had, I dream about this place once in a while.
