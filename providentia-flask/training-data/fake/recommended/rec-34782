SO GOOD! The food is wonderful, the staff is kind, young and stylish - not at all stuck up. The ambience is beautiful, as expected for ABC home style. My one complaint is the noise factor - it is loud but definitely tolerable if it's not an intimate occasion. Also, the bar man gave us a tip about getting a reservation (difficult to do during meal times) call at 9am the morning you want the reservation and they will put you on the wait list if anyone cancels - he said it works very well! Delish!
