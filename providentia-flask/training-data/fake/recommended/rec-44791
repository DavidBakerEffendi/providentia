I've lived here only for a few months but this place has been a frequent diner at this spot. I'd recommend any sort of ball with the Parmesan cream... it's a very unique sauce. Also, being a fan of bloody Marys I'd recommend the red wing, it's a fizzy more sour bloody Mary, so good! Everyone I've taken here loves this spot.
