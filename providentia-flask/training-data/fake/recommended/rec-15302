My family had not visited Spumoni Gardens for almost 5 years. Was it still as good as we remembered?  A resounding YES. We had a couple of slices of their famous Sicilian pizza as an appetizer and it was delicious. The entrees were also excellent. I wish we had been there earlier because by 9:45 they had run out of lasagne. Bummer.  My son and I had to choose again. They made up for it by coming us a spectacular looking and tasting Spumoni. They said it was to welcome us back after a long absence. They can be sure we will be back there much sooner after this.
