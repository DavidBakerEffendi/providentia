Came here for brunch and was seriously unimpressed. I should have taken the fact that there was no line as a red flag, but whatever, I was hungry and my brunch friend was getting hangry! The decor is really cute here. I'd like to try this place out for happy hour cocktails sometime. But another brunch? Not so Much. I started off asking about the option to add fish to the salad. The waitress was really helpful and thankfully warned me that it was not always a good idea to get fish here (it was not fresh that day). She really saved me there! But seriously? Is it that hard to acquire some fresh fish in Brooklyn for a Saturday? Anyway, I got a salad with black beans. It was OK. Nothing memorable though, and I left feeling totally unfulfilled.
