On another occasion I stopped by Sophie's like a moth to flame, but stayed away from the luncheons as I didn't want to further expand my waistline.   I quickly chose a chicken empanada and a papa rellenos.  The chicken empanada has shredded chicken and you can taste the olives and see chunks of potato.  Da bomb is the papa relleno which is this ball of fried mashed potato and inside is meat filling.  The outside is this bright orange-yellow color, no doubt form the addition of achiote.  This little ball of fried goodness was soft, rich and gooey.  The meat was nicely seasoned.   I quickly ran out of there without a second glance at the luncheon counter, as I have to avoid it like the plague.  Oh hurt me!  After getting such delicious little pockets of goodness, Sophie's gets elevated to four stars for me.
