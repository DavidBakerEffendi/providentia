Very disappointed.  I was there for lunch today, had 2 slices for $10 after waiting 15 minutes.  The slices were very small and luke warm as though they were sitting around for awhile.  The ingredients(tomatoes) tasted fresh but the texture of the crust(over cooked) and unusual looking cheese did not help the experience. First thing that comes to mind is why are there so many positive reviews for this place.  It also has a B health code rating.   Johns on Bleecker Street blows this place away. I will never go back!
