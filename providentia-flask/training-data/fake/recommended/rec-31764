Such a great place to welcome a new day. Been a couple of times and have only sat in the back courtyard. The food is amazing and how can you not be happy when you're in this little oasis of a spot with plants all around you, the open sky above you, and a full french press on your table?? Excellent service experiences every time and they're incredibly knowledgeable when pressed for information on their cheeses. They serve many specialty cheeses and I've listened to many a table pepper their server with a barrage of questions about their selections. You go there and you just can't help but be happy. It's a great experience.
