Here is my basic gripe with PJ's.  Why pay double the price for everything because it's in downtown Princeton?  Are the pancakes good?  Yes, they are.  Can you eat pancakes just as good half the price in town?  Yes, you can!  So why wait in line to pay 10 dollars for pancakes?  I don't know, but ask the people waiting in line as you walk by.
