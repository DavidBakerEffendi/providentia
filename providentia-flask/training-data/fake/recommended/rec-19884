This venue is ordinary and not really anything special in my opinion. It's really small in there and the food is mediocre. The only thing that's special about it is the fact that the dishes are pretty big; enough to split between two people.There specialty is food in the form of a pizza. I ordered the chicken breast on a pizza which was pretty good. My two friends ordered the ice coffee with whip cream and they liked it. Will I be back to this place?? Probably not. But they get an A for effort :)
