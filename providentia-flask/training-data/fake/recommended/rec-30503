Are you kidding me? This place is my favorite little cuban joint in the city....and its 24hrs. But with so many options, the only qualm I have is what to order. Not only that, but I don't think I've ever had more attentive service than I had today. The friendly, all-smiles staff, literally made about 20 stops to fill up my water and coffee. You might think that's annoying, but we were guzzling down the drinks, and he couldn't have been more discrete about it. It felt like we were queens, as I rested my feet and continued eating. First things first. If you like lime. And if you like cilantro-lime-flounder deliciousness...shame on you if you don't order the Ceviche Limena. It's the best I've ever had, and I will come back for it forever. My friend ordered the artichoke, spinach, shroom & cheese quesadilla...and the guac. Amazing. Even the Huevos...more than decent. And the corn on the cob...heavenly. The sweet corn empanadas? For 2.25 you can't NOT try it. I dangerously asked for the dessert menu...but then asked for my check at the same time. I had to cut myself off SOMEWHERE... But the place has a place in my heart. Juan Carlos you da bomb!!! Now gimme those plantain chips, guac, and ceviche pleaseeeeee.
