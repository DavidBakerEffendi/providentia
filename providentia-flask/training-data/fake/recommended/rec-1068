The breakroom came highly recommended the mixture of flavors is superb and their house chipotle sauce is a must have. I ordered the breakroom burger and fries- they contained pork belly, jalepeno, sunny side egg, bacon, green onions and chipotle sauce- the fries were a mixture or tator tots and seasoned fries. The burger is messy flavor overload in the best of ways! And if you don't like meat definitely have the fish tacos- tender and freshly fried fish the taco just melts in your mouth. Staff is really polite and friendly super plus happy customer.
