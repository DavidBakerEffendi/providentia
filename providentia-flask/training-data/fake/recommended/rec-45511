It's a small thing, but I really appreciate when a restaurant allows each person at the table to eat at Â her own speed. I love that the server didn't clear plates as people finished their individual dishes. She waited - as you're supposed to! - until everyone at the table was finished eating each course. It's such a simple thing to do to ensure that no one feels rushed. This - of course - is in addition to the truly delicious food that we ate. The home made, hand torn pasta was out of this world - and a small plate was a nice segway between our appetizers and main courses. Admittedly, we ordered too much food: two appetizers, small pasta plate, and two main dishes. But it was worth it to taste each dish and indulge in the talents of the kitchen staff. And the happy birthday message on my husband's dessert was a lovely touch. Next time we'll be sure to try a cheese plate!
