oh. my. heavens.  I love Pio Pio. I've been here several times since I moved to Manhattan and this location is by far my favorite!  The chicken is always incredibly tender and well flavored. A must-have if it is your first time here! I'm also a huge fan of the Salmon Ceviche ( awesome if you like very tangy-limey flavors). The sangria is always delish and the ambiance is perfectly mized between casual, festive and classy. The red beans and rice are my favorite side. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the Salchipapa. I know it's a classic Peruvian dish, but I feel like it's kind of cheap looking (and not very flavorful) compared to the rest of the menu. But I just avoid ordering that, and I have a great experience every time!! Highly recommend!
