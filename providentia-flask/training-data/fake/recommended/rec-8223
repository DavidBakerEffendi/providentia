Today, a friend took me to Pauline's Cafe for a leisurely lunch. The food was fantastic, the staff was pleasant, but there was a lengthy wait for the loo as there was a meeting going on upstairs. We were seated right NEXT TO THE KITCHEN. It was a cozier booth than I would prefer.  I had to ball up my jacket to fit it beside me. I witnessed a collision of waitresses, one carrying a tray of water glasses, plus the endless opening and closing of doors and loud banging of pots and pans. I had been there with larger parties for Easter brunch, and I was my friend's guest.  If I were to go there again, I would definitely ask for a better table.
