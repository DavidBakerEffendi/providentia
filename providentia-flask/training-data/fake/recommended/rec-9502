It's a big deal when I keep going back to a place in New York... And I've only been for dinner!  Le Barricou presents a dim, candle-lit, romantic atmosphere with delicious authentic French cuisine.  I've tried most everything on the menu, and been blown away.  Highlight is DEFINITELY the seasonal Brussels sprouts, but I've also loved the snails, the mussels, the skate, the lamb, the artichokes, the frites, and pretty much everything else that I've tried.  It's truly spectacular, and with an excellent wine list and drinks menu as well.
