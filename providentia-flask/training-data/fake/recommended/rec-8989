Excellent. Our waiter was great. We ordered the lamb chops and they were delicious. This is the place you take a date when you know you will be doing a lot of talking/flirting even after the meal. Great late night spot. Bar in the front and candle lit dining room in the back. Nice atmosphere. The restaurant is open until 4 AM. I would go back.
