Host/owner was not friendly at all. He was cocky and did not pay much attention. Did not feel welcome. HINT: if you have a "complete party seating" only policy at least offer the first ones in a drink while they wait for the others and don't let them standing in the door with their coats on. The space its accoustics was distracting. The door let too much cold in when new people came in. The food was reasonable however lacked inspiration and taste. For example, a dish with foie gras should at least taste like it. Overall the experience did not meet expectations and did not justify the high price. It is not likely that I will ever go there again.
