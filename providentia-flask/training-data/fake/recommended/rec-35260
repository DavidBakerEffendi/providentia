This place is great! I recently went with my girl friend for the first time and we had a great time. The place is a very clean and comfortable place, where you can relax, talk and have a great meal. We went on a Saturday night at around 5:30 and it was already pretty packed. We started with the Spicy Cucumbers... These are really GOOD! Then for main dish, we ordered Drunken Noodles and Thai Green Curry. They were both fantastic! It was my first time I had Drunken Noodles and loved it! The green curry was very good as well, but not as spicy as other places. It was perfect for us because everything else we ordered was very spicy.
