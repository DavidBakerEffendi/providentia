Pat's or Geno's? That seems to be the age old "who has the better cheesesteak?" question. And it was a question that I was happy to tackle while I was in Philly. Pat's is a no nonsense restaurant where you better not waste the cashiers time when you get to the window flip-flopping on what to order. They even have a sign for non-Philadelphians on how to order a proper cheesesteak so you really have no reason to be slow (and you better have cash or you ain't getting nothin'). I got a steak wit whiz and onions and in no time at all it was in my hands ready to be devoured. And devoured it was with much enjoyment. The fine chopped steak smothered in melted cheese whiz and onions on an Italian loaf put anything outside of Philly to shame. Now was it better than Geno's? Well, I have to take a Switzerland approach to this question since I preferred Pat's meat but Geno's cheese whiz was superior. So I guess I'll just have to get one steak from each the next time I'm in town. A Philadelphia institution that showcases the uncut, no BS spirit of South Philly. So if your feels are easily hurt or you like to be pampered and fawned over at restaurants, go elsewhere. But if you want a good cheesesteak and don't give a flip then hit this place up.
