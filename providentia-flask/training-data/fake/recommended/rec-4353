Two words: FRESH and HOMEMADE!! The cheese ravioli and the mozzarella knots with their bread... Holy crap. I mean, SUPER GOOD. All of it!!!! Get them behind the counter. A box of ravioli was like 8 bucks or so for 12... 15? can't remember I'm still in a food coma. I made my own pesto and served the rav to some friends who all were like pretty blown away. It would have been cooler if I actually could make those little crack-rav's myself.
