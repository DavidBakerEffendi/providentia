I had the al pastor tacos and they were delicious! I am a California native who lives in Los Angeles and I have had my fair share of authentic tacos, and these did not disappoint. Their margaritas were also great, my friend had the tamarind and I had habanero grapefruit, both were very tasty (and strong, not too strong though.) The spiciness of the habanero was perfect, but maybe too intense for people who don't like spicy. The location itself is small, but it is cozy and charming. The service is surprisingly great for being a busy, dark, and kind of loud (when crowded) place. My friend and I will definitely be back when we visit NYC!
