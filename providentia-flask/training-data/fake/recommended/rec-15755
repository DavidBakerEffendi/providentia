This place was great. I was initially worried that this place would be a hole-in-the-wall joint that I would get food poisoning from. Let's just say that I was wrong. This little place is actually really nice with a lot of great lighting and decorations. We were the first people to eat there on a Sat night around 6 when they opened for the night. I had the deep fried udon which was in an amazing smokey flavored broth and was just full of flavor-I thought it was great. Someone in my family is allergic to shrimp and some things just come or are made with shrimp without them advertising it on their menu, that wasn't acceptable when his dish came with 2 pieces of friend shrimp on the top. The vegetable tempura was delicious. I'd be happy to return, but, WATCH OUT FOR ALLERGENS!!!
