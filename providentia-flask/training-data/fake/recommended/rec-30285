I dont't know when this happened but this place has had a complete service makeover.  We have frequented this restaurant for a light dinner since mid-summer and have consistently had incredible service. No matter where we are seated, and who serves us, the service is great.  The staff is attentive, polite, fast and just generally friendly people.  If you haven't tried it  lately, give it another shot!
