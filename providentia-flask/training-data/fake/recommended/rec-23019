Was in town for work for 10 wks.  Got the recommendation for this place for breakfast from a waitress at the Lakeview House.  I got lucky on Sunday morning (only morning I have to sit down for a nice breakfast) & hit this place when it was very quiet & empty before the Church crowd I guess.  Crab cake benedict was good & fresh, nice accompanying bread-bisquit thing to go with it.  Great coffee, especially with my Irish creme in it!  Service was ho hum, not the greatest attention paid to me even though there wasn't many guests eating at the time.  Good place for my first visit, but wouldn't go inside if it was crowded, but that's just me.
