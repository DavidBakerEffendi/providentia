i was going to give memphis four stars for their excellent vegan sandwiches (mom and i split the smoked coconut club and the bbq seitan-- both were incredible), great atmosphere, and very friendly/fast service. then i opened up the ketchup bottle and it made a popping sound. a brand new ketchup bottle! call me howard hughes, but sometimes it is nice to get first dibs at a thing before everyone else gets their paws all over it. really though, i would gladly go back here any day of the week-- new ketchup bottles or not-- and would definitely recommend it to a vegan who has omnivores to entertain, or vice versa.
