Finally a bright star has arrived Sunnyside. My biggest hope is that our other restaurants, particular Bliss, Claret and Quaint, can step up and change their damn menu. Your biggest competition is here, people, do not be complacent. I simply couldn't believe my eyes, this place was packed on a week night when it's only opened for less than a week. And there was a line! What the hell? I was pretty sure not 100% of the customers that night were are from Sunnyside, but I had to assume that we Sunnysiders have longed for a new place to enjoy food as an experience, not just to fill our bellies. Our poor waitress/hostess was so overworked, but she was such a good sport and had such a great humor. Kudos to you! Forget about the savory dishes, the desserts. OH-MY-GOD. Salt & Fat is probably the only place in the neighborhood that you can get decent 'foodie-ish' desserts. Rice crispy treats with marshmallow ice-cream. Yup, marshmallow ice-cream that reminds you of a frozen mixture of dairy and fluff. A taste of that lychee panna cotta with yuzu buttermilk sorbet and I almost fainted. Was I dreaming? Was I really in Sunnyside? Wake up, Dennis! No, I was totally awake. And the end-of-the-meal yogurt drink. I practically grew up on that. Okay, I gotta be dreaming. No, I wasn't! Wow.
