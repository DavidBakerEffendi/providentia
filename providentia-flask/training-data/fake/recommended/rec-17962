Went last week and it was absolutely phenomenal. Not only are the dishes stunning and creative but the flavors are spot-on. Seasoning was perfect and the chef intensified and highlighted the flavors of each ingredient used in each dish. The amuse courses were super playful and well thought out. It was the best restaurant experience I've ever had.
