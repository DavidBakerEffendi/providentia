"We serve our pork chops medium sir. Is that OK?"she says.   "Sure thing. Thanks." I say. What arrived at the table was tough, not easily cut. Certainly much more towards well done than medium. Waitress was visibly upset that we shared appetizers. Clearly we were cutting into her tip and her attitude became real cold real fast and it was obvious to all of us at the table.  Very full of themselves and pretentious and not at all justified. Just another mediocre restaurant that wants us to believe they are upscale simply because they say so. I will give them kudos where due and say that the foie gras appetizer was delicious, albeit the only shining star of the evening.
