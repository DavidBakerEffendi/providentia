A wonderful evening-great service AND food! We arrived 20 minutes late due to traffic and they not only held our table but allowed us to relax Â without rushing us with menus and asking for our order. on a busy Sat night The waitress had a great personality and was very knowledgeable with the wine list and menu. All of her recommendations were spot on. All 4 of us really enjoyed the appitizers and main dishes. The pistaccio crusted stripped bass was simply outstanding along with the vegatable side (chard & spinach) as were the lamp chops.Dessert was also a homerun. All in all, a great place to go,
