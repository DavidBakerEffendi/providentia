We were in town for a wedding and the reception was held here. The food was great... it was the bar that left the bad taste in my mouth. I was interested in watching a college football game that was televised on a conference channel. I called a week prior to ensure that the game would be available there. When I arrived, the bar was playing three games on six tv's. When I asked if one of the smaller tv's could be changed to my game of interest, the bartender informed me that one patron - Jerry, a glassy-eyed and scruffy gent in a Princeton hat - was watching the tv. After 15 minutes I was finally able to get the exceedingly rude female bartender to check the tv guide and discover that.... they don't subscribe to the conference channel after all! Again, the food was great, and there were signed photos of Princeton grads on the wall (Michelle Obama - very cool), but the bartender was very rude, and the staff were clueless about how digital cable functions.
