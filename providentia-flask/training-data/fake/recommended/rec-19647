I got food poisoning here, almost ended up in the ER if wasn't for being in the med field knowing what to do. Â This is not the place that used to serve great food at reasonable prices 20 years ago, now they became too big and all is lost in the shuffle. Try other small places in the area much better and less noise than this one.
