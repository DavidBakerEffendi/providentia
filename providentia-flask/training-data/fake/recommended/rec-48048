This place is awesome!  Came here with an old friend and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We had two different ravioli dishes which were both amazing as was the soup and our desserts.  Definitely a great place to bring a date.  Prices were reasonable and the service was excellent.  So glad I found it!
