Excellent in almost every way.  Excellent food and attentive and friendly service.  Good wine and drinks list.  Only problem is that it's too small to accomodate the many people who want to eat there.  Expect a wait, it's so popular. Oh, and we've been so often we've had everything on the menu!  It's not the cheapest meal but for the high quality, it's well-worth the money.
