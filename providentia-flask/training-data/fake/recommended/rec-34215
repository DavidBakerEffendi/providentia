I was visiting my friend in Philly and we decided to try Vetri's Osteria. It was easy to get a reservation via Open Table for a Friday night visit (booked 1 day ahead), which was a plus. The atmosphere at the restaurant was great. I'd say the majority of the clientele was couples and groups in their 40s and 50s if that matters to you. Either way, we were excited to try the food. We first ordered wine, and that was a bit of a letdown. My Gew√ºrztraminer was supposed to be the sweetest and least dry white on the menu, but it was definitely dry and not smooth. My friend asked the waitress for something full-bodied like a Cabernet and the only thing she could suggest was a wine that specifically said "Cabernet blend" on the menu, and it wasn't full-bodied at all. We went through recommendations on several review sites and settled on the Octopus and Prosciutto appetizers. We were also going to share the chicken liver pasta, but the waitress mentioned the Suckling Pig as a special menu item. Given the reviews and its popularity, we went with the latter. The Octopus and Prosciutto dishes were great and I would highly recommend them. However, the Suckling Pig tasted way too fatty and salty to be edible. We never leave food on the plate, especially when it comes to meat at upscale restaurants, but we couldn't eat it after only a few bites. It was really a disappointment and we wished we'd ordered the pasta or the pizza. To avoid leaving on a sour note, we ordered the candied hazelnut mousse dessert, which was great and I'd highly recommend it. I wish I could say I'd want to come back here, but I think I'll be trying Amis next time. The Suckling Pig was really a disappointing experience for us.
