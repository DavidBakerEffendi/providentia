Amazing- just be sure to plan ahead and get a reservation. You're not going to be able to just walk in after work. Great small plates for sharing, huge sake list. They have this amazing soba special with uni that is to die for (if you like urchin). The roast edamame still on the branches makes a really cool presentation but is a bit too salty (if that's even possible). Really fresh seafood and they know how to treat their red meat.
