Brunch was a little disappointing from Cantina Los Caballitos. First of all if your air conditioner is broken on a 96 degree day don't bother opening. Second I've had better meals there before. My Huevos Rancheros were way over cooked. The yokes should be runny however these yokes were cooked to the point that they became hard boiled eggs. The only thing that saved this dish was some hot sauce and the refried beans. The other dishes at our table were not so hot either.
