Excellent sandwich just like Adam Richmond stated on American Best Sandwich. Excellent pork sandwich with Broccoli Robe and Provolone. It was definitely worth the weight. They really have system going. Even large line, it took about 20 minutes to get food to perfection. There were about 10 workers at same giving time. Event the owner was working his sweats off. I actually glad that I visited twice and second time I waited in the line. 1st time I came I was shocked with line so I wind up eating at different place. Roast Pork was excellent, vegetable was awesome and cheese definitely put all the ingredients together. I will definitely visited there again some time in near future.
