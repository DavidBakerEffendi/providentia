We went to dinner last Saturday at Salinas.  Gorgeous ambiance, as you pass by towards the back of the restaurant there is a table with fresh cut flowers, AMAZING!!! We got a table in the back and roof window was open, so we were sitting under the stars. Waiter came over right away, very friendly and very knowledgeble.  We ordered what he recommended and everything was beoyond amazing.  All the appetizers, entries, desert to die for.  We would come back anytime!!
