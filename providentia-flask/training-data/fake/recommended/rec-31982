OMG!  I just visited this place for the first time yesterday and almost had tears in my eyes the food was so good here!  I just tried the deli foods and they were all delicious.  The ingredients taste as fresh as if you made it from home.  Perfectly done Macaroni salad.  Chicken salad processed in a way that I had not tasted in years.  And a take home to bake pizza that amazingly good.  I will be back to try some of the other things that looked so delicious!  (Great staff as well, friendly and courteous.)
