I use to eat here all of the time no issues.  In the last 6 mos or maybe a little more every time I order a steak dish like 3rd ave or something similar I get sick.  First time I thought was a fluke.  Ordered the same this week and got sick as a dog.  My friend gets the pizza or quesadillas and got sick both times from the cheese.  I really hope they go back to the way they were.  Please please if you changed food vendors go back to them.
