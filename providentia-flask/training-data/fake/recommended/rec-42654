My parents just love this restaurant and they are old fashioned so when it comes time for a anniversary, birthday, special occasion for them, we typically end up here.  I certainly wouldn't  call it spectacular, but with a menu as large as theirs, one would be hard pressed to not find something on the menu that they liked.  The creamy garlic dressing is awesome at best.  I always look forward to the salad at a minimum for that very reason.  The bread they serve is always fresh and coated with honey, so that is also very good.   The lobster bisque varies in quality each time we get it, sometimes with limited chunks of "lobster" or imitation crab, other times extremely thick.  This clearly indicates that it is homemade, I just wish they would put more real lobster chunks in the soup that they call lobster bisque. The ambiance is nice for a group setting or a casual dinner with friends.  There is always plenty of room and the noise level always seems to remain moderate.  I am sure we will continue to go here since my parents are so attached.
