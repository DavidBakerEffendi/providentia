Brought my parents here and had a great experience. The food was amazing, the staff was very nice, and the flamenco dancers added that extra spice. I highly recommend the Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos even though it is a little pricey for such small portions but the flavor is spot on. The empanadas were also amazing (so far, haven't had any bad empanadas in NYC). If you're drinking, try the sangrias (we got mango and it was to die for). This is a great little place in EV so I'd say groups of 4 or less are ideal. And make sure to make a reservation since they can get pretty packed.
