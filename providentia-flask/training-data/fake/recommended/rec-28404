There is such value in simplicity. This place is the epitome of simplicity. Fantastic cheap beers and deep fried bacon paired up with high quality minimally(if any) seasoned beef make for the best burger joint in the city. The fries are of the boring frozen type but, honestly, who cares. If I want amazing fries, I'll go to Pommes Frites on the east side. I have been known to get the burger at the bistro and head clear across town for the accompanying fries. All in all, I give the Bistro 5 stars because they don't try to be anything more then what they are... a cool cheap bar with some burgers and fries.
