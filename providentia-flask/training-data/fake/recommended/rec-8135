Let's all get in the Wayback Machine!  $80 for 2 ozs of whiskey, $12 tiny frou-frou drinks for the ladies, $24 for a burger or a few pieces of lobster, overgrown frat boys wandering around duding each other.  Maybe the Garces empire thinks we're so far down we have nowhere to go but up.  On the upside, this is a really nice place to sit and all the rolls are really good.  On the other hand, the fries with cheese and shortrib is the most disgusting thing I've ever paid $12 for -- potato wads soggy from fatty liquid at the bottom of the pan, with tasteless orange cheese and big fatty hunks of meat thrown on top.  Seriously??  Has Jose Garces even eaten here??
