Amazing. From the incredible atmosphere to ever pleasing menu. Wasn't so sure about Bobby Flay as a celebrity chef, however after visiting I have to admit he is now my favorite. Staff was welcoming and friendly, even the bathrooms were kept well stocked and clean. Best meal I've had in the city in some time. Thank you!
