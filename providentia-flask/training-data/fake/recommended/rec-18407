I've been waiting a long time to dine here and finally got a chance to last weekend.  I was afraid my expections were too high, being that Zahav has been on many top restaurant lists.  The atmosphere and ambiance is very modern and hip.  The music was randomly awesome ranging from yeah yeah yeahs to salt n pepa.  Once seated our server explained the food and the menu.  We decided to do the Tayim tasting.        Our meal started off with an assortment of small salads including beets, cucumbers, kale, and others I can't recall.  Also the homemade hummus accompanied the salads.  Now let me just say this hummus is orgasmic!!!  I've had my fair share of store bought hummus and wow, this stuff will blow your mind!  Using the fresh pita as an edible shovel, I couldn't inhale this stuff fast enough!  Moving on we had seared foie gras (ordered seperate from the normal tasting). Foie gras is one of my guilty pleasures and this one was creamy good with a nice smokey char.  Next we had smoked sable, crispy duck tounge (our least favorite) fried cauliflower, and crispy haloumi.  I really enjoyed the salty perfectly cooked cauliflower.  For our mains, we had the Bronzino, and lamb merguez.  The fish was excellent though I couldn't eat the crispy skin but my gf loved it.  The lamb was quite spicy but good.        All in all everything was excellent.  The service was impeccable.  We had fresh plates and a wiped down table after every coue of dishes.  Also our sparkling water was refilled before we even took our third sip.  Micheal Solomonov created something great and I'm looking forward to dining here again and at his other restaurants.  Believe the hype and make a reservations, you'll thank me!
