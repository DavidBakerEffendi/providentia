I was very excited to try this place but it was a bit disappointing. It's not terrible but you can do much better. The physical place is fine and the service is fine as well. For one the food is pretty limited - as far as entrees go, you are limited to picking filling for an arepas meal. I tried both the beef and the vegetarian, they were 'ok' but short of good. What essentially kills the place for me is the price, it's rather pricey for what they offer and will likely leave you unsatisfied for the cost.
