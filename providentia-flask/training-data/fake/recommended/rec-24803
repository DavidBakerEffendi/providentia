A few years ago, I spent my time wandering through Germany looking for the perfect gausthaus....it should have great beer, tasty food, a decent view, and reasonable prices.  Researching the Perfect Gausthaus was, in some ways, the highlight of my life! Fast forward a few years to Philadelphia, PA...where lo and behold, I find a place that would have certainly made my Top Ten Perfect Gausthaus list!   Although I didn't order food, they did serve up a very nice Pilsner for me and allowed me to take it outside to a table!  The weather in Philadelphia was cooperating so it was a pleasant evening to sit outside and enjoy the view and vibe. Everybody in town is so friendly, people kept passing by saying, 'Hello' and smiling! I might move here.
