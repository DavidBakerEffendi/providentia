Ok so I decided to go here for sushi because of the great reviews I read on here. I expected amazing sushi, well that wasn't the case. My tuna roll was terribly mushy and the spicy sauce was mostly mayo which made it have a sweet taste. The edemame was also over steamed and mushy. I got a bowl of miso that was about 10 oz. of broth and maybe a piece or two of tofu. I ordered the center city roll and they sent me god knows what but it did not have three of the ingredients listed, which were fish! I don't know, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I am still kind of confused because of the tons of great reviews. I would, however, give it one more shot. Maybe i got an off night or I went too late, whatever the problem I have to say it's some of the worst food let alone sushi i've ever had.
