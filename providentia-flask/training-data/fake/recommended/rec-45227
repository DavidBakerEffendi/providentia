As good as a diner gets.  Tops is TOPS!!  Great service too!  This is the only diner that I see people ordering off the drink menu.  And the drinks are very large.  That is what keeps me from ordering them, cuz I would be scru-unk!!!   Now, my hubby loves the salads, especially the spinach bacon, he orders it with the chicken salad (he says it's yummy) and goat cheese.  I have gotten the mango salad and it is very good.  But I LOVE the juevos rancheros!!! I see many people ordering another signature dish in the Fish Tacos.  Hubby likes the Lobster Mac n Cheese too. I hear the just changed the specials menu, and the are pricey, but just order the fun stuff off of the regular menu.  You can't go wrong.  THE BEST KEPT DINER SECRET IN NJ.  Beats Tick Tock hands down!
