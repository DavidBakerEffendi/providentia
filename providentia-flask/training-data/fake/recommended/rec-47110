It felt very much like a large brasserie you would find in Paris.  Some of the negatives mentioned in earlier Yelp posts seem to have been ironed out over time.   Pros: Interior is very well done, they took special care with the details. The food is very good! I especially enjoyed the onion soup, steak-frites, salmon and trout amandine (whose haricots verts [greenbeans] were to die for!) Cons:  Loud, though I found this actually lent to the restaurant's atmosphere. The wine carafes are not that great, choose something else from the wine list.  Pricey (not bad by fine dining standards, but another place I can't really afford).
