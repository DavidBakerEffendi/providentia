My bestie took me here after telling me she comes here about 1-2 times a week. So I HAD to try this place out. Final verdict: Totes awesomeness! My friend didn't disappoint.   I got the Pork and Duck Dumplings with Hot and Sour soup. Then I tried the Duck pancake ( It kind of tasted like a bahn mi - but with a triangular sesame bun).   It's a hole in the wall with awesome food.  You have to come here.
