I'm kicking myself in the butt for not writing this review earlier (we went on 5/18/12) but better late than never. After my hair appointment, we headed over to the Village for lunch at Little Owl. We were told it would be a 10 minute wait but it turned into 30 minutes which was annoying BUT the 2 free glasses of champagne made up for it. We had a great table next to one of the beautiful windows with a beautiful building across the street. We had a calamari appetizer and I ordered a chicken breast with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered the cheese burger. The food was delicious and service was attentive. We kept wondering why people were taking photos of the building we were in and we later learned it was the Friends TV show exterior above us and the neat building across the street was the oldest wood house in NYC!
