Hands down my favorite mexican restuarant in philly. I've been there 6 times now and I still haven't been disappointed. I've tried every single one of their guacs and they're all amazing. I also get the mahi mahi fish tacos every time and those are to die for. Order anything you want off the menu and you won't be disappointed. All drinks are amazing as well. I've tried most of the margaritas and they're all delicious. Service is also great and don't forget to check out the photobooth before you leave. *Make sure you make a reservation for dinner time. You can get away with not having a reservation for lunch but you definitely need one for dinner time.*
