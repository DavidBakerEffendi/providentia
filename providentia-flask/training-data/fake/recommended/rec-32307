The upstairs music venue is a GREAT spot to see a show. 5 stars easy. Sound quality is exceptional and they treat the musicans with respect which will always translate to a good performance. The space itself is intimate and cozy. The upper balcony gives the audience a unique perspective. The Bar/restaurant is also good. They get props for being one of the first of its kind in Fishtown. Always a good selection of local beers and food is always solid. The Gospel brunch on 2nd Sundays is always a good time!
