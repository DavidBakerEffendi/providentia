Passing through town and trying to get a late night bite to eat in an unfamiliar city, we stopped here. Staff behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The hot dogs were big and tasty, and they absolutely do not skimp on toppings. Mine was so loaded up that I really had no choice but to eat it with a knife and fork, which is fine, but I do wish their paper plates were at least big enough to actually hold the food entirely on them. I had chili and onions dripping onto the table the second it was set down. Get the everything bun on your dog. It's worth it. Did not try the mochi.
