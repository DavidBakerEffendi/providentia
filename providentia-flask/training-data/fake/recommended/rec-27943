First off--Great cocktails!! So many choices and they all looked great when they came out...I had the blood orange mimosa which was served in more of a margarita glass, but I wasn't complaining! We went with a small group of girls on a Friday night and shared a bunch of appetizers, the blue cheese chips were amazing, and a huge portion, we also had the mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes and crab cakes, all quite tasty, definitely a step up from the average bar food.   The atmosphere was very laid back too, we probably could have sat there for hours chatting, even though it was a little on the loud side.  And we also got to sample some of the desserts, due to a nice gentleman who sent them over to us at the end of our meal, I wouldn't order dessert here again, but since I didn't have to pay for it, I certainly enjoyed it that night!
