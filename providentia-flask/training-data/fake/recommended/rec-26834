I am going to start my review with one bad thing. The first time I went to this place a bunch of old people were working the counter and grill and my burger came out rather mediocre compared to the one I had in upstate New York a few months prior to that. So, I stayed away from the place. Fast forward a year. I was in the mood for a burger and I had no choice, but to give Five Guys another try. This time I ordered fries along with my burger, and let me tell you. Best choice I have ever made. Burger was good, fries were AMAZING. To my surprise the employees seemed younger than the last time I visited, so I was a little unsure as to how the service/burger would turn out, but I was proved wrong shortly. Writing this review makes me want to pick up and go right now (which I think i might!) Bottom Line: There's honestly no better burger in town. I do want to warn my fellow yelpers that getting the regular size fries means that you will get the whatever fits in the little cup they have plus about 3/4's of your brown paper bag will be filled with fries. This can be both good and bad because one order of regular fries is perfect for two people (save money), but may be a little too much for one person (waste food). I have tried throwing it in the oven to reheat, but it's just not as good as the initial taste. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! If you live on the east coast and never had Five Guys..you are MISSING OUT!
