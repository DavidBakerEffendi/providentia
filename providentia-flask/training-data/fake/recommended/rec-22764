Growing up right across the GWB in NJ, Korean food and culture was everywhere. Nothing in CT beats these authentic places but this place is still very good. The pork neck is our favorite BBQ meat, but all are solid. They are grilled at your table. The banchan sides - you get about 12 to 16 - are good but nothing amazing or authentic or as varied like the places back home. The spicy soups are also good. The portions are decent but somewhat over priced. Compared to NJ, the service is an upgrade. Have gone again and will continue to go until I find a better place in the area. Still a 4 star meal. Also next to CT Bev Mart which makes the trip worth it to grab some craft brews.
