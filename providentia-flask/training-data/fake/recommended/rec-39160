Wow! I'm admittedly such a sucker for a small, owner operated place with a counter and stools.  My friend, Danny, told me to find Taim and after a couple of near misses over the course of a couple weekends, I finally committed to walking the blocks until  I did. He was right, it's REALLY good and a gem. The doorway is papered with write ups and reviews from the NYT, New Yorker and other mags.  Inside... there's about 6 stools, a counter at the window and a tidy kitchen/counter to place an order. The menu up high on chalk boards had what I was looking for- fresh falafel, pita, tabouleh, pita. Yum. I chose the "mix plate" which had all 3 falafel flavors- Cilantro mint, red pepper, cumin.  Accompanied by a fresh, coarsely chopped tomato/cuke salad, tabbouleh (full of bulgar) , a dish with 3 dipping sauces (the spicey was SO good) and fluffy, hot, puffy pita. I couldn't get enough or eat it fast enough.  The pita was fresh, really fresh. The rise was still warm, not your typical pita/flatbread disc we're all used to. The dipping sauces were really good, tasty, fresh and a compliment to the falafel. I'll admit that I'm not a falafel expert but I like what I taste and loved what Taim served up. Each was freshly prepared, a small ball bigger than a jaw breaker but smaller than the ping pong size we're used to. The flavors were distinctly different and subtley delicious. It's NOT an easy place to find. Not because it's hidden, instead because it's on the side streets off the avenue, has a no profile store front and the TAIM sign hangs high, up near the tree line. Search for it and you'll be rewarded. I can't wait to go again and hope there's NOT a line.
