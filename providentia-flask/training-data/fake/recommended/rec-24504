While way out of the way, this is a great place.  Great wine list and very tasty dishes.  We had the octopus and the buratta and both were excellent starters.  Then the rabbit and the salmon which were both excellent.  And then we finished off with the chocolate mint mousse which was a great final touch.  Great ambience and great service.
