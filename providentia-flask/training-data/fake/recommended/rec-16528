To start with the guacamole is perfect but I recommend not ordering the Aquachile drink.....the combination of flavors listed on the menu for this drink sounds delicious and interesting but I had to water down the second half of my drink just to get it down.  I also asked for no salt but it came with salt anyway.  After I finally finished it I switched to a regular old margarita next which was good.  The mole sauce on the enchiladas does not taste like your typical mole sauce....it is semi sweet with no kick or spice.  When we informed a waitress that it wasn't what we expected she responded with major attitude.  Our regular server was more accommodating and we instead ordered the enchiladas dona blanca but added chicken and they accidentally brought us enchiladas verde at first but once the correct dish came it was delicious.  Their red salsa is to die for but I swear it's a copy cat recipe of Chevy's fresh mex.  We asked for more of it halfway through our meal but it never came :-\  Prior to the correct enchilada arriving we ordered the 2nd round of drinks which didn't show up until WELL after we finished eating and by that point I didn't want it anymore.  My water glass was empty for too long prior to them refiling it as well.  After waiting forever for our 2nd drinks, we waited even longer for the check.  The food was great so we will definitely give it another try...perhaps it was just an off night.
