They are completely Â what they advertise. There are fries and a million sauces. Quick and easy finger food and pretty filling (They are potatoes after all!) I tried the Parmesan Peppercorn and Cheese Sauce and I LOVE the Parm Peppercorn. Everyone should try it at some point, but if you're unsure you can always ask them for a taste of sauce before committing. The place is really small, so be prepared to have to stand outside or to eat on the go. I'm going back to try more sauces I'm going to be back the next time a craving for fries hits me.
