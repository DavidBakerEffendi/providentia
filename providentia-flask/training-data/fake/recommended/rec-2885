I've been to Shifty's twice now - once to eat in and once for takeout. So it seems like now would be a fair time to give a review. Both experiences at Shifty's were really awesome on all accounts. To start, the ingredients in all of the tacos were fresh and flavorful. And the combinations really work well - like pulled chicken with mango sofrito or braised brisket with chipotles in adobo. Â But my favorite has to be the "Shifty" with chicken and chorizo together. When you get three big tacos for $8, you can't beat it. On top of that, the service was friendly and attentive. On our second trip, we took our order to-go. We were headed to the Mann so we did not go too far, but our food traveled well. Our taco orders were put in boxes and were pretty close to the shape they would have been had they been served table side. Regardless what you order at Shifty's, do yourself the favor of saving room for dessert. The Plaintain Pudding is unreal. Served in a chocolate crust, it's looks like Shifty's take on Barbuzzo's salted caramel budino. Except, it may be even better. Valerie Safran and Marcie Turney: beware.
