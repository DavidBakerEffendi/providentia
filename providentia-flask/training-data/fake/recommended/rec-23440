I love places with small plates, particularly Asian-influenced restaurant - it gives you a chance to experience different fantastic tastes without feeling like a fatass.  I went here with a friend, and we started off with this delicious apricot ale, then ordered the steamed pork buns and the kimchi beef lettuce wraps.   They were both absolutely delicious - the pork buns were neat and tidy and had the oddest fluffy texture that we great, with a delicious spicy filling.   The steak in the wraps was some of the best I've ever had; my only complaint was that they were a bit messy.   Each small plate had three buns/wraps.  For dessert, my friend accidentally ordered me the lychee panna cotta, which was a disappointment since I am just not a fan of gelatinous desserts.  The accompanying sorbet was very floral, as was the panna cotta.  I wasn't a fan.  My friend ordered the homemade rice crispy treat with marshmallow ice cream.  I could have easily eaten a pint of the marshmallow ice cream.  They give you these cute little Asian creamy drink bottles before you leave.   All in all, a great experience.
