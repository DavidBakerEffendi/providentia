We love this place. If you're a vegetarian (I am) there aren't a ton of great meatless breakfast options but they still have a few good ones. They updated their menu recently and it looks like they've expanded their options which is really nice. The atmosphere is really cozy and relaxing. The hot cider they keep at the bar in the cold months can be spiked with either spiced rum or whiskey depending on your preference and I highly recommend it.
