I'm in town for a convention and went looking for something I don't eat as often in Cali. Rangoon was a quick walk from the hotel and got pretty good reviews, I figured I'd give it a shot. Restaurant was pretty quiet, and I got a seat right away. The server poured me a water and left the pitcher on the table...not used to that. It's fine when you have the room, but I didn't think it was a sign of great service. I ordered my shrimp lemongrass soup. A small somewhat sloppily poured bowl arrived (see pix). Another sign of service quality. The soup was tasty, a strong/sour/savory lemongrass, tomato, and chicken broth with some small mushrooms and a lonely shrimp floating. The main course arrived a few minutes later...accompanied by a chipped bowl of white rice. I'm not asking for Lennox china and crystal goblets, but chipped dishes should be tossed (cost of doing business). The mango chicken was fine at first taste, but got sweeter with every bite until I felt like I was eating dessert for dinner. The chicken was tasty, mango seemed fresh and firm, ingredients were fine....but the cloyingly sweet sauce was overpowering.
