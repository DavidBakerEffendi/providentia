Went here with my boyfriend and his parents after getting some groupon-type deal for it. We had a great time! Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service and ambiance was amazing. My only complaint is that I thought the food was a little salty, but my boyfriend's parents LOVE salt so it was perfect for them. The hostesses could have been a little friendlier, but our server was a delight. Usually you get a little of an attitude from the staff when you whip out your coupon, but he was super nice about it and because of that he got a really nice tip. Overall, it's worth the money and a definite have-to-try at least once in Philly. I would come back here again.
