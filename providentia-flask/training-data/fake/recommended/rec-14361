Apparently this is the place to be right now (Summer 2014)? The wait was very long, even around 3pm. We went across the street and stayed longer than the proposed wait time, but they held the table for us anyway :) The truffle fries are delicious, and the five leaves burger was very good. I'm not sure about the beet and pineapple - a little sweet for the burger (two sweet things) and was a pretty thick chunk, so couldn't mask it. I guess I could have taken it off the burger, but didn't do that :) Ricotta with honey on raisin pecan toast was a great starter. Very busy and hopping.
