Just went for a cocktail, cheeses and coffee/dessert.  Staff was very curteous and attentive and the chocolate pudding w salt was phenomenal.  Espresso was robust and great complement to the dessert.  Atmosphere warm and romantic.  Well worth the short walk from our downtown brooklyn hotel.  Highly recommended.
