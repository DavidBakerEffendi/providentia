Last week my friend and I were tackling her bucket list of must try eateries in Manhattan.  That coupled with my New Years resolution to expand my list of go to restaurants in my neighborhood brought us upon this amazing little nook.  The restaurant we intended to go to was packed, which led us to Five Tacos. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar of this spotless little joint and decided to have a drink and try the tacos. The food was incredible and the different sauces complemented the tacos perfectly.  I am very big on service, and the staff was very attentive and accommodating. Definitely a must go!
