Anchored Inn's a pretty funky place. I dropped in during a Bushwick warehouse-y bar crawl, and I'm happy we stumbled in here. It's definitely got the punk vibe going on, and the odd portraits on the wall provide good conversation. I didn't try the food, and the beer selection and prices were about average. I'd definitely be back, it was easy to have a fun time here.
