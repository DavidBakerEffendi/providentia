Awesome food and awesome waiter. The waiter was very friendly and funny. He recommended the ropa vieja and the shimp and spanish sauce. So we figure what the heck, they wouldnt recommend something they dont feel confident in, so we got that and the avocado salad. I got the roja vieja with rice and beans and fried sweet plantains and the shimp dish with white rice and yuca. The ropa vieja is amazing. its shredded beef in tomato sauce. the beef was really tender and juicy. The plantains were really good too. it was not over saturated and fried just right. Then we had the shrimp with spanish sauce... I have no idea what they put int the sauce but it was great. We actually took the sauce to go at the end of the meal. The avocado salad is just sliced avocado. The price was decent, the food and service was A+. Will come back to try more of their menu.
