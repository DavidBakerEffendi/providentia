NOTE TO OWNER: Your servers leave a lot to be desired.  You need to know that our waiter said the special was "black striped sea bass."  When asked whether it was black bass or stripped, he stuck to his story for a while before giving up and getting the right answer.  Kind of lame for a seafood place.   Also, put up a sign somewhere that you are cash only.  Thanks. But I'll come back.  Price is right, and love the variety of the menu.  Don't mind the decor at all either.
