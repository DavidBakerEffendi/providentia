My favorite Thai restaurant of all time. Everything here is fucking awesome and it's CHEAP. The ambiance is great. During the summertime, they open up the back patio which has great seating and since it's nearly perfect out on a Brooklyn summer night, the whole experience is just awesome. I wish this place was near my house!!
