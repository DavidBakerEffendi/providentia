We ordered take-out and everything was delicious, from the salad and soup with the entrees onward.  We had the Haitian caviar, which was as tasty as everyone said it was, and the creole okra, bayou shrimp, trini chicken, griot mi case, and the whole tilapia special.  Not a single thing was disappointing. We will absolutely come back.
