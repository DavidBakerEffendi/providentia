What a cute and quaint restaurant! Tucked in between and amidst the brownstones on Union street, this restaurant is a hidden gem.  First off, the atmosphere truly emphasizes the Park Slope neighborhood feel.  The staff was truly friendly, especially our waiter who was very attentive and helpful.  I haven't received great service like this in such a long time, last when I was in Spain. My hubby and I came for brunch and pleased to see an affordable brunch menu, including a brunch pre-fixe deal in which you get to choose one entree, choice of coffee or tea, and mimosa or sangria - all for $16.  And, for each additional mimosa or sangria, it's only a buck more!  I did expect my brunch entree, grilled fish with corn, to be somewhat tastier and complementary to each other, but it was still decently good.  The mimosa was splendid, tasted like there was some freshly squeezed OJ in there.  Sangria was too strong for my taste, but that's just me speaking on a Sunday early afternoon. My favorite was the complimentary servings of the bread.  Our waiter was really nice about it and offered us more and more since I was so inquisitive and showed my love for the bread, but of course I had to decline the third time.  This was no ordinary bread.  This was homemade baked plum bread with brown sugar, nutmeg and the special spices. A lot of love was put into this baked oh so goodness.
