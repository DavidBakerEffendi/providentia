This has become my neighborhood go-to for a good sit down dinner. The interior is artfully distressed the tables plainly adorned with a tea light and flower.This is totally great for dinner dates as it's quiet and private. As far as the service I have had good nights and bad nights here, it seems like they get people in rushes and sometimes it harries down the waitstaff. As for the food, most of the time everything is great here, though I have had undercooked eggs on my Benedict before, but we go here a lot so what's an occasional undercooked poached egg right? They will have variations on a steak, roast chicken, a fish, chop and a burger always, but with a seasonal preparation of vegetables. The cocktails are always great and change seasonally. A charm is the delicious piping hot bread they serve which is baked in a terra-cota pot and always brought without asking. They always accommodate us when we bring the baby in the stroller, and for the record I am a conscientious diner and my kid sleeps through meals if he starts making noise I go outside with him. Like many businesses in Greenpoint there is one step up at the entrance.
