I'll give it points for good food, but I'm going to have to take some back for space.  There are railroad apartments and there are railroad restaurants.  Ended up here on a Thursday night and this place was packed, which says something, right?  We opted to sit at the bar and got bumped into so much that we couldn't really enjoy the whole experience.  The bartender was a little on the snobby side (certainly not warm and friendly) and almost seemed put out.  So here's the deal: the food is good (may I have more lamb skewers, please?), but based on the overall environment, why settle when there are plenty other tapas joints with the "whole package".
