I just went to a grocery store after my meal at Marc Forgione. The portions were so incredibly small that I had to go get something to eat, after we dropped $180 dollars at Marc Forgione. And it wasn't even that good. I was a huge fan of this restaurant, my husband and I have been touting it as the best in NYC for three years, and now, we'll never go back again. I can only assume that they decided the effort was not needed after Mr. Forgione won Iron Chef? Will never go back again. Do not waste your time or money, trust me. There's a million great restaurants to go to in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
