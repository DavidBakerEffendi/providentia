Dear Saki Bar Hagi, Last night I had to wait. Not the normal 15 minutes (even though you say 40) but almost an hour and 1/2! Why is there a perfect speaking English kid who I don't think is of Asian decent of any kind working your table list? And why did he seem slightly slow and clueless? My love for you runs deep so I will be nice and not hold this against you. This time. Next time I'm dropping a star. You obsessed food lover, Darcy
