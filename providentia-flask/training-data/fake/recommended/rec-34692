Rich, delicious Mediterranean food. On the pricier side, but so worth it. I've never had trouble getting a reservation here, even for larger parties, and the food is seriously amazing. I have brought friends, guests from out of town, family - everyone and anyone LOVES ilili. Food to Order: Order the Brussel Sprouts! It's one of those items you crave and crave until you go back for more. The Lamp Chops, Beef Shawarma and Semolina Gnocchi are very good as well. Drinks: As a person partial to fruity drinks, I love the From Beirut with Passion. The Not So Bloody Martini is also delish - very refreshing and healthy yet tasty.
