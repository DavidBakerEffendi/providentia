There are tons of lamb and rice cart in nyc, but none compares to this one. It's a must stop place for me whenever i'm up in nyc. The place open up at 7:30pm. Usually, there's already a line formed at the cart. There's another halal cart just right around the corner. Don't be fool into thinking that it's the same. It's not! Â Always go where the line is at! That's the real legit one. For $6, you can get either lamb, chicken, or mixture of lamb and chicken with rice. I usually get the mixture , but as of lately, i've been getting the lamb only. I usually don't eat lamb, but this is the only time where it's an exception. I had bad experience eating lamb before. I couldn't like the taste and smell of it. However at this place, they use a lot of seasoning, which makes the meat really good and edible. A lot of people like the white sauce that it comes with. However, i love the hot sauce! It's extremely spicy! A little bit of it can make you sweat like a pig and have you begging for lot of water. I would love to get the recipe for it! It's a must try place for all the foodie out there!
