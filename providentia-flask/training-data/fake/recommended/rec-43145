There is no worse place to watch football than here. They don't have the Sunday ticket. And when they do have you're game on, they play the sound from Red Zone. So you can't even listen to the only game playing in the bar. Plus management does not get back to you when you email them for an explanation. We work in fidi and stopped ordering all together.
