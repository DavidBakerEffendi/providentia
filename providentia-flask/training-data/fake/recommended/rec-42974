Candence R. and I went here for a wee mid-night snack after my stomach had settled from something earlier in the day.  We got a double to split (plenty!) And 3 sauces to accompany.  We had: Sweet Chile--YUM! Peanut Satay--Nice, Something different. Peppercorn Parmesean-Underwhelming, perhaps overshadowed by the Sweet Chile. This place took me back to my late night Frites fests when I studied in Holland.  Can't they open on of these in DC?!
