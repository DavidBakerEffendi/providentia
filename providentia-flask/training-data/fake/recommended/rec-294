I absolutely love the smith!  I've been to all of their locations and never had a bad meal.  Really trendy, lively atmosphere.  This is definitely a place you come to eat and not just grab drinks.  Good for dates or a group if you're ok with a louder atmosphere. A place you would come if you're looking for more of a scene with good food.
