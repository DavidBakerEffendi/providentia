Outstanding. Best mac and cheese I have ever had. The monk fish, which is what I had for my entree, was perfectly paired with bacon pieces, oysters, fingerling potatoes in this creamy broth and it was all amazing. I think of this place as a special occasion restaurant, as it can get pricey but it was totally worth it.
