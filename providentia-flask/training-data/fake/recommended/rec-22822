This is one of the better Italian restaurants in the greater Hartford area. The food isn't heavy, covered in cheese, and/or in gigantic portions as is typical in some places. The vibe may seem like it's super dressy/classy but there are plenty of folks in casual attire. Parking is a breeze with either valet or street. Service can slow down a little when they get super busy, but it's very friendly and attentive. This most recent time we'd ordered off the wine list and the waitress came back to let us know that they'd run out. We ordered again, and what do you know? They were out of that wine as well. This time the manager came over, apologized, and offered another bottle of wine that was more expensive at the same price as our original request. It was a little weird that we kept picking a wine that they didn't have, but we both appreciated the sincerity of the apology and the 'replacement' deal. My wife and I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed it every time. We'll definitely be back!
