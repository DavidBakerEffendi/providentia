I'm such a big fan of this place. The bartenders are always so friendly and knowledgable. Whenever I can't decide what to drink they know just what I want. The menu is full of amazing things. The veggie wings are a favorite as well as the burger and the chicken n waffles. I can't get enough of this place.
