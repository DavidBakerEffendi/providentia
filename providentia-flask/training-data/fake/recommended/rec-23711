Ahhh Sahara Grill, how my taste buds wish you were around the corner!! I'm thankful I found this place as it truly reminded me of my trips to Paris and helped curb my overwhelming lamb gyro cravings!!! Visiting Philly for a business meeting sent my co-worker and I out searching for a place with good food. Seems simple enough, right? The hotel thankfully had a list of places within walking distance and after giving Asian, American, Italian and seafood the ax, we decided on middle eastern. Flipped a coin and BAM!! Off to Sahara Grill we go. Walked in the place, there were 2 other tables occupied. Hells bells we thought, what have we gotten ourselves into? Never the less, we sat down ready for whatever food, good or bad, was brought to us. If you're expecting first class service, DONT! The "waitress" looked like she wanted to be somewhere else, ANYWHERE else watching the soaps but she dragged her feet over to us to take our orders. Once the place started jumping a bit more, it seemed as if someone lit a fire under her butt. I digress... We decided on the falafel with tahini sauce, spicy lentil soup, lamb kebabs and the one of their specialty plates, don't remember what it was called but it had sliced lamb and beef, delicious spiced rice w/ pine nuts and awesome grilled veggies. Oh yea, don't forget the fresh lemonade (and it really was fresh) ALL items were awesome, lamb and beef so tender; what else could a girl want? Co-worker went absolutely bonkers over their baklava and wanted to order a pan to bring back to VA. I can't speak on it since I didn't taste it but she's such a picky eater, I figured it must be cause since she was going that crazy over it. I give this place a solid 2 thumbs up for the food alone. Came back for a visit 2 days later. Yea, I enjoyed it THAT much so next time I'm in Philly I'll also be at Sahara Grill. That's all....
