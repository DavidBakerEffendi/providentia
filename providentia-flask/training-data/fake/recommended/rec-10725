This place is great for Brunch!! Its pretty spacious inside. You can either sit in the front at the bar area or you can have a seat in the back at a private table. The food is extremely fresh. The service we had was great the waitress was very friendly. I had the smoked ham, cheese and egg sandwich on a bun with potatoes. The food was excellent. Im not sure what type of bun it was but it was really delicious. I would highly suggest this dish and this place Â if your going for brunch!
