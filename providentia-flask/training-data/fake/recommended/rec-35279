I was searching for a bar with a happy hour for an after-work beer. Although there is no happy hour at the Cock & Bull, my friend and I went anyway and discovered a good atmosphere for food and drink. I felt the food was a notch better than your standard pub fare. Cock & Bull sells itself as a genuine British pub and it's easy to see why by the menu items. Over the course of a few visits, we've had the bangers sandwich, their hamburger, fish and chips and a pot pie. All dishes were served with reasonable portions and good quality. In particular, the bangers sandwich was served with a delicious mustard that made the flavors jump. On a side note, the bangers and the hamburger was served with a shredded French fry which was slightly thinner than a shoestring cut. They were different, yet delicious! The only disappointment to the dishes we tried was the fish and chips entr√©e. I felt it should have had more fish, given its high price ($20). There was only one piece in ours and it wasn't especially big. Finally, the service here is very decent and we got a waiter whenever we needed one. The crowd here is a mix between tourists and the business crowd. I would say 80/20 in favor of business people. There's a giant projection television over the entrance and many smaller tv's sprinkled throughout two levels. Also there's some British paraphernalia adorning the walls to make sure you don't forget it's British-town for you soccer/football fans. Overall, if you are coming here for a meal, it would cost you nearly to $30 per person with food, one beer, and tip. Although it's not exactly cheap, the quality is good for the price.
