to say i really like this charming place would be an understatement. the decor was eclectic, simpatico and amusing. we were fortunate to be sitting next to the windows and discussed at some length the way the light hit the windows of the building across the street, which in turn reflected golden beams of sunlight onto the mirrors on the wall of the restaurant, which in turn bathed the lovely senorita l. in a rosy glow. we also had a silly discussion about a strange but amusing statue in the room, of a nude woman. her head was disproportionately small; her facial features were rudimentary in contrast to the rendering of her torso. what amused us most though, was the elaborate and peculiarly stylized depiction of her pubic hair. it is a petite place, perhaps a bit too petite if one has claustrophobic inclinations. i wonder if the name of the restaurant is ironically redundant as it is in english. the server was a wonderful character. she had a kindness and joie de vivre about her, that contributed to the rosy glow and bon ami ambiance. briana m. was kind enough to go out and buy a fine malbec that was perfect with our meal. imagine my surprise when i ordered the thai curry cod, and it was as fabulous as mr. unlucky's secret soup surprise! i guess great minds think alike. the cod had a perfect texture and each bite of gingery, coconut rich, brothy morsel was savored.
