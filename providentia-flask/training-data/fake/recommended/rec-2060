my bf and i had to see what all the hype was about! there's been lines at times, and yes, we waited! but it's definitely worth it! get the chicken & lamb rice combo! you won't regret it. compared to most other halal carts, 53rd & 6th doesn't seem to be too greasy...a healthier option to say the least. believe the hype! go try it and put some hot sauce on it!!!
