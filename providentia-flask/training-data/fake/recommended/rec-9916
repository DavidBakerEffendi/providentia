The staff was very polite, attentive, and accommadating.  While the menu had a small selection, the food was excellent.   The ambiance of the venue is also great with a decent skyline view and elegant lighting. As a bonus, parking is FREE. However, driving to the parking lot is a bit confusing as it's behind a hospital.  However, the parking garage has an elevator that leads right to the lobby where the entrace to the restaurant is. Perfect for a romantic/relaxing dinner.
