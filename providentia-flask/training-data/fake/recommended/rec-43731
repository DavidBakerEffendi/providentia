I fly from Orange County to NYC semi frequently. You want to see a funny site? How about me in my adidas running pants, hoodie and flip flops after a five hour  flight attempting to roll my suitcase through the front door of boqueria. I don't even stop at the hotel first.  I just pull up to the bar, get a glass of wine and do a silent toast to being the hell out of california and actually eating good food again. My favorites are the Pintxos Morunos and the espinacas a la catalana. The pintxos is this awesome lamb dish that I dream about in my sleep. The espinacas a la catalana is sauteed spinach with pine nuts, rasins and garbanzos.  I'm not a lamb or spinach person and these dishes have converted me. When it comes to service, you just can't beat it. The staff is great and even on a busy friday night (when i normally get it) they always try to fit me in at a bar or table... Can't wait to see you guys next month
