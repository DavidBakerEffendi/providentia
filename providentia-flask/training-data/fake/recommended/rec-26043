My wife and I LOVE this place!  We have made it our new go-to for company fun!  Slowly but surely we're introducing it to all of our house guests and friends.  The brunch is such a great deal - delicious food, perfect caipirinha and a huge cappacino for less than $15! The atmosphere is fun and lively.  Great outdoor seating in the warm weather.  I know they have a DJ some nights and live music others....I'm looking forward to checking that out asap!
