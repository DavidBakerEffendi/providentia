This was my second visit, and a completely different experience from my first time six months ago. This time I called and was unsure if I'd reached the right place because I couldn't understand the woman at all. Told her what I wanted and she said, "OK" and started to hang up. I had to ask how long it would take and was still unsure about what she said. When I arrived, the place was completely empty, she had the food bagged up already, never asked if I wanted white rice or fried rice or lo mein (assumed I wanted pork fried rice, I guess, since that's what I got). She then disappeared into the back, so asking about the free soup or soda was out of the question. Not really sure how to rate this place now. I guess I'll have to go back a third time to see which end of the spectrum my experience lies on. =====EDIT #2: July 2013===== OK, I've now been to Ming Moon three times and finally grew the balls to ask about the advertised free soup/soda. The cashier said, "Soda can only" and motioned toward the cooler. Maybe they don't offer soup in the summer? Whatever. I rate this place a solid three stars and I'll be back.
