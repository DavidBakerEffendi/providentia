Would have given zero stars if Yelp made it possible to do so!!! Horrible management! I found chicken pieces in my paneer tikka masala. We are Sahivite Brahmins and so I was obviously outraged when I found this in my kids meal. I called the restaurant and the owner started yelling back at me - "You do not know the first thing about the restaurant business!" was one of his first statements to me... "On a busy night, this is kind of confusion is bound to happen" was his next statement... Obviously, the conversation went downhill from that point on. I was appalled to learn that there is no mechanism to ensure that this error never happens! For all of you out there who do not eat meat for religious reasons - BEWARE!
