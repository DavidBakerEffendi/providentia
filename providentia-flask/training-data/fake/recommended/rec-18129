I am close to a five star on this one, but I've only had three meals there. The udon salad was a five star! It was great. The curry tofu wrap was a 4 star, and the curry tofu wrap as a salad over spinach was also a 3- surprise, right? Well the staff is amazing, and it's perfect for a quick lunch in the neighborhood. I've been to the downtown location, which is great, also, but this spot has much more seating. One downside was that there is no weather guarding for the door, and cold air was blasting in each time someone came in- we weren't sitting close to the door, so it must have been bad. Curtains would help. or make sure to keep your scarf on if you go in winter.
