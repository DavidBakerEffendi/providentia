Meh, I've experienced better.  I went in for lunch by myself before a show.  Service was really slow but not entirely unfriendly.  The pho tasted fine, but there were large _chunks_ of beef  in it, like I had gotten the bottom of the broth, it was like there was a pot roast in my soup.  The rare beef in the bowl had no traces of pink, but had been completely cooked through before it arrived at the table.  It was fine, but I don't need to go back. Hi Jennifer, I'm updating my review in response to your comments.  It's clear that you didn't even read my comment or not carefully enough to understand and only respond to bad reviews in order to try to keep your ratings up.  I'll summarize:  slow service, overcooked sliced beef in the pho, and giant chucks of beef from the broth.
