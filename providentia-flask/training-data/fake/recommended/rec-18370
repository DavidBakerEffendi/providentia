This place is fabulous! Menu choices are amazing and food so tastefully cooked. The whole experience of the environment, lighting, living walls and garden make your dining feel amazing. Plan for a wait if you choose the outside garden without reservation, even then it's worth the wait. You won't disappoint with the Veggie dishes, Cucumber plate, Marinated beets and the Crispy potato skins, must try. My favorite dish was the Potato Gnocchi! Don't miss the Talula's dining experience and charm!
