3 stars might seem harsh but here's the downside. They rush you like no other if you're taking up space, meaning just sitting there, having a drink and shooting the breeze. Also the food portions are incredibly small, so don't go there with a huge appetite. But do go there for the chips and salsa, and the margaritas, especially during happy hour.
