Just got some take out from here last night. When i got home from picking it up i had a misseed call from them, and my phone was ringing from them calling me a second time. I forget to get the bag with the appetizers in it. They sent a delivery guy out right away and the meal was complete within 10 minutes! Excellent service! We had Mongolian beef and a beef/green beans dish and both were excellent. Lots of good ginger in the Mongolian beef. The interior of the restaurant is very neat and clean and the people are friendly. I'll certainly be back for more.
