Came back to Osteria on a rainy Sunday night. This time I sat in the main dining room where I assume it would have felt cozier than the extension with the glass windows overlooking that muggy day. Some highlights- sicilian lemonade (very refreshing), vegetable antipasto plate (a must if available), special of the night was handkerchief pasta with monkfish (please bring this back again), and the prosecco sorbet flavor available that evening. Perfection.
