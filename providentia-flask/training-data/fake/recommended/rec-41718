Went here a couple of weeks ago for a get together. The food was great the drinks I ordered  were good as well.. They had a deal here when you get a free beer ( of the bartender's choosing) , but I didn't t like the beer given. I'm not a big fan of beer so  trying something new couldn't help. All in all it had a  relaxed atmosphere with the dimmed lighting and candles.  I would come here again.
