Where do I start.  Extremely rude staff and who I can only assume was the manager was so unhelpful and disrespectful.   It was almost like they don't want your money.  Apps were very good (that's why they got 1 star)  main course was really bad.  It tasted and looked sat under a heat lamp for hours.  My wife's lechon was completely dry and my chicken was on the verge of being a weapon it was so overcooked and dry.  Both sauces had 0 flavor and the maduros were extremly dry. All in all I do not know what all the fuss is about subpar food and an extremly rude waitstaff and manager mean I will never go back
