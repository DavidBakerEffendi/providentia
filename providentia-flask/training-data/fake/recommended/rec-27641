4 and a half stars, no doubt. I will make this brief, as Jasmine M (scroll below), did a great job of evoking the ambience and quality of food found in Palo Santo. My great friend Alex and I indulged - there is no better word - in the tasting menu. The owner actually told us, after we placed our order, that they do not profit from the tasting menu; they offer it so people can interact with the chefs and try new, inventive cusine. This place respects eating as an art, but not in the pretentious sense. More in the sensual, " welcome to our home" way... After the 9 perfectly portioned bites that ranged from cold soup (a marvelous roasted avocado) to samplings of fish and meat delicacies, I can ascertain that the restaurant likely does not profit from this offering. But your belly sure will. And undoubtedly, your newfound loyalty will sustain Palo Santo's continued success.
