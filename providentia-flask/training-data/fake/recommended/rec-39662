Yummay. I've been here 4, 5, 6+ times and always enjoyed my meal. It's a true crowd pleaser and at less than $9 an entree can't be beat. The portion sizes are very generous and the food is deeelish! Also, I love the decor. It gives you the impression that you're in a really fancy restaurant. It's dimly lit, with huge chandeliers and the waiters/waitresses are super dressed up. Definitely has a really cool feel to it. Location is very convenient too. It's super close to Times Square, Port Authority, the ACE, 123, NQR....I could go on and on and on.... Visit Room Service!
