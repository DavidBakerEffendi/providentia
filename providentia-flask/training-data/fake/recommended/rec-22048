Beautiful cozy romantic restaurant. The polenta with sausage was the stand out menu choice. We started off with fresh oysters for $1 each, enjoyed wines from a generous wine menu, and ordered four tapas dishes. Surprisingly large portions for a great price, the roasted Brussels sprouts came in at a close second to the incredible creamy polenta. The staff treated us so nice: we had to wait (it was crowded, always a good sign!), but we were told exactly how long we had to wait, the bartender, John, kept checking in on us, and they created a memorable experience. I'm going back!
