Everything I've had is delicious. Red Velvet Cake is AMAZING but if you're watching what you eat this isn't the dessert for you as it pretty much tastes like straight up butter. Chicken meatball sandwich w/ pesto is a must. Apple and Brie sandwich is good too. Great for dining in and delivery. They always deliver in 15 minutes or less.
