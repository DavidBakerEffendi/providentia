Cafe Triskell is a hidden gem.  Forget about every restaurant on 30th ave and take a little walk down to 36th avenue where you'll find the best crepes you've ever had in your life.  Each bite of my poached pear w/ chocolate sauce and toasted almond crepe was pure bliss!  You can't go wrong here.   The owner is also a really friendly guy who indulged us in friendly conversation when he wasnt busy cooking.  Plain and simple: a fantastic chef with a fantastic cafe.
