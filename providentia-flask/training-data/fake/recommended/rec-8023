I love the ambiance of this restaurant - super hip, pretty, and lots of seating. The wait was not too long and it was a great place to catch up with a friend. I ordered just a regular pad thai as well as the wonton soup. Considering how many people there were in this restaurant, the service speed wasn't too bad, I would have expected it to be way slow, but the servers are able to notice you when you have to order and pay.
