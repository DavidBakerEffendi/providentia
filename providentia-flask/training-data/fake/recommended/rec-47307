Had a fine experience. Showed up around 8:30 on a Saturday night and was told it would be about a 40 minute wait for three. It was more like an 8 minute wait which was great. Service was spot on- they didn't miss a beat. Music was a bit loud but other than that the atmosphere was fine. Frankly, I didn't understand all the fuss about the peanut bacon brittle. It just tasted like candied peanuts. The fried chicken was very crispy and tasty. Parts of the meat itself were a bit dry, but the crispy outside made up for it. The mac and cheese was a little bland for my taste, but I am a bit picky about my cheeses. I prefer sharp, bold, cheesy flavors and this was none of those things. I would go back, but I'm probably not going to go out of my way to make it happen.
