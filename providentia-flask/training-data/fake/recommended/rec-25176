Ordered delivery at 8:15, expecting a 45 minute delivery (as they told me). It's now almost 10 pm and I still haven't gotten my food. I understand that the weather's rainy but damn, warn a girl about the huge wait. When I called to check up the guy who answered the phone was rude as well. All I got was a half hearted "sorry for the inconvenience, but we're busy." Now that I've received my food finally, it's not even the right order. Tasty, but not what I wanted in the first place and waited over an hour for. :( The nachos were still good but really soggy and my taco was cold.
