This place for brunch is BOMB!!!! It kind of looks like you stepped in someone's house and the decoration is cozy. The waiters are nice even though they can seem a little unorganized, it adds charm to the place. Prices are correct, especially for the quality. The food is to die for: Turkish breakfast, Green eggs and lamb are awesome. The red sangria is also super tasty! I'm sure the rest of the menu is great, just haven't had a chance to try it yet. Overall one of the best places for brunch I've discovered yet!!!
