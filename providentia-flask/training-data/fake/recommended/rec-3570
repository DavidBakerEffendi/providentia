This is a hard one....I give this a 3.5 because some things I liked and others I didn't care for. The food is cheap and tasty enough, but not great. Â The area is fantastic and there are many good places to eat at so, so don't overlook habana but be prepared for a lively lively crowd ... Tacos were good... Margaritas were okay... Nothing outstanding, but overall a decent cheap eat
