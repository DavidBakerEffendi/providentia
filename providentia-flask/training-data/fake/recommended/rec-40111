I adore Old Nelson. I used to stop here on my way to work. I like that they sell things like Pocky here...so you don't have to go several more blocks into Chinatown to get it. It feels like a mini-Whole Foods in here and it's perfect for someone on a gluten-free or vegetarian diet. They offer frozen foods and deli--perfect if you forget lunch.
