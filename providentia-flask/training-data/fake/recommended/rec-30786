I've been here about 8 times and have always waited for a table.. Nobody is there to really "greet" you.  They seem really busy even though there are always 1-2 tables open- bc it takes them forever to bus the tables.  There is always one guy that seems to be doing all the work- he is always running around but the other servers look like they are taking their time.   The menu is creative- but comes out ok... the dirty chai is amazing and I love how they have almond milk as an option, but hate to have to ALWAYS wait forever for it. For food, I always get the grilled cheese with onion jam- it's delicious, but the soup needs some work... The smore's cookies are also a favorite of mine.   The decor and ambiance has a nice "hipster" feel, and the servers also exude it- which is cool.  Love the subway tiles, and chalkboard-style walls.   I just don't understand why it takes forever to get a latte- there is a HUGE cafe counter and even a barista to make drinks.  There are barely 20 tables, and about 5-6 people on staff-- I don't understand why it takes so long to be greeted, for someone to bus an empty table, get sat, someone to come and greet and take our orders and then get a latte... Don't get me wrong- for the most part the service is nice, the menu is cool- the service is just so slow...
