Came here with a friend for lunch recently.  Glad we came for lunch as the dinner prices were rather steep.  Kept it simple with a kebab plate (adana) for her, a chicken sandwich for me and these zucchini fritter appetizers (mucver) to start with.  My chicken sandwich (only available at lunch time) was just a wrap stuffed with tomato, lettuce, and bits of chicken and it tasted great.  The kebab plate looked great too.  Our meals came with a scoop of rice, which I'm sure was tasty, but that I didn't have because I don't eat peas.  The little fritter appetizer was ok.  I wished the flavors were more pronounced. I would certainly go back but only for lunch.
