The owners, Pop and Ing, did an amazing job transforming this space with warm woods and beautiful lighting. I've eaten here three times already and they just opened! The Kwaytiew Gai -- chicken noodle. angel hair noodles, stewed chicken, braised daikon, bok choy, bean sprouts, shiitake mushrooms and goji berries is ridiculously delicious. Their noodles are fresh and you can taste the difference.They also have a killer lunch special. The staff is super friendly. They take good care of you here and make sure your dining experience is fun, unique and tasty. The upper east side is so much better now that Up Thai is here!
