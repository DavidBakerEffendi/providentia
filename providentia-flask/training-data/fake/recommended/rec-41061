When my 30th birthday rolled around, I knew I wanted some upscale Mexican food. A couple of Best Of lists and a bunch of yelp reviews later, I decided on Toloache. We considered all three locations, but opted for the Village location to be closer to bars after dinner. I'm so happy that we did! The entire experience at Toloache was great, and it ended up being the perfect birthday dinner. The Food: There were three of us, so we opted to share and eat tapas style. We started with the guacamole trio. It is a MUST TRY! Amazing. The price is a bit steep at $24, but I didn't regret it for a second. The Frutas (guac with mango and pomegranate!) and the Rojo were both to die for. We then shared the fish tacos, the quesadilla de huitlacoche y trufas (mushroom and truffles), and the hamachi ceviche. My boyfriend loved the quesadilla, but I thought the ceviche was the winner. Each dish was great though. The Drinks: The margaritas were all excellent, but to really have your mind blown, make sure to order the mezcalita cocktail with grilled pineapple and jalape√±o. I wish I had one right now. So good! So good! So good! The Service: The service was the best part. Our server was patient through all of our annoying questions, gave great advice about what to order and once he heard it was my birthday, was sure that he and his servers gave me an appropriately embarrassing and totally fun birthday song and (delicious!) flan dessert. And, before we even mentioned my birthday, the manager Luis stopped by just to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves. My boyfriend made some joke that he enjoyed, which led him to bring us a round of tequila shots on the house. So fun! I will certainly be back! Highly recommended!
