Teros always serving the best fish, ribs, and steak. Everything is fresh, they go daily to pick up the best and fresh seafood! Service is great. Someone can make a simple mistake on a busy night. I know I would. This place is cranking out orders every Saturday! The portions are always big.. This place gets 5 Stars from me!! Gino Matias
