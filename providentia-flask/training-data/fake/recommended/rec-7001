I have been here half a dozen times or so and I plan on going back many, many more times.  The first time I went, I ended up hanging out for about 3 and a half hours.  John and Treva are so nice and work very hard to remember faces and names.  They also will chat with you as long as they aren't busy which I love (Southern hospitality, ya'll).  Being from the south, I'm always getting a hankering for biscuits and gravy and fried okra... two things that can be tricky to find in the city.  Thankfully, Beehive has both!  Even though I love those two things, I always try to eat something different every time I go and haven't been let down yet.  The biscuit pudding is a meal in and of itself (I've had the plum, peach, and apple - all uh.maze.ing!) and is a must even if you have to pack it up and take it home.   It's started to get popular and busy and sometimes the service isn't always top notch but I've never had it be terrible.  Occasionally I've had to remind them about my fried okra order which I always get as a side.  I'm personally glad to see them doing so well and I hope their good fortune continues. I also love that they rotate their beers on tap.  Between that and the food, they get a 5-star rating from me.  The decor is pretty great too (the bathroom decor is hands down the best though.  It's my favorite bathroom in the city and you should definitely go wash your hands or something).  They are also starting to expand their menu and I'm excited to see what the future holds.  Definitely give them your business and meet John and Treva if they are around.   Good people, good food, good times.  A++.
