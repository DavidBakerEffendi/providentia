A Philly icon, what else to say?  A true taste of "The Philadelphia Cheesesteak".   If you can get through fluorescent-light attack on your soul, endless wall of celebrity/employee photos, strict and succinct ordering process, then you are rewarded with a thing of pure unadulterated greasy beauty, the Cheesesteak!    As a personal fan of the steak sheets or slabs of meat, rather then the chopped up and shredded kind of cheesesteak serving method you may find in a generic food court faux-steak, Geno's steps up to bat with an MVP in the late-night artery-clogging games.  Geno's vs Pat's, the rival of the century in South Philly.  Everyone has there preference, and while your group of friends may split up on Passyunk Ave and choose to pray upon their respective altars of the greasy-god, know that your both shortening your life-span together.  But oh, what a way to go!
