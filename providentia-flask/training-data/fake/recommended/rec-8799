The atmosphere was dark and noisy and the space was very tight, cold and drafty The food lacked true flavor and depth, which I believe at this price point is expected.  Most of the dishes were either to sweet or to salty and there were no true wow moments when my tongue danced. The fondue was not interesting in the least.  The main courses lacked passion, flavor or interest. I would be very suspect of these five star ratings as this was no five star meal.
