I got a bunch of items off of the menu as I've never eaten here before. Actually got it delivered, super fast. Just moved in so I didn't have any condiments, why no soy sauce Chili Szechuan? Some kinda purist thing or just overlooked? Anyway - the spice is good here, flavors are built up and exist underneath the heat so...YUM. Did not care for the texture of the chicken but that spicy cabbage and those dry green beans? DAMN, damn, damn. Keepers! And I got some soy for the fridge...
