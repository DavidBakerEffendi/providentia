Probably the best place in Princeton I've tried. Absolutely loved the fresh seafood here! The crab and chowders soup was delicious, highly recommended.  It was like a Manhattan crab chowder mixed with a new England clam chowder.   The next grill was awesome too, I believe that changes daily depending on what's fresh that day, but from what I've seen all their seafood seem pretty fresh, and The guests sitting next to me also highly recommended the scallop, which I regret not getting a chance to try. Definitely my go to spot next time I'm in Princeton!
