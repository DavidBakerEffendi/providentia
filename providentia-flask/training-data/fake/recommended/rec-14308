pizza here is incredible! i love the fact that they use fresh mozzarella, basil, and crushed tomatoes - sooo goood. less processed ingredients = less greasy = puts a smile on my face and leaves me feeling satisfied instead of gross. the staff could have been a little less cold than the weather, and the seating was extremely cramped, but the pizza was all worth it.
