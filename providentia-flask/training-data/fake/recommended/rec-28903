Went there for dinner on a Friday night.  $80 for two people.  Very unimpressive.  Onion rings for appetizer: properly fried and well presented. Chocolate infused ranch dressing dip was odd and added nothing. Entries were ok but not much better than I could have gotten at a bar around the corner. Decent burger. Steak quesadilla was ok and had a good presentation. Desserts were priced like entrees. My euphoria sundae was big and well put together, but was only a modest step up from a Friendly's sundae.   Chocolate cake looked like a work of art but did not have an equivalently artistic taste. Waiter was a little too friendly.  I really don't need to have a conversation about each entree and each beer I order.
