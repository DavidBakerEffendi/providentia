First time here a couple months ago for lunch... The couple next to us, all they ordered was 2 orders each of the pork-buns; that's it. After we finished our meal--pork-buns, beef noodle soup, & spicy sausage ricecakes--we understood the deal. ... even so, pork-buns here were not better than Ippudo pork-buns. Still, I want to come back ONE DAY to try the Bo-Ssam meal.
