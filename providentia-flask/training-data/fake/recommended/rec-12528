I was looking for a nice big bowl of noodle soup and that's exactly what I got! I arrived around five PM which was a bit early for dinner, but hey, no problem getting a table! I looked at the menu while sipping my water and then I decided to try the sliced beef noodle soup. Less than five minutes later the steaming hot bowl of noodles was placed in front of me. Fast service! You get a lot of food for your money here. The bowl is filled with yummy, chewy noodles and they don't skimp on the meat either! I found it was best to mix from the bottom because that helped dislodge some of the veggies that had sunk to the bottom. They had all the sauces on the side that you could ever need, which enabled me to liberally apply sriracha to my noodles :) This restaurant is reasonably priced, has fast service, and great food! I'd definitely come back!
