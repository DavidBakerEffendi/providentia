I am the short and sweet type of person.  I am a foodie, so you can trust my review lol! Burger:  I got the L.A. Burger; 7.50 for this burger is definitely gets your money's worth.  I got it medium, and it came a little on the medium rare side.  I really liked the avocado on the burger.  This burger definitely met my high expectations for Bobby Flay, but it didn't exceed it.  I mean, how great can a burger really get?  He would have had to do something really special to make an AMAZING burger.  However with that being said, it might have been the best 7.50 burger I've ever ate.  Hopefully you guys can understand where I'm coming from. Fries:  Got both the sweet potato and regular fries.  The sweet potato fries were pretty good, however, the regular fries were soggy and bit too greasy.  Think worse version of 5 guys fries.   Onion rings:  "Standard" huge onion rings.  Good, but just your average huge onion rings.  Feel me?   Sauces:  Fry sauce is top notch, the best sauce of the bunch.  The rest of the sauces were okay, but nothing noteworthy.  The horseradish sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was okay/relatively good. All in all, the experience met my expectations, but didn't exceed it.  If you're looking for a great burger, I'd definitely come here, but if you're looking for the greatest burger you've ever eaten, look elsewhere.
