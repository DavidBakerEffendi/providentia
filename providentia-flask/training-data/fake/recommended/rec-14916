Small plates and entrees were delicious.  Desserts ordered were also great.  Extensive list of craft beers and good cocktails.  I would recommend the farmhouse platter, escargot for small plates.  We also had the oysters, but I was not a fan.  For entrees, I would recommend the ivory salmon.  First time I have ever seen it on a menu and it was delicious.  For dessert, we sampled the ginger sorbet, the toasted pound cake and the panna cotta.  All were excellent.  Would definitely recommend to stop in for dinner or just drinks.
