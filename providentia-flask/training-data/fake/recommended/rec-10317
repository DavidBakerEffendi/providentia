Tried Sorella last night for the first time.  We started at the bar where Joey did a great job of preparing the drinks for our party of 3 - including adding a spear of grapes to the grape vodka drink my collegue ordered.  We moved to a table where we ordered the brussel sprout appetizer.  We all agreed they were the best we'd ever had.  The balsamic reduction really added a sweet finish - everyone at the table loved them.  Two people ordered pasta and one ordered pizza.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and while I didn't try the lamb dish, I understood it was very good.  I did try the eggplant dish and it was a very nice balance of the eggplant, sauce and pasta.  I ordered the margherita pizza and was not disappointed.  The crust was incredibly thin and crispy and the homemade sauce was delicious.   We finished the meal with dessert.  The most popular choice at our table was the plate of brioche ice cream sandwhices.  The bread was sweet, warm and slightly crispy, sandwiched around three different flavors of ice cream.  It was a great meal with attentive service and reasonable prices.  I will definitely be back.
