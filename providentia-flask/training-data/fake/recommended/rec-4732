I'll add to the cheer here.  Was in The Village one night with a buddy, and we needed a new bar.  My brother, who lives in LA, knows all the good bars in Manhattan and he recommended it. You'd never know there was a bar this far down on Perry Street, but keep walking and there it is.  What a great place. The beer is very good - quite a selection, and at prices you would not believe (for good beer in Manhattan). It is crowded as folks here say, but that should not deter you.  Check the place out - go early and get a table, or go late and stand.  You won't be disappointed. I'll only give it 4 stars, though, since the crowd can be a pain sometimes - hard to get a drink, and to hear yourself think.
