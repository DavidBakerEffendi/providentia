When we go to a restaurant we hope to not only enjoy the food, but also to enjoy the overall experience. and when we leave a restaurant, we usually ask- will we be back? The answer with Kefi is no, here's why...we thought the food was ok,  but not memorable, but the experience they delivered was just bland and plain boring. First the good: ..appetizers- the Cypriot salad was a refreshing, very enjoyable light summer salad,  the grilled octopus is good- not chewy, perfect char, with a touch of lemon. Service was efficient and pleasant. Ok so what is not to like? The main dishes we ordered were clumsily presented, over stuffed with chips, and a soggy salad like you would get at a college food truck. The entrees- chicken souvlaki and the lamb burger were just ok. Our biggest dislike was the way the restaurant looked and was laid out. Tables jammed together, hard services, little in the way of decor that reminds you that you are eating at a Greek Restaurant, in other words it has ZERO Greek charm, soul or ambiance. To make matters worse, we were sent to the Kefi basement to eat (even though there were plenty of open tables upstairs). And no surprise here, the Kefi basement smells like ....a musty basement. Also, when sitting downstairs, expect to be in very close proximity with other people (who were banished to the musty basement), and expect to watch the kitchen staff move dirty dishes back and forth while you eat. I mean it was a saddest spot, bleak and bland...not even a little candle to cheer us up. Needless to say, we skipped desert to go up for air.
