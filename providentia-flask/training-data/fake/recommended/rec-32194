Awesome food with creativity not only on the walls.  The staff is super nice and ALL their food is awesome, not just their burgers.  They change up their menu slightly here and there but you can always count on a few different type of awesome burgers, great fries with different sauces as well as filling dishes I would consider an "entree" like the mac n cheese which must have like 10 cheeses in it and is so good!  It's on the smaller size with "about" 8 maybe 10 booths but its very pleasant, clean, friendly staff, and fun to see all the creativity on the walls!  Definitely a place worth trying.
