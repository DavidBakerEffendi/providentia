The winner here is the service, atmosphere, and aesthetic. It's got a lot to it and I will definitely be going back. Good vibe, super attentive but non-invasive staff, and good music. When I want Lucali but don't feel like the trek, Rubirosa provides a very worthy substitute. If Lucali's pies are 9.5/10, my pizza experience here was 8/10. Agree with the review below in terms of the pie itself: Â a very bright and flavorful tomato sauce, and a restrained use of mozzarella and this definitely strikes me as a pie you order sans toppings. Also ordered the side of meatballs (3 of them delivered in a sizzling cast iron pan, the tomato sauce was the highlight) and a side of broccoli rabe with garlic. The wine was awesome too. And their olive oil. A+ olive oil. Oh, and dont forget the fact they allow take-out and RESERVATIONS!
