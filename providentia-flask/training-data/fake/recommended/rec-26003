Amazing food, chill atmosphere, nice unobtrusive service. Horrible yuppie fuck indie garbage music though.  Is it so hard to ask for non jangly fake optimistic guitar drivel in a Williamsburg restaurant?  Maybe some Italian film music, jazz, funk, anything other than fucking INDIE ROCK at a SOMEWHAT FANCY ITALIAN PLACE?? That said the volume isn't too loud so you can forget about it easily because seriously that music...I can't... Plan to spend a bit, get a full bottle of wine instead of 2 carafes it's a better deal! Love this place minus the music!
