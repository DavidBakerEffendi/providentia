I don't eat red meat so my review may not be really helpful for burger lovers. I ordered Vegi burger, sweet potato fries, pickles, salad, and onion rings. One of my friend told me that the onion ring was the best one she ever had but to me it tasted like MSG flavored onion ring. Umami=MSG?!?! I hope not.
