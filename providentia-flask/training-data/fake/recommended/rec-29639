My wife and I loved this place.  This was our first trip to New York, and we had heard great things about the food in Little Italy.  It was all certainly very true for our experience at Benito's.   If you're looking for a great New York atmosphere combined with delicious food, I'd certainly recommend this place.  We're not wine drinkers, but the list looked quite extensive if that's what you're looking for to complement your dish. 5 stars from us!  If we're lucky enough to make it back to New York, we'll make time for Benito's.
