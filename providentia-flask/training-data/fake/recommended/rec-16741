This is my favorite neighborhood joint. Penelope, or Penny's as I affectionately call it, is small and cosy with a very homely feel to it and the friendly waiters make you feel even more comfortable than you already feel when you enter.  They have 5 beers on tap and a few select wines on the list, but the selection is quality.  Saturday and Sunday brunch is a cult in New York, so if you're going between 11:00 am to 3 pm on weekends, you're bound to wait for at least 30 minutes; even weekend dinners might have a short wait, but do yourself a favor - don't leave! Its totally worth it.  Once you're in, you can eat/drink at leisure and they'll never rush you. I've been with Penny many times - 2 pm on a weekday, 10 pm on a weekday, 2 pm on Saturday, 4 pm on Sunday - and she is always equally delicious and eager to please (pardon the metaphor).  So far, I've had the following there:  granola, penny egg sandwich, whole grain pancakes, veggie burger heaven, hummus and avocado sandwich, french onion soup, Ellie's spinach pie, artichoke dip, chicken meatballs, eggs to order w/sausage, carrot cake, and red velvet cake.  It has all been absolutely delicious except for the red velvet cake (which was not much of a red velvet cake) with chicken meatballs and the penny egg sandwich as absolute standouts!  The combination of pesto and egg has revolutionalized my snacking/breakfast life.   A slight drawback is that it's cash only (there's an ATM in the laundromat around the corner) but its fairly cheap so it compensates.   Boo to expensive and average food, and booyah to Penny's!
