The food here was amazing, but the service the first time I came here was horrendous. First, the service: The staff acted as though we were just lucky to be there but weren't especially excited that we were. It took us about 15 minutes to get our coffee, then didn't get it refilled until about another 10 minutes after it was empty. BUT, the FOOD was so amazing, my mom and I did end up feeling pretty lucky to be eating here. We were there for brunch, and I can't remember what my mom got because I was so taken by my dish--the baked polenta: a polenta cake with goat cheese and what tasted like a chipotle topping, a poached egg, kale, zucchini, and some amazing bread. I quickly became full and was so sad because I wanted to finish every last drop of this dish- that's how amazing it was. The one thing I remember about my mom's meal was an awesome piece of cornbread with whole pieces of corn in it--a little sweet, a little salty, and totally amazing. I think I ate the whole piece. Edit: Service has been better in later trips and food has been just as good. Highly recommended and a mainstay of mine.
