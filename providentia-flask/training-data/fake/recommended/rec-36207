You just never know if some places in NYC are worth the praise that tourists like me give it.  Balthazar most certainly deserves this praise.  I've been multiple times over a few trips to NYC and Balthazar always gets it right.  The prices aren't ridiculous, but the wait can be so I suggest you go for breakfast on a weekday. Try the french toast - it's the best we've had in all of our travels.
