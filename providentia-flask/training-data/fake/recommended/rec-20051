The pizza crust here is so perfect. Paulie is a nice guy with quite a knack for making good pie. It is a simple restaurant with a simple menu. The Regina is a good start here. It is basically just their version of a Margherita. Â My favorite pizza on the menu is the Greenpointer. It's fior di latte, baby arugula, olive oil, fresh lemon juice and shaved parmisan. So good! Go Fig Yourself, I tried, minus the meat and it was awesome too. Pretty good small beer selection. Cozy digs. All build it green style. Only trouble with this place is that some of the staff are snooty and too cool for school, or to even smile. That said, I have had some nice servers there. The pizza oven is hypnotizing!!
