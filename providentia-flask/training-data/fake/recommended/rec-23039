AVERAGE Unfortunately, this place screams average. I was so hoping it would be better. I had the Lobster Roll with sweet potato chips and coke slaw. While the lobster was not bad, it had very little flavor and it was not served on the classic bun. The chips were ho hum, as was the slaw. The only saving grace was Erika, an excellent server.
