Oh these noodles were absolutely perfect. Thinner than I was expecting, which makes it all the more amazing that they're still chewy and have tons of bite to them. Also, so cheap: $5 for a good sized plate. The zha jiang mien's sauce had good flavor, but it was the noodles' consistency that makes me wish I could dig this place up (hey, it's small) and move it to the California bay area. We got lucky on timing; a few minutes after we came in, the place got packed, and I saw multiple parties seated at one table.
