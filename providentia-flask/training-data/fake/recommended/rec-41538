What can I say? I love Noodies. Even though it is about 10 blocks from my office, it is worth the hike to get there.  The food is cheap and clean and did I say delicious?  Yes!  The restaurant is small, that is, it really is a railroad restaurant kind of deal, but the decor really makes up for the small footprint.  Not absolutely in love with the stools but I guess I can deal with them to eat such delicious food.  My favorite ther is the Pad-Se-Ew but I really should give other dishes a try...
