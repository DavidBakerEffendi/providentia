This is the best sandwich shop in the Plainsboro area. I've been eating here for over 5 years and they do it right. Quick subs, fair prices, and good quality. The bread is fresh and the buffalo sauce on any buffalo sandwich is top notch. I would highly recommend it. There is limited seating in there, so be wary of dining in during busy lunch hours. I usually grab it to go between 12-1. After that, no problems dining in.
