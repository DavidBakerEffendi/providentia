I have walked by Ruby's at least a dozen times in the last 6 months but never even thought to go in.  This place looks like a regular little cafe, nothing stands out, nothing screams "I've got AWESOME BURGERS." Hell, when my actual destination WAS Ruby's I still missed this place.  However, this place has since become one of my favorite quick lunch spots around nolita/soho When my burger [mine was the Bronte Burger] came, I was perplexed. Up to this point, if a burger wasn't pink, it had better be a smash burger [shake shack] or I wouldn't be eating it.  Somehow, this strange looking burger, with a completely well done patty was still dripping with juice, and covered with an amazing sweet chili sauce.   This is not the best burger in nyc, but it still tops my charts as one of the more unique burgers and still one of my favorites.
