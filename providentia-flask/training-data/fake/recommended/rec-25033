I have visited the crepe truck a few times, Sometimes their food is good other times it's horrible. The sweet crepe I've had were great but then sometimes I would order a buffalo chicken crepe and the chicken would not be cooked all the (it would be pink inside) and not chopped all the way, I would be eating these huge clumps of chicken. Another thing I've noticed while waiting in line was if a female student would be passing by, their employees would all run to the back door and stare, very unprofessional for a business. This place lacks that spark they had a few years ago, it wouldn't be my first choice to grab a bite to eat anymore.
