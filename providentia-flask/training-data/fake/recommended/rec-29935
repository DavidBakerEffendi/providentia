Class act. Everything from service, ambiance, drinks, etc was exceptional. I had an old fashioned with some kind of citrus twist to it which was spot on. For mains, I had a steak which was exceptional. It came presliced which is not really my preference but was cooked to perfection and sauce definitely had the wow factor. My wife had a duck dish which was very nice. For desert we had Apple tarte tatin which was amazing.
