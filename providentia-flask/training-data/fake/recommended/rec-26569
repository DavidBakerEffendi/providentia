Visited the lobby back in Nov for a friends birthday! We had a pretty good time. Its very loud being that it's a night club, which was cool cuz we came to party! We missed our reservation so we had to sit at the bar which was cool because we had an awesome bartender! We used the coupon for 50 dollars worth of food for 30 which was so clutch! I ordered 3 drinks and 3 entrees, so it was well worth it! The drinks were good and fairly priced. The Dj mostly played Latin music and every now and then threw in some hip hop. The dance floor is kinda small but people still danced like crazy! Everything was good until the bartender tried to charge us for extra drinks and claimed real hard that thats what we had. She was nice up until that moment, however when the manager came over he was nice and helped rectify the situation!
