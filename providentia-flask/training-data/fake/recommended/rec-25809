Such a nice little restaurant ! I have been there a few times now, and the food is always very tasty and inexpensive. Every dish is made with fresh produces, and reminds me a little bit of the south of France... In particular, I love the grilled octopus, merguez and croque madame. Waiters/waitresses are very nice, although a bit un-coordinated at times. I definitely recommends this place for a low key brunch or dinner.
