I love so many things about this place - the interior is very charming and the food is good and reasonably priced. I do recommend going early if you plan to have brunch here as it can get crowded later in the day. The dinner menu is also good Â - recommend reservations. If you are looking for a charming location with good food - this is the right location for you.
