When it comes to the rivalry Pat's vs Geno's; Pats wins. Geno's just has some weird taste to each part of their product. The bread just seems off, the whiz is just congealed, and steak as a whole is a good concept, but it gets really stringy. I avoid Geno's and tell any person visiting Philadelphia to also avoid.
