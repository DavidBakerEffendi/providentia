It's only my second day in Philadelphia and I've discovered that a lot of places are closed on Sundays. I was looking for a coffee shop to work in that wasn't Starbucks and was very glad when I finally found this place. The environment is nice and quirky - bright colored walls (loved the turquoise ceiling) and there is upstairs and downstairs seating. I had a medium latte and a breakfast bagel (they were willing to serve breakfast anytime - hooray!). The coffee was delicious - very smooth and deep flavored with little acidity. I was happily surprised with the bagel - I ordered the bacon cheese and egg on whole wheat bagel expecting something like McDonald's, but instead it was like an omelet on a bagel - all mixed together. Fantastic (at least a 2 egg omelet with tons of bacon and cheddar). Huge. The size and quality justified the $5.75 price tag for the bagel. The service was perfect. I was served extremely promptly. I originally only wanted coffee but after sitting for awhile grabbed a menu. Within a minute (just enough time for me to peruse) someone came up and asked in a friendly manner if I'd like to order. Everything came faster than I expected.
