Jeez, where to begin with Mood???? I came here for lunch a few weeks ago with a coworker, and while he wasn't a fan (he's not as adventurous with food a I am), I loved it! If you're looking for your typical Indian food, skip here; if you want a flavor adventure that is unique and different, then this is your place. I had no clue what a chaat was until I came here, so the owner explained everything to me. The chaats here anew amazing; there are so many flavors, textures, colors, and unique ingredients that every bite is something different. They also have the best lassis I've ever had, and what makes them even better is the flavors! Skip the traditional mango (even though its awesome) and give fig a try. It was creamy, sweet perfection. I'm sure the food here isn't diet friendly, which is not good for me because its so close to work!!!!!
