Delicious breakfast.   The atmosphere was homey and we felt almost like a regular.   The staff was very welcoming and the food was great!  My husband and teenaged son complained of being "too full" a high never happens.   My short stack of blueberry pancakes with Vermont maple syrup was fantastic.   Great value and great atmosphere.
