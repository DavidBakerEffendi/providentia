Despite the attention-demanding name, this Sunnyside hotspot features inventive new American small plates, all created at the creative whim of Sunnyside native Daniel Yi. Dinner service starts with a bag of bacon fat-popped corn, but ends with mini jugs of cran-yogurt probiotics. Of the 17 menu items, only four creep above ten dollars, though each dish combines reasonable quantity with exceptional quality. Grab a group of adventurous friends and enjoy a hand-tailored sampling. Crack & Cheese is one of the most popular dishes, with deep-fried potato gnocchi, b√©chamel cheese sauce and salty bits of bacon. Plump mussels arrive with Chinese sausage in a Thai oyster sauce. Hampshire pulled pork sliders with a sweet and spicy sriracha BBQ kick arrive three to a plate for $9. And be sure to save room for equally unique desserts, such as the lime panna cotta with avocado ice cream.
