My husband and I enjoyed a really great meal here a few weeks ago... what a delicious dinner! I had the mushroom tart appetizer, which was light and flaky... so good! My husband ordered the scallops appetizer which was so good he recommended them to the diners at the next table. We both had steak for our main, they were both generously sized and cooked the way we ordered them, and the flavor was phenomenal. For dessert we shared the bread pudding... another hit. Cant wait to go back... its so nice to have this as an option. I would especially recommend if you're looking for a dinner for a special occasion... the service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed. Definitely worth trying.
