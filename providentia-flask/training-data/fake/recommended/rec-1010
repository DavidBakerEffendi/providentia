Seriously, how does this place have only 2.5 stars?  They must have been trying to pay with a credit card, or got offended with the English only sign. This place and Pats are institutions.  The attitude and neighborhood is part of the full package. You have to come here and Pats.  Buy one in both places, they are slightly different but both awesome
