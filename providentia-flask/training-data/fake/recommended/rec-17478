I LOVE this place!!! I always order 6-8 tapas to split among the table and I always leave full and happy! I would suggest the goat cheese fritters, datiles, papitas and pequino rellenas. All are amazing and a must have when I'm there. They are BYOB so bring your favorite wine and have a great time!
