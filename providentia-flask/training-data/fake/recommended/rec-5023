To all of my vegan comrades out there: I know you have friends who love BBQ. I know you basically never go out with anyone that eats meat these days for a variety of reasons. But if you're like me and just want to spend time with your friends over a meal, you can handle this BBQ joint with the aid of their absolutely DELICIOUS vegan mac and cheese. This is where I am going to bring all of my meat eating friends who want BBQ just so I can eat that mac & cheese again. It's really heavy/comfort food style with nacho strips, bread crumbs (?) and jalepe√±os on it, so you really don't need to invest in the 2 other vegan options (which are both sides, the collard greens and the beans.) So vegans, go eat that mac & cheese and indulge in the irony that is being a vegan dining at a BBQ restaurant.
