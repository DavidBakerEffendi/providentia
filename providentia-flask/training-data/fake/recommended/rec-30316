Went here after reading all the solid brunch reviews. It didn't really live up to my party's expectations (3 of us). I got the smoked trout scramble - the scramble itself was actually really good, but I didn't care for the biscuit that came with it. The other people I was with got the poached eggs and hueves rancheros (which were very soupy - I thought they should have given him a spoon). The service was friendly, but slow. Overall, I think if you're looking for a great brunch you would find better value someplace else.
