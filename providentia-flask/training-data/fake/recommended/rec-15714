We walked in with no expectations as we pretty much picked this place at random via Yelp.   For whatever reason it was about 1/3 full on a Friday night which was a bit of a concern, but we were ushered in before we thought about changing our minds and we are glad we stayed. We had the jicama arugula salad, the salmon, the scallops, the sweet potato planks, and fries.  The sweet potato planks were the most memorable as it was prepared steak fries style and the accompanying peanut sauce was an unexpectedly cool addition.  The fries in contrast are prepared shoestring size. The portions are just right and the service was quick and efficient.  This is a great uncomplicated neighborhood restaurant where you can go multiple times a week for what is essentially comfort American food.  We're looking forward to going back.
