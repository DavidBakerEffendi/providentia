I've eaten here a few times and was surprised that I hadn't reviewed it yet -- so here goes... I recently joined some friends here kind of late-night...  As a table, we ordered a few apps and the "Da Mikele" pizza -- which is this tomatoless number that's topped with Mushrooms, prosciutto and cheese. All-in-all, DM is a nice pizza place, whether the pie is an appetizer or the main course.  They have a more than adequate wine list and a cool, comfy atmosphere and decent service (our waiter was actually Italian).  I've only been here with a group of people -- to me, it's a better "group" spot than a "date" spot...  but maybe that's just me.
