A friend of mine and I had been dying to try this place but we both were hesitating if we should go or not because of the long wait. Turns out it wasn't really that bad at all, we got there around 8 o clock and yes it was packed but they took my name and number and said I would have to wait an hour or so. When your table is ready you'll get an automatic text message from their system alerting you and letting you know your table is ready, pretty cool. The wait wasn't bad at all.. Yeah it's an hour but you're at greenwich village and if you want to kill time, just walk a loop or so and an hour will fly by. My friend had the Original Burger and I had the truffle burger along with Sweet Potato Fries. Burgers were suggested to be medium rare and it turned out great! Burgers were packed with flavors and juices which will just melt in your mouth. The fries were fried to a perfection and went really well with the the sauces they provided. They have a wide selection of alcohol and mixed drinks and even though I'm not a drinker, If I was.. I think I would've loved it even more. Overall my experience at Umami Burger was a great one.. I would definitely come back with my friend since she loved it as well! It sure does live up to it's hype!
