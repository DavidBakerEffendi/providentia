Great spot.love the ambiance of this place. Music is loud enough but not over bearing,large selection of beer.great place to bring a friend and chill. Last time i went (Thursday night)Bartender the first half of the night wasn't the nicest,but the bartender who took over for him compensated. Would definety go back and check out the menu.
