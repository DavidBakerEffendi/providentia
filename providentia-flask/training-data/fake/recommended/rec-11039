My boyfriend and I have been there twice, and both the times the food has came out after a considerably long wait. This place may be good for a slice or two of pizza (which they will have pre made and hence give it to you quicker than other menu items), but be prepared to wait a while if you order non-pizza items like strombolis, paninis etc., which are not quiet worth the wait.
