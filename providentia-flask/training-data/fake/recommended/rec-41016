Great Restaurant & Great Ambiance for a special evening. Had reservations here for a New Years Eve Dinner, and it was wonderful.  The food was fantastic, and the service was attentive and helpful! Our waiter paired us with a bottle of wine just to our liking, and was very knowledgeable on the selection.  If you go, do order the bread to start, it is SO worth it, and even the toppings for it are well thought out with a great flavor.  Salads were also a great addition to the evening, I enjoyed the blood orange salad, and my date had a crab salad.  Two different Duck entree's for dinner, and ending with a coffee, a hot chocolate with homemade marshmallows for him and a very good dessert.  Only thought on the dessert menu is that most of them came with ice cream.  Some more options, or styles of desserts would be my only comment.  As it was a very cold NYC Winter evening, and ice cream isnt quite my preference for a cold evening! All in all, a great holiday evening dinner, thank you Print!
