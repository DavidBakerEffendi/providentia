After my having brunch there for the second time, I can officially say it's one of my faves in Philly. Although the food is very good the service is what distinguishes this place. Most was served by Courtney. What an amazing server! She anticipates your needs, goes over and beyond and she's full of energy. Looking forward to our next trip to Philly with a stop at Sabrina's.
