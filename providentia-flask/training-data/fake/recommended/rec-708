A friend took me here. I really liked the atmosphere it's very cozy and even if the place is actually pretty crowded it doesn't make you seem like it. The bar is designed nicely and food are good to share. We ordered plenty of dishes to share and the started with squid was pretty sour, the meatball with cheese filling was really heavy, the Brussels sprouts are really good tho, the pizza margarita is really good! We also had two desserts: the tiramisu and the caramel pudding. Make sure you save some stomach space for the dessert! This place is suitable for many occasions! Recommend!
