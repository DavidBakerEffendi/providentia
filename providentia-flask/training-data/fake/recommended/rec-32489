Now it's time for mexican.  Once again I have found a good quick way to get my mexican fix.  I will say that this restaurant is pretty good, but it's not perfect, but that may be a good thing in this case.   The food is consistant and the owner is a pleasure to see almost any time of day.  The food tastes mainly fresh and I will highly recommend two things on the menu that will keep you coming back.   The Tortilla soup.  This is by far the best tortilla soup I have ever tasted and dream about it on occasion.  The various burritos are also worth the trip.  I have to admit there are many good choices, but these really stand out to me, as well as the mole sauce wich I find superior to most mexican restaurants.   This is an authentic, local, and reasonably priced restaurant.  If you want to be a high end snob looking for overpriced, tasteless crap then I suggest you go to Agave in hartford center.   Monte Alban is not trying to be something it isn't and that's why it gets 4 stars in by book.   The food all meets or exceeds your primary expectations and that makes it worth going back to regularly.  And the prices don't hurt either.
