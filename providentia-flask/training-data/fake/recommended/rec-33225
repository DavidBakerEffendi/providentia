Jimmy's Caramel Malted is the best milkshake on earth. I used get it every time I came here. Until today, when I had the BEST MILKSHAKE IN THE UNIVERSE: Jimmy's Jameson & Coffee. Oh Lord in Heaven, thank you for bringing this delicacy into my life. It is clear that you mean for me to become obese, and I will gladly serve you. (By the way, I met Jimmy's lovely owner today, and it turns out that she also owns the new-ish Anella on Franklin Ave. I've heard raves about that place and am now even more eager to try it!)
