I recomend anyone who comes to New York to dine at this French restaurant. when we walked in the place was packed and they seated us in 5 minutes. I ordered the regular steak with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus and it was amazing! the workers we're extremely friendly and the manager stopped by twice to speak to us, and also the location is perfect, it's right next to all the shops in soho which made me like the place even more!
