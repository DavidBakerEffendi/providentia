Full disclosure - I went here after a night of heavy drinking and ordered basically everything on the menu.  There were hits and misses but I think the accolades David Chang has been getting is hard to live up to.  Unfortunately we did not have enough people to order the pork butt dinner.  The Berkshire pork in the steamed buns were very good and I would go back just for those.  The rice cakes did not have the traditional Korean spicy hot flavor but were good consistency.  My biggest objection was the seating - not very comfortable and I read done purposely so people would not linger in the restaurant since they don't take reservations.  I think that sucks.  Gotta try Momofuku next time I'm in NYC.
