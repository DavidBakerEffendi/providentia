We went in a group of 5 adults and 1 infant. It was 6pm and we were seated immediately at the high counter. The tabletop was rather narrow and high, not a place for kids or infants. The hooks below the tabletop is a nice touch though. I ordered the sea urchin starter and the pork burrito. We also shared the steam pork belly bun. The sea urchin starter came with tofu mousse and small tapioca balls. The taste was not distinctly sea urchin and the 3 ingredients did not really gel. The steam pork belly bun was nice but not outstanding. The pork was tender and the sauce pleasant. The steam bun could be softer and served hotter. My pork burrito was very nice. It is a very fresh take of the traditional burrito and worked very well. The tender pulled pork and soft fluffy rice, contrasted with the crunchy onions, kimchi and edamame, and were all nicely wrapped in flour tortilla. This is what i would come back for!
