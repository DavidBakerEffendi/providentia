It's a MUST GO. First time; had a dinner with a party of 20. So impressed with the service! Â Seamlessly smooth service for a party that size. It was like they were serving a party of four. Wait staff was extremely personable, educating our large group on the menu and specials; and oh so friendly. Our favorites were the rabbit ravioli, sausage stuff calamari, duck entree, penne stuffed with suckling pig & sausage with poached egg. Reservation required. The only MINOR observations we made were; artwork could have been more interesting & some good background music would add to the experience. Dessert spread was perfect.
