Only disappointment was we were charged for a chips refill. We didn't get that many chips to begin with and the order of guacamole wasn't huge for 10.95$ plus another $2.50 or so for chips refill. We only asked for a few more chips. The drinks were great. The food was great. We ordered Guacamole Y Totopos, Arrachera (Steak) Tacos and the Enchilada Verdes. Recommend the Enchilada Verdes. Habanero Margarita was very spicy, kinda burned my throat and I love spicy food. They did warn me but I still wanted to try it, I personally liked it.
