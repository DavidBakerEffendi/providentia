Oh man is this place AWESOME! I had the Ruby Red drink, it was delicious and refreshing! The Caesar salad was humongous with freshly made dressing and ciabatta croutons. The absolute BEST thing of the whole night was the accompaniment to the Grilled Skirt Steak.The steak was delicious, but the chipotle creamed corn was out of this world. I would drive 2 hours to Philly just for that!
