Excellent Soul Food.  You'll always leave with a full stomach and, likely, leftovers. A few short blocks outside of central New Haven, Mama Mary's is not in the best location.  There is usually free street parking right out front, however.  The decor inside belies it's location - nicely appointed and comfortable. The staff is always very friendly.  Even though my visits are usually months apart, they welcome me back each time. I can recommend the pork and the fried chicken, both are wonderful.  For sides: fried okra, potato salad, yams, corn bread - all excellent.  Also, treat yourself to the sweet tea.
