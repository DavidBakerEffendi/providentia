For $5, you are literally KING at this Halal cart. By far, the best tasting food off of any Halal cart in the city. The meat, for once, doesn't taste as if it has been rubbed on the street several times before being served. The sauces are even better than the other carts offer, spicier, sweeter, just superb to any other Halal cart in NYC. And for $5, it's great not to be served gross food.
