Ever since I tried California sushi for the first time a year ago, I have never gone to a different sushi restaurant. I now attend bi-weekly with my boyfriend. Love the staff and the byob offer (there's even a package store right next door for convince AND they'll heat up your saki for you!) ... Dobt forget to get the smoked salmon Sashimi which melts in your mouth!!! Â can't wait to go back already!! YUMMOOOOOOOO
