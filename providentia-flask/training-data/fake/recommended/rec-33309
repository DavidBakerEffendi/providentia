Ate at Zahav last night. Lemonana drinks were delish as was the Sauvignon blanc Â by the glass. Service is unstuffy but amazing. Seems like there is an employee for every diner. Hummus/ sautim was just great along w/ warm pita. Kibbe Nyah was great. So moist. Crispy haloumi was great combo w/ dates and almonds. Next course was only bad note of evening. I had been looking forward to the lamb shoulder for the last month since reservation but when I ordered was told they didn't have any. Apparently you must reserve it in advance. Craig Laban never mentioned it in his review. Oh well got the branzino instead and it was very good as well. For dessert almond semifreddo was a super end to a great dinner. Being of Lebanese heritage I just loved the authentic flavors which are hard to come by especially living in cape may. All in all great meal
