I honestly have no idea why people get so excited about this place. The food is okay, but it's not super fantastic, and it's certainly not worth the price you'll pay. The service is usually pretty good, I'll give them that. The atmosphere can be nice on the right night, but it can also turn into a wannabe night club, crowded and hot and full of wet-behind-the-ears business undergrads in ill-fitting suits with even worse pick-up lines. I'd really recommend going for lunch if you go for anything. Or just go to Molly's. Better atmosphere, on-par food, less expensive.
