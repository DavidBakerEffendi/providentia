This was ok. I'm not much for a seating arrangement here- came for a birthday party and the space was very small, seats uncomfortable, tables too low, and barely any table space. They forgot to bring our cheese platter. Then, I told them to bring out a dessert for someone's birthday. Instead of nicely presenting it with a "happy birthday" they just placed this wrapped ice cream bar on the table. We were confused and didn't know what it was. It was awkward (though it turned out delicious). The wine was good though and about 60% of the tapas were good: 1) Deviled eggs- good 2) Shrimp - not so good, swimming in oil 3) Spiced Lamb skewers- OK, nothing special here 4) Seared steak - good 5) pretzel - good 6) beet salad - good 7) roasted cauliflower- OK 8) duck manh mi - not so good, barely any duck pate 9) ice cream sandwich- great 10) cured meat - OK I would not necessarily rush back here.
