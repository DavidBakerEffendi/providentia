Food was good when it was properly cooked (cold sausage makes no sense right?)   The real problem here is the service.  I can't count how many times our waiter rolled his eyes.  I'll be gracious and omit any identifying characteristics, but I was so offended that I will not be returning to this restaurant because of him alone.  We were rushed through our order, and he kept trying to finish my sentences.  Sometimes the waiter just has to listen.    Only go here if you just broke up with your girl/boyfriend.  Then your attitude might fit in.
