This place instantly sprung on the scene and boasted to have Â the City's best Burger... Ich dont think so. The first time we went there I was served a pitiful patty with globs of special sauce (the sauce was the only thing with taste) Later that day I felt like I was struck by montezuma's revenge, we were both sick. A few months later I said hey I will give this place another try, I had the Pyt burger and to no avail it did not surpass my first visit. Not only was there flies everywhere but something smelled as well. Im pretty big into burgers in the area, with my father in law we did our own family quest for the best burger, which ended for us at phils in blue bell...( well that was until I had N 3rds burger) the burger I was served the second time was tiny, although had 2 patties but just did not taste good, the meat did not have anything special about it and I didnt get that BEEF taste, it actually tasted bad. They may make some special burgers to try and get people in the doors, but that may just be to try and polish up a dull main attraction. The roll is a martins potato roll which also was a huge letdown. This place has a nice decor and may from time to time have some good night time parties, But the burger just does not measure up one bit, which is not good if your main serving item is burgers.... Change the name to PUB... Pretty Untasty Burger save yourself the time, if your looking for a burger go somewhere else
