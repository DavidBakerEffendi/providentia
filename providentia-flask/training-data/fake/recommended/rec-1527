hands down the best baklava i've ever eaten.  i live in oakland and have a standing request to have some shipped to me by my girlfriend.  even after being sent through the usps, slightly squished, it's phenomenal. they use just enough honey for the sweetness, but not too much so the filo is still crunchy.  ya get a little savory taste with the salt + butter too.  never had any of their "real food" but it looked great!  when i go back to philly, i wanna try some of their zaatar pizza!
