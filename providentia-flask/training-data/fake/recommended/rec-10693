The restaurant had a live band, and authentic southern food. My table ordered the family meal for the six of us  and the food was lip smacking delicious.  Thumbs up on the penut butter pie. Definitely a to go to in Brooklyn. So many beers on tap  and a great variety of spirits,but I ordered the lemonade with berries and moonshine. Very summery and delicious. Talk about having the itis, I'm stuffed and loving it.
