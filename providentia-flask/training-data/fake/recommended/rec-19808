This was a fun spot to get a flight or try something different for a very affordable price.  We decided against having dinner because nothing really stood out; we instead had a few apps to tide us over.   A nice place to get on the patio, have a few standard bar food bites, and imbibe while watching the Vermont day go by.  If you're looking for a culinary experience, go elsewhere.
