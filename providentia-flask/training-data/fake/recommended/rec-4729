Fiance's mom: "I'm gonna take you to a bar our family has been going to forever. They've got really good Italian food. It's called Jo Jo's." Me: "I didn't know they have a Joe Jost out here. Cool. I've never eaten there but I've heard they have good sammiches." Fiance's mom: "It's Jo Jo's." Me: "Yes, Joe Jost. We have one in Long Beach. Never been but am amped to try it." Fiance's mom: "Sure, whatever." ....later when we arrive at restaurant.... Me: (seeing the sign clearly marked Jo Jo's) "Ok, you must have thought I was retarded. I really did think you were saying Joe Jost." I enjoyed the food here. I had one of the daily specials--shrimp/cheese stuffed tortellini with creamy tomato white sauce. It was Â Fing delicious. I felt compelled to lick the plate...but didn't cuz I'm a lady (sort of). Drinks were strong & the people watching was awesome. This place is crazy small so call ahead to get a table.
