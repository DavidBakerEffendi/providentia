Man...I want the pizza some of you guys were having, because I did not get the 4/5 star experience.  Don't get me wrong, it's good pizza, but there are definitely better slices all over the city. With that said, it's probably the best you'll find in Times Square.  Great crust, good sauce, the topping were okay.  The meats on my slices could have used a little more time in the oven as the pepperoni edges were not crisp and curving up.  Stay away from whatever slice had the ground beef on it - I had to throw it away. Great place if you're looking for a quick bite.  If you have time, try somewhere else.  Also, am I the only one who thought the slices were a bit on the oily side?
