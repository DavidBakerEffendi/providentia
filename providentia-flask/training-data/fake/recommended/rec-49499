Update, tried this place again after a year of fright and terror of getting sick again, mostly on challange from a friend of mine. Didnt get sick this time, front end girl is.    Just as sweet as can be, but the food was very oily and disappointing. I dont know if i will go back but at least i didnt get sick.
