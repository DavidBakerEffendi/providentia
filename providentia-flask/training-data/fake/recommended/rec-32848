I recently moved to Lyndhurst and tried Francesca's on a recommendation. The pizza was delicious. I have tried the margarita and plain cheese. The pizza arrives crispy and piping hot. My Italian boyfriend said their rice ball is one of the best he's had. It's softball sized, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I will definitely be trying more items on the menu. Can't complain about a thing!
