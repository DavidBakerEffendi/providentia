I went here to see a band that I've been listening to a lot recently. I enjoyed the place and show. Had a good meal...Mac N Cheese was the star for me but the North Star burger held it's own as well. Doors to the venue were to open at 9 but didn't open until 9:15. I normally wouldn't care about a 15 min delay but our crew and 80% of all of the other people who attended the show were there around 8:30. So the bar/restaurant side where they make you wait in line to go into the venue side was shoulder to shoulder packed with 1 bartender. Waited about 10 mins per drink. The venue should open its doors once a crowd starts to form in the bar part just so that people are not packed in like that. Once the venue doors opened and the crowd was now split between the venue and the bar/restaurant side then it was enjoyable/comfortable. The next downside came when we walked into the venue side and attempted to get a drink at the venue bar which also had just one bartender...this time a 15 min wait. Ugh. I truly believe that all of this waiting around had to do with just being understaffed. I noticed that halfway through the show both bars had 2 bartenders and the flow of service for drinks was now normal.  Both the front and back bars should of had 2 bartenders from the very start of the night. Especially for a show on a Saturday night.  I pondered about whether to give 4 stars or 3 and I went with 3 just because of the long wait at the bars. That's one of the most annoying things ever when you go out. Here's my 5-9 dollars per drink....thanks for making me wait 15/20 mins to buy them. Other than this service issue I loved this place and it's vibe.
