I've come to this restaurant over five times, and this is because it is the cleanest, most unique, and definitely one of the top three tastiest restaurants in Chinatown. I'm not sure what authentic Burmese food taste likes, but the food here strikes me as a combination of Thai, Malaysian, and Indian cuisine.  The menu is humongous - the second I flip through the pages I am bursting with mixed emotions of hunger, excitement, and pure agony over the necessity to decide what to eat from what seems like hundred of delicious options.   Don't let the potential for an emotional meal scare you away.  I recommend the following dishes: - Thousand layer bread with Potato curry (tried the Beef curry, not as tasty for some reason) - Rangoon house noodles - Jungle Beef - Pineapple fried rice (best I've eaten, even though I know this is not Burmese) - Southeast Asia Noodles (pretty much like Pad Thai so probably not an authentic experience either) The lentil fritters are really spicy, especially when you bite into the jalapeno bits so it's not really my thing.  I also tried the crab meat dumplings which seemed a bit too Americanized because of the cream cheese and minimal bits of crab - definitely not something I would ever order again.
