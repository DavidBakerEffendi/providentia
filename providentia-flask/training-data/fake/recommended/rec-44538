FIrst, I was really impressed with the service.  Came in around lunch time and they were very busy so my expectations to get a table right away was already low, however; I didn't realize how spacious the place actually is.  Lunch was delicious, I tried Matzoh ball soup for the first time and was not disappointed.  It was very flavorful and delicious.  The sandwich portion, even though I only ordered half was very generous, I couldn't finish my meal.  And I saved the best for the last, the cheesecake was delicious.  I have to admit, I am not a fan of sweets but I fell in love with their cheesecake.  It was creamy and just the right amount of sweet flavor.  I can still almost taste it.
