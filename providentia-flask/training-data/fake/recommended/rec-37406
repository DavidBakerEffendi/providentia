There is nothing I don't love about Wafa's! The food is wonderful, great prices, excellent service; not to mention that Wafa and her sons are so warm and friendly! I end up here at least three times a month. The food is consistently delicious! Favorites include the cauliflower, falafel, and spinach pie.
