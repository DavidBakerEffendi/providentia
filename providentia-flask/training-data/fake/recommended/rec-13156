After living in Cedar Grove for just over a month, I must confess I have so much love in my heart for Lombardi's.  The service food and service, whether dining in or taking out, are just wonderful. Portions are huge, the fireplace adds to the ambiance and the bread...ooooh that delicious hot bread..it's just to die for.  Also, order the veal parm; you will not regret it.
