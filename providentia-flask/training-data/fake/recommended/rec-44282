Just amazing; you'll likely have to wait but it will be worth it.  We had white clam and a sausage, roasted peppers and onion.  Both terrific.  Crust perfect.  Local sodas are a treat (birch beer a novel experience).  Coal-fired oven adds a unique flavor.  If you have room after pizza, walk a few doors down Wooster to Libby's for dessert and coffee.
