Fat juicy burgers here with crispy bacon and a good wad of american cheese. Weak bun not enough support in the burger to bun ratio department. Careful how you tackle these babies otherwise you're likely to have juice dribbling down...not pretty that's fer sure! They don't take credit card or debit so come prepared with cash. Fries are nice and crispy kinda like mcdonalds fries. Get a McSorely pint ($2.50!) paired up with your burger and fries and you're set for the day!
