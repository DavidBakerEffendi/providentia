What a gem!  After searching Yelp for something that was within walking distance of our hotel (Holiday Inn, Midtown) we decided to try Noodies.  There were three of us, and after reading other Yelp reviews we decided to call ahead for a reservation.  Glad we did!  It's a tiny little alley-type spot with seating for about 20 guests.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend calling ahead to make a reservation.  You'll be glad you did.
