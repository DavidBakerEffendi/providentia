Went tonight and was sorely disappointed.  Service was bad enough to make me lose my appetite and the food didn't help.  I used to come here for half price margaritas, we would just fill up on free chips and salsa, and we would STILL get moderately friendly service.  Now?  We didn't skimp on the food or drinks and the service was downright RUDE.  Our order for a pitcher of mojitos was messed up twice, the server would disappear for forty minutes at a time and then refuse to wait three seconds as we tried to pay the bill.  Mahi mahi tacos = gross.  I was hoping for that creamy, drippy, cilantro sour cream that is typically draped on fish tacos, but instead got glops of sour cream straight from the carton, along with what looked like the pre-shredded cheddar cheese from Acme.  The fish didn't taste fresh either, and there were no veggies in sight.  The chips are amazing and the drinks are fabulous, but honestly, the bad attitudes at this place are not worth it.
