Found this place online, and didn't realize it was their first week until the waitress mentioned it. The beer selection is pretty great,  a lot of German beers you don't see often.  Staff were helpful, friendly,  and fixed an order mix up quickly and with no problem. The pig knuckle was fantastic! Best I've had this side of Germany! A bit of a walk from the trains,  but well worth it.
