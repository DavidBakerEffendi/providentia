Reading the other reviews, clearly people have strong opinions about their ramen. Some awfully dramatic comments for a bowl of noodle soup. I consider myself a pretty cultured eater, but I fully concede that I'm not a ramen expert. So if you are the ultimate connoisseur of ramen, perhaps this review is not for you. Perhaps you would like to shun me and take me off the Christmas card list. Okay. That's fine. But if you just like good food and don't approach it with a checklist, I would definitely describe what I had for lunch today as delicious. Maybe the shoyu broth was a little salty, but I rather liked it that way. It had a complex flavor. The pork belly, scallions, and bamboo were all presented nicely. Noodles were properly cooked. Â I thought the portion size was perfect. I will come back often. It will be especially great when the weather gets cold. I have no problem with a small menu, which is now typed out properly with prices. I would have eaten any of the three ramen choices. The decor was very attractive, I thought. Yes, it took two chefs a few minutes to make two bowls of ramen (ours looked like the only order in), but let's be real here - it's minutes. Unless you hold some deeply held belief that ramen must be served instantly, you can handle the wait. I know the lunch options in this neighborhood very well and believe me, this is a welcome addition.
