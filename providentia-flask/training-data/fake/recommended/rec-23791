I came here for breakfast one Sunday and it was packed! It is seat yourself and a bit unorganized. Luckily, we only waited about ten minutes for a table. You order from the counter and then hope you have a table by the time it is ready! They have a small breakfast menu which is why it took me so long to get here, BUT they have a lot of great specials on the board daily. We both had Mexican breakfast specials. They were huge, unique, and delicious. This is great for a quick, sit down breakfast or lunch. I am really looking forward to coming back for lunch soon!
