I get excited about this place. Both brunch and dinner are equally good but having the option to have chili lobster at either meal is the #1 reason why I keep going back. That sauce... Oh my god, that sauce. Plus this place kills in its drink and wine choices. 2 of my top drink recs are that you must order bottomless mimosas (more bubbly than anything) during brunch and the banana Jameson at all other times. That is of course if you like bananas... And Jameson... And booze in general.
