Who knew that a new burger joint could be so popular on a Wednesday night? I've walked by many times since Umami opened this NY outpost a few months ago, and there were always lots of people inside. After several rounds of happy hour cocktails, three of us went to check it out. An hour wait. We had more cocktails at a bar down the street. We came back and our table had been given away. Luckily the hostess found us a bar table upstairs. The food was worth the wait! It's truffle season and if you like truffles, you better run over ASAP. I had the Truffle Special Burger which yes, is a beef burger (I thought it was all mushroom for some reason) with truffles, arugula and topped off with a gorgeous sunny side up egg. Cooked medium rare, it was the best burger I've had in a long time. So juicy! Paired with truffle fries and a craft beer, I thought I was in heaven. I offered a bite to my friend David R. but he said wait until later, which ended up being never because that burger was gone really fast.
