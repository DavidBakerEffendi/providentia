I write this sitting at peppercorn grill waiting for my dinner plate to be cleared. My fiancé and I had high hopes for our meal, we had tried peppercorn back in the winter during restaurant week and really enjoyed our experience. We had great food and a great server. A few months back we bought a groupon and tonight was the night to use it. To start we walked in and the host looked us up and down like we didn't belong. And even when he found our reservation he couldn't figure out where to sit us. (Our reservation was at 630 and most tables in the main dining room was empty). He also just pointed us to the table and didn't actually seat us or give us menus. As a matter of fact we got our bread well before our menus. Next was our waitress. She appeared already stressed and again there were maybe 3 other tables seated. She barely acknowledged us throughout our meal and frankly was just a giant sourpuss. One table actually said loud enough for us to hear how bad she was. We were impressed by the specials menu, we had many more options to choose from over their basic menu. We had the antipasto for the table which was delicious, so we had high hopes for our entrees. My fiancé had Chilean sea bass with shrimp and veggies, it was just ok, the description on the menu was better. I took a risk and ordered the cod special with lump crab topping, asparagus and a potato cake. The presentation was nice and that's about it. I suspect my food was victim to the heat lamp as my fish was so overcooked it was dead, buried and the funeral was already over by time it was served to me. It was very disappointing. We were looking forward to a great meal and this really fell short. We passed on desert. We are going to sonic for ice cream where you are greeted and served with a smile ;)
