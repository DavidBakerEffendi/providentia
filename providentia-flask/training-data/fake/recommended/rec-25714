Two Irish guys in a bar in Philly serving Ostrich burgers...intimate, not a huge menu but everything we tried was excellent.  If you avoid french onion soup because it's salty and otherwise tasteless, have some at Sassafras and your faith will be restored.  But really come for the burgers - great fresh meet on really nice buns that aren't too little but not so big that they overwhelm the meat.
