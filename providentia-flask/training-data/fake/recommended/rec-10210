Took a taxi to Pat's straight from the airport.  Got a cheesesteak with Whiz and onions.  And in the end, it was good but not amazing.  Maybe the hype got to me, I don't know, but I'd say that out of the touristy cheesesteak spots that I've tried, Jim's was way better than Pat's.  My cheesesteak was on the dry and lukewarm side, like it had been sitting there for a while.  I was a little sad -- until I walked to Jim's and ate another cheesesteak half an hour later.
