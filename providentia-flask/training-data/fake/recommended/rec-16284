Great to have a new wine bar in the neighborhood. I've tried the sangria, wine and appetizers Â (their fried rice balls are delicious!). A very warm and inviting space, staff and owners are friendly, and a nice vibe to meet with friends or a date. My only issue is the size of the drinks and wine - a tad too small. Since they market themselves as a wine bar, I was expecting / hoping for a more generously sized glass. Great to have them in the neighborhood though, they seem to be doing great business, and will definitely be back.
