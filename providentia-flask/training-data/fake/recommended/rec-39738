Not worth overspending for dinner here, but it is a nice place to go to and just walk around and maybe try a thing here or there. The only part worth waiting for are the walk up tables. Get a meat and cheese platter and a nice glass of red wine. I usually like to start there and just go to another restaurant in the area and get just an entree there.
