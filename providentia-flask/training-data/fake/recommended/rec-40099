Room Service is a bit deceiving. The exterior did not look much like a restaurant, which three me off. I read such good reviews, I didn't let that deter me. The interior decor was very fancy. There was a gorgeous chandelier in the center of the long, thin restaurant. Quite unique. My friend and I decided to go before the dinner rush. The tables are close by each other. You could probably over hear the tables conversations on either side of you. We were pretty much the only ppl there, so it was quite and relaxing. Oh, btw...the food was delicious!! :)
