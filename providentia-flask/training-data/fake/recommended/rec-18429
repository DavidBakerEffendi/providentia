I like everything about this place:: exceptionally good food (that it is good for you is a big plus); clean, friendly, good delivery, price, etc.  This is the real thing: I can't believe how fresh and flavorful and sophisticated these under $10 meals are.  Ingredients are really really fresh and there is obviously a lot of thought given to their menu.  This is a HUGE addition to the neighborhood food choices.  I always do take out or delivery but it is a pleasant site to eat in, too.
