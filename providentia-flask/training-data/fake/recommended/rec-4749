Not that this place needs another 5 star review, but I've just got to give it one. Today was my first time eating chaat, but I love similar foods, and have wanted to try this restaurant for a while. The owner (I think) made it a memorable experience for both me and my fianc√©. It was a flavor explosion that was perfectly spicy (we like spicy). The lassis were awesome, although I felt a little guilty after eating mine; it was as decadent as any dessert...delicious. I look forward to returning. The seating area is very, very small, but we were lucky enough to snag a table. The owner even let everyone in the restaurant try something just because a kid that was there asked what it was. He told us we didn't have to pay unless we loved everything, and he would change anything we wanted. This is how a restaurant should be run, and this kind of customer service is why this place consistently gets 5 stars. They make you feel welcome and appreciated, like they truly want you to enjoy their creations. Other restaurants in Philly should take notice. We will definitely be back, and soon.
