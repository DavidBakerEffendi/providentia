Takes only cash; thats the only bad part. We went in the evening. The place was packed. Saw ppl bring their own beer and order food. We ordered the chicken dumpling w/ curry and coconut for the appetizer, Chicken Chop Noodle Soup for myself and Chicken Stir Fried Fresh Noodles for my wife. This was my first on the Â noodle soup and it was a good experience. The quantity was a lot. The waitress said that they make the hand drawn noodle, which maybe the reason behind the taste. My wife liked the soup too.. I would give a 4 / 5. We also tried the Mango smoothie, which was good too. My wife wants to go there again, so we probably would go next week before we leave to Atlanta.
