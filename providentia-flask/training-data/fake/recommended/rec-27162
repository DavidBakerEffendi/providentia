If I could award this place six stars, I would.  I've been meaning to write this review for a few months now. For years I've tried to convince friends that Middle Eastern food is not just kebabs, falafel and shwarma.  You can also have a fine-dining Middle Eastern experience.   This restaurant, well, proves my point.   This has gotta be how the sultans and pashas used to feast. The plates look mouthwatering and taste even better (A word to the wise, the food is not cheap).  Try the mouhamara, the grilled octopus was also delicious-- I still remember it a few months later. I haven't returned yet, but that's because of the price, not the food. I'm looking forward to eating here again!
