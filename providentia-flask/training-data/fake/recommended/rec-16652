This place is a solid east village standby.  Nothing I've had has ever really blown me away but if I'm feeling suburban and in the mood for Outback Steakhouse while living in the city, it's the place to be.  The Smith is Outback if Outback got dressed up for a night out on the town with the girls.   The prime rib is delicious.  The whole wheat pasta is decent if slightly bland.   Oh and the last time we went our service was pretty great.  Though I think the waiter might have been trying to bed my husband.  Whatever brings us our drinks faster...
