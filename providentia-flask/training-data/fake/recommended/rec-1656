OK, Lets get real. I don't get it. The attitude sucks here. The spoiled kid who I presume is the owners son is a jerk. How about saying thanks to someone. Customers are dropping some heavy cash after waiting in line forever and you don't have the decency to greet them or say thank you? That is BS! It's not like there is a shortage of cheesesteaks joints in Philly and the burbs. I am not going back due to the bad attitude of these pompous jerks.
