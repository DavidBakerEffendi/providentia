We were in somewhat of a rush to get to a bus near 30th St. but the waiter was very understanding and recommended us the dishes that come out the fastest, and he wasn't fooling around: within about 10 mins we already got all of our dishes together (me burger, my dad ribs, and my girlfriend a salad) and had plenty of time to eat! My burger came with some great fries seasoned with parmesan (might be quite salty for the average mouth) and the burger itself was fair. my dad enjoyed his ribs, and my girlfriend was pleased with her salad being a vegetarian. All in all great zippy service and well made food on all levels!
