Beyond sushi, beyond amazing! The hubby and I are not huge vegan fans, but these vegetarian sushis blew us away. 'More tasty than fishy sushi' - raved the man. We had Spicy Mang and La Fiesta which were both delicious with matching sauce. The Jalapeno in the sushi was delightful and a clever multicultural twist to the traditional sushi. Just note that the restaurant is quite small as others have noted, it would sit around 15 at most. Be prepared to take away the food or share a table during peak hours.
