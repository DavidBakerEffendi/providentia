Food was good, but the service was questionable. The waiter either had way too many tables or just wasn't good. He didn't take our drink order until 20 min after we were seated so we just ordered our food at the same time. Unfortunately this didn't speed things along. We got our oysters before our beers and then our food arrived about an hour and 10 min after we arrived. It was only my husband and I so our food shouldn't have taken that long. Probably won't be returning which is unfortunate since the food is good.
