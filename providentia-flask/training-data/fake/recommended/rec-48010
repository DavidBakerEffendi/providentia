Came here for dinner tonight, and was very impressed.  Me and my fiance are staying in Brooklyn for the weekend, and it is her birthday on monday, and we both love Italian food. We started with an amazing caprese salad, which is probably the best Ive ever tried(and I worked at a great italian restaurant for three years, so I would know).  we then had spaghetti pomodoro, and fusili in a cream sauce, both of which were fantastic.  We ordered a 1/2 litre of wine, which our waiter chose for us, and was a great pick.  The service was fantastic, and the gentlemen serving us were great to talk with, but also gave us privacy as well.  They truly went the extra mile to make my fiances birthday extra special, without me even asking, and that made all the difference.  These guys know how to run a restaurant, and create a true dining experience, that is rarely seen these days. Thanks guys!!
