Nice ambience and staff, but the food is a little bit dull next to legit Indo food, which is pretty much the case throughout NYC. The tempeh was decent, but they didn't serve rice with it. No rice? Really?  Then charged me $3 for a side of rice and $2 for a little sambal. A pretty tasteless lemongrass tea on top, and I'm out $30 lunch.  C'mon folks, you can do better.
