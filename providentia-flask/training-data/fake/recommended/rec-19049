Not to be repetitive, but the decor in this place really does go a long way in making me heart it all the more: it has all the ambiance of an upscale eatery, with a much more reasonable price-tag. I'm not usually one for salads as an appetizer, but I have to say, my fellow Yelpers have a pt: the spicy tuna salad is on point. I honestly couldn't have imagined that many complex flavors in a salad, prior to tasting Room Service's. Roommate had the green dumplings, which were pretty dense. We also had the pumpkin curry--delish--and the spicy basil fried rice--solid but as impressive. Oh and their dozen+ varieties of mojitos are a must; coconut's a stand-out. Minus a star for servers who, though friendly, were decidedly distracted. Granted it was 9 on a Thurs. night, and the place was packed, so at least they weren't just being lazy.
