3.5 Hmm no hot sauce to have with the eggs, brusque waiter-service and quite slow on the food delivery... Also a little pretense about not having a reservation although there was a ton of space inside. But the caramelised banana, peanut butter gelato topped cinnamon brioche French toast made for quite an extravagantly delicious brunch. Where was James Franco though?
