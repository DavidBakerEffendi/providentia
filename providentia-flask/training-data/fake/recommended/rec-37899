Used to stop in here quite a bit back in the day. Please note, because of my work I see a lot places from the best in class to festivals. Service sucked- bartender was too busy chatting it up with employees Food- Philly is great for wings, these were not good. Atmosphere - charming Perhaps it was an off night?
