This was perfect spot for lunch with sisters and mother....started with black bean soup, spinach empanadas and the duck rellenas, soup had a ton of flavor, ripe avocados and plenty cilantro, rellenas were crispy with duck confit inside and empanadas cooked perfectly. Two of us ordered cubano sandwiches which were huge, flavor was good, bread tasted fresh baked. We also had the Romero salad, the anchovy dressing was awesome and fish tacos, which are my fav, crispy fish, chipotle mayo and cabbage that tastes like it was pickled. difficult to eat with my hands, so I begin with fork and hallway thru I'm just picking tacos off plate, yes they are that good! Also had a side of rice and beans, which could be shared by two definitely. Finally, do not overeat because you have to try a dessert....maybe the lime tart which was smooth and tangy with buttery grahm cracker crust. Or the coconut rum bread pudding, served warm...YUM!! Waitstaff is always pleasant, not pushy or pretentious....I hope Blue Cat has much success because we love this place. P.S. Server forgot one app, so bought it to us later....at no cost, that was a plus!
