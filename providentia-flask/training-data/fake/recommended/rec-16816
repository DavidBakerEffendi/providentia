Drinking Beer outside is great. Drinking beer with the spawn of the hipsters running around on a Sunday evening isn't. Michelle and I stopped for drinks and apps before dinner at E.G.G.. Liters of delish brewskies, or a half liter if you can't handle it. Ping Pong and Jenga to while away the time. A fire pit going and Sm ores for sale only sugared up the kidsters. We only had the Potato Pancakes with Salmon and they were meh. This was or second visit and we will probably be back again for more outside drinking.
