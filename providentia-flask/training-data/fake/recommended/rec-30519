Market Table is the kind of restaurant I *wish* was in my neighborhood.  Amazing, healthy, food, cute and cozy, and super friendly and accommodating staff. Nice wine list but no cocktails... can't get a dirty martini here ladies!   Market Table ::on knees begging:: please open a location in midtown east!
