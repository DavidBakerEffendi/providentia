This review is for delivery: I wish I could actually give ZERO stars for this place! We ordered breakfast from here on foodler. It took them ONE HOUR and FORTY-FIVE MINUTES to deliver our food to us. I called them about an hour after we placed the order and the woman said it should have been delivered "A WHILE AGO," so she would call me back to check on the driver. We called a few more times and got different answers--it was very obvious that they were lying to us. If they would have just admitted their mistake(s), we would have been fine waiting instead of all the lies. When we got the food it was was sub-par at best. The pancakes were rubbery and the syrup was terrible. They also used some weird tasting artificial butter. They also did NOT listen to our instructions to NOT put chocolate chips in the pancakes. We also got the salmon omelet, which was overwhelmingly covered in cream cheese. This experience ruined brunch for us that day. We will not be ordering from here again.
