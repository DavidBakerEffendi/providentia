I moved out to the east coast some months ago and have noticed that the Mexican food is very much not the authentic Mexican food I have been blessed with in the Rocky Mountain region and west coast of the nation. I would say that if you are looking for the authentic Mexican dish, this is not your place and keep going a few blocks up the street on Passyunk to find your more authentic, less aesthetically pleasing set of restaurants. This place is fun and has a fun more American style Mexican food menu.
