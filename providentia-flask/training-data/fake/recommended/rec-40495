I use to love eating at Jones, but after a visit on Saturday I'm not sure! Food is still good, but the front desk hostess in my option is rude and not very welcoming. We had a reservation and were a few minutes early. She said they are just clearing up a table, it will be a few minutes. That's fine, but after seating other parties, and waiting 20 minutes, I asked again. She said, for the second time, they are clearing a table, with not even an apology and a very cold tone. Finally we were seated after 30 minutes, and this was with a reservation!!. My daughter asked for crayons for her daughter, hostess said I will try to find some. She never returned. I have told others, and they do agree, that the reservation and seating practices are horrible!
