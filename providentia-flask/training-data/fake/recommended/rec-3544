I came here with misguided expectations. I was expecting a Cuban restaurant with some drinking and great outdoor seating. What I found was a great outdoor space with lots of drinking and some Cuban influence. The Cuban sandwich was pretty good, but it weirdly came with mayo instead of mustard. My wife had some fish tacos and the grilled corn. The corn was unequivocally awesome. I was rather disappointed with the drinks. The only cocktails were frozen and came out of 7/11 Slurpee style machines. My main motivation for coming here was getting a mojito on a hot summer afternoon, and the frozen stuff was fairly awful. That being said, if you know what to expect, this is a great place to hang out and drink in the sun with some better than average but not fantastic Cuban food.
