Asked our server for ice water twice. Tried to ask the lady behind the bar for ice water and rudely told to wait for your server. Finally got the ice water after we were done with our meal My beef stew was not so good. Salad that came with it was wilted and dressed with pure vinegar and the roll was stale. Wife's banger on a bun was good but missing the mustard. Only one other option at this gate area so I guess next time we'll try that place.
