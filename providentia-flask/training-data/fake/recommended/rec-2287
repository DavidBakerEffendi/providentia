Don't be confused by the imitators.  The original and true Halal Cart is the one in front of the Hilton on the SW corner of 53rd St. & 6th Ave.  They don't set up until 7:30pm.  The daytime vendors are different.  Look for the yellow hoodies that say halalguys.com and 53rdand6th.com.  Get the half chicken, half lamb, over rice -- delicious.  Like everyone else has said, the white sauce is bomb and the red sauce is pretty damn hot sauce.
