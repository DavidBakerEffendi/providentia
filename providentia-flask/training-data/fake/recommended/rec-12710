When my mother and I came here on a Friday morning around 10:30 we had an hour and a half wait- it seems like this place is always packed, so be prepared to wait. I wasn't excited about the wait since I was starved, but they have a really cool app where you can see the number of people in front of you, so you can go explore the area and come back when its your time. The food was delicious!! I got the steak and eggs and thoroughly enjoyed it! I also had a mimosa, which had plenty of champagne in it. On my next trip to NYC I would love to come back.
