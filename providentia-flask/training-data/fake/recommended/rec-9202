I must say I was not impressed! I will give Hearth credit for not screwing up my BFs surprise 30th birthday dinner! We were in NYC for the birthday celebration and 6 other friends met us there from out of state for the big surprise. Now this was quite a feat to pull off... not to mention to make 8 people happy about a restaurant selection. The politely accommodated my request for 6 of the people to show up at 8pm, and the birthday boy and myself to show up at 8:15. It went off without a hitch and he was quite surprised! 5 stars for that! The restaurant was cozy... they sat us all next to the kitchen which was quite warm and not very pleasant. I didn't quite understand what the "theme" of the restaurant was. All the waiters had on flannel shirts and blue jeans as if they had just come in from the farm. I think I understood what they were going for but it was really a miss for such an expensive meal. Oh about the expensive meal... WAY overpriced for the quality of the food. Everyone at the table said the meal was "just okay" or "pretty good." No one was blown away for sure. Which would have been okay if we didn't shell out about $100/person. It seemed that the chef was trying to come up with some down home menu selections that somehow just weren't very impressive. So unimpressive that I really don't even remember what I had!
