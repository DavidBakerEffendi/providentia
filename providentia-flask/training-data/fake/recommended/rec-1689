Our hotel is only like a block away from the RTM so we decided to come here for a late breakfast/early lunch.  We got there at 10 or so and sat at the counter.  Both my buddy and I ordered the roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone.  The sandwich was good...not great like I expected, but still very good.  The meat was hot and had a good pork flavor, the rabe was a little bitter and it had a great garlicky punch to it. The sharp provolone was a nice added touch.  One thing about that though....On Man vs Food etc, they show them carving off chunks of cheese from a block of provolone.  They did not do that here.  I saw them pick up sliced cheese and put it on the sandwich.  The flavor was still great but it was different than what I expected.  The bread they use was pretty good too.  It got a little soggy but still held up well.  I'm glad I got to try this place.  If I ever go back I might try something else...I'm more in the cheesesteak/hoagie clan than roast pork clan.  The lady serving us was very friendly.  My buddy liked it a little more than I did.  You cant go wrong though if you stop here and grab something to eat.  Its pretty good but there are better sandwiches in Philadelphia.
