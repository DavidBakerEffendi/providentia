We picked up two Classic Sandwiches super spicy. Ingredients include ground pork, Vietnamese ham, pickled carrots and daikon and cilantro on a very fresh roll. It was delicious, well balanced and very fresh. Dinner for my wife and I for $11. Hard to beat that. I'll be back and you should give it a try.
