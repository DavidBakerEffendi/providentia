I'll preface my review by saying I'm hard to please when it comes to pizza by the slice (although this only applies during daylight hours, when I tend to be slightly more discerning about my pizza that's been sitting out uncovered on a counter for who-knows-how-long) but I just wasn't thrilled here. The slice was sort of just meh all around. The bf wasn't thrilled either (and he's much more enthusiastic in his slice affection) but he did seem to like his purchase a little more than I did. Pricing isn't terrible for what you're getting, but I don't think I'll be back.
