Every summer I take a trip to New York, and every time I must eat at Carmine's.  I crave their Chicken Marsala.  It is so good.  The portions here are ginormous and the place is always crowded and loud.  You definitely need to make a reservation.  I would love to go with a bigger group and try several different things on the menu, but I highly recommend the Marsala!!!
