I was stumbled across this place on yelp and looking at the great reviews, I had to check it out myself! I went in for a late lunch which was good.  It wasn't crowded at all.  The place is super cute and small.  I sat over at the bar and you can see array of alcohol stacked pretty high.  It gave it the bar feel but not bar food feel. I looked at the menu and of course I had the famous burger whiskey king that came w foie gras. Since the foie gras in CA I had to get in my burger w fried egg.  I also ordered a side of the duck fat fries.   When my food came, the burger was HUGEEEE!! I'm pretty small so this thing had to be cut in half.  I took one bite and it was mouthwatering esp with the egg that dripped down. Yummm.  The duck fat fries was like icing on the cake and complemented the burger really well. I had of course leftovers and took it with me.  This place is def worth checking out :)
