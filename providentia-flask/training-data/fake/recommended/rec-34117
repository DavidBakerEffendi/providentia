Was near New Haven visiting an old high school bud and I got advice from a coworker in Chicago to give this place a whirl...and boy, I am glad I did. One of the best all round restaurant experiences I have ever had. The atmosphere was lively and fun, the dining area was immaculate and from what I could see the bar was clean almost to a fault. That's just the appetizer because the service was solid and the food (911 Chili & Chicken Waffles) was outstanding. The Chef? Owner? Manager? Carl came over to the table and was awesome conversation with a warm/genuine feel. I highly recommend Box 63 and would travel a descent amount of time just to try this place!
