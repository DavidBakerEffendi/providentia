Will never go here again. Reason we went was to try the 'Great Lombardi's!' They is nothing in this place that to write home about. 1. The pizza was nasty 2. cheese tearing from the crust as you pull every slice 3. Poor service. We were seated after a looong wait and parties thatcame after were seated before. 4. Non chalant waitresses who will not mind ignoring you for 2 hours because after all they are 'Lombaridis' and they dont care if you come back or not 5. Some parts of the pizza were so unedible and squishy that it was disgusting to even imagine putting that into your mouth So in the end I would say - "Keep Off!" you are better off walking into any random pizzeria in NYC and having a slice
