It's funny.  There are so, so very many restaurants in Princeton, and yet I feel like it is so difficult to get a good bite to eat.  Blue Point Grill is one of those places where you go to spend money for the purposes of not being disappointed.  I've never been disappointed with their food, or service, or atmosphere...even though when I was there this lady passed out and the ambulance came, but I asked and it had nothing to do with shellfish allergies, and everything to do with drinking an entire bottle of wine when you weigh a hundred pounds dripping wet.   But I digress.  My only problem with going to Blue Point Grill is that it's expensive and I can't go there more than I do.  But I have no problem paying for quality seafood, and that's what they have there.   By the way, I would just like to say, every restaurant should be a BYOB.   Anyway, I had the scallops, and though they weren't u10 scallops that you see in stupidface chain restaurants that were probable farm fed corn somehow....eek, they tipped a good nine or ten little suckers onto my plate, and damn.  They were good.  Very well seasoned -- not too much!  And the baked potato was the best baked potato I've had out in...well, I can't even remember.  Let's go with ever.  It was very soft and tender, not like it had been sitting in a hot pan all night long, even though it was close to 10pm when I got my food.  Speaking of getting food?  It was SO FAST.  Which I love, because I was really hungry.   Also they give you oyster crackers in the bread basket.  Nice touch.
