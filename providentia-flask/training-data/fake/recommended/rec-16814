guaranteed fast service along with good quality pizza. Buffalo chicken and bbq chicken pizza are my personal favorites. The white meat chicken toppings used are a meal in of itself. The only downside are the steep prices but its justfied in quality and its one of the only good pizza shops in a couple mile radius... The fact that its in the heart of temple campus assures a fast turn over.
