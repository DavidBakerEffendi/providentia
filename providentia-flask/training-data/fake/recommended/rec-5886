Mmmm, goat tacos. The waitstaff is certainly on the super duper hipster side of the fashion aisle, which often enough translates into apathetic or incompetent service (it's often true, I'm just saying it is all) but that is not the case here. The margarita I ordered was good but not really amazing or all that special. But, seriously, mmmmm goat tacos.
