Blue Point Grill is definitely a seafood staple in Princeton. I would say the place teeters on the $$$$ mark, just because some of the entrees easily push $30 but I think the price reflects the quality and freshness of the seafood that you're getting. Plus the fact that it's BYOB definitely helps your wallet (and enjoying your company). Everything here is good. Everything. I mean it. A trick we sometimes do is order 2 appetizers each and a bunch of sides. Great food and you still end up walking away very full. The place is constantly packed so book reservations early and often. When you go, and I hope you do, try to get Cindy as your waitress. We've known her for years and she's great.
