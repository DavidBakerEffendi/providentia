The rooftop bar is a great place to take out-of-towners, but it's a little too touristy for locals.  Wine and beer lists are uninspired and reflect old trends, but the cocktails are above average.  Some use ingredients that aren't rare, but are not normally found and consumed in Philly (like Pimm's No. 1.)   The last time I was there, I was a bit embarassed for the staff.  Our server exuded an attitude that should only be reserved for top lounges and restaurants-- not for a place that was popular and innovative five years ago.   Overall, this place is good if (1) you're starting a date with a quick cocktail, (2) entertaining people from out of town, or (3) are in the mood for an overplayed retro motif.  Not that (3) is a bad thing, but the place is getting a little stale.  Small plates and cocktails haven't been cutting edge in Philly in years and in NYC for a decade now.
