We had the pleasure of meeting the new owner tonight, Maurice, who has done an excellent job reinvigerating the old Rodolfo's with a friendlier atmosphere and even better food.  It's a BYOB but theirs a liqueur store practically next door.  The food was excellent and the portions were generous. (I had a special, the seafood Fra Diavolo.)
