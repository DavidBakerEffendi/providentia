We had every intention of going somewhere else when we saw the happy hour specials listed on the sign outside and decided to give this place a try. The happy hour prices for dinks are pretty excellent (about $6 for a glass of wine) and the flatbread pizza is a must. For happy hour it is a pretty decent price, but I would be willing to pay full price for it. The bartender was very friendly and extremely attentive. The place is on the smaller side so not great for a large group, but if you are looking for a decent place to go for lunch or after work with a few people, i'd highly recommend Saleya.
