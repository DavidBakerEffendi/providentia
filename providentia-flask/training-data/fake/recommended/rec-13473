I live in CA.  I still think about this cart when I think about food or NY. Wish they would open ones in other states. I had the lamb plate 3 times in my 4 day stay in NYC. The real cart is open during the day on the southeast corner. At night it is on both the southwest and southeast corner. And they have one on 53rd and 7th.  across the street from the sheraton towers. The sauce is way better than any yogurt sauce I've ever had.  And the hot sauce is real tasty too.  Everything is perfect about the lamb plate and if you get the pita.  I think it is more of a flat bread because is real soft and perfect. And it so inexpensive.  And the portions are huge.  My wife and I end up just sharing one plate. The imposters are on the southwest corner during the day.  They have yellow shirts with no logo.  And they don't have the logo on their plastic bags.  They are jerks too.  Someone in their line was leaving their line and I told them the real guys are across the street.  They started going crazy and yelling at me.
