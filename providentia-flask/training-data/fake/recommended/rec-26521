Mistral after all the hype and praise we read, my friend and I were quite excited about our dinner at Mistral. Sitting outside was lovely - but being ignored for 15 minutes was not. Service was not attentive - we asked three times to get water glass filled. And the food was a disappointment. The famous clam soup with custard was permeated with onion slices and included something that tasted like potato chips. Another dish, a gnochi with mushrooms was a mushy mixture of not wonderful flavors. The grilled octopus was the best of the dishes we ordered - but hard to spoil that. Everything was very salty. No bread is served - only rice crackers which are fried. We will not return. This was an "elephant's new clothes experience."
