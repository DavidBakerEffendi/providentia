i was so excited to check out cuban pete's because the patio looked awesome. unfortunately, the food was mediocre and my mojito tasted like lemonade. our waiter was nice enough, but very slow considering the place was half empty. *beware vegetarians. usually i can find something at any place to eat, but almost everything had meat. the only alternatives here are tapas that are cheese based :-(
