I made a reservation for a group of 11 people. There were some misunderstanding de to lack of communication when I made the reservation, but the staff were professional and patience. We worked through the discrepancy well. The restaurant manager is very nice, his attitude solved 90% of the problem. Really enjoyed our time, highly recommended. The food is really decent, kinda feel like underpriced (shhhh....). I will definitely going back to OBAO and try all the dishes!
