Where should I begin?! This place is amazing! My husband and I found it via Yelp and it did not disappoint! The owner, Sandra, greeted us upon arrival and helped us decide what dishes to try. I had the Go-Green chicken w/ Mac&Cheese and fried Okra and my husband had the fried chicken, cabbage, and yams. Both were delicious and the portions were huge! And let's not forget the warm buttery corn bread delivered to our table before our meals! OMG it was all great! We will definitely be back the next time we find ourselves in CT!
