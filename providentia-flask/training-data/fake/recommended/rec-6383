I'm not an active reviewer, but Pylos deserves it. If I could give 6 stars just to one restaurant in NY, Pylos would be the winner. Hands down best restaurant in town. I've been there several times and it's hard to say what's the best dish. Everything is fantastic from the Greek salad to the amazing baby lamb chops. Other dishes to give a try are the dips (I don't love the eggplant dip, but the fish and the yogurt ones are yummy) and the grilled whole fish. Feels like home!! If you love chocolate keep some space for dessert. The chocolate mousse is outstanding! Finally the service is even better than the food (at least equal). It's just and amazing experience overall. Worth a try. Pylos, thanks for existing!!!
