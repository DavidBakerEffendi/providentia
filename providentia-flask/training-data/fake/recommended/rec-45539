We went here for breakfast Sunday morning and just missed the crazy large brunch crowd that was arriving in masses when we were leaving so thank goodness for that blessing. Never having been here before I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it was nice. The place was small and they had you sign in outside the door which was something new to me. Service was very fast and they seem to be extremely well organized. My daughter and I split 2 meals half and half. We had the monkey french toast and an egg and cheese sandwich. The monkey french toast was very good, not too sweet. I was afraid it was be like a coating of sugar, but it was perfect. The egg sandwich was okay. It was dry and the cheese wasn't melted all the way through. I didn't care for the home fries. They were overly seasoned and not very tasty to me. My husband got the st patty day pancake special which he devoured. We all tried to homemade ketchup and my husband proclaimed that they need to bottle that stuff up and sell it. It was so tangy and tasty.
