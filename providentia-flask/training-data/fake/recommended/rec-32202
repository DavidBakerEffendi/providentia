Soooo good, its small, its cramped, but soooo good! They are not fast, they are not cheap, there is no where to sit and wait, they treat you like your a family member. Â But when you eat their masterful sandwichs you and your heart sing. They are every bit as good as katz deli in nyc but without the having to go to ny to get it. Plus you dont havecto pay bridge tolls, gas, parking, driving thru the morons or the extra $5 you'll pay for your food just for being in ny! Extra hint: park at the cvs across the street and run over, street parking is rough to find.
