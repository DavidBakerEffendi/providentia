Me and my husband ate here for breakfast and the food was delicious. I got the huevos rancheros which was delicious and the flavors were perfect! I love chorizo for breakfast and this hit the mark. Hubby got the challah stuffed french toast and it was delicious as well. The cream cheese was literally cream cheese not the sweetened kind but it obviously was coated in a sweet sauce. The service was ok, waiter forgot our water twice and hubs oj. But he brought it right before we paid and did not charge us so besides that everything was amazing and the place is so cute!!
