We went here to avoid the common deuschebagerie associated with the trendy places, did not dissapoint.  I had freid Goat, she had Chicken Ettouffe, they were both perfect.  They both came with soup and salad.  I had conch, she had veg, both were amazing.  Salad was normal, but it was easy to see someone took care in plating it.  We had a traditional dessert, Papate?  It was really good, like crumb topping almost.  I would absolutley highly reccomend this place.
