headed down there a few weeks ago with my sister and brother in law. i had heard this place had an extensive bar, and my brother in law is a whiskey and rye aficionado- so i thought i'd bring him there and try to impress him. and he was impressed! we had drinks and dinner. the drinks menu is extensive- and really cool! the food as delicious. well...my food was. we all shared the farmhouse platter meats, cheeses, fruit, olives) and a spinach salad. i had a special- sweet potato and lamb groton. it was seriously mouth watering. my brother in law wasn't as impressed with the pork he ordered. my sister had quail- which was great and definitely different. we ended the night with a homemade ice cream sandwich. i would definitely recommend- although i wish the food menu was a little larger.
