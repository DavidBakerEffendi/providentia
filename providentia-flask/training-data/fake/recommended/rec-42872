I had been wanting to go to DiNic's for a long time and while back home to visit family, we finally made a trip to Reading Terminal Market.  DiNic's had the longest line there and for good reason...this is, hands down, one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life. I got the roast pork and my boyfriend got the pulled pork, both with provolone and broccoli rabe.  While the pulled pork was delicious, for me the roast pork cannot be beat.  It was succulent and juicy with the sharpness of the provolone providing a nice contrast.  I didn't mind the broccoli rabe, it was not as bitter as I expected but I did take some of it off.   There is not much else I can say other than it was amazing and lived up to my expectations. It's cash only and don't be put off by the line, I thought it moved pretty quickly.  If you have room, definitely check out Bassetts afterwards for some fantastic ice cream.
