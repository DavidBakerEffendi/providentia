chicken rice with white sauce is simply the best! the perfect combination of flavorful rice, side of fresh lettuce, pita, and tender juicy meat all drenched in addictive white sauce over top for 6 bucks!   it almost always has a line any time of the day but i always try to walk here even though i'm many many blocks away--it's that good!  i hate lamb and never eat it but the lamb here doesn't have the typical "lamb" smell/taste and was actually good/edible even for me!  the hot sauce's a little too spicy for me but a bit is still awesome. best food/ value. there are lots of vendors in the general vicinity so make sure you get the right cart
