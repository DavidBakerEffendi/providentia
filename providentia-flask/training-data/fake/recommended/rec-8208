I can't wait to return to this cozy coffee shop in Burlington. The combination of wooden beams and floors, brick walls, garage door and bar seating overlooking the street and ridiculous amount of space in the back, makes New Moon an ideal coffee shop in my book. The rotating drinks of the day/week don't hurt either with Vermont flair like "syrup this" and "syrup that" - I'm always down for syrup. The folks working behind the counter are willing to play along with your questions and curiosities- always a bonus for those of us who are new to the world of coffee bebidas. A few other items worth noting: -veggie and vegan friendly eats (this appears to be one of the popular places to go for lunch in downtown Burlington) -gorgeous decor (chandelier) and plush seating - New Moon walks the fine line of "we tried" and "we tried too hard" -tall and industrial-like ceilings -honey at the sugar and fixin's bar (I'm always on the hunt for my next spoonful of miel) For my next visit: those tiny and adorable mini cupcakes
