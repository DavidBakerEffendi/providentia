Food here is excellent! Pho broth is very flavorful and the spring roll just perfect, but the best feature of all is the simplicity of the "menu". On weekdays, the options are: 1) pho beef or pho shrimp 2) small, medium or large 3) spring roll or not Service is fast and the right amount of attentive / interesting / funny. Expect some wait at lunch time. Enjoy!
