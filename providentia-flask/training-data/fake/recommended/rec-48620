I ate here summer of 2008. An adorable neighborhood restaurant gem that I will visit again next time I am in Philly. Delicious spring rolls, Pad Thai and Yum Salad and the best part to me was that you can bring your own bottle of wine! I believe they charged us a small corking fee, but it was very reasonable and really helped keep our bill down significantly. Quaint and lovely on both food and atmosphere...
