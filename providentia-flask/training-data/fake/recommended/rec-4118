Cheap good authentic Cuban Food. I first found out about this place on Yelp and decided to try for myself. I love the bacalau, pork chops and my personal favorite is Chicken Francaise. You have three options for rice. Either white, yellow, or the special rice that includes beans. The food here really does feel like a home cooked meal.
