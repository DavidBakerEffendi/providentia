You could easily drive by this place (like I have so many times), but it's worth a visit!  These guys take sushi pretty seriously, and the quality shows.  I had excellent Uni and a very good spicy tuna roll as well as very nice yellowtail and Ikura.  This was a very pleasant surprise, and get this.....they deliver!  Check it out.
