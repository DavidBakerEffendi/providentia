Quite good!  Reliably delicious food.  Nice vibe.  Good drinks.  Comfortable small bar area. I only wish the kitchen were open later! I don't remember what I ate, just that it was good :)  My friend also enjoyed everything too! 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't knock my socks off like some other places have.  Still, I love this place and will be returning soon.
