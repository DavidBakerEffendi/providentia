ditto what the other five-star-givers said.  I just had dinner here with a friend and we were greeted warmly, and they didn't hestiate to let us sit outside!  I feel like my friend and I served as an advertisement for the restaurant by sitting outside too because people passing by kept looking over at our food--which was amazing!  We both got the vegetarian sampler and cleaned our plates; I was very satisfied without feeling heavy, which I think is a good sign of quality cooking.   Almaz is definitely disguised as a mere coffeehouse, but don't let that fool you.  Having been to Abyssinia in west philly and getting quality Ethiopian food only after enduring the snotty, rude, and sloooowww service there, I can honestly say that for any center-city denizens, there is no excuse to pass up Almaz if you're craving ethiopian.  no compromises at this gem of a place--It's quality Ethiopian food AND very personable, genuine, and timely service! (as an addendum--I've come here several more times for dinner and the service/food are still just as great as the first.  I also came in once for sunday breakfast--I had a mad pancake craving but no energy to make them at home--and their pancakes were delicious and HUGE....I only barely got through half the plate!  is there ANYTHING they don't do well here???)
