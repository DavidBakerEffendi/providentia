Margaritas, Nachos, and that amazing salsa verde are what made me give this place 5 stars.  It has been the girls night spot for my friends and I for the last few years and I am never disappointed.   Food: fantastic, and if you can get the corn on the cob when its in season it is a wonderful unique treat! Service: decent I've never had any real issues Atmosphere: it can get very loud and dark, but that has rarely bothered me. When its nice out there is outdoor seating, and its a wonderful place to meet up on a hot afternoon at.
