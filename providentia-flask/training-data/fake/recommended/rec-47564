Like previous posters mentioned, the salsa at Beana's is horrendous - akin to pouring plain tomato paste into a bowl. Supermarket salsa is more flavorful and probably costs less than the swill we were served at this restaurant. The nacho appetizer wasn't bad; but then again, I could throw ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese on a plate and call it an appetizer, too. The guacamole looked great, but had absolutely zero taste - a dash of lemon or garlic was not to be found. Fellow diners ordered the "jumbo tacos," and described them as the taco equivalent of the nacho platter: zero taste, zero originality. My mother ordered the portabella quesadilla and couldn't eat more than a few bites because it had been piled high with jalapenos, an ingredient that wasn't included in the entree's description.  I ordered the little neck clams in diablo sauce, and I'll admit the diablo sauce had a nice kick, but the clams were SO salty I felt like I was sinking my teeth into a block of salt. Awful! No one at the table finished their meal, save for the person who ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Thank goodness Beana's is BYOB, because my cheap bottle of merlot got me through the evening. I was genuinely looking forward to my night out at Beana's. I remember eating here when it  opened a decade or so ago and having a pretty good experience; I can't help wondering what happened. The decor was charming and the service friendly - too bad the cuisine was abysmal. **UPDATE: Three - of the five - of us has food poisoning/upset stomach that night and into the next day. Diners beware!
