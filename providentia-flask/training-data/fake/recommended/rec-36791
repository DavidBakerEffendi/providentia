We had breakfast at Penelope's just before leaving New York. I give it 4 stars, since it's hard to achieve a perfect score just for breakfast. The place was really hopping. Very animated. Loud, but fun. Breakfast is mostly omelets and egg sandwiches. We had omelets. Both were very good. Fries on the side were excellent. Other egg sandwiches we saw looked really good. Good service. And this is Manhatten - so walk.
