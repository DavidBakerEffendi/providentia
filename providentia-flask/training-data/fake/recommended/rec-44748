I've gone here so many times, and still can't find one bad thing to say about it. The ambiance is always friendly, although the noise level is a bit high during dinner hour (especially on the weekends). Service is always extremely attentive and the staff is always extremely helpful and friendly. Whether you go for dinner, brunch or lunch, you're almost guaranteed to have a delicious meal. The bleu cheese cheese and brussel sprouts are both a must try. Make sure to check out the photo booth downstairs! Must try: Hot Potato Chips, Tomato Soup, Steak Salad, Jalapeno Cheese Grits, Tuna Tartare, Brick Pressed Chicken
