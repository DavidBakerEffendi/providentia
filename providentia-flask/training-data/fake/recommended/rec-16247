When we want a romantic dinner in an Italian restaurant, I usually take my wife to Olive Garden--all the breadsticks you want baby and house wine straight from the box! My wife wanted "real Italian food," not Olive Garden. I argued that at Olive Garden, we're family, but she still wanted her "real italian." I picked Vite because it had the most italian name. The cuisine is amazing. They make their own pasta and have innovative dishes. I had the lamb ragu and my wife had the spaghetti with scallops. Both dishes were great. Tip: In the bathroom, they have a CD playing beginner Italian lessons. I spent a long time in there and now know conversational Italian.
