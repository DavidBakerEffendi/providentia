Food was AMAZING! Our waiter was A+ and knew the menu very well. He ultimately helped me decide on my dish. We even went close to closing and he was still very patient with us. The garden patio is so pretty, especially at night! Loved it. When we were done with our food our waiter gave us all free glasses of Moscato which was delicious! Will be visiting here again for sure! A+ everything.
