This is the perfect restaurant if you're in the mood for a very good wine by the glass, some socializing and a bit of a snack. The wine list is very well thought out and we've been back to drink a few times, and have brunch when it's not so crowded. The place is tiny cramped and feels French in its approach to diners. If only the food were better. The small plates were comme ci, comme ca, and were mostly small. Size isn't so important but many of the dishes felt like they had been sitting around for a few hours and then microwaved. I don't know if this is what is actually done here, but the food had that heat me up vibe. On the one occasion when we went for dinner, we order about 9 courses before filling up, and I have to say, it was the wine that was the stand out in all food wine pairings. But a lovely feeling here, to sit and drink and watch the people settle into their cramped spaces.
