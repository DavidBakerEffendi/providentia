I really love the food here, and am a huge fan of their sister restaurant (National Mechanics). They serve the cactus burger (vegetarian) which is my favorite. The cactus is so mild but has such a great texture. They also have great guacamole and chips, and many quesadillas. The atmosphere is just a little weird, and the service isn't always the greatest. It's kind of a dance floor with high tables set up. (The floor is for salsa lessons.) Since it's still new it also tends to be empty, but that means you should go if you want a place you can actually talk in, and not shout (which is one of the downsides to National Mechanics).
