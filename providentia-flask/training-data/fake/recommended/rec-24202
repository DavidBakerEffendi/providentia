I decided to hit up Zento for restaurant week because I'm such a big sushi lover! Its located right in old city philly where it used to be called Grey Lounge. The decor is very nice and the restaurant is quite small. The menu is a bit pricey but overall food is great! Their drink menu is also pricey but at the time that I was there, they were half off. I had the Geisha Girl which is a vodka cranberry martini with mangos and cranberries in the drink which is very interesting. The drink wasn't too strong and it was a little sweet due to the mangos. Now down to the food, I ordered the Kani salad. The Kani Salad is by far the best thing I've had. I also had the Flaming Dragon Roll with spicy tuna topped with eel. If you do not like raw fish and a first time sushi eater, this is recommended. I also ordered the Volcano roll which is very good. My boyfriend ordered the Mixed Sushi and he enjoyed it. Lastly, I had the Mochi ice cream. You can never go wrong with that! Zento is best for a date or just a nice night out in town with the girls. Although food was great I gave it 3 stars because I felt rushed by the server.
