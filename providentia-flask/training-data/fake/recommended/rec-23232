Decent Mediterranean food but the appetizer portions are disappointingly small. The hummus and cheese dishes seem woefully inadequate when they plop a huge basket of pita bread next to it. However, I do have to admit the Phoenician fries are delicious. For the main course, I had the loup de mer (for two; I shared, obviously) which was fine. Two of my friends had the Mixed Grill for two, which was a ton of meat though taste-wise not overly impressive. Another friend had the scallops, which literally came in four small pieces - do not order. Our group had a negative experience when the waiter dropped and smashed all of our drinks, spilling on my friend's jacket. We weren't charged, of course, and they replaced our drinks (after a somewhat lengthy delay... Actually, in general the service was a bit slow, though it was 9:30pm on a Saturday night) but there was hardly an apology from the waiter. That left a bad taste in our mouths. Overall, I would say there are better options in New York City, but if you're making last minute reservations you could do worse.
