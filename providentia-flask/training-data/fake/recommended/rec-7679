I came here convinced not to eat - well I was not hungry! Kinda late lunch day. Just drinks with my girls - in and -out kind of situation. Appetizer, main course, desert and a bottle of wine later  I was leaving let's just say ... happy. The food is a phenomenal trip to near perfection. Light, real, simple. Atmosphere very unique in it's own way. Service just right (if you don't notice you are missing something  then it is good) and the music was pleasant and fit the surroundings. I want to go back  for sure - hungry next time/
