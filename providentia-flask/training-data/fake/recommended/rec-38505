Seriously some of the best food i have ever had!! i love salads and the Veggie Chaat at Mood is one of the best salads i have ever had. I had a friend tell me i had to swing by and check it out. When i arrived i was greeted by the owner/operator Hasan. He was friendly and helped explained to me exactly what chaat was and  gave me a run through of their menu.  He made our food quickly and masterfully and even came to check on us to see how everything was when we were about halfway through our chaat.  Hands down i would come to this place daily if i lived closer by, but for now i will have to settle on swinging by any time i am in west philly. Seriously do not skip going here based on one or two persons bad reviews. I am thrilled i made to Mood and am already planning my next visit. Thanks Hasan!
