There's Pizza and then there is Pizza from Lombardi's.  Located in Little Italy on Spring Street, this place is in a class by itself. Only regret I had was that we should have ordered the larger Pizza.  Crust was as close to perfect as you can get and the tomato gravy was excellent.  Bread sticks were ordered as an appetizer and were just OK - Pizza was over the top.   We stopped here the last night we were in the City which was a mistake. . . . If it would have been the first night, I would have eaten here every night I was in NYC.  They do not take plastic - there is an ATM machine in the restaurant and they charge for refills on your drinks.  Great place to go for classic NYC Pizza.  Easy five stars.
