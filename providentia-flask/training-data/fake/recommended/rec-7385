Ordered in for dinner last night after a long, hot day of drinking. I was craving something substantial but reasonably healthy. Wolfnights delivered (and in less time than the Seamless estimate!) The Brother's Grimm wrap was AMAZING. I literally woke up this morning thinking about how delicious that wrap was and plotting out when I would order from Wolfnights again this week. The beet salad was also really yummy. Two thumbs up. Only disappointment was the tater tots, which arrived a little soggy, but such is the cost of delivery I suppose. Prices are solid. Food is ridiculously fresh and flavorful. Delivery is quick. Wolfnights, I'll be seeing you. Soon.
