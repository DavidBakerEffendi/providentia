Arrived around 7:45 on a Thursday night, and hopped in the relatively informal "line" that accumulates in front of the bar.  The jack of all trades waiter/host did a decent job of figuring out how many people in each party in order to quickly turn tables over.  We ended up waiting around 30 minutes before getting to the front of the line, but we decided just to sit at the bar.   Bistro burgers were cooked perfectly rare-medium rare as requested.  The burger was delicious, and I would say that it compares favorably to any of my favorites in the city (JG Melon's, PJ Clarkes, Shake Shack).  The bacon on top was quite crisp and added great texture and flavor.  My one complaint was that the fries were undersalted.   Great and friendly service.
