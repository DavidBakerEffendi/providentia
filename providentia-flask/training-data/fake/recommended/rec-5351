Went there for cocktails before seeing a show at Helium comedy club the service was great, An employee that was off-duty and there with a friend having drinks as well got up and give us their seat at a table so we could sit!!! I had the ginger Rogers which is fabulous and my husband had the old-fashioned extra sweet also very good! Â Would love to go back there and eat the menu looks superb!!
