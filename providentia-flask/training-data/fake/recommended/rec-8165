NYPD smells better than any other pizza place ever. maybe because it's located so near sansom street, and the scent of fresh pies is just that much better after the moldy trash juice/dead body scent of sansom. The sicilian pizza at NYPD is the best i've ever had. The eggplant parm is also amazing, and i dont even like eggplant. The store is family owned and operated, and they all look alike which is pretty adorable. also, when my boyfriend broke his kidney a while back, he was in jefferson hospital across the street from NYPD and i brought him slices so he wouldnt have to eat hospital food. i'm pretty sure that's what saved his life.
