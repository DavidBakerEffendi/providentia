I've been coming here since I was a little girl so this place is home to me.  My parents were married here.  My bridal shower was here.  My daughter's Sweet 16 party is going to be here in August 2013.  Great food and ambiance.  The best part is that you can have a party or wedding here for a very reasonable price around $40 a plate depending upon the options you choose.
