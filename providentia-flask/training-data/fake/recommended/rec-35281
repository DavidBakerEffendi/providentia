Let me just say, I'm not a cheesecake person.   So, please take my review with a grain of salt.  Junior's cheesecake is probably one of the riches cheesecake I've had.  I really like that they have so many different variety.  So, I can choose a bit of devil's cake to compliment my cheesecake.   I think they best part is that they have sugarfree cheesecakes.   This is perfect for people with a sweet tooth and diabetes.  I know, because I saw my family member's eyes lit up like I've never seen before.  Probably a match made in heaven.  :) 3 stars from me as a non-cheesecake eater 5 stars from all those cheesecake lovers in the family = 4 stars overall
