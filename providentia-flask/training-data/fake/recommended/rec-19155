Ordered for delivery..it wasn't the best. I had high hopes for it based on the reviews, but maybe its better when its not for delivery? The grilled pork chops tasted weird and the shrimp and tofu was mediocre. =\ I wanna try eating there and hopefully it'll be a better experience, but I'm extremely reluctant.
