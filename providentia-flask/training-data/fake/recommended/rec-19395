I love coming here, especially if you are going with a large group. Or if you want to make friends! This is a large beer garden, and only a short walk from the Piazza. Games galore and food aplenty. Try their ginormous pretzels! The dipping cheese is TDF (to-die-for)! But really, go for the beer. Â Huge fan of the Dunkel-Weisse and Octoberfest. Hopefully, you can avoid ping pong balls that sometimes come flying by your head!
