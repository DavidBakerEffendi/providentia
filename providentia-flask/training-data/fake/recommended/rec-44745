My friends and I are from Toronto, and we came here for lunch while shopping in Soho and the West Village. It was the perfect little spot for a rest! Service was great. My friend is vegetarian and there were not many veg options on the menu besides a plate of vegetables or frieda, or an eggplant dish (but my friend does not like eggplant). Our waitress asked the chef to make her a pasta, wish she thoroughly enjoyed. I had the soft shell crab pasta which was absolutely delicious and unique, I haven't seen something like this on other menus before. We were told that the exterior to the restaurant was used in the Intro of Friends which was a nice bonus !
