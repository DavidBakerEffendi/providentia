Corn is okay. It's grilled with Parmesan cheese. That's it. I ordered the roast pork with yellow rice and blk beans to go. Pork had medium to light flavor but it was juicy. Beans tasted sweet. I'm cuban myself so I enjoy a bit more salt on my pork but for people who don't your in luck. Grilled steak is made with filet minion. Thick and juicy.. Ask for well done! Medium was a horror to eat on the run since fork is plastic and meat is xtra thick. I guess I would come back... Not a instant favorite tho.
