Cisco's serves some of the most terrific Mexican food not only in Newington, but in all of Connecticut! Clean, comfortable, dining space, and amazing food (not just breakfast!). The prices are more than fair, the meal portions are very generous, and the hospitality is outstanding. Cisco's is a must!
