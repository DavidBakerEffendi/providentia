This tavern is the FIRST (and only) place I would ever consider eating the next time I'm at the intersection of South Street, Maple Ave, and Freeman Street.  And it's the LAST place I would ever expect to find at the corner of this ... interesting ... neighborhood.  By the way, I am a pasta freakoid. I knew nothing of the venue before entering and expected trashy dive bar with pool tables and high tops; maybe a few dart boards.  But when I entered to find brick walls covered in B&W photos, white table cloth covered tables, and a center kitchen where fresh dough for bread and pizza is prepared and cooked; I was completely blown away.  And pretty much in love. The menu irked me with its steep pricing (it's lunch time, gimme a break), but I loved everything I ate so much that I forgot about the money signs. Housemade foccacia burst with flavor (aka salt and herbs and olive oil and garlic) and the Italian bread was a freakin godsend: not stale, airy and big, with a thin and not overtly crispy crust.  Nom nom nom...  I could just order a side of red sauce and dip my way through lunch.  Next time. I'm definitely in a restaurant that takes its food seriously (maybe I was at different restaurant than ya'll); I order the garlic and anchovies spaghetti bowl ($7 the cheapest lunch option, but no worries there are other options here).  Pasta cooked al dente (not Sbarro at all!!) and lightly dressed in olive oil/garlic, topped with (not enough) crisp fried whole anchovy fillets.  My pre-dinner house salad with homemade Italian dressing was fantastic!  With its crisp greens, chick peas, red onion, two types of olives, etc. and the dressing was great. Am I reviewing the same place you all are?
