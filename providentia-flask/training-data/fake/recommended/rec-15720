From start to finish, my experience was perfect!  It was incredibly crowded, but we had a 7:30 reservation and we were seated almost immediately.  I would definitely say to start with the calamari appetizer.  Its huge but delicious!  Perfect fried to a golden brown and a little crunch in every bite.  For the entrees we had the chicken parm(massive) and the Spaghetti and meatballs.  The chicken parm was the most incredible tasting parm I've ever had...EVER.  The spaghetti and sauce were fantastic though I will say, the meatballs were a little overcooked for my liking.  The meatballs are literally the size of softballs. We had an amazing waiter who catered to our every need.  He even thanked us personally  before we walked out for the very generous tip we left him. I will DEFINITELY be back to Tony's next time I'm in the City.  This is 100% on the list of "must eats in NY", along with Pastis and Maya mexican.
