Other than the drinks I can't fathom why someone would venture across the street from Yasuda to this place. Â The service is average at best (took our drinks without asking if we wanted refills), the food comes out slow (an hour for two appetizers and two mains that weren't much larger than the appetizers?), the menu is average in taste and presentation, and if not for the sake and beer I can't imagine I'd eve feel this good... I'm still bummed I didn't eat up stairs at the udon place and thank god I did eat across the street at Yasuda's to get the taste of Sakagura's out of my mouth.
