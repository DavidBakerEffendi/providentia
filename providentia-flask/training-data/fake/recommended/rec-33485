God, I used to love Joya.  Back in the day before you didn't have to wait an hour for a table and the food didn't make me sick as a dog!  Yeah, I love the mango martini and the curry, but recently when I take advantage of their great prices, my tummy doesn't respect my thriftiness.  The last few times I've eaten here I have left feeling ill.  And this is an unfortunate occurrence which lasts for a good 24 hours.  Perhaps it's my choice of entree, or maybe it's the lack of a good DJ, but Joya, I've had it!  But damn, how wonderful you taste.
