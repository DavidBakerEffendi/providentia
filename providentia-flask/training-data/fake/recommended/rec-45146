I recently visited this sushi bar and I have to say that the sushi was awesome. I am a very big sushi person, so I know what good sushi is lol and I can say this is definitely the best sushi in Little Falls. So if you're close, try it, you will not regret it! :-] Also, the service was great. He was such a sweet man and he was very attentive and service was quick. Let's help our local businesses do well! Especially ones that deserve it like U1 Sushi!!!
