This place just can't get it together.  I've been there a few times and it's a disappointment each time.  I've given it a few chances since it was fairly new the first few times I went but it's been about 2 years now and they still struggle. I went on a Wednesday night with about 10 friends and we had a reservation.  There weren't many people dining there but it still took over an hour after we ordered to get any of our food out.  And when the server did bring our food out, she only brought food for half our table.  She never offered an explanation as to what was taking so long.  I was so pissed, I cancelled my order (a salad).  What could possibly be going on in the kitchen to take so long for a salad? I went back during the summer for the outdoor patio.  It's nice to sit outside but there's not a good view of anything from either side.  The mixed drinks were impossible to ingest.  They were disghusting and my friend and I couldn't drink them.  This was the first time in my life that I sent a drink back. I went back in the fall and ordered a glass of Shiraz and an order of Truffle Fries.  I was given a glass of some white wine and an order of tater tots.  How can someone mess up an order of two items? Besides the terrible service, the people there are snooty.  The only reason I gave this rating 2 stars is because of the atmosphere and decor.  It's really a cool place inside.  It's so frustrating that they can't get their stuff together for service and food. Also, no reservations for outdoor dining.  Boo.
