Disappointing brunch. When we arrived the were out of Bloody Marys and Hashed browns. Not at promising start for a Sunday brunch... Waitress more grumpy than called for, did not listen, corrected the pronounciation of the names of the dishes. Ordered the fried chorizo: less than half of a sausage in homemade baked beans covered with a fried egg - not inspiring, cheeseburger: boring, no finesse or taste, and pancakes: at least that was big - but boring as well. Not a good place for brunch!
