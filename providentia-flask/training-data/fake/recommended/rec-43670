Lychees are an amazing fruit.  I don't believe I have ever seen them in a supermarket.  I never think to myself, "I need a potassium boost.  I know!!  A lychee!!"  But they are the damn finest drink fruit I believe in existence.  And Room Service does well by them. Lychee Sangria?  Don't mind if I do....  Lychee martini?  I do love those.... And everything lychee at Room Service is top notch.  Plus, their happy hour is almost unbelievable.  For New York- for Chelsea- these prices are more than a little surprising.  Almost to the point where I want to get my fill on as many drinks as possible before they realize they messed up on the price. The food is also quality.  I haven't really dome to Room Service for food.  But, I do seem to always eat when I end up there.  So, yes.  It is good.  And I am picky about Thai.  But, their drunken noodles (or noodles mao) are up there with the best of them. So, raise a glass to Room Service.  And hopefully there is a delightful lychee concoction in that glass...
