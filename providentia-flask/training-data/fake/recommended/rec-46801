I absolutely love this place! The people here are so friendly and welcoming and patient. About once every couple of months me and my friends go see a movie at Bow Tie right across the street, and Â this is our go-to place for food when we get hungry. The service is wonderful and they always remember us when we come. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. It being a family business makes it all the more better. I just love coming here to enjoy a nice meal or even taking it out. It never gets too loud, and they have a tv that becomes strangely appealing. I would recommend this place 'til the day I die, that's hoe good this place is.
