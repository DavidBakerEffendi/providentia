In search of a great ramen restaurant in philly so I was excited to try Hiro Ramen house. In my opinion the location is horrible.  It's situated behind a bus stop and the restaurant isn't brightly lit and the sign isn't that noticeable. Inside the restaurant: small and cozy, resembles a ramen house with a bar in front of the open kitchen and a few tables. Ordered : Apps: Seaweed salad and Wasabi Octopus I ordered the Veggie Ramen added the marinated egg and Cha Su First the seaweed salad didn't taste that good, it tasted like the ocean.  Not my cupt of tea.  the Octopus was different with a slimy and crunchy texture with a hint of wasabi which made it edible but would not order again. Now the ramen: the Broth was definitely light and not oily that's the plus with the whole bowl.  The Cha Su tasted gamy and the noodles were not ramen noodles it was more like chinese egg noodles. Overall: if you are expecting to have a good bowl of ramen than look elsewhere but if you are looking for a good bowl of noodles that is similar to one where you can find in chinatown than give this place a try since toppings are different than a regular chinese noodle house.
