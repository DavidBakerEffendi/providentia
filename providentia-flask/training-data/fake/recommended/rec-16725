A medium sized, low key, great food restaurant in the West Village -- sounds familiar and also exactly what you're looking for. The food reminded me of a better version of the Little Owl's, with flavors that are a bit more complex, ingredients a bit fresher, and creativity a bit higher.  The dishes were reasonably priced overall, ranging from 24-29 with the exception of the steak. The steak, of course, was by far the best dish.  It was enough steak for two, though.  Perfectly cooked and doused with a savor sauce.   The arctic char I thought was good, but tasted more like salmon than I normally like.  The gnocchi with lamb was my favorite appetizer.
