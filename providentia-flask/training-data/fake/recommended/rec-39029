During our recent visit to NYC, my boyfriend and I dined here on a Saturday night. He has been here in the past and had great memories. We checked in with the hostess for our reservation and she said she could seat us right away or we could have a drink at the bar and she'd have a better table for us in a few minutes. We happily waited. I ordered the ginger martini - delish! We were in the middle of our beverages when we were taken to our table, definitely worth the wait. We felt as though we were in our own world during the evening. Our server was great, although I don't remember her name. We started with the steak tartare. Loved it, although it might have had too much onion for me? Couldn't identify exactly what it was. For entrees, I had their pork chop special and my boyfriend had the steak frites. Impressive serving size for both and equally delicious. For dessert, we shared a dish of their homemade ice cream - 1 scoop of chocolate, coffee and butter pecan each. We had such a wonderful time - perfect for special occasions!
