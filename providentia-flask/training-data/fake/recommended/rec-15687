I've been here twice and it was definitely a treat both times.   I'll start off by saying this place is definitely towards the top/slightly out of my price range.  Each time I've been there, though,  money was no object.  We asked the waitress to order for us.  She asked us how picky we were and double checked to make sure we could handle what she was bringing.   We got a feast and it was excellent. I tasted: - Kibbe Naye Beirutieh - Moussaka - Kibbeh Bi Laban - Black Iron Shrimp - Mixed Grill Everything was unusual, unique, savory and amazing.   I will caution that if you're a picky eater, you will not appreciate the full potential of this place.  Having said that, there's something for almost everybody.
