If you're looking for a hole in the wall - this is the epitome of it. Grandma's attic in the Islands is the best way to describe this gem. Between 4 people, we ordered 5 plates (supposedly small plates) and we were barely able to finish everything!!! Oxtail, Jerk Chicken, Curry Goat, Fish and Shrimp. My personal favorite was the Curry Goat - least expected! The jerk chicken was honestly too spicy for me - even though we ordered mild! So if you're ready for some heat, come on over here!! The meal was affordable and super healthy portions! Plus for this little spot: BYOB :)
