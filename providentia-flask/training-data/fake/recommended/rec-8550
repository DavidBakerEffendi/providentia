The food is passable Mexican food. It's good, but not the best in the city. The only thing I actually crave from there or really ever rave about is guacamole (but I put guac on just about everything, so that might just be me). What's both a plus (as a 20 year old) and a minus for me is they don't card. Like obnoxiously don't card, so I feel like whenever I'm there I'm surrounded by teenagers sipping on margaritas, being loud and obnoxious. Overall? It's okay. Good if you happen to be in the Passyunk Square area, but not really worth going out of your way for.
