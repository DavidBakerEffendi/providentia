This place is pretty good, but not all the dishes are authentic peruvian. My parents lived in Peru for 20 years, and though they enjoyed the food, they were disappointed at how nontraditional some of the dishes were. That said, the food was still tasty. The Seco Norteno was quite good as was the Pollo a la Brasa. One negative comment about this place is they charge you for everything. We ordered the Chaufa De Mariscos which comes with an onion salsa on top. When we asked for a little bit more of the salsa, they charged as $2.00. And they charged us another $2.00 so we could take some cancha home. There were five of us dining and we each had an app and a main course. Our dinner came out to over $200, the least they could have done is given us these two little things for free. One final note, the wait staff is quite friendly. There was always someone around to serve us wine or refill our waters.
