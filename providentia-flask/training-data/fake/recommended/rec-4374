I walked in to Mood Cafe a few weeks ago completely skeptical about lassis in general. How many times had friends tried to force mango lassi on me with cries of, "try it, try it!" I pretty much hate mango/mango-flavors, so after my second mango lassi or so, I swore off the concept...associating mango + lassi forever in my mind, and resigned myself to never having one again. Turns out mango is just one of the many flavors (over 20) you can get at Mood Cafe-I've had the blueberry lassi twice and it has a fantastic flavor and texture. Kind of like a milkshake plus a slurpee that's blueberry flavored and basically super delicious. I also have to say I really appreciate the fact that you can make any lassi vegan without any big fuss! I'm definitely coming back and trying more flavors.
