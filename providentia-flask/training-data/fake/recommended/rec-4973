They always have a good variety of beers on tap that are always changing. The food is good and comes out of the kitchen fast even if it is busy. The waitstaff is always super nice. They only reason is wouldn't give this place 5 stars is that the parking situation is a mess. If you can't get a spot in the small lot behind the restaurant you'll have to park in the street. If you are parked in the street after 9pm you'll get a parking ticket. I understand that it isn't the fault of Cloverleaf, but it's just an unfortunate result of their location.
