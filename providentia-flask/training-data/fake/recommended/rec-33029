Stopped in here during a day trip to Princeton and was not disappointed. All three slices I ordered (Philly Cheesesteak, Spinach and Garlic, Pepperoni) were quite flavorful and tasted as if they were made with high quality ingredients. Unlike your typical pepperoni slice, the pieces of pepperoni were of slightly different sizes, giving me the sense that they weren't just mechanically separated slices of "meat" and the steak on the Philly Cheesesteak was fresh and tender. Only two negatives about this place come to mind. First, the seating area leaves a bit to be desired, consisting only of four stools and a small wrap-around countertop. Luckily, I was able to snag a seat, but it would have been unfortunate to have to eat standing up or outside in the cold if all the stools were occupied. Secondly, I feel they could have warmed up the slices a bit more (and I'm usually not too picky about this!). Sure, I could have asked to have it reheated, but the place was bustling and I didn't want to be a pain. That said, neither of these are serious problems. I understand that the place generates the majority of its revenue from take-out orders, but considering each slice was over $3.00, I feel the need to deduct a star for this. Great NY/NJ-style pizza though -- better than any slice I've had in NYC and I didn't have to deal with New Yorkers, so what's not to love?
