Great decor, great prices and just OK mac and cheese.   Went for dinner on a Wednesday night.  I ordered the mac and cheese, which came with a lovely little salad at $9.50.  As for the portion size, it would have been enough if i wasn't quite so hungry (so ended up adding a pumpkin cupcake that was yummy).  Truthfully, I did not love the mac and cheese.  The breadcrumbs were delicious, but any bite without the breadcrumbs tasted like soggy pasta in a watered down cheese sauce.   I'd certainly give other food items a try, but might just throw together 8 oz al dente pasta, block of cheddar cheese with 1.25 c of milk and 2 eggs next time I'm feeling for delicious mac and cheese.
