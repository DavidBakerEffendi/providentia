It is always a pleasure dining with my fellow friend from grad school days, whose like a brother from another. We pulled up to valet and received a hearty welcome and fast escort into restaurant where we were greeted by an onslaught of hostess. One of whom escorted us to a table paralleling the kitchen. The seating was half booth but quite comfy. The place was gorgeous, adorned by rich browns and accents mirroring the deep sea. We dined for restaurant week which gave us an opportunity to sample the menu in three courses. I feasted on: 1. Appetizer: Lobster Bisque with Corn Fritter 2. Entree: Crab Cake with corn and Succatash 3. Dessert: Ten- Layer Carrot Cake with pineapple anglaise To accompany our meal, we also had the white truffle deviled eggs with our cocktails (blueberries & bubbles and Tequila Cocktail) before our meal and added the black truffle Mac and Cheese Â as an accompanying side with our entree. Perusing the al la carte menu, there are so many mouth-watering options that I'll be sure to give a try in future visits. Our waiter Michael was prompt and attentive and certainly not over bearing. We provided compliments to the chef and were astounded by the ambiance, friendliness of fellow customers and well-portioned menu. Ocean Prime May be new to the scene but they are definitely off to a great start.
