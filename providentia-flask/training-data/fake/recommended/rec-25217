I have been here over half a dozen times at this point, and not once has Room Service disappointed. This isn't your standard, greasy, flavorless Thai food. These dishes are brimming with complex flavors and fresh ingredients - everything from their Room Service Pad Thai, to rice dishes, to noodle dishes. Everything is just delicious. I don't understand how places like Wondee Siam and Pure Thai Cookhouse can produce entirely substandard dishes yet receive better Yelp reviews...but I would come here a hundred times before ever going to WS or PTC ever again.
