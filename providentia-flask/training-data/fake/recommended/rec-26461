I came here yesterday for the first time. I have to admit, the decor is pretty damn luring. While Halloween is still a month and a half away, they already filled the ceilings with cotton webs, plastic spiders, extremely dimmed lights, some witches and demons displayed throughout the restaurant. I am very impressed with their decorations and services. However, with a party of two, the bill came out to $80. Their dishes are over priced and what my main concern is their soup base. My boyfriend ordered the pork soup base and I didn't even realize it's $20 for the base. Am I the only one who thinks this is absurd?! For a soup filled with ONE tiny piece of pork bone and probably over loaded with MSG cost twenty freaking bucks! Here's what we order, a plate of shredded seaweed, fish cake tofu, corn, sliced fish, sliced lamb, vermicelli noodles and frozen shrimp-each dish has about 5 or 6 pieces. Yeah, and the bill with tips comes out to $80. This is the most expensive hotpot placed I've been to. The food is mediocre. But I guess we were paying for the atmosphere. Lastly, I don't understand why they walk about with an iphone when it comes to paying the bill. I don't like the waiters up in my face when I'm paying the bill AND telling me to pay 18% tip. Get a damn credit card terminator, have the customers sign the bill on paper and they can calculate the tips on their own. Atleast if you check in on facebook, they give you a free popsicle-which they prefer to "ice cream". Btw, where are the sesame and peanut butter sauces?
