I didn't see any reviews  of Sushi at Fusion House to date.  That's what I came for today, and I was not disappointed.  With their $15.95 all you can eat special, I kept my expectations in check.  What I discovered was great atmosphere, fast courteous service, and the invitation to order as much sushi, maki rolls  as i wanted plus a soup or salad.  The quality and presentation were excellent - seems too good to be true.  Enjoy the offer while it lasts.  I will most definitely be back.
