Anytime I'm in NYC, whoever I'm with INSISTS that we go to the halal cart. Don't get me wrong, it's (chicken/lamb and rice platter - $6) good stuff. I know the red sauce is deadly and stay away from it - the white sauce suits me just fine. (Giggity?) It's just not something I want to eat every day. (My bf is fine with this and will usually order 4 platters, knowing full well I can only stand to eat one platter before getting sick of it.) The line late at night can be really long but the food is being prepared and sold so quickly that I've never stood there for more than, oh, 30 minutes. It tends to fly by when you're surrounded by drunks and tourists anyway. Halal carts abound in NYC but this the only one for me.
