The hubby and I stopped in for brunch last saturday and were blown away once again. They have brunch specials along with drink specials for the phillies games. I had Poached eggs over homemade biscuits with pork gravy and Gouda Grits...my mouth is watering just thinking about it again. It was so amazingly good, i save a little to eat later adn savor the flavor. The hubby ordered a spicy frittata with potatoes. And the special came with a draft beer for only $9. The place is really clean, and comfortable. The staff is always really friendly. Definitely give it a try!
