Solid solid burger, yes. Got here on a Saturday 11.30 because Im classy and dont wait in lines. Line started to form around noon. We got the Original and Truffle burger The Original - blah. Yes meat is cooked well but theres no taste that stands out particularly. The Truffle - yes its good. Good truffle flavor, not overpowering. Got both cooked medium rare and the burger is just good quality and JUICY. Fried pickles - not "amazeballs" as someone else put it, the ones at Bareburger are to DIE for though, so go there instead for them. I will say I do prefer Shake Shack. The burger quality from both is definitely comparable, but maybe I need more salt in my food.... I probably suffer from hypertension and my taste buds are a bit dead from eating too much spicy food, but thats just me. If I had to wait in line for this though, Id be rather upset. Again, Im classy.
