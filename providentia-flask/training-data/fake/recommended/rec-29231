I'm not too much into beer gardens, but I love Frankford Hall! Huge selection of beers (obviously) and a great place for large groups to gather over drinks and Jenga! Didn't order any food, but the gigantic soft pretzels I saw being served to various tables looked absolutely delicious. They had other standard bar kitchen foods, like burgers and fries. But the pretzel looked bomb. The big, long tables with the high seating are perfect for both small and large parties to share, and the shorter picnic tables were great for larger group seating. Didn't hear much of the music since it was so loud inside, but there were TVs with games on that also added to the noise, so a bit loud. I wish I checked out the outdoor area, but it was so cold that I didn't even bother. Though I did notice they have heaters all around outside.
