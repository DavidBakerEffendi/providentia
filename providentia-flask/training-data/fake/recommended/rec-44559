It's all about the corn-flour empanadas.  My brother told me that when he goes here he gets "one of each."  Now I understand why.  It is impossible to pick a favorite.  Beef.  Pork.  Chicken.  Shrimp.  Broccoli.  Codfish.  The outer shell is so perfect that you could probably stuff it with used tissues and it would still be delicious.  But the fact that the inside is just as good as the outside, makes this hands-down a must visit place.  Yummy.  Delicious.
