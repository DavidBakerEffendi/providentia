So after eating our steaks at Geno's, we had to compare it to Pat's. Walked across the street ordered 1 cheesesteak with provolone and onions. The menu selection here is better. My hubbie ate it while I watched cause I was full from Geno's. He said Geno's was better because the meat wasn't fatty, the cheese was already melted, and the service was a tad better. Oh they have more patio tables than Geno's though. I give them that!
