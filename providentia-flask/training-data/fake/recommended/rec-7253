Generous portions. Nice ambience. Clean bathroom. Service was fine though we had to ask the waitress several times to be seated. Once seated things moved great. I am not a fine taster of sushi, so all I can say was that the salmon, tuna, and spicy tuna all tasted different. And I was full on the Triple Roll option 3x8 pieces for $12).
