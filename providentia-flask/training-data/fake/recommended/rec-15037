A total disappointment and completely overpriced.   Beer selection: confusing.  It's nice to have a large selection, but it helps if the menu describes them. Mushroom Philly Cheese-steak (no meat): this had so much potential!  Seriously, I could have just made this at home.  It didn't have a lot of filling to it.  Towards the end of my sandwich, I was left with a lot of bread and no mushrooms.  The filling was good, but there needed to be more of it.  My BF had the fries with his, and he said they weren't good. Salad: the best part!  It was a spinach salad with goat cheese and a pomegranate vinaigrette (I think).  Very delicious.   Our bill was around $50 including tip.  That is way too much for food that I could have made in the kitchen at the hostel.  I'm going with three stars though because that salad was really tasty and the service was good.  (But I think 2.5 stars would be more accurate.)
