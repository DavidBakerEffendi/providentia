Came here for my sister's graduation party, and boy were we wowed by the food.  They brought out tray after tray of delicious Mediterranean fare.  Some of the dishes were a little more experimental than others (goat butter endives), but most everything was top notch.  Also, the waiter was extreamly attentive to our large party, which is always a pleasant surprise.  Plus, check out the in-house market, which features imported wine and cheeses that are hard to find elsewhere.
