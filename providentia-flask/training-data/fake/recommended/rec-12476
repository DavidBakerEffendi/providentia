Wow, wow, wow!!  By far the best breakfast restaurant I've been to in my life.  I bought the Clinton Street Baking Company cookbook a couple years ago and ever since have wanted to eat at the restaurant.  While on vacation with my wife and some friends this past weekend in NYC we decided to give it a try, and are so glad we did.  We arrived about 30 minutes before they opened on a Sunday morning and found there was already a long line stretching down the sidewalk.  Once they opened and let enough people in the fill the tables, they took everyone else's cell phone numbers and said they would text when a table was ready.  For us they said the wait would be about an hour, which it was.  Once inside the tiny (40 seats) restaurant we were warmly greeted and served coffee and juice while we decided what we wanted to eat.  I had blueberry pancakes, hash browns, and homemade sage and herb sausage, which was served with a side of maple/caramel butter which was totally incredible!  My wife had the brioche French toast which came with roasted pecans and the same maple/caramel butter.  Like the pancakes, her French toast was the best I've ever had.  The service was efficient and friendly and the food flawless and delicious.  The only disappointment was the cookies my wife and our friend bought to eat later.  The cookies were a bit stale, overly sweet, and lacked the wholesome taste we expected.  Oh well, they are totally forgiven given the great food we had for breakfast. Although the wait was well over an hour, it was well worth it.  Hands down this was the best tasting and best quality food I've had anywhere in the world.  No shortcuts here.  I'll certainly go back when in the area again, and highly recommend the Clinton Street Baking Company to anyone who is willing to wait for truly good food.  You'll not be disappointed.
