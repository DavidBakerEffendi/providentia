Visiting my friend who just moved to NYC, she thought it would be appropriate to take us to Bistro of Friends! Duh. We made a reservation ahead of time and quickly sat down. This has nothing to do with food but I appreciate the waiter letting us charge our cell phones. We handed him our cell phones and chargers to take in the back or bar side to charge for us. Hey, I was being a tourist and wasting my batteries all day. Onto the food: I got the Niçoise salad and it was très délicieux! What delicious portions and filled me up. I also ordered foie gras because it is illegal back home in California and it was the best damn fattened duck liver ever. I am sure someone in San Francisco is protesting me now for it. But ohhhhh it was fantastic. I really liked the ambiance as well, it felt like I was in France. Très bien, Bistro Les Amis! Je reviendrai!
