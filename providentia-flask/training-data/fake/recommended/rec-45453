I cannot say enough about this place!  It has become our special occasion restaurant.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.   The main attraction here is definitely the food!  It is always delicious.  They use the finest ingredients, and often source from local farms.  You can truly taste the freshness of each dish.   If you're going during the fall, do NOT miss the squash ravioli with a butter sage sauce.  It is truly a little slice of heaven!  Cannot complain about one thing at One53.  Enjoy!
