Fun, funky, great Italian food. Decent Italian wine list. Â Fun craft cocktails menu. Loved they played hip hop all night. We didn't feel rushed. Ordered 4 apps and 2 bottles of wine between the 4 of us before we ordered our meals. I had the rigatoni bolognese. It was beyond YUM. My husband couldn't stay out of it after he cleared his plate of delicious chicken parm. My sister didn't love her caprese pasta but I didn't try it. Next time we will get dessert. Def make reservations otherwise you'll be waiting in a cramped bar with limited seating. But you'll have tasty cocktails to help the time pass.
