Had a craving for a good hot chocolate in the middle of a snow day. Yelp said this restaurant was right around the corner, and it looked cute, so the wife and I went on over. I must say, the pictures don't do it justice. Home Sweet Harlem is trendy, upscale, and everyone that works there is quite friendly. Bonded with Pete, one of the managers, over our new puppy. He even offered to watch our dog when we go out of town. It just felt like we walked in out of the snow to a long-lost friend's apartment. Hot chocolates were delicious, made with proper bittersweet chocolate and almond milk option (YEAH!). Also ordered dinner (Salmon Burger, and Wings+Potatoes) which were both delicious. Looking forward to going back with friends for brunch. Delighted to have a restaurant of this quality so close to our apartment. Keep up the good work, Home Sweet Harlem!
