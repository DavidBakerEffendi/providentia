Walking home one night after a late dinner, we saw a line of people stretching an entire NYC block. What the heck??? They were lined up at a Halal food cart! And, there were two others within sight that had maybe two people in line...something was definitely up. Â  I knew Yelp would clue me in...5 stars...the number one rated Halal cart in the entire city! Rumors were that it was the mysterious white sauce. For $6.00 you get a plate piled high with either chicken or gyro meat, rice, and a salad. After they slop it onto your paper plate, they squirt the sauce of the Gods over everything. That's it! That's enough. Another consummate New York experience...
