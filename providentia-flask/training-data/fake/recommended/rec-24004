Went to Friday Saturday Sunday for my birthday dinner. The restaurant was very cute, with some interesting paintings on the walls. The waitstaff was excellent - all the waiters share all the tables. The menu has appetizers, small plates, and entrees - perfect for any size appetite. I ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls, the petite filet mignon with au poivre, and the chocolate mousse pie. I've had better spring rolls, but the filet mignon was divine, and the portion size was perfect. It came with sweet cooked carrots and delicious potatoes au gratiin. My boyfriend ordered the cheesecake which was light and fluffy and delicious served with a berry sauce. Mmmmm!
