I've been coming here for awhile.  Trying to get back into the review game.  But this is VASTLY improved ever since the new owner took over from the previous group that called the place Ramen Boy.  Prices are now reasonable and the quality compared to other ramen shops I've tried in the city are superb. Broth is decadantly rich and the noodles are almost always al dente just the way I like it.  I am typically a meat meat and more meat kinda guy, so I almost always spring for the charshu ramen and add an extra helping of noodles to my bowl for a cool +$1.50. (It's like getting a second bowl of ramen in terms of extra noodle portion size for 10% cost) Service is quite attentive and well staffed given the small size of the venue so they are always there to refill your water cup and bus plates etc. I highly recommend a visit when you're in the mood for a hot bowl of noodles in broth.
