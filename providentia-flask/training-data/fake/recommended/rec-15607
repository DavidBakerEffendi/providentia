Outstanding. 4 of us Came in for brunch today. Everything from ambiance &service to food was stellar. Really appreciated their soundtrack of soul & funk classics. We ordered some mezze &pita to start which was delicious. I then got egg"souvlaki" which was a play on a souvlaki sandwich but with egg & Greek sausage wrapped in a warm pita. My guests got lamb burger,octopus,&baked egg dish. All very good. The souvlaki &lamb burger came w smashed fries which I think are treated like tostones as they are fried once, smashed & crisped up in the fryer again. Again really good & unique. Other restaurants in the neighborhood pale in comparison to MP. They should come in & see what modern dining & service is truly about. Will def be back again. Also the bill was really affordable & fair for the quality of food & service we got. Opa!
