Honestly I don't know what all the hype is about this place.  I saw it on TV and they have signs all over the Reading Terminal saying how it was rated the best sandwich.   I ate here twice while in Philadelphia.  With all the hype, I was excited to eat this famous sandwich.  I sat down at the counter and ordered the Italian Style pulled pork sandwich (thinking that was the famous one).  I was wrong.  Every person who sat down (other than me) was met with a "would you like to try our famous roast pork sandwich".  I don't know why the waitress didn't mention the famous sandwich to me but it annoyed me.  The service didn't much imporve with her refilling other people's sodas and not mine and taking a long time to have my left over sandwich wrapped up. The sandwich itself was huge (over a foot).  I had it with provoline cheese.  I didn't think it was anything special.  Actually I thought the provolone really over powered the meat and I left disappointed. Few days later I was determined to get the "famous sandwich" so I went back and this time got the right one, roast pork with provolone and brocollirab.  I'd like to say it was better than the first, but it wasn't.  The meat tastes good on its own but I found the bread too hard, cheese overpowering and greens just unpleasant.  The brocollirab was salty and I thought over powered the meat like the cheese.
