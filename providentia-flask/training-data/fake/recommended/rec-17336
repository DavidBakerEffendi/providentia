Ended up here randomly on a drive around Princeton. Walked in and had to walk right back out because I hadn't noticed the cash or check only sign on the front door. Closest ATM is three long blocks away, so come with cash or get ready to find a new parking spot. I will say that the other reviews are spot on. They make a really good fresh salsa. Even ordered a second round of chips, although I didn't love that they charge you for a second basket. I get it though... What I didn't expect was that the salads would be the best thing I had all night. I ordered the chimichanga with chicken, and it was extremely bland. Chicken had not flavor, doubt it was even marinated. And the entire chimichanga has nothing but chicken in it! No beans, cheese, onions, peppers....nada! So disappointed after that that I didn't hang around for what seemed like a few decent dessert options. Oh well! Don't think I'd make a second visit...
