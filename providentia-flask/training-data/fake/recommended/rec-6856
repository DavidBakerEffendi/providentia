Absolutely love this place! I have been there for dinner twice and went for the Superbowl recently. Since it was superbowl, I wanted some beer (coming from a wine and vodka kind of a girl), and I literally tasted every beer on the menu before deciding - with nothing but graciousness from our server.  Also had the wagyu steak, which was as delicious and tender as it was beautiful.  Even the bread and butter is homemade and rave-worthy.   Favorite part is the non-pretentious vibe, which is hard to find.  People are just themselves, and the food speaks for itself. Will definitely be back. and back and back.
