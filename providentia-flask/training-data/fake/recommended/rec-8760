Nice little spot if you don't want to commit for a full dinner but rather munching at the aperitif hour on jamon, queso and small plates like gambas ajillo, duck breast and more Their wine selection is great and the best spot to be is at the bar like you would do in a tapas bar in Barcelona or Madrid... Mostly spanish speaking staff gives you a genuine feel of the place.
