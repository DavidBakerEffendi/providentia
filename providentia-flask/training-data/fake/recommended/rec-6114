YUMMY.  There burgers are juicy and fresh just the way you want them.  The meat is ground fresh in house everyday.  No preservatives added.  I had the Cali Burger and my friend got the Original with a side of sweet potato fries.  Both of us were in heaven as the juice drip down out hands.  Next time I will go for the truffle burger but I am all about trying the basic burgers first before I get all fancy.  If you can do a basic right the add on are just a plus.
