I had my first taste of an empanada here, and by golly - it was wonderful. Empanada Mama is fast becoming one of my favorite go-to restaurants in NYC: The food is excellent, the prices are decent and the service is great. Oh, and the empanadas cost $2.50. Cheap is how I like it. Try the dessert empanadas. It's like having a party in your mouth. A sexy delicious party.
