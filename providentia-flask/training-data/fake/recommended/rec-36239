I just have one wish. Can I live here? Please and thank you. The first time I've been to an Eataly was when my friend took me to the one in Tokyo. It was great too, but much more quaint. I was in New York with some girlfriends for almost a week and we came here a total of 3 times. We would have come everyday if we weren't so busy. But I think 3 times is not too shabby. First night we had reservations at La Birreria (which will have a review of its own) so we were only able to take a quick walk around and we knew at once that we would be back. The second time around, we came to purchase some cured meats and fruit. The rustic display of breads and meats made your mouth water just looking at everything. You must try the fig loaf, it goes very well with Rocamadour and Brie de Maux The adorable Marimekko fabric on the produce carts and the Kartell design items added a pop of colour everywhere. We passed by an area where people were eating pasta and we almost stayed for that if it weren't for our mission. Which leads us to our 3rd visit. It was near the end of our trip and we just wanted some comfort food. And for me, that's often a plate of steaming pasta. We were seated upstairs overlooking the market. Perfect to watch people. It's quite obscure from the ground looking up, actually. Our simple pasta of cheese was just right and the ravioli was filled generously. We went home perfectly content. I felt like a kid in the candy section when I came here. The staff was very friendly and the vibe was so energetic. Hoping I have a New York stay again soon. 30/30 of 30 Days of Yelp
