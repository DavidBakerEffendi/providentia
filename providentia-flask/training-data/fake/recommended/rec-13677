oh Ms. AMY RUTH HOW I LOVE YOUR WAFFLES! YUM.. I'm not a big waffle person but after all the hype I had to get my ass up to Harlem to check this place out. So we had the waffle and catfish and a waffle with strawberries. The berries were good but definitely not the way to go. The catfish was AMAZING. Perfectly seasoned crunchy fluffy, melted in my mouth. OUFF I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Really spectacular. Now the setting is very basic but clean. with a boom box jamming old school hits The cash only policy is always a pain but at least they let u know before you are seated. I will be back! and totally worth the train ride!
