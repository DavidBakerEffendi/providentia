Totally disappointed going here. The only cool thing was that we went to the "original" philly cheesesteak place. The meat in our sandwiches had that grizzle icky stuff that you spit out in your napkin. The fries were outrageously priced along with their sodas. It was movie theater pricing where it cost more than $6 for one drink and fries. Definitely not impressed and don't plan on going back...instead we mozied across tthe street to try out Geno's.
