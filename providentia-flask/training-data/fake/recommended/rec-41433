No reservations needed on a weeknight, especially because there's a huge downstairs portion to the restaurant. Decor is interesting, and the service was okay. There was a large group of women a few tables away, and our waiter spent five or six minutes taking group photos of them. It was nice of him to oblige their request, but not when my water glass is empty and I'm eating a dry, dry sandwich. Based off the other reviews, it seems like I ordered the wrong dish, but I was really in the mood for a pita wrap or sandwich of some sort. So I ordered the chicken souvlaki sandwich. It was really, really hard to eat (stuff was falling out of the sandwich left and right - do NOT order this if you're on a date), and it was also really dry. I don't know if it was the chicken specifically that was dry or if it was a lack of tzatziki sauce but something was off about the dish. That being said, I may need to return and check out some of the other dishes, given the number of amazing reviews.
