$15 a roll !? Maybe because I was spoiled in Maryland and Maine for their amazing lobsters and prices. But $15 for a roll !? let alone that it's on a hot dog bun ! The lobster itself is great. But the portions aren't. I know I can't compare this to another state. It is NY & it will be pricey. But, if im going to pay $15 for a roll. I expect a little bit more bang for your buck.
