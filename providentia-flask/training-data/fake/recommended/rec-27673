Alan's is awesome. It's everything you expect from a good neighborhood sandwich shop. The first time I went in, I got a bacon, egg, and cheese on my way to work. Ended up standing there and talking to Alan for 20 minutes, and was late to work. Been back a dozen times. Cool guy, good and inexpensive food. Definitely check it out.
