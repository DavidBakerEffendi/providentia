I would give this place 10 stars if I could. My partner and I came here last Friday night and we had a fantasitc time.  From the outset our waitress Jennifer was kind and accomodating.  There were not that many folks in on an early Friday evening, so we sat at the window. The food: We both had the philly brisket and everything about it was amazing.  The meat was juicy and tender.  The flavor was truely mouthwatering.  The portion was a generous size.  And the coleslaw was perfectly seasoned, not too much mayo not too much vinegar and a perfectly smooth bite at the end of the bite. Bevarage: They only serve their house made sodas and iced teas and they were both good.  Neither was too sweet or too bubbly. We were also given the apple pie on the house and this pie did not require ice cream to enhance the flavor.  The crust was tasty and filling was delicious. Also, the kind butcher Matt kindly came over to introduce himself as well as generously offered us beef pattys for home.  All in all our experience was fantastic.  They really didn't need to throw in the extras for us to rate it high.  The food honestly speaks for iteself.  If you are looking for a great place to chow down on some tasty meat, then this is the place.
