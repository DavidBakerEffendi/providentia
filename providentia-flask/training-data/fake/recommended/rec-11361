Frankford Hall embodies everything you used to love and embrace as a child: ping pong, jenga, s'mores, fire pits, the open air, and of course, beer by the liter. They also have German food, what with being a German-themed establishment and all. Hefty soft pretzels with nose-stingingly spicy mustard? Ausgezeichnet!!
