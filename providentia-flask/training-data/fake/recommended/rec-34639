Chengdu 1 is our go to place for authentic Sichuan food. We have eaten Sichuan food in Manhattan and Flushing and this restaurant would stack up against the best. We have been there more than a dozen times over the last two years with friends and families. While the decor is generic Chinese with red lanterns and red interiors, service if friendly and quick. Our favorite dishes are Double cooked pork with leeks, cumin lamb, yang Zhou fried rice, conch, Sizzling chicken, lotus roots. Prices are very reasonable. But watch out, the dishes are spicy.
