My friend and I went for dinner here on a Friday night. Pros: It was busy but didn't have a problem getting a reservation. The jalapeno margarita and mahi tacos were delicious and the staff is friendly! Cons: 3 Stars though because the service was very slow/unattentive--we ordered the fried brussel sprouts as an app and after a long time waiting for it to come out we asked about the status of it. They finally brought it out but with our mains. I also requested no cheese but there was cheese on my chicken tacos.
