Nice ambience but the food is just so-so. The Pho broth kind of tasted like dish-water. I am actually quite surprised by all of the positive reviews because I find the food quite underwhelming. The rice dishes are a bit better but it's not all that tasty - especially if you know really good Asian cuisine.
