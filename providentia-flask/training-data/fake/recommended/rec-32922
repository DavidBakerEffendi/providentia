A good friend of mine commented on how delicious the fried calamaris were at this place and I have to say he was spot on!  That reason alone is enough to get me back through the door but there's more that keeps me coming.  In fact there's a lot more--as in a lot more pages of food goodness to choose from.  I've tried several of their menu items and they never disappoint.  It's just not "diner" food but really "restaurant" food.  There's a difference between the two and Nevada pulls it off quite well.  Plus the fact that this place is open during those late night cravings is just awesome!  They also don't skimp out on the portions.  I once ordered a dinner combo for less than $20 and I got food that lasted me for breakfast and lunch the next day! Not too bad eh.  One more thing: the diner opens their patio during the warmer weathers and I tell you it's great to sit outside enjoying your food and just watch as the cars pass by Broad St.  Great job Nevada Diner!  It's not easy to succeed as a diner here in Jersey but you seem to be pulling it off quite well.
