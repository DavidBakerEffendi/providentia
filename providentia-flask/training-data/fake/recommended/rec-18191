Fogo makes for a great man-night, but it's pricey as hell, and I agree with other reiewers that a lot of the meats don't have a ton of unique. Â For this kind of cheddar, Philly has a lot of other restaurants that provide incredible food and service without having to resort to the gimmicky service-swarm/ meat-storm combo. That said, it's still a lot of fun.
