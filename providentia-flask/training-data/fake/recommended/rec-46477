COCKROACH! There was a baby cockroach crawling out of my friend's water glass, that just made this place go from a 4 star to a 1 star.  Made us all sick to our stomachs and doubt everything we ate...didn't help that one of our friends held up the glass to check it out and it crawled on her hand and she threw it on the ground...guess where the little critter went?  Right into the kitchen!  Ick!
