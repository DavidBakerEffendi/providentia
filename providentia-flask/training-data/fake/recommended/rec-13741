Almost didn't come here because my friend and I were both hungover from the day before. But we did, and let me tell ya, this is LIFE giving food (as my bf likes to call it). First we started off with OJ (yeah, orange juice is essential when you are hungover). Then we had the spicy tuna carpaccio, which made me feel like Mario just after having scored a +1up mushroom. Then we had the snow crab cream croquette, which neither of us could stomach, nor thought was very good. meh. They came as two big balls, no joke. And I didn't know how to eat it. Anyways, then came the Hakata Ton Ton hot pot which was when life was breathed back into me. Just when I thought it was over, the pot reappeared with holy soup broth and rice, making this truly life-giving food. Then I was stuffed and wanted to go to sleep. Otherwise I would have ordered the black sesame ice cream that everyone keeps mentioning. This place is a must-try!
