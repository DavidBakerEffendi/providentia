Just finished our anniversary dinner at the A&W Steakhouse - 456 Avenue C, between 19th & 20th. All I can say is "WOW"!. What a meal. The hangar steak was delicious followed by an exquisite chocolate souffle. They opened up in late May or Early June and business hasn't been great. They're closing for a few weeks of August since the doldrums of summer tend to be horrible for restaurants anyway. They plan to reopen right after Labor Day. I encourage everyone to give them a shot since Bayonne deserves a diversity of good eating choices. No standalone website but they do have a Facebook page: facebook.com/AWSteakhouse
