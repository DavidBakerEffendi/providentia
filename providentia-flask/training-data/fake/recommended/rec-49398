Food - one of the best ethiopian spots in NYC/NJ area. We had the vegetarian platter and for once there were no restrictions on which 6 items one could pick from the menu - absolutely loved that! Extensive menu and each dish had its own distinct flavor. Space - a little small. They don't take reservations for party of 2 so we had to wait a little for our table Service - could be better. one person serving 9 tables is a bit too much but then this was Sat night Once again, food - one of the best!!!
