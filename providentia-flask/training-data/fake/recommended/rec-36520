Essentially, Ippudo is what you get if you ask a trained chef to make ramen for a living. In Japan, the restaurant is a chain, sporting multiple locations, but in New York, there is only one location. Wait times can get quite long since Ippudo seems to have found a niche in the food world. The noodles are handmade and fresh, and the broth is too. I agree that Ippudo ramen has a distinctly different taste than cheap, packaged ramen, but I can't say that Ippudo is the transformative experience I was looking for. While flour noodles floating in broth would be a great pre-race carbo-loading meal, ramen is definitely not something you would want to eat on a daily basis. In summary, I would say, give Ippudo a try, but I would not visit Ippudo again since there are many more choices for great food in New York.
