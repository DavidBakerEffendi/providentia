I used to be a big fan of Ashiya when I was in high school. Maybe it's because I had not experienced what sushi should really taste like yet. Nonetheless, it was cheap and it satisfied my cravings. Ashiya offers 50% off their rolls if you dine in. If you're planning on taking out or having it delivered, do yourself a favor and make a trip to a good sushi establishment. (I would recommend Illuzions in Hoboken!) Â Paying full price for these rolls are not worth it. Let's face the facts; their fish isn't the freshest. But what can you expect for $3.50 a roll? It's good enough. I usually order the philadelphia roll (smoked salmon and cream cheese) where ever I go, and this place is no exception. Though I will say that one time I ordered it, and something was really off tasting. I ate about 3 pieces before I realized the weird taste was because the cream cheese was definitely expired. I didn't go back for more than a year after that. But I gave them a try again early this year, and so far no bad experiences. I also like their Hakozushi roll (spicy salmon, eel, and tuna) as well as the Lover roll. These are considered "special rolls" and are priced a little higher. Their crab meat rolls are decent, and are made with REAL crab meat. (Not the imitation one found in California rolls). I must say I like their shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer. Order 2 maki rolls, and you're good for dinner. It'll run you less than $15. Their all day bento boxes are a really good deal was well. They're $10 and you get plenty of food! My boyfriend and I usually order shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer, one bento box, and one maki roll. Super cheap dinner date. Costs less than $20 - which explains why we even come here. Quick tips! Dine in. 50% off rolls! Bento boxes are offered all day. There's no upcharge for ordering salmon either. Score! They have lunch specials until 3 Monday-Saturday. From what I remember, I think they are closed 3-5. BYOB and there is a liquor store next door!
