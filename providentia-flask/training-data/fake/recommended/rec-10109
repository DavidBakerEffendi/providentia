I have visited La Sirene before the renovation a few years ago and absolutely loved the place - the food, ambiance, and the service was great. I went recently a few days ago looking for the same experience and unfortunately I was disappointed. The food was still very good (white wine mussels, beet salad, and the warrior's meal - great stuff), but it was no longer as intimate and romantic. I will go back for the food, but I don't think it is as good of a date spot as it used to be.
