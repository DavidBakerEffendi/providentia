So we ventured in to the city for the day a week or so ago. The night before, we found this place on line with the great reviews. We were so excited to try some unique food combinations! At our table, we had the foie gras and marrow appetizers. The foie gras was just "ok" . Not a lot of personality. Â But the marrow was spectacular. Oysters were fantastic and fresh. Warm Goat Cheese Salads were next and they were wonderful. The toast points with herbed goat cheese spread were a perfect mix with the mesclun greens. The salad dressing was plentiful but not overpowering. Entrees were disappointing. I am not a seafood lover and ordered the strip steak. It was cooked to my medium rare order but lacked any seasoning during preparation. Green beans were nicely cooked but again had zero seasoning at all during prep. Adding salt and pepper at the table really detracted from both. For the first time in a long time, I used steak sauce to add some flavor to the steak. Other entrees were just ok. Sweet breads were cooked well but nothing spectacular. Fried chicken coating was delicious but the chicken meat itself was flavorless. Potatoes and collards were fantastic. Service was excellent...not overbearing yet available when we needed something. We really wanted to be wowed, but this was a surprising disappointment especially with all of the great reviews.
