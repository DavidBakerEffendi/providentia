For a dive bar, the food is not bad, but I think we went on a day when the manager or person in charge was on vacation. I went there with a couple friends for lunch in the middle of the week to grab a burger.  After my friends and I ordered our food, some guy comes out with, like, a three gallon jug of smelly pesticides (the kind that you can almost taste in your mouth at the slightest spray) and he just starts spraying all the corners of the room we are sitting in and all around us. Several of us had to scream "Excuse me! Can you not spray pesticides all over like that while we are eating?" more than once before the guy realized we were talking to him! Which means they aren't following safety protocol for pesticide application.  Every restaurant I've worked in, it had to be done after hours, overnight, after the staff had wrapped everything up (utensils, etc.) in plastic, so you weren't eating off plates with a slight coating of poison on them the next day. It's too bad, because the food wasn't all that bad, and the new paint job looked nice.  They need to reprimand the guy with the pesticides.  That's not safe. P.S. As for the "has TV" question below, the answer is yes, and all the channels are turned to sports...ANY sports, so if you don't want to watch deer hunters killing Bambi while you eat your lunch, make sure you aren't facing a TV set.
