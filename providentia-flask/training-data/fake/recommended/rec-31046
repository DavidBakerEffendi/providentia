It's been a good 6 years since I had visited Buddakhan and while the company this time around was considerably better, the food stayed pretty spot on. There were four of us total and we each ordered an entree, rice to share, and a couple of apps. It was just the right amount of food. Sea Bass was excellent as was the duck. Overall, Buddakhan is a sexy restaurant that makes you feel like your in a city. My only criticism was that we had a reservation for 9:45pm and we got seated closer to 10:15pm. Not a huge deal as we made our selves at home at the bar, but as you can imagine eating dinner that late we were starving.
