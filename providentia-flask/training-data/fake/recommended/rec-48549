Tried Pat's when I first moved to Philadelphia to experience the whole cheese steak craze. I will admit it was a tasty cheese steak, however I became extremely ill a few hours after eating the sandwich. So ill that I had a fever for a night and was sweating profusely in my sleep. I have a pretty strong iron stomach but this one really took it out of me :( I'm not sure if this was a bad day at Pat's or if this is the regular quality of the food. Either way, I won't be visiting this Philly landmark anytime soon. Stick to Jim's Steaks or John's Roast Pork.
