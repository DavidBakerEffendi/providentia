Penang is a restaurant located near Borders and CompUSA in the Nassau Park Boulevard Shopping Center in Princeton, NJ (off of Route 1). Penang offers authentic Malaysian and Thai cuisine.  The ingredients they use are extremely fresh and their soups and noodle dishes are delicious, large, and very reasonably priced. They do not serve alcohol, but their beverage offerings are interesting.  If you enjoy milk or cream in hot tea, then you might like their Malaysian Iced Tea which is tea with milk and sugar on ice.  This can be a little much after awhile, so when I order this, I often get a coke chaser.
