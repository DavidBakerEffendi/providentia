This place has some of the best tacos I've ever eaten. Period. Los Gallos is a small Mexican restaurant in South Philly. Usually you can find a place to park on the street, though sometimes it can be tricky. The place doubles as a grocery store, though lately they seem to be focusing more on the restaurant than the groceries. As long as I've gone, it's been cash only. I have never eaten anything but the tacos. They are cheap and delicious. You get 3 of them, and they come with Mexican cheese, mounds of cilantro and onions, radishes and a nice pepper. My favorite is al pastor, which is a marinated pork with a chunk of pineapple. Trust me, it is the best. The steak is awesome, but the chicken and chorizo options are not as good in my opinion. Wash it down with a nice lime Jarritos and you will leave happy. I like this place better than El Vez and The Cantina. An entire meal is less than 20 bucks for two people. Glad this place exists!
