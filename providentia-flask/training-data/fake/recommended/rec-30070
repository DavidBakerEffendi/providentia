I go here frequently mostly due to the half-priced sushi option, since I normally crave sushi about once a week. The sushi is good, especially for the price, but nothing overwhelming. It's normally pretty crowded, and they also have a Hibachi option which is really fun if you go with a big group. The service however is pretty spotty, and at times has been terrible. I normally have to beg them to give me the check at the end of the night and then take my money, which I find rather annoying. I'm trying to give you money, hello, get in the game here. But despite the sometimes slow service I keep coming back for the consistent sushi and decent pricing. My favorite rolls are the spicy dragon roll, new haven roll, and the incredi-roll.
