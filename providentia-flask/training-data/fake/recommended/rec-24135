Decent southern food in the north. I had the jumbalaya (THEY WERE OUT OF MUFFELETTAS, WTF), which was a huge portion and one I could barely finish. It was good, but living in the south for 3 months makes me a sob at this kind of stuff...so I can't consider it excellent. My friend had a shrimp po'boy, which looked okay. So the food was only 3 stars. But our server, Kimber, gets this place the 4th star. She was very helpful, and super cool. If I lived in Philly I'd be back for the food, and the conversation.
