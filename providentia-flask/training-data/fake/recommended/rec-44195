It was worth the 45+ min. wait for a table. Staff is very pleasant. Glasses of wine were passed out to those waiting a long time for a table. Everything was delicious. Spanekopita was crispy outside and fluffy inside with a nice hint of lemon. Calamari crunchy and fresh. Tzaziki fantastic with a whole small loaf of break drizzled with olive oil. Fried cheese was terrific. They were out of the snapper, so I got bronzini and it was moist and so fresh. The lemon potatoes are a must as a side. Complentary dessert was a thick plain yogurt (or ricotta, was hard to tell), drizzled with dried cherries that were soaked and partially rehydrated and their sauce. Very nice.
