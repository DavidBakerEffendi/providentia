Ah, the Ear (burned out lights on the 'B' in 'Bar' translate it to "Ear").  I heard it was once a speakeasy back in the day. I went with a large, loud group of friends for dinner and drinks. We managed to get a table in the back.   It was very cozy, the waitstaff was friendly and the atmosphere was fun.  It gets crowded at night so get there EARly if you can.  The food was pretty OK also.  I'll definitely go back again someday.
