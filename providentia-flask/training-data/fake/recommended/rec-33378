I've been eating here since I was in high School, I looovvve thier pizza I even got my best- friend hooked and i've tasted all three pizzas the margarita, artichoke, and crab alll delicious. Though I read a review I agreed with on the crust being kind of rough, that could be a little softer but besides that it's great, The people thier are nice now when I was going in 08' 09', they were pretty blah like not interactive. They probably just wanted to serve everyone I guess... But recently in 010' to now the guy is nice thier he makes like little jokes, here and there. So the customer service has improved.
