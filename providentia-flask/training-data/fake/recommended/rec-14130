The perfect brunch !! Great variety, excellent quality - we had the biscuit sandwich, huevo rancheros and pancakes. Their peppermint cocoa warmer was simply divine, and led us on an amusing drunken gallivant around SOHO for the rest of the day. No complaints ! Granted the place is tiny, and the service did make up for it, but have to knock off one star for the insane wait time and for not accepting credit cards.
