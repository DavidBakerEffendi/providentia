I've been here three times so far. The service is consistent and amazing. There is always someone nearby that can help you up whether you need a new plate or anything. The salad bar is good, that's all. its a salad bar that has tons of options. After you flip that card over the meats and the sides just keep coming. When I came with my parents they said that some of the meats weren't as well seasoned, but I still thought it was delicious and juicy! I have always left here satisfied! As far as attire goes...It is professional/ business casual/ dressy casual.
