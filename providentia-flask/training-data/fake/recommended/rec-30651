Fantastic!  Loved Ellie's Spinach Pie -- lots of cheeses backed in filo dough.  The Nutella Frensh toast was excellent.  Prices not bad at all considering the quality.  Visited on Saturday before the race -- glad we got there at around 9:30am because within 30 minutes there were almost 20 people waiting.
