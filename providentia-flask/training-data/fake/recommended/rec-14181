A bit of a wait to get into this tiny place with small ass tables but it was well worth it...I never knew corn could taste sooo good until I ate here. Almost everyone orders the corn along with their main dish. It comes with two and what makes it stand out is the chili powder and cheese that they put on it. Makes me crave one just writing about it....For my main entree I chose the Cuban Style Roast Pork, which comes with rice and beans. It was pretty dam good, but not amazing or anything. The pork tasted like a Filipino dish called lechon paksiw...which is basically the leftover meat from the whole (lechon) pig with some kind of sauce added to it. Although the one that I ate here had all the leaner meat in it which I preferred. The hubby had the Grilled Skirt Steak..again which comes with rice and beans. I'm guessing that it must have been really good cus he cleaned his plate mighty fast. I did get a quick taste of it and it was very flavorful. My only complaint really are the tiny tables. There were 3 of us eating and I felt that while we were all diggin into our corn that I had to time when to take a bit as to not bump into the other person's head. Also, the bathroom was very, very small......I'm not really claustrophobic but I thought I might be when I was in there. But I guess you can't really expect much as the place itself is small. Don't get me wrong though...I will come back here on my next visit tot he Big Apple.....mainly for the corn....
