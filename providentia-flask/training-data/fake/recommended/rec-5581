I don't know how to rate this experience as a whole. But I guess the food is most important. Our waiter was very accommodating being that one of our friends were vegan and had to ask him in detail what everything was on the menu. He says he'd ask the chef if they can alter with the recipe and of course, we were rejected. And it was her birthday =( But that's okay. There were still a few things she could eat. Well: the warm eggplant was a tad runny, brussel sprouts too dry, the duck shawarma tasted like it was left over from two days ago, the bone marrow was too salty, the beef and lamb meatballs tasted only of lamb, the steak tartare was bland (maybe it was supposed to be but I do see spices on there and I had to eat all the jalapenos for flavor), the hindbeh was okay, but I guess the fries weren't too bad. I'm sorry but not a single item we ordered were to my standards. We wanted to try the risotto but the chef was reluctant to take the cheese out. Oh well. The decor was nice but we were seated at a big round table when there were only three of us. It made chatting difficult but we managed.
