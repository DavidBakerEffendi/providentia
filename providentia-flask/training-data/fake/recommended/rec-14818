The vibe is a bit divy, but in a good way - it's a very unassuming atmosphere and anyone can walk in at any time of day and feel right at home. The food is top notch. I frequently go back to Mac's just to order the wings which have a unique sauce that kinda makes you want to lick the plate. The consistency of the wings varies a bit though - on one day, I'll get a plate full of plump, juicy wings, another day they are dry and puny. I'd like to give them 4 stars, but the bathroom situation is downright odd. The ladies room door leads to a narrow hallway with 2 teeny stalls and a sink all crammed together at the back. That's all character, right? No problem! However, I have on more than one occasion found myself in a stall with no toilet paper and cleanliness less than ideal.
