My absolute favorite slice pizza joint in NYC. I'm a vegan now and opt for the Broadway Breadcrumb (it's cheese-less), but I used to love love LOVE the Mercer Margherita. The mozzarella is fresh as can be and the basily marinara has me drooling just thinking about it. Also for you pepperoni fans, they definitely don't skimp here, unlike the other places on the block. Try the rice balls with vodka dipping sauce! Yum!
