L and B is famous for their square slices and spumoni so I went to try. I was never really a fan of square slices. It's too thick and reminds me of nyc public school school lunches. I gave the square slice a try and it was just okay for me. I love triangle slices more because it's thin, crunchy, and the cheese is stringy when I take a bite. I bought 2 slices and it got me really full. Eating the square slice was like eating bread. It was too doughy for me. On the positive side, I liked their sweet tomato sauce and the thick crust. The square slice didn't live up to the hype for me. I'll be better off grabbing a slice from my local joint.
