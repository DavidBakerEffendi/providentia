Piccolo Angolo will absolutely make your night! On a recommendation from my cuz who grew up in the big apple I made reservations for me and my girlfriends for a recent girls weekend to the big city. The food was great! The garlic bread had heat, the arugula salad with chunks of cheese was to die for and the red sause. *sigh* This is the red sauce of my dreams. Hands down a great experience. Make a reservation. Be prepared that it might get a little loud. But the food will not disappoint you.
