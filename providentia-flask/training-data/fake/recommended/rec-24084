After reading all the awesome reviews on this place, I finally stopped by for lunch! I made a first pass through the buffet and picked out about 1 of each item for half the buffet. I considered the stewed tofu and seafood or the kimbap but decided to stick to the buffet for the day. I was a little surprised that my order rang up to $5.30 since it's not a lot of food (photo!), but for NY, it's not too bad for lunch. The food was tasty enough - some oversalted - although some was a little bland so I did add sriracha. On my way out, I saw a special for $3.50 for maybe 8 pieces of tofu so I'll definitely look out for that next time. I'll probably be back to check out some other foods, although I'll likely skip the buffet.
