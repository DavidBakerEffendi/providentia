Dined at Extra Virgin recently with friends from out of town. 4 stars for the food, had the virgin salad and virgin chicken and both were excellent. 1 star for service. Waitress forgot our side for the table after a decent-sized discussion about it when we ordered and was absent throughout the meal, checking only near the end of the meal so no chance to ask about the missing dish. Docked part of the usual 20% tip for that and noted the omission, very straightforward. Waitress had the gall to come back and complain as if the mistake was on us. Ridiculous and embarrassing.
