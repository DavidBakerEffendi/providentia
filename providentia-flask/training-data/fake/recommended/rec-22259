Overrated!  I always walked by this place and always wanted to go.  After a few recommendations from friends that it was amazing my gf and I decided to go.  The restaurant itself is very nice but very dark. Saw a few other customers looking at the menu using cell phone lights.  Service is very slow.  Seems like we were waiting forever, finally a waiter came and we ordered wine and appetizer both taking a very long time.  Gf got steak.... The steaks itself was good but they put a beet steak sauce on it that was weird tasting.  Not good at all.  I ordered the trout, which was delicious but it was a very small filet and I was still hungry.  Carrot cake woopie pies for desert was good, expresso seemed watered down.  Overall restaurant is nice, service SLOW, food ok.  Definitely not worth the money.
