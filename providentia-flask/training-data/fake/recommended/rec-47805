I've gone to Mezcal many times and the service can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is. Its not that the service is bad, but they can be easily overwhelmed. That being said, I went last week and it was awesome! The juan gallo is the best and the fish burrito is fantastic! It took a little while for one of my drinks to come but they were setting up for a party, so it really wasn't a big deal. Also, the nachos are amazing, but be careful not to fill up on them before your meal!
