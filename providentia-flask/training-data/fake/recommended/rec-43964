I've tested 4 of the arepas, and they've all been great. The Reina Pepiada, the Pernil, and the Mulata stand out. If you like arepas, you won't find a better place in NY for them. A beautiful, delicious surprise, though, was the Tostones Mochimeros; they're mindblowingly good. The service was very good, although the tables were very cramped. Also, if you go past 7:30, expect to wait at least half an hour for a table, and probably more along the lines of one hour. The rum bar's a nice distraction while you wait, though. I've eaten at both the Williamsburg and the East Village locations, and I personally think the Williamsburg location's better. All in all, a fantastic meal at a very reasonable price.
