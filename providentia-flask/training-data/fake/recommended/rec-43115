I went there this evening with my hubs and daughter (two years old). The place wasn't busy at all. It was refreshing to find a place with space to eat AND for our daughter to play. The staff were friendly and engaged my daughter, she really enjoyed interacting with them. Finally, the food was really good. My two year old even inhaled hummus!
