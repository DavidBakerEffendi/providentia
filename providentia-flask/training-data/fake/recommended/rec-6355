I really enjoy Greek food a lot, and I eat it at least 3 to 4 times a month. Pylos, really takes Greek cuisine to a different level. I've never known Greek cuisine as fine dining, but this place definitely takes the cake. I immediately knew our food was going to be good from the delicious pita bread they served. It was probably the best pita bread I've ever eaten in my life. I was tempted to ask my server for more, but I knew I needed to save myself for the rest of the meal. I ordered the braised lamb shank and the meat simply fell off the bone. It was amazing! and I'm salivating just writing this review. I can't wait to go back to this restaurant again. The ambiance was cozy and romantic. I liked how the ceiling was decorated with various ceramic pots. I did feel the seating was too close to other parties, as I could hear other people's conversations. Other than that I think this restaurant is probably one of my all time favorites.
