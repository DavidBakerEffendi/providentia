Pretty authentic, they rep the Mexican flag hard and the pride in their ethnicity shows in their food. They've got an interesting setup- cooking out of a truck parked in front of their physical location. Legit Mexican tacos & burritos served quickly and full of hot fresh goodness. Be adventurous, get some beef tongue (lengua) tacos and be prepared to be pumped!
