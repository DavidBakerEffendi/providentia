We lucked out going on Easter Sunday and didn't have to make a reservation as many have suggested.  The service was great with only 5 tables to attend to, so can't comment on poor service folks have talked about. The salad of roasted beets and avocado with pea shoots was very tasty as was the pizza (we ordered the 2 specials). Nothing to complain about except the price was just too high for the offering to make it a regular haunt.  $75 for 2 pizza's and 2 salads (no alcohol) is a bit too steep. The bar looked fun, we'd come back but knowing we aren't really getting value for the buck.
