Went here twice in last 2 weeks, this place offers amazing brunch and a so so dinner. I dont think home fries can get any better, Mediterranean egg dish was different yet ok-ish, eggs were poached really well though. The Â brunch dish with pepper sauce and fry ups was really good, going to go back for this. Dinner wasnt great at all though, mushroom ravioli was kind of weird, it had LOTS of pesto( plus it wasnt mentioned anywhere in the menu either). Veggie burger was better than the veggie burgers I have had before but nothing I would crave. 3 starts for dinner and 5 stars for brunch and hence giving it 4 stars.
