My long standing opinion of the meager quality of Pat's has finally been echoed by the evil queen of homemaking, Martha Stewart. Upon a tasting during an interview for Philly.com, Martha did indeed make a face and say the damning statement "It's kind of bland. Pat's is bland. Maybe they forgot the salt and pepper". This was actually Martha's first cheesesteak EVAR and her opinion of our city's most notable food was quickly tarnished. Perhaps I shouldn't be leaking such vitally confidential information, however it must be said loud. I wish to shout to the hills: "YES! Pat's is bland! They leave their meat on the grill for an hour and don't know how to cook to order! Their bread is subpar for being in the bread capital of the east coast! You're paying a premium because it's open til all hours of the night and you only like it because you got drunk off of Coors light at a sporting event! You were tricked into thinking Cheese Whiz was good despite them using it because its cheap (and you don't eat it any other time ever)!" philly.com/philly/video/â€¦
