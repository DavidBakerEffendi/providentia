I had heard the hype and have been wanting to try this place forever.  Finally made it there last Friday for lunch and just wasn't impressed.  The burger was good - not great, and the fries were mediocre at best.  The upside is that beers were cheap and service was fast, though I'm not sure that would be enough to make me go back.
