My time here was rushed, but fun and delicious. We stopped by searching for guacamole before running a 5K a few hours later. We wanted something light, and this sounded good. Yup, it's pretty pricey. Definitely you pay for the colorful, fun atmosphere. We tried the blood orange margarita which wasn't anything overly special - small for the price (I mean, considering), and mostly just tasted like a slightly orange frozen margarita. I wouldn't run back for it. The guacamole though, we tried the de la hoya, was amazing and worth coming back for. Super fresh, perfectly tasty, and came with yummy tortilla chips they obviously made there. That made the trip completely worth it!
