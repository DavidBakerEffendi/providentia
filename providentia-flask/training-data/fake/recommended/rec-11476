I was here to meet a friend for coffee, I arrived early, he arrived late.  They let me linger, standing until I felt comfortable to sit.  Which is nice, it wasn't crowded on a weekday afternoon and they were very attentive.  My friend ended up showing up, we had coffee and I ate a grilled cheese, which was good but not great.  They accommodated my soy milk drinking and brought out a little pitcher for me.  The atmosphere is cute, bright, and Australian themed.  They also sell some Australian goods, like cherry ripes.  I would hang out here if I lived in the area.
