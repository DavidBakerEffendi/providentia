This review is for brunch...which was awesome. After a morning hiking in Fairmount Park, we were starving and migrated ourselves over to fairmount ave in search of brunch.  When we first walked in, I realized most of the brunch patrons were dressed fairly nicely, and cringed at my obvious workout gear.  We asked to sit at an outdoor table, which ended up being great. They have ample heatlamps and a covered area on the side, so despite the chilly day we were cozy (and not sticking out in our gym clothes amid a sea of skinny jeans and sweaters). I had the brioche French toast topped with caramel and bananas, and it was fabulous.  Service was good too.  I'm looking forward to trying this place for dinner or drinks next.
