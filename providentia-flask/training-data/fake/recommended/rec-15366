We got here just in time. We arrived at about 6pm. After we got seated the place quickly filled up. It's a small space so if you're looking to come here for dinner make sure to call before. The food is very special here. Not the typical menu. Everything is prepared fresh and you surely taste that in the food. The server was very friendly and helpful. He made our experience here worthwhile.
