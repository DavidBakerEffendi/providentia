Oodles and oodles of yummy for my tummy noodles!  My first visit to NYC and this was the first place I hit.  A very small quaint lil' old place that's also very small on and quaint on prices.  The Thai spin to some classic Chinese and Vietnamese noodles is a treat.  Very friendly service which is a welcome scene after being thrown to the hounds with New York hospitality.   I could doodle all day for a poodle while waiting for my noodle...at Noodies :)
