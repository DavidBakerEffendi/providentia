Well-prepared, if unimaginitive food, but the service is quite slow and inattentive. The good came out at the right time but water glasses and coffee mugs went un-refilled for most of the meal and only a verbal flare gun got their attention, including when it was time to pay. On a final note, what does this place have to do with New Zealand? Likely will not return.
