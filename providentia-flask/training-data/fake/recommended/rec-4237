To call this place a mexican restaurant is grossly inaccurate... From the lack of guacamole, cilantro or salsa verdad it's about as mexican as I am. With that being said, it's one of the few places in that area that serves real food, not that manufactured crap found in the fast food venues nearby. I've had the chicken taco bowl and it never disappoints... Be aware that it's not on the menu but it is the best as it has a little of everything. Full of flavor and a variety of ingredients, the shell itself is made on site. You get a lot of food (maybe even enough for two) for a very reasonable price and if all of that isn't enough to warrant an occasional visit the friendly demeanor of Dario himself is worth the trip. He's easy to talk to with that sexy accented Latin vibe and very easy in the eyes.  lol...  all in all its a very good place to grab some food.
