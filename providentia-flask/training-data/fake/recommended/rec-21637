Silk City: The diner is open late-night, busy as hell, and connected to a large club-type structure.  Live music and such.  One of the only spots that stays open in Philly-East, to my knowledge. Always liked the place... always will. Every Monday night, "Back To Basics!" they have amazing live music  and turntable action.  When I went, it was jazz and turntable fusion. The shit!  I highly recommend Monday night at the bar!  Highly!
