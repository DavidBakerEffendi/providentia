I visited this restaurant many times, most recently in August 2013 when my sister and my cousin. My cousin is vegetarian, my sister is a vegan. All 3 of us thought the menu was creative, and everything we ordered was so delicious! Our server was not especially funny our outgoing, but he was very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive to our table.
