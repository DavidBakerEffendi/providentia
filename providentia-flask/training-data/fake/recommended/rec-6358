Locanda Verde was the place we chose to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and our first night out in city. The restaurant itself is really adorable and romantic. We were seated right away because we had a reservation. I advise that you make one pretty far in advance, because I hear it can get difficult. Our server was sweet, but not overly friendly. She suggested a great bottle of wine at a pretty terrific price point. Unfortunately I don't remember the name, but it was really delicious. We started out with the blue crab crostini, which was AMAZING! The crab really sang...mmm. We shared the scallops and the pappadelle verde, and a side of brussel sprouts. It was all very tasty. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the pasta was fairly light. The brussel sprouts were my favorite though, which is surprising. All in all, a really nice place. Not sure I would go back though when there are so many other amazing restaurants to try in the city.
