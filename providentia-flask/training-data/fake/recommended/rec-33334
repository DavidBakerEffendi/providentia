finally decided to try brunch here this morning after passing by many times and were not disappointed! green eggs & lamb were absolutely delish {esp with requested harissa mayo for my potatoes} and my wife enjoyed her chorizo & manchego sandwich {though it was a bit light on the chorizo} mango & pomegranate mimosas were the perfect side. we are definitely excited to go back for tapas
