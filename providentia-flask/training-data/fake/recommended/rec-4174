I miss the Cyclops!! I was transferred about a year ago to the Boston area and I can't find a burger joint as good as Sketch. Nobody will put an over easy egg on a burger here. Damn Board of Health! Â I can't wait to come back to Philly and visit so I can get a Cyclops and the wife can get the decadent Truffle Butter Burger. Best burger anywhere.
