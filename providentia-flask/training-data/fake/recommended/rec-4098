We just moved to the area and I took my family here for breakfast. I was a little unsure at first based on the exterior but the inside was very nice. The eggs Benedict and pancakes were amazing. Our waitress and the rest of the staff were very friendly. I will definitely be making this a regular stop on the weekends with the family.
