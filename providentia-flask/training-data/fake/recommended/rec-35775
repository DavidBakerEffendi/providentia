That makes three times now I have eaten at Kanella: for dinner, for the special Valentine's Day menu, and for brunch. Not once have I left feeling anything other than completely satisfied with the both the food and the general dining experience. Kanella's menu is simple yet inventive; as it is Cypriot cuisine, do not expect your run of the mill spanikopita/ moussaka type Greek fare. Brunch was such a refreshing change from standard brunch food- the haloumi is not to be missed. I'd highly recommend both the meat and vegetable dishes I was served and I can't wait to get there for lunch!
