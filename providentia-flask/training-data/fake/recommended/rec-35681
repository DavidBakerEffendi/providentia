I love BBQ.  Smoke some meat and I'll eat it and probably like it a lot so my standards may be already low.  I did, however, just come back from a trip to Austin (where I did have the best BBQ of my life).  However, this place is very faithful (in my opinion) to real, Texas style BBQ (they even let you choose between lean and moist brisket!). The prices are a little steep, but then again BBQ is usually pretty steep.  The ambiance is a little cold but not unwelcoming, when we went it was pretty empty so that might've been the reason. Good beer and whiskey selection and the service was friendly.  Best BBQ I've had here as of yet, wish I could afford it more often.
