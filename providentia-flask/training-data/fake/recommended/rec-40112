Food was d√©licieux, ambiance was sacre-blah. Made an early (6:00) reservation for a romantic Christmas dinner with my girlfriend. When we arrived we were seated in a tight spot between the wall and the only other two person table with people. I'm not sure why they chose to smush us all together at one side of the restaurant, but it really set a bad tone for the date (we had a great date but were super annoyed at their obliviousness to the lousy seating). On top of that the only other table besides the one they wedged us next to was an obnoxiously loud, slovenly dressed (Dave Matthews Band 2005 Tour t-shirt to a French bistro, really?) party of 6. I guess I was expecting something a little more dimly lit, with well-dressed couples since it was described as "Romantic" on Yelp. That said, the food was really good. Though we both felt sick the next day, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and blame that on the two BYOB bottles of wine we polished off in an effort to drown out the other table and forget how cramped our table was. Could be a great little restaurant if they work on their decor, ambiance, and lousy seating logistics. Wouldn't recommend it for a date, but if you're looking for somewhere to go with a group, could be a fun spot.
