The entrance is exciting. Great sense of anticipation. Welcome is warm and the menu looks expansive particular the emphasis on Bangkok dishes. The chop sticks arrive and we wonder ....... we then have three dishes which we take a communal approach to. First the lemongrass chicken.....terrific and a wow taste, then the tamarind black perch which has it's subtle flavors and the shrimp pad thai which is great....feel like I am in Bangkok. Do try the basil eggplant....tops. The Chilean wine, the Savigon Blanc is complimentary to the dishes......just wish the bill had arrived after we had finished. Still great night and try this joint.....
