OMGoodnes!!! Such a euphoric experience. Went out to eat on a whim and just happen to randomly pick this quant restaurant. Truly a Gem in BK. The staff was amazing the food was delicious! We tried every cocktail and my Fav was the Winter Cabin...nice smooth drink. We tried as much as we could! Started off with the Salt Pepper shrimp then the scallops...OMG! Ofcourse the strawberry and cinnamon ribs, rigatoni, and the sliders! Too good. The flavors were on point with each dish. I will defiantly return! They ran out of Bacon doughnuts so I didn't get to try them for dessert. So I'll be back.
