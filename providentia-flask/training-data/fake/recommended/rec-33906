Everything about this place is down right great! From the customer service right down too the check.. I went here with my girlfriend and her best friend after church and I must say from the outside I was prejudice but as soon as you get to the backyard and sit to eat, it is an experience! Lucky for us it was a lovely day and the right temperature! I would imaging what the night ambiance is like! We started off with an appetizer (munch) which was a glorified powdered jelly donut but this wasn't any donut.. They added a special purée sauce which is referenced in the dish below and the donut is warm.. Once again it may not sound like much but trust me you will not be disappointed!! Now to the dishes: I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was amazing! There is this special purée sauce that they add to the dish that gives it an extra kick.. The waffles were the right size and the chicken is baked to perfection.. My girlfriend had the duck and this was my first time tasting it.. Can't really complain, enjoyed it for what it was but then again I'm not sure what duck is suppose to taste like! All I can say is that it was succulent and every bite was as good as the next one! Our mutual friend ordered the fish and chips, which may not sound like much but it blew me away! I was expecting fried fish battered and breaded but they actually bought a whole fish and baked it with French fries! (LIFE CHANGING) haha.. Overall I rate this place a 5 out of 5! Great for a social gathering or first date.. For all 3 of us the bill came up to $131.00.. Which I think is reasonable! And that is NOT including tip! Paying the bill too me is what set it over the top for me.. For my AMEX card holders, there is an app (if you are not already aware) called "cover". Basically you register with your name and your card and the waiter rings it up at the register by pulling up your check in name.. I thought that was pretty cool and quick!!
