horrible. I went there for a nice fresh lobster dinner, but instead went with the   soft shell crab done w garlic oil, the entire 3 crabs were  completely soaked in some ? sauce that was very watered down and old fishy tasting. then the  rice piao was  old  clumps of  rice with old fishy  seafood and very dry lobster then the  "fish soup"  5 dollars  was a horror, some thickened  corn starch with extremely  old fish taste no identifiable  fish in it. the  Spanish  antipasto was some sliced up  pieces  of goat cheese, salami and overly soaked asparagus and pepper. I will never go back there 90.00 for 2 and I am sick to my stomach
