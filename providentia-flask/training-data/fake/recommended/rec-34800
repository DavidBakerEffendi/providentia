This is one of my regular joints not just because it's a two minute walk from my house, but because the food actually is excellent. I go here for the nice homely feeling I get when I'm there. The owner (Silva) and the wait staff are wonderful, lively and keeps things moving. My favorite dishes are the Duck Pate and "everything else" Â ha ha. everything on that menu is so delicious. I've basically tried almost all of it. They do have a decent selection of wines and the deserts are hmmm hmmm good!
