This place came highly recommended by my Portuguese-speaking friend from Astoria, and it did not disappoint. I had the prosciutto chicken and also tried a bit of my friend's shrimp stew. Both delicious, but oh man, the chicken was yumacious- even the side of mashed potatoes had that homemade que ne sais quoi, second only to the way my grandma used to make it. Â The passion fruit caipirinha was a delight. For dessert, we shared the Brazilian tiramisu, small but tastily unique. Our waiter was attentive in the beginning but, as we were taking our sweet time browsing and requesting more time, eventually it seemed that he forgot about us for a good while. Still, once we ordered, the food arrived fairly quickly. On a Wednesday night, the place was nearly empty around 7pm, then peaked gradually to a few more parties, and tapered off again. We stayed a long while talking until close time, not feeling at all rushed. Plus, they played lots of Gal Costa, Caetano Veloso and Astrud Gilberto :))) It is pricey though--at around 17 dollars an entree. But worth it.
