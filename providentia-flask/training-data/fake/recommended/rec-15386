Food: excellent! Setting: nice, but loud as hell thanks to the posse of noisy broads from Staten Island behind us. Everything on the menu is good and the prices are decent. Their cheese plates absolutely crush. Avoid sitting near the huge table by the fire place as it attracts big groups as requires people to shout across the wide table at each other. I think this place is best suited for an weekday date night.
