It was like revenge-of-the-bitchy-nerd-on-a power-trip! I've gone a few times for brunch and the food is tasty but the service is consistently slow and the waitresses all have bad attitudes - which I was able to look past and continue to tip well and bring friends - until this last time. I went with two other ppl on Saturday and the host said it would be a 10 min. wait. We ordered cocktails at the bar only after 25 minutes did we notice that everyone walking in (from 2-tops to 4-tops) were getting seated right away. Still in good spirits, we asked the host about our wait time and instead of apologizing for forgetting about us, he had major attitude and said that we were a 3-top and he couldn't seat us until our 4th got there. We said there was no 4th person, it was just us, and we're all here and ready. He walked away without a word. We sat back down at the bar and then it became apparent that he had no intention of seating us at all. Another 10 minutes went by and now there were some empty tables, plus ppl walking in and getting seated, and still nothing. He wouldn't look at us and seemed on a power trip. I have NO CLUE why, we were nothing but polite. We finally left. There is no reason to ever treat good customers that way!
