What can you expect from airport fast food, at least better service or more value for your money right? NOT!!! I don't believe they deserve a star. I wasn't that hungry and craving for vegetables, and the only place I can order a quick bite with any sort of veges was at this place. I ordered 1 Â choice of entry but was charged for 2 since I asked for half rice and chow mien. I was told since I asked for the half and half it's considered as 2 entree, then I realized I'm dealing with people from Jersey, so I didn't bother to rebuttal back; I was too jet lag and since I had no choice but to throw away food after I finished instead of giving it to homeless - I just ordered small portion hut paid for it as 2 entree. Shame on the people that work there. I know I'm only discussing about a few dollars here but it adds up if you screw that many customers that has very few choices to begin with, you should be ashamed ripping people off. Your company need to stop. I don't know if your a chain but - your corporate should fix this problem. You make Panda Express a 5 STARS!!!
