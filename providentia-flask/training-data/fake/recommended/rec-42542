Both the food and service here are awesome. Food is creative, yummy, and vegetarian-friendly, but the service is really what made me happy with the place. My friends and I came in on a crowded Saturday night and asked if we could add one person to the reservation- the hostess looked totally stressed but managed to squeeze us in one more person, even with the place being totally packed. I'm gluten-free and couldn't eat the eggplant meatballs that came on the butternut squash dish. The kitchen easily swapped them out for extra veggies, but charged me an extra $5 for it (definitely not worth it). Our waitress was totally understanding about it (she hadn't told me there would be an extra charge) and compted it immediately. Would have given it five stars except for the bill mishap!
