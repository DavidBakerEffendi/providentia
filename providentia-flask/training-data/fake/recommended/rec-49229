Please don't believe any of the reviewers who claim the portions here are small. Unless you have an enormous appetite, you really need to come here with a minimum of four people and preferably more, because the platters are HUGE and designed to share. We always come here when we're in town and we have never been disappointed. Everything, from the antipasti (the hot is our favorite) to the pasta options (try the Rigatoni Country Style with sausage, prosciutto, broccoli, onions, and cannellini beans in a sauce of olive oil and chicken stock loaded with garlic)  to the meat and seafood selections, is outstanding. You probably won't have room for dessert but if you do try the tiramisu. Tables are close to each other to accommodate the mobs so you'll probably start up a conversation with the people next to you. We've actually shared with total strangers a couple of times!  A few of the old-time waiters can be gruff but most of them will let you know when they think you're ordering too much food. They accept reservations only for parties of 6 and more, so to avoid a long wait smaller groups should try to get here late afternoon or right after 8:00pm when the theater crowd has left.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
