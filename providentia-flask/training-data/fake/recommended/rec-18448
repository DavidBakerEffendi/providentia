I went here for my birthday and had a wonderful dinner. The duck appetizer does stand up to the hype, particularly the broth. I had a fish entree and the fish was cooked BEAUTIFULLY! Dessert was quite unique too; corn ice cream with jalapeno. The service also deserves mention - attentive but not intrusive. They made sure our glasses of water were always full. I will definitely be coming back!
