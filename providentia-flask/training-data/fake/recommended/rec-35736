I love this place. Its great both for food and for seeing bands or other events (i.e. Ignite Philly). The food is really tasty, for both dinner and dessert. We got a free dessert once because they had taken longer than usual for our order (which actually hadn't seemed that long to us). The atmosphere downstairs is great with big windows that can be opened in the summertime and big tables with slow flickering lights built into the table tops. Upstairs is very intimate with great visibility of the stage from either the floor or in the balcony. Altogether its also a really cool looking building. We can always manage to find parking, but its also not too far from the subway.
