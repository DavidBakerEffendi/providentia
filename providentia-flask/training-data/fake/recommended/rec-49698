All in all a truly awful experience. Service was slow and inattentive. Food was DRENCHED in salt. There is a difference between salted and too salty but they apparently don't know what that is. Coconut juice had little real coconut and tasted watered down and over sweetened. Papaya salad was swimming in dressing. Normally I would take out my displeasure in a tip rather than a review, but they had the gall to charge us an 18% gratuity for a party of six. Avoid like the plague.
