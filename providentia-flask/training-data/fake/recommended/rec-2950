Every time I end up at JBs I wonder why I don't go there more often, and then quickly remember why I don't. The location is the best part about the place. It's a great spot to meet friends who may be coming from all over the city, there's ample bike parking, outdoor seating (with heat lamps now, apparently!), parking on nearby streets, and a pretty cool ambiance inside. But the beer list is pretty terrible (especially because it's surrounded by amazing beer places), the food is just decent, and there's nothing that makes it really stand out. Its main purpose seems to be as a venue or a plan B destination for when all of the great food/drink places are crowded/closed/the apocalypse happened.
