i had no idea that this is the famous cart even though i work on the same block the cart is on . . . .but compared to all of the street meats near by... it definitely wins hands down.... for $5 freaking dollars you get a plate full of chicken & gyro meat on a bed of rice and some salad . . . then halal nazi's ask you if you want any white and hot sauce and they plop it ... bam, in and out..... for you picture snapping tourist, there's one street meat cart that is actually better than this place, its called Kwik Cart on 45th and 6th... they use REAL lamb meat...not a rotating hot dog. the price kinda shifts though.. one day is $5 and one day i was in my suit and they charged me $6 ...wth?
