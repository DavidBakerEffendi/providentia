I think this is a late night, drunk delivery place. They deliver until 3am on weekdays and 4am on weekends, which serves a noble purpose. The pizza is a cross between greek-style, domino's, and deep dish. I would never eat this kind of pizza normally, especially in New Haven, but at 3am it does the trick. I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I think its probably a good place for what it is.
