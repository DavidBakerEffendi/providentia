Bring an appetite, Cash and a bag to carry your leftovers back to the hotel! and you will still go home with money in your pocket!   After seeing the Bobby Flay throw down on TV - I knew I had to visit the diner the next time I visited our office in Essex Junction.    The restaurantt was like visiting a restaurant from the 50's from back to the future. The service was quick and friendly.  The sauce was the best part of the lasagna.  For me - i would have preferred smaller size portions so I could have tried more items.  You can get the sause at Bloom's in Northern Virginia.  My kid's tried the sauce and liked it! Worth the visit if you are visiting Burlington!  Additional parking down the street at the mall - if the back lot is full. PS - they have a ATM machine in the building!
