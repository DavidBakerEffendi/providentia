This is the MOST AUTHENTIC japanese ramen i've had. HANDS DOWN. THE BEST. If I was only rating the food it would be 6 out of 5 stars. It is truly worth the long wait. I was lucky because my friends and I went on a weekday around 3.30pm - there was still 20-30min wait. Last time I tried to go in the winter, in the pouring rain/snow, there was a 3 hour wait. This ramen is serious business. There is no ambience. No room. Tiny. Small. Hot. Cold. But the broth... the ramen... will change your life. If you are looking for a crappy looking place that has the best food, also reasonable price ($10-13 a bowl, depending on your add-ons. fyi - cash only) - THIS IS IT. A MUST GO. A MUST EAT.
