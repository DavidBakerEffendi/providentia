I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! I love dos segundos. Let me tell you why. * The service is never less than amazing * The margaritas are amazing... and potent! * Amazing late night happy hour that includes half price pitchers of margaritas * A delicious and cheap brunch menu My #1 recommendation is surely the eggs benedict... chipotle holandaise sauce? don't mind if i do.
