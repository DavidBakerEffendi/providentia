My experience at this site last weekend was VERY POOR due to the service provided. Started ok, but our servers were switched. I ordered my meal and realized I didn't want it. I wanted to order something else. In any other restaurant, you get the courtesy to do that if you inform the waiter/waitress in a timely fashion (which I did). Instead, two things occurred: (1) I was told the kitchen was closed by that point. This was not true. I watched a couple of people order meals/beverages even after I asked. The waiter simply and clearly didn't want to bother satisfying the customer; (2) I was met with a non-negotiable manager who pointlessly reiterated that I could not order something else and that I was stuck with the meal. She didn't resolve the situation. She actually confirmed the overall poor service. I frequent Philly often enough, but I don't plan for this to be a stop I make in the future.
