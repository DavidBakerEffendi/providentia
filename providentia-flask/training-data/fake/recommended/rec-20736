My selfish side has put off writing this review for a long time. The restaurant is getting packed and I can no longer just waltz in and satisfy my cravings immediately. My mouth waters even as I write this. The first time I went here when it'd just opened, I had the Sensai warm soba noodles with Hijiki seaweed salad, the miso coleslaw and a beer. Oh wow - the broth, the flavors, the miso dressing! It was unbelievable and I ended up thinking about that meal for a week before I ventured back there and ordered exactly the same thing. You'd think I would've built it up in my head but the second and third times were just as good as the first. Then all the subsequent times have never disappointed me. I bring friends here, but only good friends. It's like a dirty secret. It's my trusted friend. I know I could be having a bad day but one taste of that broth makes everything better and I'm in a great mood by the end of the meal. Food this good needs to be shared. My selfish side will just have to step aside and wait for a table so other people can get as much kick out of this place as I do.
