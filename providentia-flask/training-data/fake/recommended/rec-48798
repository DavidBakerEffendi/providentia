Pretty good Thai food. I recommend the fried spring rolls and the tamarind duck. The dumplings were fair (fatty) and the rice pot was lacking in seafood (only 2 shrimp, 1 scallop in entire dish). Service was very attentive and environment attractive. Constant flow of delivery men through dining area was a bit odd though and made it feel much more casual.
