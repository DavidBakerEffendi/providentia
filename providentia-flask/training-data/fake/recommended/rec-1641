Pat's is well worth the hype. So much that in fact we went twice in one week, driving completly out of the way back from NY to Ohio adding an hour of driving time just to eat another cheesesteak. Ok 5, since we were pissed that we just got one to share the first time. We wern't hungry and got one at Genos and one at Pats just to compare, but as soon as we bit into a bite of Pats we were all over it, talking about it the whole week and finally gave in, drove back and got 5 more with wiz, peppers, mushrooms and onions and some of the awesome green and red peppers they have at the cart out front which rounded it off perfectly. Lines are a mine long but the guys are quick, yes $9 per sandwich is steep but it will stay on your mind forever. About once a year I get a craving for meat but if I lived closer to pat's I'd eat it daily. Usually there is no way I touch beef or god forbid cheese wiz, but this is so f*cking good there is just no way around it. No words can discribe just how good this is, just thinking about it makes me want some again right now. Nothing can compare, if you are anywhere in a 1000 mile radius, do yourself the favor and go to Pats!
