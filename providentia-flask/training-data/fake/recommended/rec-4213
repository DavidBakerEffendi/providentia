I just don't understand why anyone goes here.  Last night I stopped by for a cheesesteak on my way home.  What my friends and i received were ice cold pieces of meet on a roll with cold provolone.  I guess no one told me I had to specify that it be cooked.  Give me Little Pete's anyday. (The french fries though were good).
