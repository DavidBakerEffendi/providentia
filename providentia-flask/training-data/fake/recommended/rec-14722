It's the samosas stupid! I'm addicted. The second or third time I was chomping away I happened to look down and I saw peas! For a half a second I was infuriated, how I could be so decieved... the other half second I realized it blends in well - and I'm still alive. I don't understand the Pondicherry craze. I've had it a couple of times. I just don't understand. Never had any luck with fake meat, but I keep trying. That said, the veggie drumstick did not go over well with me. The trooper that I am, I'll keep trying... although not for much longer. For the samosas alone it's worth stopping by.
