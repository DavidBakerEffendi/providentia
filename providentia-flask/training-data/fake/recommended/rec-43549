The Skinny Pancake is such a cute and hip restaurant.  The menu is pretty extensive with crepes that cater to the food-mood you are in-- savory, sweet, dinner, breakfast.  It was packed on the Saturday morning we came here, and we had to wait a bit to snag a table.  We ordered and prepaid our crepes, and they were delivered to us once we had our table.  Our orders included the Déjà Vu Crêpe ("Winding Brook Farm sweet Italian sausage, Champlain Orchard apples,and Cabot cheddar cheese. Served with a side of VT maple syrup," $8.95 ); the Breakfast Monster ("a Shadow Cross egg, shredded Cabot cheddar, baby spinach, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and our house-made basil- sunflower seed pesto," $8.50), and two Atlantic Monsters (Shadow Cross Farm egg, smoked salmon, scallions, baby spinach, and spinach artichoke cream cheese spread," $9.00).  All of our crepes were DELICIOUS...and they came with side salads that were yummy and refreshing.  The combinations and flavors put together in these skinny pancakes are so creative and comforting; I wish I lived closer so that I could try each of them!  I also had their Dark Roasted Coffee, and it was amazing (as coffee goes).  I highly recommend this place for a nice twist on breakfast.
