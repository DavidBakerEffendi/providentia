A friend of mine from down south was in town and needed a cannoli fix.  I had heard really awesome things about this place and took him there.  We started off with a peice of pizza.  While waiting for the pizza to be heated back up via microwave by the taste of it, we explored the pathetic excuss for the pastry counter.  There were only two cannoli and they looked runny and sickly.  After the unimpressive pizza we took off over to Modern and had a few really amazing desserts and cappuccinos that made up for the disaster that was Mozzicatos.
