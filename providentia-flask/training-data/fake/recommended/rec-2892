I've never had anything other than a great time here. The food is great, but this place is all about the atmosphere and whom you're with.  Roast some mallows on the fire, play some jenga, get an ice cream cone. (Why don't other bars serve ice cream cones? Jackpot). Food comes out quickly and is delicious.  Depending on the day and weather, you can wait in line for quite some time. Just a heads up. Worth it, though.
