Went here with the hubby for some rotisserie chicken, fries, salad and Maduras. Delicious green sauce on the side but only 3 spoonfuls are given. This place is cash only and run by Asian/Mexicans. Tables are not clean so bring your own baby wipes to wipe tables down. This place is so busy and no table service- get your order and stay to eat or to go.
