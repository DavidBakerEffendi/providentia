After Mad46 we took a taxi to Little Italy! My kinda town (area)! Sidewalk cafe party of 4 to celebrate my birthday! This is the way to do NY City! Ravioli, Artichokes, Antipasto appetizers all great! Linguine Frutti de Mare, fantastic! The bottle of wine was bad,but the wine steward removed it from our bill! I think I Â could spend all night in Little Italy, totally reminds me on Rome!
