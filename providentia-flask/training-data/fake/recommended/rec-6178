I went there Thursday Â night for my first time. I sat in the front with my friends. We ordered the Greek salad and the octopus for appetizers and I had the lamp shank for main course. Everything was amazing. The staff(was a guy server) is top notch and very informative. I def gunna go back again very soon,there r many things that I have to try!
