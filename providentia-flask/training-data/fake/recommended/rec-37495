The food was good but the service is RIDICULOUS! I believe it is the owner's son that answers the phone but he is a complete jerk. Customer service is obviously not his expertise. First I was told to call back in 10 minutes to place an order for delivery, when I called back he had the only attitude and told me my order was too small for delivery when I asked how much it was his response was "I don't know not $15 though" so after I added random items just to meet minimum he allowed me to place my order. I hung up and decided that my measly 15 bucks was worth better service than I received and I called right back to cancel the order. He told me well it's already been started and I said that's fine but your service sucks so I don't want it. I was then instructed to never call back again. No worries BUDDY...wouldn't eat from there if the food was free and I was being paid to do so! ***Thank you Michael Â for your response it speaks volumes to the type of owner you are and I do appreciate it. Unfortunately it is overshadowed by the fact that not long after I cancelled my order the same exact order was delivered to my job by another deli. However I did not place that order, it was done using a blocked number, with a mans voice and giving my extension. At first we believed it was a coincidence until later on in the afternoon there was yet again another bogus delivery ordered the same way. I would bet money that if you checked your company phone bill you would find the numbers to 2 local restaurants today. I am in complete shock that any adult would have the time in their day to do such childish pranks. We however did call back this afternoon and spoke with a woman and told her that these childish antics need to end. And to clarify I am speaking of your establishment, I have your menu which has your phone number on it.
