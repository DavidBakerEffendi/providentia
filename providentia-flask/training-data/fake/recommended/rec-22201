I was so excited when I passed by this place when I was living in New Haven. Falafel, right down the street from me?? I couldn't wait to try it! I've had their falafel a few times now, it's so good and they do it all from scratch. The ingredients are all very fresh. **A quick tip is to order beforehand and pick it up. I've gone in to the mart and ordered a falafel and have waited about 20 minutes or so for it. So, if you have time to kill, then you have nothing to worry about. But if you are not the patient type, definitely call in ahead with your order. I've also eaten inside with a friend on our lunch break. When we were there, almost a year ago, it wasn't well suited for dining in. Given this is a deli, I recommend just picking up the food and eating at home or taking it back to work with you.
