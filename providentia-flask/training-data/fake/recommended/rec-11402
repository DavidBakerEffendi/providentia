I find this to be a tough place to review because I feel these are two sides to it.  If I find myself sitting at the bar I have found the staff to be friendly and knowledgeable about the beer and food and always willing to offer a sample.  The tap list can get a bit repetitive if you frequent the bar which could be partly because they only serve local beer.  the food has been very inconsistent, I have gotten excellent burgers and desserts as well as grossly undercooked ones and torched friends.  The entres seem to be more consistent. I would only give the restaurant side 3 stars, both for the aforementioned inconsistency in the food as well as the attitude some of the waitstaff can have, especially on weekends.  It is very different than the bar side and why I usually have a better time when I go in with one or two friends and sit at the bar as opposed to bringing a group in and sitting at a table. Johnny Brenda's is an excellent venue for shows and I like it better than other venues of it's size (North Star, M Room, TLA....)
