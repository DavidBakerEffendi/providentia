I have been here several times before and the food is always very good. It's a BYOB so that is a plus. I recommend the KARPATHIAN MAKAROUNES (Homemade Old-Fashioned Whole Wheat Greek Pasta topped with Sautéed Onions & Traditional Cheese). It's very different and yummy.  Reminds me of something my grandma would make. The Cypriot Salad (Lettuce, Onion, Tomato & Cilantro mixed with Feta Cheese, Greek Olive Oil & Vinegar topped with Grilled Halloumi Cheese).  I think the grilled cheese really makes this salad and  I really enjoyed the light cilantro flavor. For dinner we had the seafood skewer and lamb skewer. Always very good. Def try the lemon potatoes for a side dish.  Wait to put in your dinner until after your appetizers because the meals come out quick. Service is always very attentive. Love this place!!!
