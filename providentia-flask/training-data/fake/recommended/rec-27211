Really great Thai restaurant near a neighborhood that's less well known for great restaurants and more for tourist traps. The thai iced tea is excellent. For appetizers, you can't go wrong with the avocado summer roll and the sesame tofu. The chicken pad thai is one of the betters ones I've had, and their curries are great. Really a great place for thai food, and reasonably priced, particularly for the area.
