Very good food. Very creative and fresh. I had the veggie burger with lamb (definitely get it with the lamb if you are not vegetarian), and the Fianc√© had the gnocchi. Gnocchi is definitely hand made and very rustic in taste. Sadly had to knock off 2 stars because of service. Don't get me wrong, everyone is VERY nice, but they all appear to be novices in the service industry. Waitress actually took my order and then ran off, forgetting to take my date's order along with mine. They just need to tone up their service skills a little and run a tighter ship. They should start with the pacing of food. Our food came out in 5 minutes. We barely had time to sip our first drinks, and as a result, did not feel the need to order a 2nd round. Generally a very nervous and confused energy coming from the wait staff. My wish for this place is that they become cool and suave with their service, making me feel like I want to spend $20 on an entree and sit and drink for awhile. It seems they are trying to be a fine dining experience in Bedtsuy, and they have the food and decor to back it up, but not the service skills.
