I've tried the likes of buddakan and I've been to all the Thai places close by, but by far they have the most authentic Penang curry and most other dishes . Their calamari with the hot sauce (hot sauce from the 4 pots) is by far the most amazing I've ever eaten . They have a very good lunch deal fr 9 bucks.. Their staff is very cordial and get your order the way you want it, no questions asked. And believe me, they deliver. I'm a regular at this place now, and I think it's a must try. It's always a good experience to try the odd things on their menu and not just the usuals.
