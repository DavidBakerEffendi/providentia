This is my first Yelp review but not my first time to Piccolo.  This is a neighborhood staple in the West Village.  I really can't say enough good things about it.  The food is fantastic and the family that owns it and runs it is so warm and welcoming.  I love that I can get a main course and pick a pizza to go along with it.  The pasta's are home made and I just can't resist. If I had to pick something to complain about it would be that its always busy and I need to make a reservation.
