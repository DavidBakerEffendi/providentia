Got lucky on a Saturday right at noon, we had no wait, and were promptly seated near the door to the terrace. Service was alright, and the food was delicious. We ordered the Tunisian eggs, the breakfast sandwich and the steak and eggs, and all were very good, the only thing off was my toast, which was cold and soggy. Other than that, it's reasonably priced and the portions are decent. Would definitely come back!
