Two friends suggested we go here, and I'm glad they did. I've walked past the place many times and have wanted to try it out, but it always seemed very busy (and now I know why). We met at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night, which was a good time to go. It wasn't busy yet although it kept filling up as we were there. The service was top-notch and the food was delicious. The empanadas and croquettes were especially good, as was the Spanish Omelet. I'm looking forward to going again and trying more of the dishes. It's a great gem of a place with nice staff and a good ambience.
