the food here is pretty great!  i had a damn fine salad here. but, have you ever been in the bar area?!  it's the most awkward bar i've EVER been in!  it's like, this ultra well lit square bar, with about 6 different flatscreens positioned around the perimeter, none with volume.  and also, no music!  just a bunch of 50-something hopewell residents chatting too loud, under the bright lights.  weird city!  so if you just want to have a drink, unless you want to feel awkward, i'd go when it's nice out and sit on the porch! the inside looks like an old german grandmother's crib, and there were mad teapots.  i was into that!
