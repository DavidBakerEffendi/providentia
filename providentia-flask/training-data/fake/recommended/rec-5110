Went in for brunch... food was great as always (get the donuts) and the atmosphere was pleasant--full, but still room to breathe. I don't usually rate based on service, but these guys were so super sweet, it warrants a mention. There were a couple minor gaffs early on (a dirty glass and a late entree) so they comped us another dish... and then eventually gave us the meal on the house. This definitely wasn't necessary but it was a nice gesture and really way more than expected. With the simple gesture of wanting to do right, the Diner staff made two customers for life. Nice work.
