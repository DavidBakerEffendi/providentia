This is why I love Yelp.  I listened to all of you who told me that Village Whiskey is a must, and a must it is!  I do agree that this is hands down one of the most delicious burgers I've eaten.  I got mine with the white cheddar.  The duck fat fries were good but I have had better.  Also, my burger, fries, and diet coke for lunch totaled $25 with tip.  Definitely a splurge for lunch (the lunch menu and dinner menu are the same).  If I were to try this again, I'd probably go for dinner and try one of their micro-brew beers.  Glad I went!
