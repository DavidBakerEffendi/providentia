The BEST Authentic Jersey Pizza Pie anywhere! *****5 stars for the pizza:  a plain pie is perfection and only $10. ****4 stars for the service:  it's a friendly family joint! ***3 stars for the decor:  this place has not changed in years! **2 stars for the fact that they only take cash. *1 pizza you need to try, cause it's 5 friggin' stars and better than any "Famous New York Pizza" you will ever eat!  Jersey Pizza is thin crust all the way through.  Like essentially having an infinity edge where the perfect blend of fresh mozz and tomato sauce just oozes to the tip, creating just enough room for your fingers to hold it and the base being the perfect vessel to hold it all up and transport this deliciousness from plate to mouth.  Much better than anything you will have when you drive over/through that "bridge & tunnel"!  People talk a lot of smack about Jersey but we are good for something over here!! Can you tell just how PASSIONATELY I feel about this pizza!?!
