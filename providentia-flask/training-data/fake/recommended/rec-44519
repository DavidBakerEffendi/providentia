I was in this restaurant yesterday with my teen son; we order lunch/brunch special "Tosilog with Garlic Rice" for $10. Place was small and outdated (but doesn't bother us, the food was good, especially the Garlic Rice; you got to try it).  The lunch special's portion it's enough for me and my son (we're not the big eater).   Only one thing I would like to mention is the "waiter", he need some SMILE..... on his face, Seem like he does not want to be there.
