This is THE Grimaldi's as Patsy is back. The wait to get in was bearable even at 30 mins. In spite of the packed house the service was great. I wasn't sure of which craft beer to order so the waiter kindly brought over a sampler of 3 bers gratis. The arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts was delicious. Maybe a bit small for the price ($12) so we ordered two. No problem we were here for the pizza anyway. Went with the Margarita in a purist attempt to sample. Without a doubt the Margarita pizza was literally a slice of heaven. Sauce was fresh and robust, cheese was not greasy but stringy and yummy, and the crust was just the right thickness with almost a buttery note to it. Pizza perfection! To end our meal we tried the cannoli. Without hesitation these were some of the best we've ever had. Shells were fresh and the filling was light and airy. Not the typical heavy filling. Very, very good!!! Don't forget to try a few.
