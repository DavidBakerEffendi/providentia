I've been coming here since I was a kid, and the place is as great as ever. If you're coming for the pizza, there is only one choice to make get the SQUARES, better yet come with a few others and just get the half-tray. 12 fresh sicilian slices with the best pizza sauce I've ever tasted. Of course it isn't complete unless you also get some spumoni next door, which is the perfect complement to the pizza. The spumoni is a mixture of three flavors - pistachio, chocolate, and canilla. My girlfriend and I, always argue over which is the best flavor. I went to the restaurant part one time, and got the chef's table, a four-course family style meal. Each course was delicious, and I would definitely come back for a full dinner in the future.
