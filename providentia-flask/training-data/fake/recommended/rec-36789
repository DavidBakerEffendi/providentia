I am from Los Angeles and was on a solo excursion through the Big Apple, but I was staying with my cousin who highly recommend Mamoun's. As Indians, we regard spice and savory flavors over ANYTHING else. believe me when I say ANYTHING. After a day of being tourists, she took me here and from outside, I honestly wasn't expecting much. Located near a seedy tourist shirt store and graffitied ATM was this small walkway leading into a very narrow, dark wood restaurant. After ordering our food and getting some water, we sat down and within a few minutes, our falafels arrived! We instantly grabbed their famous "hot sauce" and drenched our pita pockets with them...mainly because, again, as Indians, we love spice. LITTLE DID WE KNOW... that so did middle easterners in NYC... as our mouths started to BLAZE into an oven! We quickly scooped out the majority of hot sauce and gobbled up the delicious falafel... only to run to the nearby Pinkberry and order a yogurt and drink it down like water. It's an amazing little shop. Definitely a must try for visitors like me, or locals who are sketched out.
