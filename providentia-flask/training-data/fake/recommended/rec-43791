Tragically located in the depths of boring-ville, Prospect Park. But totally worth the trek. They use all local ingredients so it's fresh and delicious. Friendly and helpful waitstaff (though we sat at the bar, so can't vouch for table-service). The dishes I tried were good, but I must say: GO WITH GOAT. If the New York Times' recent article (nytimes.com/2009/04/01/dâ€¦) isn't enough to convince you, I don't know how else to sell it. The menu changes every day so make sure to catch them for dinner on the right night.
