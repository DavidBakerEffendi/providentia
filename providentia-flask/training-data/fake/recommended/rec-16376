This is a wonderful concept for a restaurant near Bryant Park- a simple, small menu, good quality ingredients, clean fry oil, and both carnivores and vegans will walk out happy. The prices are almost too low, the service is lightning fast, and the waitstaff is uber friendly. The owner Brian is clearly a talented and hardworking man and can be seen behind the counter, serving food with his employees. I like the community table lunch space and the portion size is spot on. My only dilemmas would be that I wish there was a recycling bin and unsweetened ice tea
