I don't know how to feel about this place. First visit, BF and I went in for lunch after reading reviews on Yelp. We were seated right away and received excellent service the entire meal. I tried a special, black bean burger tacos, and it was AWESOME! I had to fight off my date after letting him have a bite. When I asked our server for a beer suggestion, he took the opportunity to invite us into their "MBA" beer tasting program with great enthusiasm. A guy at the table next to us even added his thoughts on the program, showing off the beer stein that you get when you complete it. I was really looking forward to going back to work on my beer list! Second visit was two weeks later, dinner time. After a half hour wait, we were seated and drink orders taken. The special I had last time wasn't available, so I asked for the regular black bean burger. "No," replied our server. I thought she was joking by Â her abruptness. "We're out of it." I should note that this is the only vegetarian entree on the entire menu. The server offered some suggestions, like salad or cheese sticks, but I'm a good decade or two past wanting to eat cheese sticks for dinner. Disappointed, we finished our drinks and left. The first visit was so great that I may be willing to try again, but having one (or zero) option for a meal will be difficult to get past unless they are willing to accommodate the vegetarians and vegans of the world. Update 4/22/14: I was contacted the next day by management with an invitation to return. I'll post an update on my third experience in the next couple weeks!
