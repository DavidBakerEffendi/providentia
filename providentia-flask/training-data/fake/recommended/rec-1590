i really wanted to love this place.... i always pass by and it's so cute! but it was kind of a disappointment. i ordered the hilly cheesesteak and it was very dry. i do have to say however that the service was really good, our waiter was really sweet and friendly. just because of their excellent service, I might go back and try some other items on the menu.
