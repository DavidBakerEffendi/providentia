Our favorite restaurant in NYC! Living in the East Village is made better by this establishment. I am not going to gush or go on for a review. Instead we want to point out that Beyond Sushi is a benchmark for excellence in demonstrating what can be done with only vegetables in a vegan model. All of the other vegetarian eateries need to take a page from Beyond Sushi's book and know that a true vegetarian patron will know how to cook, prepare, and be delighted. All 3 are maximized with every visit.
