This place is AWESOME. We ordered the Chef's Menu, which combine the different type of food. You won't know what you are getting, until it arrives on your table. We had maybe a total of 10 dishes (including dessert). Everything was good. Dessert was okay.....I don't think this is their area of excellence.
