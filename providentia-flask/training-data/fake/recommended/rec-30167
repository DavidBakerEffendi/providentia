I recently did some training to work at this restaurant. Unfortunately, it did not work out but while I was working there the food always looked amazing, so I decided to check it out. I ordered the watermelon mojito, which was incredibly delicious and refreshing and the lasagnetti pasta with pesto, which was to die for. For dessert I ordered the nectarine shortcake, which was very fresh and just the right amount of sweet. The great thing about Cookshop is that the dishes are not overly complex because they get the best ingredients and they trust the ingredients enough to make them the star of the dish. You can really taste the freshness. i thought the price was fair for the quality I was getting. Also, the staff is incredibly nice and, even though the job didn't pan out for me, I have to say the management is awesome and super dedicated. I definitely will be back!
