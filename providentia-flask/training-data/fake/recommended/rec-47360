Everytime I come to NYC... a local tells me to hit up the meat cart on 53rd and 6th. On my most recent trip to the city, my curiosity got the best of me. There are so many street meat carts! Why this one? A friend was nice enough to pick up some of this famous Chicken and Rice Plate ($6) for me for dinner on my last night in NYC. He told me that he did not have to wait at all, because he got to the cart BEFORE they open at 7:30pm. I know for a fact that if you go late at night, the lines can be about an hour long. I didn't know what to expect... from "street meat".. My plate consisted of shredded chicken, rice, pita bread, and shredded ice berg lettuce. Doesn't sound too special, but if you eat it with the yogurt sauce - it is really DELISH! They also provide this blood red hot sauce.. WAY too spicy for me! I stuck with my white yogurt sauce :) Portion wise, it is just right for 2 people.. if you're crazy hungry, you can probably finish a plate on your own. I must say, it was PRETTY good for a plate of food that comes off a cart. And if I was drunk and hungry, this would really hit the spot! No wonder the lines get super long! I have a feeling I'm going to crave this when I get back to CA. :(
