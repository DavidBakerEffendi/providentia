THE NASTIEST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE!!!!!!! first of all the staff was nice but I got my plate and there was a hair wrapped around my shrimp, which prompted me to check my other shrimp and there was a bug with wings on another shrimp... The nastiest thing I've seen in my LIFE!!!! My boyfriend said his crab legs were so bland and dry, not juicy at all. My son's food was fine but I was so appalled. They have the golf outside and since we promised our son, we went to play after the food Â incident and we didn't pay for that. As we reached the last hole..... I seen the BUGS, the same bug that was in my food fly all around. It was at least 100 of them flying around. I suddenly felt sick!! and left!!!! NASTY! NASTY! NASTY! NASTY! NASTY!... THEY WILL BE CLOSED BY 2013 AND I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT BECAUSE I'LL WRITE MY REVIEW EVERYWHERE!!!
