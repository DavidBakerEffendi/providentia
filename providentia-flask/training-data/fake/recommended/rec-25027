They seated us at 7:45 for a 7:30 reservation because a table that was done was just sitting there talking and the restaurant wouldn't ask them to leave. I had the papaya salad and the salmon green curry. The curry was rated as very spicy in spiciness but was not spicy at all.  The papaya salad was rated as mild spicy but was very spicy. The cost for the food in not worth it.  Maybe its a good place for vegetarians, as most of the positive reviews seem to come from vegetarians.
