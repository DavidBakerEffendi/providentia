I've only ever had takeout from here but it has always been to my liking. I stick with the vegan options and the gentleman who always takes my order knows to not include any paneer or ghee in my dishes. They also make their naan for me without ghee which is nice. Â I especially like their Bhindi Masala and Aloo Gobhi which are delish! And when I ask them to make it extra spicy they always accommodate. I've been to too many restaurants that when you ask for extra spicy they are afraid or something and hold out. It's quite annoying. Hopefully one day I will dine in.
