This restaurant has the best atmosphere . It's nice and inviting with an eclectic mix of people. I love that they sometimes have live music and they have a smoker outside. The service is the best . I like that they text you when your table is ready and they accommodate your every need. The food is amazing especially the Mac and cheese , omg the best. I don't really care for the cornbread because it's on the savory/ salty side where I like sweet cornbread. Lastly the smoke flavor of the ribs make the ribs , they fall apart but they are often fatty . Other than that I would eat here anytime
