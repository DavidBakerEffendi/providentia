I grew up in the area and have been living in New York for the past 15 years. Every time I come back to West Trenton I am disappointed by the lack of decent places to eat. Finding Cafe 72 was a pleasant surprise. Â The staff is friendly, the food is great and they have outdoor seating. I had the braised short rib eggs benedict which was delicious. Next time I come to visit my family, I am definitely coming back for more.
