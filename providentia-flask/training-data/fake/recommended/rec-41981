I have a new favorite.  Talula's Garden was out of this world!!  We went there yesterday for my sister's birthday brunch and everything was just fantastic.  The ambiance is lovely, and it has some really nice touches, from the fancy side plates, that are all different, to the rustic paintings and decor. For starters we got the cheese plate, which came with gluten free rosemary bread!!!!! (a surprise and a winner for any celiac diner), ricotta doughnuts, and fruit and berry plate.  So good, seriously good.  I want to go back and just order cheese.   For the main course, we all got something different, and not one of the 6 of us had anything bad to say.  Even my 92 year old grandmother, who can't really eat out anymore was thrilled, she ate her entire plate of blintzes and was seriously impressed.   I will be going back again!
