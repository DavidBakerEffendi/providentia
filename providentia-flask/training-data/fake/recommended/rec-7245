A few friends and I met here for brunch at 1:30pm. There were a few parties ahead of us but we were told the wait would not be too long. Right...we weren't seated until past 2:30pm. Every other party was seated before us; we were literally the last people waiting outside in the freezing cold. Then, when we could FINALLY go inside and sit down, we were squeezed into a tiny corner because one person in our party wasn't eating. The only redeeming quality is that the food is good. I got the shrimp curry crepe which was OK, just too creamy for my taste. The desert crepe is very good (banana nutella - everyone seemed to have ordered one). Price is reasonable, about $10 for a crepe. The restaurant is REALLY small though, so unless you're here early, I would skip it. I can't believe I made the trek all the way to Brooklyn just to stand outside in the cold...go figure. I just think it's incredibly RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL to have people waiting outside for over an hour...if you're really that crowded, and you realistically don't think you can accommodate a party for a long time, you should let them know. We went inside multiple times to ask how much longer the wait would be. I get this restaurant wants to make money, but my time is probably more valuable than the $30 I forked over. I would take 60 minutes of saved time over $30 any day of the week. We were there SO late, we might as well have stayed for dinner. I'll probably never visit this place again, and would NEVER recommend it.
