This place is solid, nice place to go enjoy a good conversation with whomever it is you chose to have it with. The food is great, you'd be doing yourself an injustice if you went without trying the short rib appetizer. I had a chance to try the steaks and their fish, I've also tried the pastas. The food is creative, the service is great, the decor is clean. HOWEVER, be clear, this is why I only give this place a 3 star rating. This place is filled with the meat packing district, and Bayonne, New Jersey's most do*chey, do*che bags EVER. If you're a female and don't have big hair, fake boobs, an oompla loompa orange spray tan, and enough make up to put Mac out of business on your face, If you're a guy and don't have chevron's entire emergency reserve of oil in your hair, lip gloss, only 3 buttons fastened on your 12 button shirt, jeans with intentional holes, long and pointy designer shoes, and a shirt so tight that someone can see your heart beat in it YOU WILL BE STARED AT. This is fine, I understand that this is New York City, home of people watching. But if you're trying to enjoy the company of a certain someone, this may make your dining experience a little uncomfortable. I don't want to be a yelp snob, but it looks like they cloned the two guys from night at the Roxbury and created an equivalent female counterpart, and cloned them all 50 times over and squeezed them all into this place, gave them cocktails and nothing better to do and sat back to watch what happened. I've been here a few times, and I seriously felt like I was on that MTV show Boiling Points each time because of the people who frequent this place. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. Thank you have a nice day. The End
