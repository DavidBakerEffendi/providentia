We came here with a group of Friends to try their limited time prefixed menu offering that let's you pick one appetizer, one entree and one dessert for twenty dollars. The food did not disappoint! I will say that this place does not have its own unique style or imagining of standard food dishes (it does not try anything edgy or innovative in the preparation) but the food was definitely well prepared in the traditional sense. Throw in the $20.00 package meal and you get a home run. I would have given this place 4 stars however, i ordered an "alleged" 16 Ounce Prime Rib, which came out looking more like an 8 Ounce (which is a cardinal sin in my book), so i deducted some points for shadiness and poor form. Outside of that minor gripe, I think this is a great option in a city that has a few to pick from!!!
