Uhmmm...YUMMMMMMMMMMMM! Went here for during my VDay trip to Philly for Saturday morning brunch & it was pretty much the best decision ever. Â Although the wait was about 45mins-1hours when we got there, my boyfriend & I were lucky enough to score a table at the bar (okay we kinda stalked the people sitting there until they felt so uncomfortable they had to leave). Once we were settled in our comfy bar seats, I was greeted by a wonderful waitress who then passed me, of all things...a BEYONCE themed menu! At that moment, I knew THIS was the place I was supposed to be! I ordered the egg whites frittata & my boyfriend got the french toast...both were amazingly delicious. If you're ever in Philly, don't think twice about stopping at this place, just do it! Con: The line got so long people were standing at the front door holding it open & letting freezing cold air in :(
