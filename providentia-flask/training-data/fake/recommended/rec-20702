After reading all the wonderful reviews, I decided to stop by here and give it a try with my friend. Comparing to the other busy korean restaurants, cho dang gol has better service where waiters won't rush you to order things and the servers were very polite. However, the food wasn't as good as I expected. I ordered the tofu with beef stew expecting that there would be beef in there and not spicy at all, but when the dish came out, there was no beef at all and it was EXTREMELY spicy. I ate it with rice to calm the spicy taste down, but my tongue was on fire! However, the tofu tasted very good and fresh. On top of the tofu with beef stew, I ordered a small seafood pancake, and i didn't really like it because it tasted kind of bland, and I thought the seafood pancake I got from kunjip was way better with the seasoning and flavors. Overall, the experience was okay and I was a little disappointed with the food despite all the positive reviews.
