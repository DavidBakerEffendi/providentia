Wandered in after a long walk, this place is awesome. We got two different pizzas, both were amazing. All the ingredients are super fresh and tasty. They have a great beer selection, we are in love with their Vermont beers on happy hour special. Service was great as well, it was rarely quiet and the waiter was super chill and helpful. This was my second trip to flatbread, first time was with a native Vermonter friend. I guess Vermonters have good taste. Place is worth checking out!!
