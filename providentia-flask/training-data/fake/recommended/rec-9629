This little gem has an understated elegance through and through. From the décor to the good natured employees to the simple yet carefully crafted dishes. Tsumami Tororo Soba - The Japanese yam creates a stickiness similar to okra.  You gotta try this.  It is so unique and delicious. Yakitori - Skip the Yakitori Ju and get it a la carte, it's so much better. Try the Momo with Shio. Kaisen Don - The usual suspect when you're in the mood for sashimi. Sometimes I wish they'd cut the sashmi thinner. I just like it when it melts in my mouth more than a bite sized fish steak. Desserts were surprisingly underwhelming after such a great meal.  Head over to Chikalicious on 10th/2nd to end the night right.
