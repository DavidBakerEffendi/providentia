Saw them building this place and frankly was put off by the overall look and feel from the outside (and inside), however the other day I was walking past and thought I'd give it a try for lunch. Now I'm a convert and after having the Carnivore's Delight last night, that closed the deal. Food tastes fresh with interesting combinations of ingredients. Still have to squint a little when I walk in so not to see the decor to much and I don't really get the theme either but I'll definitely be a regular here.
