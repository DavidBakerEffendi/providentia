5 stars with caveat - there are a stack of ominous highchairs located near the ordering counter.  I went on a lovely Friday evening and there were no children to be seen.  But, I did take note of the highchairs.  However, I will review based on my experience, not on the possible experience said ominous highchairs might invite.  I would like to note that highchairs are a slippery slope and you should visit quickly before the families start arriving and ruining everything for everyone. On a recent lovely Friday evening, Husband & I were wandering aimlessly in our 'hood wondering where to go for a cheap-ish meal, with drinks.  I had just read the Top 10 Fries article in the Village Voice which recommended the sweet potato fries at this joint.  I remembered that anecdote as we were passing it on 8th (luckily, it's happy little sign is visible from 8th) so we turned down 16th and ventured in. There was a short but long (ordering takes time) line at the counter where we eventually ordered our Cuban Press and Philly Steak, 2 drafts (Dogfish Head and a witte), and dessert (a giant brownie and a coconut/date macaroon).  All in it was only about $45 (including 10% tip). The seating area is lovely, spacious and comfy and sprawly.  The staff are super friendly and chatty and happy.  The food was good.  I typically don't like sweet potato fries but keep ordering them hoping someday I might but I still don't; next time I'll order the normal fries. I love the scene here.  It felt like coffee house slash lounge slash bar slash awesome neighborhood joint.  I envision returning often until, of course, the first child is seen.  Once that happens I'll update my review accordingly.
