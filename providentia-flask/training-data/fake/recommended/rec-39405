Beenn going here since it opened 7 or 8 years ago. These guys make the best chicken and rice i've ever had. Big plus is the gigantic portion, and incredibly marinated chicken which they marinate in these black plastic bags. They've been friendly ever since they came and the big guy is a really charismatic person who turns the customers into friends. You'll even getva free falafel waiting for the food if he knows you or you're a mildly attractive woman haha we all have our vices. Great place and I was so excited to see it's awesome reviews! UPDATE-He won the Vendy AWARD for 2010!!!
