Was invited to a pre-opening here last night, and the food and ambiance are both great. It's btw Mercer and Greene at 25 W Houston and easy to get to. Terrific burgers, appetizers, chops and all kinds of reasonable priced food and drink. We had the tacos, the shrimp ceviche and also split a rib eye steak. All delicious. Very nice wines; hence the word Barrel from a Brooklyn winemaker. The chef is Josh Capon of Lure Fishbar, and the restaurant (just down the street from Lure) is owned and managed by the same group as Lure (one of my favorites). Very friendly vibe. as the front of house is managed by Rob Collins, host of Lure as well. Great wood and tile decor. Full bar where you can dine or hang out. The menu isn't overshelming--just enough choices--same with the dessert menu. Save room for dessert. Check it out!
