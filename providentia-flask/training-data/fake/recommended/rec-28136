"Ooof, I'm tired. Monday's suck. What do you want for dinner tonight?" "I dunno. I'm not cooking though." "It's your turn!" "So." *sigh* "Let's get Song" "sweet." *speed-dial on cell phone* -REALLY LOUD MUSIC IN BACKGROUND AND softspoken hostess - "mmffffsongtakeyourorder?" "HI I'D LIKE TO PLACE AN ORDER FOR DELIVERY!" "mmmfmmmfffmmmfffaddress?" blah blah blah "okwhatyoulike?" Everything I've had on the menu has been amazingly delicious. Everything. Seriously. Everything. I recommend the Kang Gai, though its fairly spicy. Go for the lemongrass dishes for anyone who can't handle heat. "okthankyou" "WAIT!! HOW LONG, AND HOW MUCH" "30 minutes, $21" CLICK. And 45 minutes and less than $25 later, me and mine are stuffed to the gills, with enough for leftovers tomorrow. Thanks Song. See you next week.
