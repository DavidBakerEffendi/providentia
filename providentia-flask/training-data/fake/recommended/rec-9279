This was the first place that I ever had raw scallops as part of a raw bar selection. To date, I still haven't found them anywhere where they are as good as the ones the serve at BLUE RIBBON. And that was just the first course! I was with a group of co-workers and we didn't get in the door until 11:30 PM. Luckily, one of us called ahead because there was still a huge back up at the bar of "less than lucky" folks that had to wait. We were seated at a cozy table smack-dab in the middle of the dining room. This turned out to be one of the highlights of the evening because we had a great view of all the action. After the raw bar course we we floored by the awesomely prepared yet simply plated apps, salads and of course the entrees! Everything was done to perfection, as good as it could be. The deserts were also some of the best around. Everyone who is even a mild foodie needs to check this place out!
