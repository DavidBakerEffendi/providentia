This place was such a pleasant surprise.  My party of six went here last Saturday night when it was pretty damn cold outside (well, it was January, doy!).  Nevertheless, we ended up outside in the beer garden area because the inside was overflowing with people having a really good time.  Once we were out there, we realized that it wasn't that bad because they have an abundance of heaters and fire pits all over the place.  Once ordered, the food didn't take very long to come out and everybody was stoked with what they ordered.  The potato pancakes were one of my favourites, mmmmm.   This place is just a really good time.  They have ping pong set up out back, and Jenga for most of the tables.  OH! I'm now a fan of mulled wine thanks to FH.  Sitting outside, sipping some delicious mulled wine, playing Jenga with friends, enjoying some indie music, eating German food....what more could you ask for, really?
