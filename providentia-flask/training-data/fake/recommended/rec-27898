Monday night. It was one of my best friend's birthday. Originally, we had plans to go to the Thai place but the decor wasn't fabulous enough for a celebration so we opted right next door to Market Table. Probably the best decision ever because Market Table was definitely fabulous and sophiscated for my friend who just turned 24. Once you enter Market Table, you can tell you're about to burn a hole in your wallet. you know what, you might as well just call it a day and throw down all your cash because this place is expensive (alright, I'm over exaggerating but this place was probably the most expensive date I've ever been on, especially since I paid for both of us). The restaurant has a very intimate feel to it with its holiday decoration and dark wood decor/furniture. It's also quiet so you can hear your +1 talk so that's good. I would recommend this place for dates. I ordered the codfish (yummy) and my friend had the fish of the day (bass). Both of them were cooked to perfection. Also had the banana pudding. A+. Do you have a lovely lady/man to impress? Bring them here. Guaranteed fooling around after because this place will leave you feeling great.
