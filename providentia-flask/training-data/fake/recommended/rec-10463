Went here on a Friday night with a friend for dinner and a catch up, and it was the perfect place to do it! The atmosphere was good, not too loud, but lively enough for a chilled Friday night. The offer wine and a small selection of beers, but not hard liquor. I had the Chilean sea bass which was melt in my mouth good, and oh so delicious. Only draw backs I had was the bathroom, there seems to be only one, and I think they could use another! And also, our table was at the front, and was set up very close to the next. We could hear each other's conversations. Service was good, food was good. It's a High End Diner.
