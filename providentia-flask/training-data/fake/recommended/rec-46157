I live in Connecticut and you can count the Cuban restaurants in this area with one hand.  I recently visited my Dad who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens and my nephew suggested we eat at El Rincon Criollo (roughly translated the Cuban Corner).  My mom and dad lived in this area for over 30 years and never told me about this hidden treasure!  It is tucked away off Roosevelt avenue and junction blvd about a stones throw away from the elevated 7 line and subway sandwiches across the street.  The restaurant is small and homey with Cuban memorabilia all around.  Cuban music is playing at all times and I'm talking about from the 50s!  The portions are huge and authentic, a little pricey but worth it.  They have a variety of Cuban dishes, I had the steak sandwich with a generous portion of French fries.  My wife and daughter had the chicken and rice with plantains and avacado salad.  We also had a large portion of white rice and black beans we we shared.  The wait staff was pleasant and they also had a full bar that was well stocked.  The wait is long because they are extremely busy but they bring you lovely baskets of heavenly toasted bread with butter which makes the wait bearable.  You will find families and couples very welcome but unfortunately they allow baby carriages which makes it difficult to navigate the room if you need to use the bathroom.  I think you will be quite pleased.
