Being a former Texan, I really crave good Mexican food, which is almost impossible to find in the northeast. One day I stumbled upon this place, and I have literally gone here at least once a week since. This place never disappoints. Must haves: Margaritas are awesome and fresh. All the tacos are amazing and cheap (my fave is the fish and chorizo) Yummy steak quesadilla AND the pozole on the weekends is soooooooo good. FYI....Friday night gets really busy so expect a wait.
