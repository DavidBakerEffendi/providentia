We often come here before or after a night at the ballet or theater. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this restaurant. Upon entering you are greeted by the maitre'd who has always remembered us even though we only come once every few months. The waitstaff is extremely professional and knowledgable. We have never experienced poor service or anything that could be construed as poor service. I've been to many restaurants where the waitstaff and bartenders are extremely pretentious. Such is not the case at Varalli. While the waitstaff is very professional here they are also very friendly. The food is very good and we've never experienced a subpar meal. We prefer to eat after the ballet or theater but have eaten prior to the performance and have found the waitstaff to be extremely aware of the time so that they could make sure that you make the performance without any issues. I definitely recommend the calamari. It is certainly some of the best in the city. We always leave satisfied. I would certainly recommend Varalli for a pre or post performance meal or dessert.
