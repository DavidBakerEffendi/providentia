It ain't big and it ain't fancy but by God, it's good food AND it's open late!!! Literally only space for 30 people in this whole place, but it's a fun 30 that'll be we'll fed. Besides, you get enough Sangria or other such cocktails and anything that doesn't work for you will magically right itself. A good hang for some hearty food with a vibrant ambience. Oh dear God, I just found out that they deliver AND are open 24 hours. THis place is heaven....I may never leave home or cook again. I ordered some arroz con pollo and this plantain and sour cream thing that was INCREDIBLE. The rice and chicken thing wasn't like "mama" used to make (note-my "mama" was a heavy set gay Cuban gay dude who could cook his head off and like to use orange juice to sautee his chicken...really, WHO could compete with that?) but even so, I ate ALL of it. For some reason I cannot seem to fight off the inclination to go back there again and again. I'll probably go there again and chances are it will be really late at night (to avoid such a crowd) but I am SURE that whenever I go there, as long as I'm not needing quiet or intimacy, and ESPECIALLY if I wanna EAT and PARTY family styled with young Â adults!!!
