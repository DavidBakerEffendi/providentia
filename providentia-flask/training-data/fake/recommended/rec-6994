Recently stopped in to the BeeHive Oven and had an awesome meal (dinner) from start to finish: Veggie Plate w/ Homemade Buttermilk Dressing Deviled Eggs Fried Green Tomatoes Jezebel Wings The Nettie Shrimp & Grits Fruit Biscuit Pudding (order even if you're full) Staff was super attentive, friendly, and made you feel like you were at home. Plus, they had a nice little beer selection to pair with your biscuit sandwich and southern hospitality.
