Went here for some beers with friends last night.  The beer selection was pretty good, I can't complain. I didn't have any food, so I can only comment on my drinking experience. I didn't really see the decor since it was dark out and I'm colorblind.  We ended up in the front vestibule/mini bar area waiting for a table from 11-12 AM on a Saturday, so I suggest coming earlier if you don't want to wait an hour like us.  The waitress did serve us though, which was great.
