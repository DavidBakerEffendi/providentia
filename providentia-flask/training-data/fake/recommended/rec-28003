I tried to like Sweet Afton, I really tried. I've always had so-so experiences here. Unfriendly service at the bar, long waits for drinks, little to no acknowledgement once sitting at the bar. There's usually only one bartender even when it's super busy, so I GET IT. However, my last two experiences have been pure crap. The first crap experience was drinking a glass of wine with a friend along the wall. A busboy came to take my empty glass and spilled a lit candle full of hot wax all over me, my jeans, my purse and vintage suede boots. Honest mistake I'm sure - except for when you don't apologize and act like it was my fault that it happened when I hadn't budged from my seat once. No apology, no acknowledgement, no nothing. Second bad experience is right now, as I'm sitting here at the bar. Asked a question about the drink my friend had just ordered, to which the bartender replied curtly "why don't you just trust me?" And rolled his eyes. Um, seriously? I work in hospitality. I would never. Overall, bar has a good vibe, but needs a serious attitude adjustment. Stop trying to appeal to the new Astoria and remember that locals belong here too. We could do without the pretentiousness.
