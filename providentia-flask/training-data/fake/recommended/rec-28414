A great East Village hot spot.  A friend and I stopped by here two Sundays ago.  I told here "let's go to this cute little place I know - there won't be a wait".  Wrong.   The wait was an hour at noon on Sunday. Regardless, the food is great and the menu is slightly unique.  If you're a health nut you'll have plenty of options.   Service isn't exceptional but nothing to complain about either.
