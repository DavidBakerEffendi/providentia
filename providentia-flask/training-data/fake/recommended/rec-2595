Sarcone's bread.  High quality meats. Interesting sandwich combinations.  Sound like your typical South Philly hoagie shop?  You'd be wrong, because this place takes credit cards and is open 'til 9pm!  They deliver, too. The hoagies and hot sandwiches (chicken cutlet, chicken parm, eggplant parm) are where it's at here.   The cheesesteak and even pepper and egg are disappointing.  I've had some pretty awful experiences with the fried appetizers.  But get a hoagie here and you will be happy.
