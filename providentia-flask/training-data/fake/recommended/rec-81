I'm a rib snob. For port. ribs this is a great find. I ordered a full order of pork ribs,and the owner suggested a 1/2 order. I have a big appetite, but he was right. The half order filled me. Â Most places give little meat and a ton of rice. Not this place . The ribs were meaty,tasty,the sauces added the right tang without over powering the taste of the meat. I had the beans and rice for my sides. Both complimented the meal. The place is very clean. The owner,Eli,is very friendly ,like a buddy u haven't seen in awhile . Oh ,the price is very reasonable . Will definitely return.
