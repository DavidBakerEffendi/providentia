Two friends and I, visiting NY, were referred to this restaurant by the business which provides its homemade pasta.  We were exceptionally pleased with everything about the place. Joey seated us and was our waiter.  Very nice guy and part of the family who has owned it for long time.  Ravioli with marinara was superb as was pesto and ravioli with white sauce. Ambience very nice. "Uncle Jimmy" held court over the establishment and was kind enough to direct us to a route to our subway.  Highly recommend this restaurant in the heart of Little Italy
