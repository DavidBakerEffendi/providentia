This place deserves 5 stars based on the tuna burger alone. But I'm only giving 4 stars because they've run out of tuna burgers on several occasions. They always have interesting specials. The cooks/chefs take pride in the food. I appreciate that. Oh, and every now & then, there's a decent party going on in the lounge area. But um..I come for the food.
