I came here about a year ago, but wanted to write a review.  This was, hands down, one of the best meals I ever had.  My roommate was pretty friendly with the Maitre d since he brought clients there.  A group of four was seated down and they don't have a menu.  The waiters are trained to cite the entire menu and all their specials and it's quite the long list.   I'm not sure if they will do this for everybody, but we asked for 10 entree's but had them serve it to us divided proportionally.  I can't recall exactly what we had, but we had a variety ranging from all sorts of hand-made pastas/raviolis with raw/cooked fish, chicken, beef, etc.  We topped it off with two bottles of red and last but not least, we also made room for dessert and coffee.  The best part was the bill and I'm not going to spoil the surprise, but I will say it was probably 1/2 of what I expected to pay. Not only was the food great, but the service was exceptional.  They will treat you right here.
