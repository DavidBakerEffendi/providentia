Love this restaurant. It's small, cozy but has great food. I wouldn't say that anything is mind-blowingly amazing, but the quality and the freshness of the ingredients really make a difference. My boyfriend and I have eaten here a couple of times now, and both came to the conclusion that the food reminds you of true homestyle cooking: real food cooked by real people, with accessible flavors and cooked with love. Very quick service and charming staff makes this a lovely neighborhood joint.
