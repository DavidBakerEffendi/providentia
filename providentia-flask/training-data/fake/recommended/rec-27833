Cafecito is a wonderful restaurant, great bar with excellent drinks, and a perfect place for me to unwind after a long day at work or to begin my night on the weekend. The food quality is excellent, the mojitos to die for, and the management is incredibly friendly and professional. I love the steak sandwich with delicious plantain chips made in house accompanied by a fresh garlic mojito sauce. The churrasco is also one of my favorites, and their weekend brunch menu is incredible. A regular stop for me and one that is consistently delicious and pleasant to visit! They even have a twitter and instagram where they post daily specials, @cafecitonyc
