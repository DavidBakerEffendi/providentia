Outstanding, not to be missed.  Excellent preparation and execution of everything, especially the sauces.  Very rich and savory, especially the signature Saveur Creole Goat, my dish.  Nice and intimate, great for a date, upscale lunch or night out, or a change of pace from more "downtown" restaurants.  The owner even greeted our table, an unexpectedly friendly gesture.
