Thiru is an artist. His food is delicious, creative, healthy, and affordable. He is excellent at relating to his customers and fans. Arrive early for best selection, and if you see a long line and have a tight schedule, just approach the window and ask for an appetizer - I recommend the samosa or a vegan drumstick. This will give you a taste of his genius without a wait. If you have time and/or there is a relatively short line, I recommend masala dosa. The coconut chutney that accompanies the dosa is exceptional. Enjoy!
