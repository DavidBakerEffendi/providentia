This place was a bomb, and not in a good way. I really cannot fathom to understand how people write such raving reviews. I went for brunch earlier today drawn in by their gluten free menu options. I am not actually a celiac, but now choose to eat gluten free as it is healthier for both the mind and body. Pizza, however, one of my greatest weaknesses has been incredibly difficult to give up.  There is nothing like a cheesy,moist,basil goodness slice of pie, and after all the fantastic reviews I had to give it a try. We started with the Arugula salad- a tasty, tangy bowl of summer fresh greens in a lemony dressing. Great- not memorable, followed by the gluten free vodka pizza. Maybe it was an off day??? But the crust was actually repulsive.  The flavor of strange potato starch dough coupled with the lead-like weight in my stomach left much to be desired, and made for a regretful meal.  Placing the arugula salad on top covered the muted taste and texture to a point, but after a slice each we called it quits.  For the record, I love doggie bags and will take leftovers from any meal, but I wouldn't even give this a homeless person. Also, the GF pizza was pricey, at $24 bucks a pie, making this a steep price for a single terrible slice. I also tasted my bf's slice of regular pizza, which he had to get after such disappointment, and it wasn't that great either.
