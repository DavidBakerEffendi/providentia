I like a good beer joint. Especially a British one. It reminds me of all the fun I had putting on 20lbs doing a college semester abroad. On top of that the food is quite lovely (done in my very best accent). The Gnudi was a great way to spark my appetite. The burger was clearly one of the best of ever eaten. Fun place!!
