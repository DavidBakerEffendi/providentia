HELLA GOOD! the naan-type bread, sauce, beef and egg was so good! a couple coworkers and I stopped by around noon and the place was packed! we were in a hurry and almost missed the opportunity to try it! but I persisted and we wound up waiting about 15 minutes for our food! not bad when it looks like there were at least 30 people waiting in line! i will say, the spicy level is OFF THE CHART. if you aren't the biggest fan of FIRE/burning of the lips, definitely have a glass of water ready! I almost passed out because I wanted to keep eating but the spice level was insane.
