I had the BBQ ribs and pulled pork with baked beans and mac and cheese.  Ribs were ok, they were not falling off the bone like someone told me. They are smoked ribs so its not soft at all. Pulled pork was good but a little salty. Cornbread was bland.  Mac and cheese is similar to Kraft mac and cheese. Baked beans had meat in it and was sort of mushy. By the way my friends and I had to wait for 45 minutes to be seated. It wasn't worth the wait.
