I'm always happy with my experience at the VT Pub & Brewery. I've been twice in the past two years, and I love it. Great food, and awesome beer. I love how their menu is like a newspaper, filled with fun facts about beer too. I love the VT cheese sampler, and the beer sampler. The cheese sampler comes with different types of VT cheese, paired with slices of apples and crackers to clear your palate. The beer sampler is a good price for the types and amount of beer that you are getting. Service is pretty good. My one complaint was when I was sitting at the bar nearest to the front. It was nighttime, and it was warm as heck. Some air conditioning please! Other than that, great place. I always make it a point to stop here when I'm visiting VT.
