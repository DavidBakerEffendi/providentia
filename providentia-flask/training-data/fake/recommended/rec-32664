Had an early dinner here recently, the restaurant wasn't crowded, but still the service was rushed, food overcooked, and preparations apathetic.  We ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers, and pasta dishes.  Appetizers were barely opened when entrees arrived!  We pushed aside the apps in an attempt to enjoy the pasta while it was hot. When I mentioned the overcooked seafood and rushed service to the manager, she reminded me that the area has many restaurants, probably I should find another!  GOOD ADVICE! Il Corallo Trattoria seems to be catering to students who cannot afford better, and those who don't know better.  There are enough great restaurants in the area, why waste time eating such mediocre food and enduring poor service.
