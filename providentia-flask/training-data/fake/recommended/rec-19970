Just encountered the most dismissive and cantankerous hostess. Observed numerous open tables for two at brunch and was told it would be forty five minute wait, and abruptly walks away having never looked at us. My wife and I decided not wait and upon leaving, without solicitation, the nasty hostess comments "Sorry we couldn't accommodate you right now." Â Speaking to us like spoiled children. Food might be good, don't know. Refuse to do business with a place that can't even be gracious on hello. Cross the street to Prime Meats.
