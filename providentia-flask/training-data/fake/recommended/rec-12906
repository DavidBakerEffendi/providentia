Whenever people hear about popular eateries, they automatically expect food of the gods or something. Don't let the over-hype fool you, this ain't no ambrosia, however there is some darn good food here. Being all touristy and what not, I had to try the blueberry pancakes. However I'm not the biggest fan of sweets, so I also got the Spanish Scramble. Blueberry pancakes were delicious, as was expected. A little too sweet for my kind of morning food, but they have definitely perfected this recipe. Pancakes were fluffy, seriously melted in the mouth. The Spanish Scramble on the other hand. Ugh, it was perfect !!! All the flavors of the vegetables blended so well together. Wish I hadn't split this with my friend so I could have it all for myself !! But what's with those hashbrowns....they were strange and bland. Me no likey. Downsides: - long wait - CASH ONLY (had to sit at my table and hold up customers while I waited for my friend to return from the atm...haha embarrassinggg) - small place, can feel a bit cramped Overall, food was great!! Didn't really care about the wait, cus it's always expected when it comes to popular places.
