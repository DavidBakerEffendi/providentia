Way overrated. I would say the atmosphere is nice and the sushi is cheap, but there are definitely some weird sushi options. The rice did not taste like sushi rice. The miso soup was served with a spoon!?! The service was a bit pushy. Definitely not authentic sushi. Good enough if you want sushi and dint want to pay a lot. For someone who doesn't know a lot about sushi it is fine but I won't go back. I love sushi and this was not great.I'd give this 2.5 stars
