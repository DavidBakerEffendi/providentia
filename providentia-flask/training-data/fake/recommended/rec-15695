Absolutely flawless and given the deliciousness really reasonably priced.  Met an old friend - we hadn't talked in several years - for a reconciliation / "airing of the grievances" / catch-up dinner.  We enjoyed a comfortable table (I sat along the wall on a booth, he sat in a chair) in a romantically-lit, on-the-quiet side section of the restaurant (it's huge!) on a Monday night.  We were seated immediately at the time of our reservation.  We both got the Restaurant "Week" (7/22-8/16) menu for only $38 each and it was terrific!  I had hummus and felafel as my appetizers and both were scrumptious - the felafel cubes were perfect, perhaps the best I've ever had.  For my main course I had chicken which was great.  For dessert my friend and I split the candy bar and cheesecake, and the former was awesome and the latter wasn't our taste but for cheesecake fans it was probably good.  He is a vegetarian and enjoyed his dishes as well.  We split a bottle of wine and first had a free taste of it - we liked it that much!  Just delicious - can't wait to go back.
