I was at new haven for a day and ordered some food from here , With the reviews here i am sure people in new haven do not know how the Mediterranean food tastes like , I ordered for chicken kebab plate and chicken shawarma, the chicken was burnt and was terrible with soggy salad , This is not Mediterranean food , Shame on you guys !! the interior looks . The quantity is very less , not worth money ! I think the truck food is still worth it !
