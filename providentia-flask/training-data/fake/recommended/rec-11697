I've been here a few times and I love this place.  I love the wacky decor and the cool very modern-looking plates.  I find service to be attentive without being overbearing, and they always bring my food at just the right time between "wow, it's done already...?" and "wow, I'm starving, PLEASE feed me sooner than this!" GREAT drinks and lots of variety in the drink menu-- mimosas, mojitos, martinis, mixed drinks, you name it, it's there, and it probably involves some kind of semi-exotic fruit flavor like lychee or mango or whatnot. Also the pad thai is totally out of this world fantastic; I've had both the chicken and the vegetable.  The spring rolls aren't bad either, and I got the appetizer platter once with an assortment of fried things that were all incredibly good and worthwhile. YUM!  Go here!  It's a fun experience for your eyes and your mouth, and it's relatively inexpensive-- around $10-12 for dinner.  I've never been for lunch so I can't speak to that, but dinner here is consistently good.
