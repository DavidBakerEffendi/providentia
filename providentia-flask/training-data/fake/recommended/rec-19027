After having it on my list of restaurants to try for years, I finally made it to Market Table and was thoroughly disappointed. The meal started in an odd way after the hostess tried to ask our permission to seat the 2 of us at a 4-top (why would we object to this?) and completely confused us in the process. After being seated, we waited for our server to approach but were ignored. When we finally flagged down the hostess to ask who our server would be, she promptly stepped in to take a drink order. Although we did eventually meet our actual server (after we had been seated for about 25 min), she kept disappearing and the hostess had to cover for her through most of our meal. I was expecting to be wowed by the food, but it was very underwhelming. Quinoa hushpuppies, chicken and steak were all nicely prepared but each were bland and lacking in flavor and innovation. All of the specials were sold out by 9:15 on a Friday night and the remaining menu choices were not exciting. Is it possible that a restaurant of this caliber would actually put bread that had been frozen on the table? Ours was suspiciously cold the center and wet on one side. I am willing to overlook service issues for great food but neither were up to par here. There are too many other great restaurants in the neighborhood to give Market Table another chance.
