I love this place! For 2 reasons, 1. My husband proposed to me there and 2. because of the amazing Brunch they have. I had the poached pear and pecan french toast and it was amazing! We sat by the window, which I definitely recommend because I'm not one for sitting in the middle of the room when I'm trying to have a nice intimate meal with someone. The service was very good, the wait staff seem to be very knowledgable about the menu. The decor is rugged with cute dog pictures everywhere. The only negative is that the brunch is so popular that there is always a line if you don't make a reservation. I am also a big proponent of Farm to Table establishments and this one definitely has brunch down to a tee!
