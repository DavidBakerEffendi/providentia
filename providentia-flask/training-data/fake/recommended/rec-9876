Poultry is probably my least favorite protein. I tend to avoid it at restaurants and in my personal cooking. On the other hand, fried food is just so delicious and once you give it a kick (AKA make it hot), heaven has been reached on earth. Add some bacon and....Focus, Sophie. Focus! So I decided to try this place for my love of fried and hot food and to see what all the hype is about and to support a local business. Now, I have a very high tolerance for hot food...Like, ridiculously high. Too often I order dishes that are advertised as being devilishly hot, only to be sorely disappointed. So I went in with the mentality that their hot can't possible compare to my hot. This lead me to order the  extra hot, thinking that Peaches' hot won't do it for me. I was so effing wrong. The hot was so damn hot. Like burn your mouth and need a gallon of milk after each bite. The slice of bread and pickle (loved the pickle) also help battle the hotness. Despite my burning mouth, I was able to taste everything. This is a must for hot food, the flavor must be there and my chicken was packed with it. The meat was juicy and the skin was crispy.  The portions are also really big so you can easily share just one order. After having the extra hot, I had to go back for more, but this time I pulled it down a notch. I got the hot. Delicious! And I did not need as much milk this time. I also took it to go. This is a small place and it's always packed so be prepared to wait if you decide to eat in. They also have a limited amount of beers on tap (like 4). Side dishes are okay but honestly, who cares? Do you really come here for anything other than fried chicken? Sides are just fillers. Peaches Hothouse really is that good and so worth the hype.
