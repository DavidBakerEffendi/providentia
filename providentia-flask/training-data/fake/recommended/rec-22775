This is the one!  Service was so incredibly friendly and helpful.  My last Korean BBQ venture in Cali was really ruined half by poor service, and when you have people changing grill plates, it's amazing what a quick and nice staff does for your entire dinner. Really, I was quiet charmed by all of the staff and their responsiveness.  Not to mention actually quite private seeming private rooms, the big TVs on ESPN, but nothing so loud or obnoxious that you'd be annoyed.   It's that good balance of something different and special that's also casual and inviting that a lot of restaurants in this area tend to lack. Love that the menu has some photos and really helpful description for meat choices.  The house marinade is good!  The sides are also great.  Their KimChi is at a good balance in flavor.  Bite-y without the "every bite adds to heat" problem I've had at other places.   Sauces were excellent as well.   Beers were priced fairly. The Sushi was also above what I expected for a mixed-menu place, and the wait staff warned it may take a bit with on chef at the helm.  My Sushi was out in less than 10 minutes.  My other favorite sushi place is Tokyo Sushi III and I actually couldn't decided whose I liked better. I really have to echo the other reviews that say this on par with major city expectations. I'm actually trying to plan when I can go back sooner, and really, that's a first with a lot of West Hartford / New Britain places.  The prices are right, the food is delicious, and the service is great. I was charmed into Seoul from other reviews, and was ready to be disappointed.  Nope! Perfect.
