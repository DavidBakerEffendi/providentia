Take it from someone who has eaten food from Spain (especially Galicia) all of her life. This restaurant has great food! The taste, presentation, and portions are phenomenal. I have eaten and know all of the Spanish (from Spain and not Portugal) owners of Spanish restaurants and their prices are fairly close to Fornos but the food cannot compare! The service is impeccable! It is an expensive place but what do you expect from a restaurant that actually cooks great food. Places that are more expensive than Fornos will never have the quality of food that Fornos has. End of story. Like I have sad numerous of times before, if you are going to eat a typical food from Spain, like Paella, no where in America will have it authentic because of the ingredients that are grown and the water they are used. It goes the same with pulpo. Oh and another know fact about Spain, Galicia is known for the best waters for their healthy and delicious fish.
