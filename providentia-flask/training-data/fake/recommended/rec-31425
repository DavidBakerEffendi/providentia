I was born and raised in New Haven and I have visited a lot of restaurants in the downtown area. Zinc is easily the gem of the New Haven dining scene. I have eaten here nearly 10 times now and I have never been disappointed. Their ever-changing menu easily appeals to any taste. My personal favorite is the hangar steak, a menu staple. The market menu is a pre-fixe option that offers a three-course dinner made with local, in-season items. A well-stocked bar and talented bartenders round out this top quality restaurant .   The restaurant is very tastefully decorated, the ambience is louder than your typical upscale restaurant which makes it perfect for celebrations and large groups. Zinc's centralized location makes it the perfect springboard for a night out in New Haven. Located on the green, coffee shops, the theater, and any event at Yale are a short walk away.    If New Haven is your dinner destination, do yourself a favor and make a reservation at Zinc.
