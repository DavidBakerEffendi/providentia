I had never had Korean barbecue before so I was not sure exactly what to expect. We ordered two beef dishes, which come with fourteen side dishes. The beef was cooked at a grill in the center of our table. The staff was extremely helpful, explaining how we were supposed to go about eating our dishes and identifying all the sides for us. Staff frequently came by to see if we had any questions or needed any help. My boyfriend was thrilled to be able to grill his own food and they let him take over, but waitstaff came over to provide a clean grilling surface. The food was delicious and we had a wonderful time. We are already planning our next visit!
