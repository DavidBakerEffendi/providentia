A late-night godsend. Pommes Frites is open until 1AM on weekdays, and 3:30 on weekends, and is an amazing place to satiate your needs for late night savory goodness. As if in a great ice-cream shoppe, there is an array of sauces to choose from, and for those who are afraid to make the wrong decision, like myself, you can taste them before you buy them! Between myself, Martin H. and Neil K. (not on yelp) we devoured the largest portion of fries sold with two sauces: european ketchup and smoked eggplant mayo. The fries themselves are large and hearty. A good crispyness on the outside, but not to the point where it feels fake, and a perfect soft gooey potato filling inside. The smoked eggplant sauce was like babaganouj in a mayo dip, it's so perfectly seasoned. Pommes Frites is like a little European vignette, definitely worth visiting any time of the day, but I like it to be my savory night-cap.
