When each item on a menu only consists of a handful of ingredients and sometimes less, the quality and selection of those ingredients becomes most important. Without a true understanding of the sublteties of flavors (for example the difference in flavor between pecorino and parmesan), you may not fully appreciate how good this place really is. Regardless, this place is not to be walked past... you can't pick a bad panino to start with, so just give it a try! I promise you'll love it.
