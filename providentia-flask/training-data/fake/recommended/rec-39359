The best Greek restaurant I've ever been too. The food is always amazing. They have great service. When we weren't sure what was inside a dish, they explained everything in details. They also give you complimentary dessert (if you don't go too late) Recommendations: the octopus, lemon potatoes, stuffed shrimp, and the pita bread with various dipping sauce.
