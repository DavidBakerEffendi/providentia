We really had a really wonderful time here for a birthday dinner. My boyfriend had a ribeye (that came with some sides that made it a big plate) that he savored every bite of and I had a gluten free pizza that was way better than you would imagine, but not as much food as his steak! They even gave us a free dessert with a candle. The only gripe we had was the bread. It came cold. But we asked them to warm it up, they explained the only oven they had was for the gluten-free pizza so they couldn't warm it up without contaminating. Even so, my boyfriend said it was absolutely delicious. Only problem is, they didn't have any gluten free bread, so I watched him eat his bread and my slightly smaller meal left me a bit hungry. I'm sure if I had gotten the GF pasta I wouldn't have had that problem. Overall, highly recommended. Really great service and staff, friendly and accommodating! BYOB
