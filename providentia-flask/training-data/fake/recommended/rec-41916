This was always my favorite restaurant in the city, but on Valentine's Day I decided to bring my boyfriend here and we had the worst experience I have ever had. The food was great which almost made us forget about the awful service. We were seated and 15 minutes later our waitress opened and served our wine. We kept seeing her run back and forth to talk to other tables, even tables that sat after us, but not us. We ordered and got out appetizers. Thirty minutes later, our waitress told us they like to wait for some time before bringing out the entrees... which was obviously not true because people sitting right next to us- who came in after us- were already don't their entrees. When it came time for dessert they gave us a sampler of three different things (all of which weren't the options we heard verbalized to other tables) I believe they ran out of the regular desserts and just whipped up something for us. The waitress then asked if we wanted free shots of Sambuca, which we agreed to, and then she did one too? We thought this was really unprofessional and may have been why she was all over the place. I have to admit on a normal night the prix fix is an amazing deal! $35 per person! But this night turned me off from Modo Mio, and I don't think I will ever go back.
