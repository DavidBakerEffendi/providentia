My daughter and I are enjoyin a mother daughter evening in Philly. With Â a taste for Indian food we decided to give Karma a try. For starters we started off with the Fish Pakora. Yummy!! I had the Bombay Breeze which was actually watered down as a cocktail. For the main course I ordered Seekh Kabob and my daughter ordered the Tandoori Chicken. Delicious!! It came to us on steaming plates. For dessert we had Gulab Jamun. Yummy cheese balls warmed in a honeyed syrup. Beautiful ambiance and great service!!!!
