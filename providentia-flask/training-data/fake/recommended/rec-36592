After reading the good reviews of this place and a "where should we go for dinner" moment, we decided to hit this place up after work last Thursday.  We got there around 6:30 and were seated immediately. I guess I hadn't read about the decor or skimmed over those parts of reviews, but it's definitely cool in there.  We sat in a booth that was kind of in an alcove, interesting. Anyways, food was good. Not the best I've ever had, but decent.  I had the Thai mango blackened fish although I really wanted the drunken noodles (as that's what I usually order at thai restaurants). Wine was a bit expensive ($8-12/glass) I thought given the prices of the food ($10-15 entrees), but not outrageous.
