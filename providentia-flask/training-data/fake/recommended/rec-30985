I recently started riding my bike again to get over the chronic depression I've been going through after my impending divorce with my wife and separation from my twin sons. I am not blaming them. I was really distant emotionally and struggled to not define myself via my career (I'm an actuary). I wish I could have taken back a lot of things I said but, more importantly, I wish I could have said a lot more than I did. Came here after a bike ride on Kelly Drive. SO beautiful -- right by the river, great wine list, pizza (MMMM), service. I would recommend In Riva to any resident of Philadelphia who is self-evaluating their life after he realizes he sabotaged a 14-year marriage and hid behind his career rather than to commit to his family.
