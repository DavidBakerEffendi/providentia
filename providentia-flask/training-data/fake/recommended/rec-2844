4+ stars for my first Spot Burger, the Charlie Brown.  Burger, Fried onions, Bacon, Whiz on what appears to be a potato roll.  VERY good burger, easily the BEST burger I have ever eaten from a truck, but I have not eaten burgers from many trucks in my time...be that as it may, this burger will stand up to any brick and mortar burger and is better then any chain burger I've ever had...Five Guys, Elevation Burger, Jake's Wayback, and even Cheeburger Cheeburger...SPOT burgers are ground sirloin, not chuck, and you can really taste the difference.  I actually wanted a cheesteak, because they do slice their own steaks, but they sold out by time I got there.   Walk up to the cart and there should be one or 2 order takers on hand...Give them your order, your money, and sit back and wait...Prices are pretty good btw, 7$ seems fair for a burger of this quality\quantity.  Beverages are 2$. Overall, given the quality of the burger and the price, I'd say they deserve 5 stars.  The reason I did NOT give them 5 stars is due to the long wait for food!  This is not a food truck, but a cart.  There is room for one small person inside and one small grill which looks like it can hold about 8-10 burgers at a time...which is fine if you only have 8-10 customers, but when you have a long line with 30+ people and more coming the wait times become almost unbearable.  Some people waited over an hour to get their lunch today...I waited till they were all gone(literally placed the last order of the day) and my order was done in about 10 minutes, however they had also ran out of cheesteaks by this time.   I wish there was something that could be done to speed this up!  A second grill?  A second cart?  Hopefully they do well and can upgrade the cart to a truck and turn the tables over faster!  That is my only beef with this burger truck, the burgers are outstanding and worth the wait, if you have the time!
