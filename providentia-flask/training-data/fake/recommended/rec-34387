I came here on my mission to find the best pizza across the country so waited an hour and a half because of the wait for this pizza but I was not disappointed! They have very nice employees and an amazing pizza with a crust that goes through a three day process, first rising, second put into balls, and last being refrigerated. This process is totally worth it because that crust was heavenly next to the homemade fresh mozzarella and the tasty tomato sauce made in a 999 degree, 6000 pound wood fired oven that makes the pizza in 90 seconds. I got a tour of the room where they make the fresh ingredients by the owners of the restaurant after a delicious free Nutella calzone dessert, and I will come back next time I can!
