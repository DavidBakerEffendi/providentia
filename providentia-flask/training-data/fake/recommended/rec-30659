Was in NYC for less than 48 hours and determined to eat pizza at least twice. Lombardi's hit the spot - perfectly crispy, charred crust, with a delicious and appropriate amount of sweet San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil. The other half of the pizza had pancetta and wild mushrooms, but I have to say the Lombardi's classic is the BOMB!!! Will be back....
