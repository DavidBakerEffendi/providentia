I almost wish I didn't discover this place- because boxed pasta will never be the same. We found out during a walk in Little Italy (aka trying to walk off a Paesano's food coma) and realized we had nothing planned for dinner. The refrigerated section was a carb/pasta lover's dream come true- multiple varieties of different pastas, recommendations for sauces to go with said pastas, and Italian dinner specialties that are already premade. After a few minutes of discussing what we should get, we noticed a sign that for $24 you can get two packages of the lobster ravioli and a sauce of your choice. As we were walking towards the counter to pay, we also grabbed a loaf of fresh bread. All I can say is wow- the pasta was fresh, the sauce was amazing (go with the Rosa sauce - you will not be disappointed) Â and fed us for 2 meals. Each package came with either 16 or 20 ravioli- a hearty portion per package compared to going out to a restaurant and getting 4-5 lobster raviolis for $20 and you could taste the lobster in each bite. They had a ton of gnocchi varieties there as well which I can't wait to go back and try. If you happen to be walking around the Italian Market area definitely stop in- and if your not in the area, find an excuse to go .
