The Spaghetti alla Carbonara is the best pasta dish I've ever had. I like simple, but delicious, things, and this dish is to die for. From the menu: "Pasta tossed in a sheared egg, crispy pancetta, cracked black pepper & Parmigiano." The sauce is delicious, and the perfect amount of it is tossed on the pasta. The cracked black pepper on top is the perfect complement to the cheese and egg. And the pancetta isn't heavy-handed, just dices of it in the sauce itself to add great flavor. Try it!
