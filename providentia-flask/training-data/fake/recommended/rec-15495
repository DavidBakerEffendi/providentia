This is not my first time at umami or this location but the special truffle menu made me have to write a review. I generally don't like onion and I would go as far as picking out tiny chopped onion bits if I have to. The only place I would gladly eat my onions is umami! The Truffle Royale burger which only costs a few bucks more than the regular truffle burger, has port onions, truffled shiitake mushrooms and truffle cheese and took umami to a whole new level. The sweet port onion and the salty and savory truffled cheese and tender mushroom made the angels sing while I was eating every bite. I really hope this burger stays on the menu because I think I can't go back to any of the burgers on the menu. Please please please keep this on the menu or at least make sure I can order it any time! If you love the truffle burger on the regular menu, you will LOVE the Truffle Royale without a doubt! Must try!
