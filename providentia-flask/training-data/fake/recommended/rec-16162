We stopped by for Sunday brunch. The wait was about 40 minutes but in my opinion it was worth it. I ordered the nutella french toast and my fiance ordered the farmer's omelet. Â The food came out quickly and the portions were excellent. My french toast had the perfect amount of nutella it was inside of the bread and not overwhelming at all. The fresh fruit on the side complimented it well. But the best part of our meal was the apple cider mimosa's. It was a fun twist to the traditional orange juice preparation. Don't pass it up. Another note we've been here twice and both times their credit card machine has been broken. I'm thinking they are just discouraging them and it probably works. Bring cash along just in case.
