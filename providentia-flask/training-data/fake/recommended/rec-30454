I absolutely love the Japanese desserts. My favorites are: Zenzai (matcha green tea with mochi, red bean paste, chestnut, and sake ice cream) black sesame creme brulee GREEN TEA ROLL CAKE is my absolute favorite. It always runs out when you go there like later at night, so if you want to get it, go a little earlier. Despite how delicious the desserts are, the wait is pretty long, usually from 30-50 minutes. However, they accept reservations on Thursdays, so that's something you can do. Oh and they only accept cash.
