Native Brooklynite here.  Nobody, I mean NOBODY makes a pizzaiola anywhere remotely close to DeFonte's.  I won't eat a meatball parm from anywhere else. Turkey, ham, shrimp, eggplant, broccoli rabe..... You just can't go wrong.  DAMN!!!  It's incredible. Been coming here for 28 years and still as amazing as ever.
