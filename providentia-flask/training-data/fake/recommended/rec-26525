Just opened yesterday (3/19/14). Not bad for their first day. Friendly staff and great service. Happened to dine here while in town for a conference. The bar & dining area is cool and the menu pricing isn't bad. Minus one star due to the soda being flat and staff not knowing the correct dinner time. Was told 5pm when it was 5:30pm. Kind of annoying when you're hungry and don't want to wait 30 mins.
