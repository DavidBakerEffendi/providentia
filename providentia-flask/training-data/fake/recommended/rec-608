I came here to celebrate my birthday and was absolutely blown away the level of service and attention provided to me and my group. The owner not only provided free sangria for the table, he also ensured that the birthday people had a flamenco lesson with the dancers! The food was quite good as well - generous sized portions that were reasonably priced. Some dishes were better than others - the choriza a la sidra was delicious, the tortilla espanola should be skipped. Overall, a wonderful birthday celebration and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others given the level of service provided.
