I don't understand the many 4 and 5-star ratings associated with Balthazar.  I have lived in the city for years, but I always assumed that without a reservation, Balthazar would have an impossible wait for Sunday brunch.  Much to our delight, my boyfriend and I were promptly seated at 11:30 am.  Our delight ended there. First, we saw the prices.  Yes, yes, we should have looked first, but we figured that if the food was delicious, then the price wouldn't matter so much. Second, when I received my food, I felt like a fool.  I ordered the French Toast for $19.50.  What I got was two slices of dry brioche and some limp, bland bacon.  That's $10 for each slice of toast!  Like I mentioned earlier, if it was delicious, then cost wouldn't be an option.  However, it was meh.  Insultingly forgettable.  My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  It was also meh. If you want a scene (or if you want to pay too much for forgettable food and to be surrounded by tourists), then go to Balthazar.  If you want solid brunch fare, then go to one of a number of other great places that this city has to offer (westville, grey dog, clinton st baking co, good, cafe cluny...for french toast, I should have checked out nearby jane, where I haven't been in years, but whose toast left a fond mark on my memory). I assure you that I'm not a grouch; in fact, I am just a shocked patron, willing to see past the pretension that is Balthazar.
