Without a doubt, the best deli in NJ. No exhaggeration. Its great in all areas, but what puts it over the top is the bread. Without a doubt, the bread they use is the best bread any deli uses by far. Their hot meals, special order sandwiches are skillfully prepared and served. Frank is also a great store owner. its always months in between my visits because i don't work in the area anymore, but i salivate whenever i have an opportunity to drive through. Their chicken cutlets are not dry, also.
