This place rocks. Just be prepared to wait for your table. Hey, it's a byo family-joint, so enjoy both! Some observations that may be helpful: Be sure to ask what salad specials they may have, they are very well conceived/executed/fresh. They are pretty cool about bringing in things they don't serve for children such as milk and butter (my kids love butter on the crust, as do my wife and I). Explore variations on all pizza they offer. One of our favorites is a no tomato pie with basil and garlic. The service is, in my opinion, excellent. Of course some servers are more experienced but that is true of all restaurants. I have never come across server one at delorentzos that didn't care about what he was doing. it's a byo family-joint, my friend, you know what to do!
