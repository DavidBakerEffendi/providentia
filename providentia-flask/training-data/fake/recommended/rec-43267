This is the poor cousin in the Momo Terra family. For those who missed the history class, the Terra Momo group owns 4 businesses in this area Mediterra being the well off cousin and Eno Terra being the rich rocker. The not so newly acquired bakery is the 4th business but we shall resist labeling it. That digression behind us now, Teresa's does not fail to impress and nicely fills in the spot for that quick Italian lunch with ample offerings of pasta and pizza and a wide flavor gamut to satisfy the discerning palate. Their brunch on weekends lists quite a few selections of egg dishes and lends itself as a strong alternative to the popular PJs pancake house. Go there for a quick lunch or when you have kids in tow and keep them in mind for that weekend brunch!
