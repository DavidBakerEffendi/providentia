OK... I love me some fried chicken.  And absolutely NO KFC here.  I mean to me KFC is fried chicken mediocrity!!   I prefer venturing all over to the small independent fried chicken joints so I can sample em' all!  I have had spicy, crispy, peanut coated lol I mean everything!! Chicken Shack in Newark locks it DOWNNN!!  And it is oh so good to my dolla dolla.  Please I hope no one is waiting for me to say how healthy and UNgreasy the food was because that isn't going to happen. The chicken is juicy as heck, and the batter which is seasoned to perfection makes it so crunchy.  It has maybe a little cayenne in there because I can taste a little heat on the end.  I know, what good is awesome chicken @ a chicken shack without a slammin biscuit right?  Don't worry, they got you! I recommend this Chicken Shack first and especially if you got beered and need something to absorb it!  It's only about  a15 minute drive from my area and I definitely do not suggest any type of stroll around the neighborHOOD. Enjoy!
