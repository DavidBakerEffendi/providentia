Lobster ain't my thing, but I would say that I did enjoy the lobster roll from Red Hook Lobster Pound. For about $17, I got it Maine style, which meant it was served cold. You get a ton of lobster meat. However, I was a bit disappointed that my roll came out very sloppy. I think they might have put too much sauce or gotten too much of the lobster juices, so my bun was falling apart, and I had to eat the bun and lobster meat separately, while my friends enjoyed theirs whole. I definitely prefer Red Hook's lobster rolls over Luke's because I find Luke's to be too rich. Red Hook has the perfect amount of richness to it, which made eating it refreshing (although you may still find your cholesterol through the roof after downing one). I liked how they garnish it with the green onions. It gave it the extra oomph that a lobster roll needs. I probably won't eat another lobster roll again. For $17, I think I would rather get something else, and lobster rolls are something I do not crave. But if you're a lobster fan, Red Hook is the perfect place to get your fix.
