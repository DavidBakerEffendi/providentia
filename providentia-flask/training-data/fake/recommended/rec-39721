I came to Philly for a cheesesteak. Ok, I came to Philly as a stop by way of a roadtrip back up to MA. Regardless, once there, I wanted a cheesesteak. I have read that this is the best cheesesteak in Philly. I sure hope not, or else I can stick to the ones in Boston and say 'Oi boyo, sure as sauce the same as Philly!' There is nothing special about the grinders here (yes, grinders, I said it). Steak, cheese, some banana peppers. Street carts make these by the plenty, and Cosmi's advertises how in days of yore they were the best cheesesteak in Philly. The staff are nice, helpful and patient (a much needed quality in this small reticle of a brick and mortar). But if looking for a cheesesteak, leg it elsewheres and try yer hand.
