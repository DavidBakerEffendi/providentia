I never give two star reviews but this one does merit it.  The place was "dead as a door nail" as my mom would say and we were seated within a minute or two.  It took forever for someone to come over and take our drink orders.  Probably 10 minutes.  There were only two other tables with diners at them so that was a long wait.  Another 10 minutes to get our beers.  The waitress was really nice though and she eagerly supported most of our orders with personal enthusiasm.  I had the...doh, I can't remember the name of the burger.  It was the classic (or something like that).  It had lettuce, tomatoes, country fried bacon, goooood pickles and a special sauce.  It was very tasty.  The top of the burger bun however was too small though and it all sort of fell apart.  My companions had the cheese (special) burger, another classic sans bacon and the mac and cheese with short ribs.  Everyone enjoyed their food though we all thought our burgers (ordered medium to medium well) were a little overdone). The mac and cheese was declared "not cheesy enough, pasta cooked perfectly, short ribs: good").  The duck fat fries were declared "no different than the others" and I did think the regular fries were tasty albeit limp.  Beers were cold, large and adequately priced (but it would've been a whole lot cooler if they were cheaper...just sayin').  The beer selection is decent (i.e. perfect for me...the average beer drinker). So all in all, not bad but the service could be improved greatly.  If the place was jamming I'd have forgiven the wait but it wasn't.
