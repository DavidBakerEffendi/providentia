Today is probably the last time I will visit the cupcake truck for principle's sake. I wanted to buy 2 cupcakes for 2 separate coworker's birthdays. I asked the man at the truck (who doesnt wear gloves by the way and handles the money) for separate containers. He said "that's $6." I said no, 2 cupcakes are $5 to which he replied "if you want separate containers, it's $1 more." Um really? You think you come to Yale and we're not smart enough to see that you're conning us into buying 2 cupcakes? Also, for those of us who have visited the Sugar storefront in East Haven long before Cupcake Wars--you will notice that the size of the Â cupcake has considerably shrunk. I'm moving on and I suggest you do the same,
