I had lunch at Room Service with a co-worker and really enjoyed it. They have great lunch specials - a lot of food but I'd say more quality rather than quantity. That is good for me. I'd rather have one good app instead of two mediocre ones. We both had the vegetable dumpling starter, it was a little unevenly heated but tasted great. I think it had spinach, peas, carrots, and corn maybe? Odd but tasted good. I ordered the pad thai with shrimp and veggies and it was great. It had a nice amount of veggies and it was flavorful yet not spicy at all. I would ask for it to be made spicy next time, I am a spice head. The atmosphere is a little cheesy in my personal opinion but nice and the service is efficient. I will definitely be back.
