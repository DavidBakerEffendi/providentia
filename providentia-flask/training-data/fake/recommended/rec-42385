We were staying in the Ludlow area from out of town and found ourselves at the Pizza Stone. After trudging through mediocre reviews of other places in the area (and landing on basically only this place that offered vegetarian options) our low expectations were pleasantly met with a fantastic experience. We ordered the starter with mozzarella, basil, and capers and then the VT homegrown pizza. My husband and I could honestly say that it was the best pizza we've ever had. Waitstaff was good, food came out timely. The atmosphere was also great with live local music! Going back again tonight.
