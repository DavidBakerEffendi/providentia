Oh was there a pleasant surprise waiting for me at Katsu-Hama. I never knew katsu could taste so good until today. It just about blew my mind. Â From all the other reviews i don't even need to explain how it tastes and what not. All i need to say is if i could, i would pay the owner so that i could buy his/her recipe & workers and bring them to the west coast so i could eventually create a kastu empire!! well and of course being able to eat it day in and day out. If anyone is ever visiting Manhattan, you have to try this or else you're missing out.
