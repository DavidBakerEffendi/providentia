Ok I don't know how many stars to actually give this place. :( I want to give it 4 stars but I just don't think it earned 4 stars. Well 3 stars doesn't do it justice either. And I hate to be an in-between kind of person. Well lets just focus on the food and place. You can easily by pass this place thinking its another St. Mark's Place hole in the wall. And it is just that. But its a magnificent hole in the wall. In fact I wouldn't have known about it if my brother didn't tell me about it. The place is a cute wooden cabin like place that reminds me of Europe. Ordering is simple, just tell them what size and which sauces. Why? All they have are pomme frites (french fries). Their fries are wonderfully delicious. Definitely not your fast food or diner fries. They freshly fry them in front of you and season them with the right amount of salt. Its a wonderful production that happens before your very eyes. They have 26 sauces you can choose (but need to pay for) and a few free ones like ketchup and others. My brother recommended the sweet mango chutney mayo. So worth it! It had the right amount of sweetness but also a little spiciness! I don't want to give it a 5 star rating simply because I feel it is a bit over priced for french fries even in that area. My friend made a good point. To produce the french fries does not cost that much. None the less I will return every now and then because I will be craving freaking mango chutney sauce.
