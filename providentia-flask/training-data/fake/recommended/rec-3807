I really want to give 3 stars, but if the definition of 2 stars is "Meh I've experienced better" than 2 stars it is.  Presentation of the ramen was appetite enticing.  I had the Minca salt broth with garlic, now that was VERY tasty broth.  My friends had the shoyu broth, and theirs was too salty.  The chasu (pork) was delectably delicious, nice and tender and fatty.  But the point of ramen is the noodles, right? The sign said "ramen factory"  but why did it taste like our noodles were not housemade????  I had thin, which was recommended, one friend had the thick.  They both did not taste housemade.  They did not have that freshly made springy chewy texture that you come to expect with a good bowl of ramen.  In conclusion, if you're in NY and have a STRONG craving for ramen and you're in the neighborhood, then by all means.
