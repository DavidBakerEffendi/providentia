Went to the most famous corner for cheesesteaks and tried both of the options. Overall, they are both decent sandwiches but I feel like Geno's edged out Pat's. Pat's had better toppings and more cheese sauce, which I liked better, but the meat was just too chewy for me. The chewiness of the meat really took away from the combination of flavors and made it difficult to eat. As always, there was a bit of a line but they have the service down pat, so there is not too much of a wait.
