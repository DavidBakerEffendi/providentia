I have been going to Great NY Noodle Town for about 10 years. I bring all my out of town guests there for a taste of authentic Chinatown food. Food: I love everything I get there. Spicy Singapore Mai Fun is fantastic, the soft shell crabs are delicious and the roast duck is really great, too. Service: Well, you ain't gonna get service with a smile here but I think that is part of the charm. It is a bunch of older men who are kind of gruff but they are fast. Atmosphere: Also oddly charming in that it has absolutely no ambience. Like none, zero. Just badly lit, crappy cheap decorations. It's perfect.
