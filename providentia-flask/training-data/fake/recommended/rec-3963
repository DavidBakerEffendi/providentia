This is a great place to take a date. Why you might ask? I usually get a take out pizza here and then go down to the water front to eat it. Right after the pizza, the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory hits the desert spot. there is great scenery. But all in all, the pizza is fantabulous. Only problem I had was the being seated or waiting to take out is a bit of a wait.
