This place is absolutely as good as Italian food gets. Their pizza is probably the most underrated in the area. I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. I've tried chicken, veal, rabbit, and pasta dishes and they are consistently better than anywhere around. Even the free bread and salad are amazing. I now live in Hamden a few miles from New Haven and would rather come to Lisiano's over any of the great restaurants around. The owners are true authentic Italians that use quality ingredients, many of which are grown at the restaurant. I wish they had a better beer and wine selection but if they only served tap water for drinks I would still come here just as often for the amazing food.
