I expected more from the reviews. The food was incredibly delicious (I had the yummy but a bit heavy avocado gazpacho and the braised lamb) but the service was terrible. The waitress asked us what we wanted to eat just a minute after handing us the menus, so we asked for a couple minutes. Well, that turned into 25 minutes. Then after ordering it took 50 minutes for the food to come! When it came time to pay, the waitress was again nowhere to be found. I usually like to have a cocktail with latin food, but the place was only beer, wine and sangria. The white sangria wasn't good. Not enough alcohol and it had a nasty after taste. Mushy fruit. There is only one table in the back patio, and it's probably pretty romantic sitting out there. But inside where we were sitting, it was poorly decorated, verging on ugly. I felt silly making a reservation- it's a big place and was mostly empty. I guess you have to lower your expectations for decor and swankiness when you're in Brooklyn...
