I have always been satisfied with every meal I have ordered here. For a long time I always ordered the Tuscan Chicken sandwich which is awesome! i finally branched out and got the salmon and it was also great but I did think it was plain if you like that. I always start out with a small caesar salad because the dressing is great. I think this place is great for a group or picky family members because there is something for everyone and if not here is many options or build your own salad, pasta, or sandwich.
