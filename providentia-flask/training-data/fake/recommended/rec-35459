This place was awesome. We had the rigatoni, skate wing, Brussels sprouts, chef's risotto, spinach salad, and the cauliflower soup (special of the night) The owner was great and understandable as we had a restaruant.com coupon, but there were no instructions that we were unable to use on Fri and Saturday, and he took the coupon anyways.   I would definitely be back to this place.... Oh and as a special treat they gave us a little shot of the Irish Cream (that they make in house)  amazing...When they make bottles of this i will be back in to buy a couple!
