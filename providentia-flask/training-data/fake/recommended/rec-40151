I went here for the first time last week, after Eli Kulp overhauled the menu. It was sooooo good. The smell of the charcoal grill welcomes you when you enter the restaurant. I think the steak tartar was my favorite, but I also enjoyed the mussels, quail eggs and beets, and the clams. I'll definitely be going back soon!
