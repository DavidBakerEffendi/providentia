The food at De Mole is consistently fantastic.  Simple meals, well prepared with fresh ingredients.  Their house salad is large enough to share at the table with fresh greens, peppers, avocado and pepitas.  The spinach enchiladas with verdes sauce, the squash blossom and huitlacoche quesadillas are excellent.  Their brunch menu is also very good and the fresh fruit salad is large enough to share as a side with your juevos rancheros.  Really reasonably priced too.  Don't miss the orange flan for dessert.
