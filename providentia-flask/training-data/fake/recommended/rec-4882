I love this little upcoming block of South Street.  I am a definite fan of Jet, so it was only a matter of time before I made my way over to Rex.  I am from the south as was my dining companion, so we were excited about this new restaurant prospect.  We started with the crawfish pot pie and mac and cheese.  Both were quite enjoyable, but I really enjoyed the crawfish pot pie.  I opted for the seitan meatloaf.  I am very far from vegan or vegetarian, but was intrigued.  I enjoyed this as well, it is a good option for vegetarians or meat eaters alike.  The cocktail list is definitely a fun, festive addition to the experience as well!
