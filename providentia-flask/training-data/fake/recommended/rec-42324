Came here after wedding dress shopping with my mom and sis in law. It was quite a little treat for me. This little eatery was easy to find with plenty of seating inside as well as outside. Ok so the menu.... we actually came during brunch time. Of course there was your typical eggs and waffles but what really got me was they had a "Croque" section... can you say YUMMOOOO!!!!! I really really wanted to get the croque monsieur but I ended up getting their "Almond Hash" here's why....... DUCK CONFIT...... with DUCK CRACKLINGS yummy!!! But please give me more next time... It also came with 2 perfectly poached eggs. They gave us some homemade biscuits with preserves, butter and applesauce. They were small but very filling and buttery, just what I like. The atmosphere was great and the people were really nice. I hope I get a chance to come here again!
