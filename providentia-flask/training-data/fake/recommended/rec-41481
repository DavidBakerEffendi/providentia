Had: Tom Yum Soup $11 Satiation level: hella satiated Great stuff with a good presentation. Only wish the shrimp tempura didn't get soggy (inevitable if left in the soup). The chicken surprised me in a good way. It reminded me of boiled chicken from home. Flavor of the soup was great but near the end of my meal I felt the other ingredients were overpowering the soup. Given a bottle of water with which you can fill your cup with. Usually one of the waitresses will fill your cup. Staff was friendly and welcoming. If you want original Tom Yum soup then go elsewhere.
