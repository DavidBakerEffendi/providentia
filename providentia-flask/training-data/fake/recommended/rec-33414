My Prospect Heights friends RAVED about how great this place is.  I was expecting to be taken to the next level of screaming Mexican food-gasm abandon. Hummph. Don't get me wrong, it was good.  But - just good.  We got guacamole for the table and it was fine.  Not life-changing.   I ordered the Plato Don, and it was a lot of food!!  The grilled steak was really tasty, but the chipotle chicken was bland and watery.  The accompanying rice/beans/pico de gallo etc etc were all standard. It's a neat space, albeit cramped and crowded.  My chair was really rickety.  (OK now I'm nit-picking...lemme stop here) I would come again.  Its not a bad place.  I just don't think it lived up to the hype.
