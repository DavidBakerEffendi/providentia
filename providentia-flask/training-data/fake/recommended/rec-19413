I went to Buddakan for the first time last week and very much disliked the experience. The amount of decent to great reviews of this place is shocking to me. We had reservations for 8:15 and didn't get out of there until after 11, this was not by choice. The lighting was dim, too dark for me... the host had to escort us to the table with instructions on how not to trip on steps in the dark. We ordered a pitcher of Zengria which barely filled 5 small glasses half way. The pitcher was full of ice, so we really ordered Icegria. Needless to say, the drink was completely watered down. The waiter started to bring the food out slowly and with no rhyme or reason to how he was bringing it out. We realized when we asked if he could bring the appetizers and salads out first that all of the food is meant to be shared. The waiter explained, "Yeah, you ladies ordered a lot of food." Well, no shit we ordered a lot of food, we thought a salad and an entree was appropriate...apparently not. So, we finally told him to bring it all out. I had the duck salad, not sure where the duck was. Also, the salad was best described as backyard. The cashew chicken was as delightful as my local Chinese food takeout place. The rest of my friends food was OK. I'm glad the waiter finally brought out our bottle of wine after we finished. Delightful. We all had doggie bags to re-live the Buddakan experience at home.
