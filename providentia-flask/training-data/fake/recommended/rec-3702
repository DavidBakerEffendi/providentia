I really loved this place. You wait in line to get your food and drinks and then bring it to a food truck. The place was hopping at 5 on a saturday evening! I ordered the Guacamole & Queso sandwich, I think it is up there with the best sandwich I have ever eaten. The guac was so creamy and smooth, and the chipotle mayo gave just enough kick to it. My husband had the Cuban sandwich which he really liked. We also got the corn, so sweet and delicious. And I also got the Mango salad, wasnt toooo impressed I guess cos I loved my sandwich soooo much! We also got the Frozen Mojito, it was super sweet and I didn't think there was much liqor in it, but walking out of the place I did feel the effects of one! I would totally make the trip back to this place, great!!!!
