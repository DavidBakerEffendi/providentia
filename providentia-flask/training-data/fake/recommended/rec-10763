Horrendous treatment!  We went to celebrate a friend's birthday, were a group of 12.  After we ordered our overpriced, bland food and drinks, we paid the bill.  Before we got our credit cards back, the owner came running over to the table frantically telling us we had to vacate the table because others were waiting (despite the fact that we were still sitting because we hadn't finished paying). Despite better judgment, our group went downstairs to grab some drinks at the bar.  The other owner told us we were all cut off for being 'over-served' (most of us were drinking non-alcoholic beverages) and kicked us out. After spending over $1K at a restaurant, I would expect better treatment.  If you're in Red Hook, head to Hometown BBQ - much better food and great staff!!
