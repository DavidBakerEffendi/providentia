Happened upon the North End Bistro when jogging through the neighborhood with the roommate. The clientele was a mix of trendy well dressed couples, large family gatherings, and the typical preppy casual Princetonians. Even though we were clearly on the under-dressed spectrum, decided to grab a post-run bite and check out this new spot. Food: 3/5 (somewhat underwhelming) ***Blackened Chicken, avocado, cherry wood bacon, bleu cheese, bibb lettuce, parker house bun the only thing that was done well on the plate were the sweet potato fries. The chicken was on the dry side and had some mysterious herb flavor that was quite distracting. Theoretically the ingredients should have came together quite nicely. Sadly, no a-ha moment with this sandwich. ***charred brussels sprouts, goat cheese, cranberry almonds Brussel sprouts on the mushy side...perhaps steamed or boiled? no signs of charred here. Overall still very tasty. Venue: 4/5 (modern/bright) We settled on the comfortable outdoor patio area facing nassau street. Indoor area had a warm yellow/orange hue with cushy seats. Very clean/bright. Service: 1/5 (needs work) First 10 minutes of sitting down no attention from the wait staff. Only bright side was we had a basket of chips to much on. This was followed by plates, napkins, and utensils all arriving separately 3 to 5 minutes apart. Another 5 minutes go by...nothing. We attempted to flag down a waitress who appears to be somewhat distressed and confused and finally takes our order. We had to ask twice for water to be brought. Much improvement needed on the service end. Not sure if I should give up or grant this place one more try. Perhaps in another couple of months assuming food and service improves.
