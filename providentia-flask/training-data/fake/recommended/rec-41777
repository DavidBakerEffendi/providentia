I was in the mood for some tacos....so I found this place searching on Yelp. Great choice of tacos! Ordered mine to go, but while the wait had a 20oz frozen margarita...only $8! That crept up on me later on...lol went back inside and the cashier told me about 10 more minutes....so she gave a 12oz one on the house for the wait.. that made me a happy camper! By the time I got home to enjoy my tacos it felt like I spent all day at the bar! The tacos were great, good choice of toppings to accommodate the meat.I had the fried shrimp and a grilled chicken taco. Next I'll try the fried chicken. Their house made chips are excellent! Everything was just what I needed to end my night.
