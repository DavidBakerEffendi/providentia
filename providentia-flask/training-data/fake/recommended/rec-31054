Oyster heaven. Came here with a GF when she was in town. The food was so good I had the Shad and she went with the lobster roll-traditional style(cold),  the timing of the courses was perfect and what really can't be beat is the butterscotch pudding we had for dessert- HOLY CRAP was that amazing.  Should have gotten two :)  Will DEFINITELY be back.
