The tea options here are quite good, they do taste unique from one another. Came here during a rainy summer night and had tea and dessert. A friend got the mochii (which was dry but edible, did pair well with her choice of tea though) while I ordered the black seasame creme brulee (very good, highly recommended, though it didn't pair well with my choice of tea which was something with a hint of lemon taste). The place is a bit on the intimate side but can be a casual place. If anything, each person's teapot can be worked into a discussion since it seems there are different pots and cups for each person (keeps the flair fresh).
