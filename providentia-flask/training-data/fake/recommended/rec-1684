THIS PLACE SUCKS!  Looking at their current rating I can see I am not the only one with this sentiment.  Where to begin?   The sandwich itself is disgusting.  These huge chunks of chewy sinuey beef?? are covered in radio active orange cheese wiz on a weak piece of what seems to be grocery store bread.  The sandwich looks like what you would throw up after a proper cheese steak from anywhere else.  Which also makes me question why anyone needs to go to Philly.  Try Carls Steaks in NYC and save a 2 hour drive.  If you live in Philly, make the best of what you got. The staff is either burnt out or seriously think too much of themselves.  Just because you have a glowing orange cheesesteak sign on your building and people come there for cheesesteak does not make it a registered UNESCO site.  Get off yourselves.  There is this crazy line system that they have in place and if you don't place the order right they whine and complain like they have something better to do.  The best story I have is that after buying $25 in cheesesteaks from Geno's I wanted to use their hot sauce (also horrible; just pure heat, no flavor) on my Pat's cheesesteak as well as the Geno's.  I would understand if I just didn't spend money there and did this but I just spent $25!  Some roid rage ape behind the counter started screaming at me to not do it or i have to leave.  Real great customer service, NOT. Save yourself a case of the runs, leave this place off your bucket list. Hit up Pats or you can just take a ride to NYC...
