My son treated me to Bayou for lunch today. We had the chicken wings for appetizer which were delicious, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The blue cheese that comes along with it is homemade and amazing. Entrees were great and Creme Brule for dessert was delightful. Overall we had a really nice experience. Our waitress was attentive and very sweet.
