This is the second time that I've been here and I'm going to keep coming back cause I haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  The food is incredibly playful, mixing ingredients I would never imagine to pair together and it works really, really well.  I wish there was more vegetarian stuff for my friend, but the waiter made it possible to make some of the dishes vegetarian and still tasted great.  The service was knowledgable and nice.  Not stuffy at all.  The food seems like it should be in a stuffy restaurant, but it's in a comfortable wooden setting with friendly servers having a good time with you.  My only complaint was a lot of ice cream for dessert in the dead of winter.  Not interested in ice cream in the dead of winter.  Other than that, 5 stars, easy.
