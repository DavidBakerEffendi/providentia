After seeing so many 5 star reviews I was a little skeptical, and thought there must be some star inflation going on here. Nope - not a bit. This was one of the best meals I've had all year. The incredibly gracious & friendly service I received made the meal even more memorable. I had no idea what Chaat was, but the owner (Hassan I assume) gave me a brief tutorial and outlined my options. I couldn't believe that all of the ingredients he listed were going into my dish! I asked for chicken, and he created layers of salad, spices, mango, dates, sauces, cheese, and tasty crunchy bits. The medium spice level was perfect - and allowed me to enjoy all of the flavors. You can't go here without ordering a lassi as well. They are made fresh to order, and he has a ridiculous variety of flavors. I picked Rose, as it was my first visit and I'd never tried that before. My lassi was made of actual rose petals & was perfectly milky and sweet. After watching Hassan create my meal, I was pretty confident I was going to love it. But he insisted that I try it out before paying, and he mentioned a couple of times that he wouldn't ask me to pay for anything I didn't like. Ha! I doubt anybody has ever taken him up on that offer. It's a good thing I don't live near this place or else I'd probably be there all the time. I can't wait to go back and explore the menu!
