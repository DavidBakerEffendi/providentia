After walking by Il Bambino for the past few months, I decided to stop in for brunch. This will definitely be one of my regular go to places. Once we got there, the entire wait staff was friendly and the service was fast. We sat outside in the courtyard which was peaceful and relaxing. I had the Sweet Ass panini- proscuttio, taleggio cheese and fig spread. My boyfriend had the Piggy Got Back panini- scrambled eggs, olive spread, mozzarella and ham. Both were fantastic and huge! They also had fresh OJ that was perfect. Their wine list was impressive as was their cheese and meat list. We took half of our paninis home but were considering going back the next day it was so good. The roasted mushroom panini will change your life!
