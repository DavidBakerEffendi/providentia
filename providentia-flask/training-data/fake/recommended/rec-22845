Delicious Soup Dumplings, and around Princeton Junction, there are no other soup dumpling spots that compare! The other Chinese dishes however are a bit bland, so the 4-star instead of 5 is for that. I would say it'd be great to go for soup dumplings, but don't count on the other dishes to be stellar. Another annoyance: no splitting checks with credit card!!!
