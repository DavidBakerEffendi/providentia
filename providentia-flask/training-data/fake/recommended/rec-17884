Food is terrific.  I would guess that negative reviews of the food are from people that are used to sauces that are full of sugar, salt, etc... as opposed to the fresh herbs, spices and vegetables used here.  This does not taste like "pizzeria italian food" - it is far superior with house made pasta and sauces. The atmosphere and service are both terrific.  If you eat outdoors on the enclosed patio by the garden you will absolutely not belive that you are between Route 130 and Cranbury Road.
