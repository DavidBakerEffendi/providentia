WOW! When you see a line around the corner you know they're doing something right. Get a split sandwich, 1/2 pork w/broccoli rabe and 1/2 beef w/broccoli rabe. Simply delicious and each bite I wanted another. A great portion of beef and veggies. You can also get spinach greens instead of the rabe. In hindsight, I should have gotten 1/2 beef with spinach just to try it. I'm a foodie so I had to try the pork and beef. If I went back again, I'd get only pork 1/2 w/rabe 1/2 w/spinach. If you don't like sandwiches much, then go somewhere else.
