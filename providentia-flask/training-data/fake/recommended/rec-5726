We experienced great friendly service at Shanghai Bun, the waiter was very friendly, and he translated all of the specials for me with no irritations. I happen to like that the specials are written in Chinese with no translation, it adds a sense of cultural pride to the atmosphere by my POV. It also helped foster a relationship between me and the staff since this is what eating is about in other countries. The ambiance is very nice, and extremely clean despite all the action going on in the kitchen which was refreshing. I was also 1 of 3 white people in the restaurant and the place was full which is a very good thing!!! The tea they serve is outstanding as well!!! what you'll be served is a teapot with loose tea steeping in it.....Tea that's actually worth drinking!!! We started with Shrimp Shumai which was flavorful and really big....these are definitely hand made and outstanding. For soup we shared a bowl of Shanghai Wonton which was very fresh and tasty!!! it was loaded with delicious hand made dumplings seaweed and maybe bok choi.... We also had Â Zha Ziang Mian / Jajangmyeon which was amazingly tasty, very savory and spicy with lots of flavors. Lastly, we had Sour Spicy Chicken with Tree Ears which was awesome!!! chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious. Between the 2 of us we had some to take home and the bill was 30.00 bucks. All i can say is i can't wait to go back again!! Bummer it's sort of far for my from PA.
