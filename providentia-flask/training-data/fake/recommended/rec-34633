Was at times square and was way past the usual food serving time of most restaurants. But needed something good and heard a bit about this one. We tried it and it was great. The rolls were great, tasty, cheap and was served late night (went in after 12 AM) The best part of this place is it stays open till 5 AM in morning. The food was tasty and had no complaints on that. Tried the Chicken Unda roll and the Shami kebab roll. Both were awesome. Time to get them was like 5-10 minutes. Yes definitely I have had better tasting kati rolls in India, but this is US and you can't expect the same perfection and that too at this late! The best Indian Street food in NYC! Small place, got a few tables and chairs, but then street food joints are supposed to be small. They take orders on phone as well :) Cost is less too...you have all stuff under $8. You do get a lot of fast food stuff on Times Square, but those are mainly Mediterranean. This is the only Indian joint open this late near Times Square. Definitely worth trying again and again.
