I've been to the original Shake Shack in New York and this one in Philly is definitely more grand, with indoor seating and stainless steel everything. I only went for the shakes this time around and we were lucky to go when there was no line. However, for 2 milkshakes, we still had to wait 10 minutes for them to get made. I think that's a little ridiculous for a restaurant who's namesake is milkshakes. The shakes were delicious and creamy but not too heavy that you got super full from drinking it. For some reason though, I think the shakes in Philly were a bit more watery than the shakes in New York. Â I will go back for the burgers and update to see if they are just as good as the ones in New York.
