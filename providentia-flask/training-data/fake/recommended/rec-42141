This place has changed from a decent, reasonably priced Mexican tacqueria into quite possibly the worst Mexican restaurant in the city. They have replaced quality food with a WiFi speaker playing music way too loud and gratuitous servings of bad, unordered margarita pitchers (but apparently "on the house" even though we byo'd that bottle of tequila you took to the kitchen...thanks!). Thur to Sat the only option now is a $20/person family-style meal of dogsh*t taquitos, concession-stand quesadillas, and the most bland burritos I've ever eaten. Never again... Go to Veracruzana for superior food and environment. Happy Birthday Steve. Sorry your birthday dinner sucked, although Jon had fun.
