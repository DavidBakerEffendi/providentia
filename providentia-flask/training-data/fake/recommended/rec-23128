We've been coming here for the better part of 20 years, and tonight is the last time. We won't be back. I don't know what happened, but the menu is completely different, and kind of weird now. Not like a "diner" at all. The service, which used to be great, is sub par. Our waiter was very sassy, and seemed incompetent, didn't know certain basic things about the menu. They were also out of both beers that we wanted. The food, which has never been terrible before was not good. The matzo ball soup had the most flavorless matzo balls I've EVER had. And the broth had no flavor either. The chicken I had as an entree was interesting, and not in a great way. All I can say now is: "the end of an era. Goodbye Americana"
