My friends and I were trying to try a new place and we came across here. It wasn't crazy expensive like most Italian places, and it was genuinely filling. I had the gnocchi and it was absolutely amazing. Wholeheartedly recommend. There's rarely a wait, the food is tasty, the staff was polite, and the atmosphere was nice. Will be going back!
