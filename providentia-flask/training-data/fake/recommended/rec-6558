This place definitely met my high expectations especially after we waited in line for nearly an hour on a Saturday night.  I had a cheeseburger and the best part about it was possibly the way they toasted the bun, so that as you bit into the burger it was crunchy and then soft.  The fries were good but nothing to write home about, similar to McDonald's fries.   Another huge plus is the good beer selection at their low prices.  Beers on tap started at $2.50 and bottles were around $4.  If you're looking for a cheap eat in the area, I think you'll have a hard time beating this spot.
