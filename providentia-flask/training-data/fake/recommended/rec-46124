I give this place the HIDDEN GEM of the month(at least) award. Its been here for a long time..at least 15 years and probably longer...and i'm the first person to write a review! Right off exit 34 on I-91....you can't miss it. if delicious hot dogs,hamburgers,french fries,chicken wings are to your liking....you will thank me for recommending this spot. this certainly isn't a place Â to dine....mainly a place to eat in your car in the parking lot. They have some indoor tables and a few picnic tables outside.... it ain't fancy!! Hot dogs are quite good and are served on a grilled buttery bun. hamburgers the same..served very hot and delicious. french fries crisp and well done....help here are very efficient...no screw ups on orders no matter how busy they get. prices very affordable...seem stuck in a 1980-1990 time warp. You don't linger long here....in and out quickly for some delicious(OK maybe a little greasy) American comfort food. highly recommended.
