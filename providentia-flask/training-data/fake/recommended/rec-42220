Went there tonight with 3 other people.  Food was excellent and so was the service.  We had Salmon, grilled chicken and steak.  All were excellent.  Appetizers and desserts were great.  Everything was great all around.  Have to rave about the waiter.  He made you feel so comfortable.  For sure we will be going back.  You won't be disappointed.
