This place is much cozier than I expected. Today's weather was nice, but the four of us opted to sit inside as the sun was too much for our hangovers. We sat in a room off to the side, pleasant and just dark enough, and there were large windows open to the breeze, which felt nice. Our poor waiter. Every time he asked (terribly difficult) questions such as, "What can I get you to drink?" or, "Did you decide on food yet?" he was met with a chorus of "Huhh.. mmm?" (again, the hangovers). He was cool and friendly though, laughed at us, and waited patiently. Three of us had the huevos rancheros, which was very satisfying. In retrospect, it was a senseless thing to order at place with a Middle Eastern flair, but I guess we can't resist the Mexican grub. When we asked for hot sauce, we got ramekins full of some yummy homemade-looking hot salsa with an actual kick to it. I also liked that the dish came with a fresh side-salad with a tasty mustard-y dressing. The potatoes had excellent flavor but could have been far crispier. The fourth member of our party got a bagel & eggs, and judging by sight alone, I would say stay far away from the bagels. I didn't try it though. There are tons of options here for the vegetarians, which I like. The best thing I tasted here was the coffee. If you order a cup you will receive an incredibly hot and delicious Americano. It seems they will take FOREVER to deliver it to you, but it's worth it. By the time we left, newcomers were in for a long wait. I will be back next time I can make it early enough to miss the brunch rush. It's a perfect atmosphere to gently ease yourself back to reality after an awesome weekend night, over yummy, affordable noms and perfect coffee.
