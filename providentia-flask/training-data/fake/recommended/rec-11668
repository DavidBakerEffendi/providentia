the food is good, and i've gotten brunch there a ton of times but I have been turned away for dinner 3 days in a row and I live one building down. The man on the phone suggested I try making a reservation for 3 on a tuesday TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE? I don't know who this place is trying to cater to if they are that rude to people who live on their street. They mentioned "seating" times and told us it would be a 2 hour wait but the kitchen would be closed by then. Just lovely. Gives me little reason to spend my money there when there are several places like this downtown that actually welcome their customers instead of push them away. Oh! Also, all three nights when asked if we could just order take away we were told "no". Pretentious, obnoxious and rude. It's worth the walk to Goat Town.
