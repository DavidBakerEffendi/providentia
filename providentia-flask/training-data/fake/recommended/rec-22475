Unlike most of the reviewers, I wasn't disappointed with the food. Though I would have preferred homemade soft pretzels rather than the frozen kind, the dips in the app were delicious. I had the knackwurst and it was good. The beer selection was ample, but being lunch time, I didn't get to sample much of it.
