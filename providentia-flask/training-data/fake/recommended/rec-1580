How the hell have I not written a review for 53rd & 6th...this place is my life line I've been eating at this cart for years. I dont care what time of night it is, the weather, how long the line is. I'm innn thereee. Its the best Halal in the city. Halal elsewhere just doesnt compare. I've gladly introduce this cart to a few people and I feel like I've changed their lives forever lmao. Beware of the little containers of hot sauce, a little goes a long way. This is the ultimate 4-5 in the morning post-clubbing meal. Eat it.
