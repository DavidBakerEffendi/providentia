Excellent food! I ways order off the specials menu here and it's always exquisite. However, I went on valentines day with a reservation and the owners had added possibly double the amount of tables. It was so cramped, my chair backed up against someone else's and I was crammed against the table. My date had to move every time someone walked by and the service that day was slow. Overall this place is great but don't go on a holiday!!!!!
