Great spot for beer guru's, see the pictures for an idea of their beer list, it is awesome. I didn't have any food so no comment there and they were out of one or two beers we requested. It didn't hurt that my new friend who I had just meet at Farmacia was a Belgian ex-pat on business for a week and I happened to be on the hunt for a Belgian style pub. What Luck!!!
