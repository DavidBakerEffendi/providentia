The person who recommended this place said it right - it's a place that you should go if you're in the neighborhood but it isn't so good that you have to come down to East Village to eat it. The fries were really well cooked - crispy on the outside but still some softness inside. We got the mango chutney and then the house sauce along with onions/jalapenos with one order. It was enough to fill my cousin and me up - it was a solid midafternoon snack/appetizer amount. We were lucky enough to grab a seat but there is severely limited seating, so people should plan on taking it to go.
