A good friend invited me to Flyers game last night. He suggested C&P for pregame meal and i thought great idea as fries at CBP always good. Ok I'll admit I'm a bit of a foodie. My motto is pretty much "Life is too short to eat bad food". I liked everything about C&P except what I ordered. Crowd was good, beer was good and waitress was doing a great job in a very crowded pre game condition. I ordered the Chicken Italian. Chicken, cheese and red peppers. Roll was great. The rest was an indescernable mess. Piles of gooey tasteless cheese on top of tasteless chicken with the thinnest of roasted reds on top. $7 I believe. I did get the sweet potato crab fries and they were outstanding. So I guess I ordered the wrong sandwich but that should be a pretty easy sandwich to do much better than that. Meat to bread ratio wrong.Either more meat or less bread. Need better grade cheese and not a gooey slop. More and bigger roasted reds. I'm not trying to be a jackass, and perhaps other dishes were much better than mine but that was perhaps the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had
