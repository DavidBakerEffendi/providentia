It was a full house on a random weekday at 9:15. (Is it just me or does every night seem to be a weekend evening here in NYC?) The place was full of energy and chic with patrons dressed up in suits and dresses. Such a different vibe from what I'm used to back home in San Francisco. In such a fashion conscious city, many people really do change out of work clothes to go out for dinner. We started off with crackers and a strained yogurt spread. As simple as this spread was it kinda blew my mind and we asked to keep it when they tried to clear empty plates before our dishes stated trickling in. We ordered a Hommus (i spell it hummus) and added pine nuts. The pita bread that accompanied it was amazingly fresh, fluffy and served hot! We used it to dip into that yogurt spread we asked to save. The hummus itself was pretty standard and in my opinion had a bit too much olive oil on top. I had the Farro Risotto with winter vegetables, parmesan and a carrot crisp which was quite delicious. It almost had too much risotto and not enough veggies if you ask me. Along with it a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Husband had the Chicken Shish Taouk with marinated chicken breast, crispy chicken skin garlic whip and sumac onions. He finished it up in no time. He had this with a glass of Cabernet. It was interesting watching everyone get smashed around us. This one man was barely able to walk and he looked like he needed help as he stumbled out. It's so fun to people watch out here.
