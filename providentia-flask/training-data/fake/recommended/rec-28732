Totally impressed!!! So awesome!!! A relatively fast, nicely design atmosphere, spacious restaurant that serves  gluten free, dairy free, and organic, non GMO options. Amazing!  Likewise, its awesome if you are on a Paleo diet, Blood Type diet etc and want great, healthy and organic food. As others mentioned, my experience with the staff was really great. The owner was super cool and, while not overbearing, introduced himself and we talked a bit about the restaurant, the food. He and his staff felt genuinely welcoming, accommodating and dedicated to bringing quality food to NY. I love the various aspects on the menu like that they have non grain muffins and stuff sweetened naturally. They also had things like biscuits made with coconut flour on a paleo-friendly bacon and egg sandwich. Coconut milk to go in your coffee is a nice option too. I haven't tried the smoothies or stir fries, but looking forward to going back. On the subject of the prices, while I always welcome less expensive food, but I understand that the price of organics and the quality that they bring is not cheap. That is not necessarily the fault of the restaurant, but more due to the upside-down, corporate run food system we have in this country where processed, unhealthy food is cheap and you pay a premium for simple, whole foods. I am one who succumbs to the price of healthy food and if you work long hours like most NYers and cant cook at home and you prioritize health over other things in your life, this is a great option. All in all, really happy to have this place as an option!
