I think I've found my favorite place in NYC! We had no reservations and decided at the last minute to attempt to get a seat for dinner. I was already in the area so I just popped in to put my name on the list, knowing that my sister would get off work in about half an hour. The hostesses were extremely nice and didn't make me feel like a peasant for daring to think I could have dinner here without a reservation. They said to just let them know when the whole party was there and that they would take care of us. When everyone arrived, we were seated right away. Literally, my sisters boyfriend walked in, and the girl said, "right this way". Uh-mazing. As I perused the menu looking at all the mouth watering options, I swear a tear came to my eye. So many delicious items. There were 3 of us and we must have debated for half an hour all the possible combinations that would give us the most different flavors in one sitting. We decided on Moules Frites and Escargot as starters for the table. These 2 dishes could have easily been enough of a meal for 2 people, but we were feeling greedy! Both were perfect!! With each buttery garlicky bite I had visions of Paris dancing in my head. We had a magnum of wine that was about half my age and tons of bread to swipe up all the sauces. For our meal (as if that wasn't enough) the 3 of us shared the Cote de Boeuf for two. It came with some veggies and onion rings. Each of our plates had what look like piles of meat. It could have been Cote de Boeuf for five! We finished our meal off with a light sorbet which was a perfect way to cleanse the palette. The service was impeccable, the decor was enchanting and to my surprise, the bill was not outrageous. Not cheap, but not through the roof. I will be waiting with bated breath for my next meal at Balthazar! J'adore!
