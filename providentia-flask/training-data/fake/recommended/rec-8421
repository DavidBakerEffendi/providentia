Saw Gandhi Fine Indian Cuisine in Yelp while looking for something to eat around Flatbush.  Took a critical foody and his delightful wife and we all had a wonderful meal. I just asked the waitress / owner to choose for me and she got her husband to choose.  I am glad he did.  I got an order of Kachoori which was one of the best dishes we had; everyone really liked it.  Kat's vegetable samosas was one of the best I've ever tried.  The chicken Bhuna was tender and very flavorful.  The Roti, Garlic Naan, and aloo paratha were all very good.  Everything was excellent.   Disclosure:   I am a white guy but work with many Indian nationals, have visited India and have been allowed to eat Indian Hot spice so I've been around Indian food a few times.   This was one of the best Indian restaurants I've tried.  I have to take one of my direct reports and his wife to dinner in the foreseeable future and I wish this were located in Denver.  They do take out but I think that is out of their service area.  Damn! Anyway, the husband and wife are very pleasant.  They brought us dessert and offered us tea.  I was trying to get some shopping done (didn't get out in time) but we couldn't refuse the hospitality.   It was funny that as I was leaving, he did ask me to give him a review (on another website) which I laughed about and told him I had seen the place on Yelp.  He knew about it too which was good for a little old guy running a restaurant in Brooklyn.  Must have some techie clientele but regardless, he is a Restaurateur in the finest meaning of the word.   As Jamie the foody noted, they cook their dishes with love.  Boy, does that taste good!
