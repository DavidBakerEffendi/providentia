One of the best burgers in NY. I would give five stars if I never had to wait in line, but this is not a world fashioned around me. IT SHOULD BE! All kidding aside, this burger is really tasty. The bacon is always plentiful, and that's a huge test for me. The beers here are great. It's a little pricy for a burger and there's always a line, but what do you expect for a place as popular as this?
