Ohhhhh...So that's what a heart attack feels like. Finally got 53rd and 6th Halal for the very first time yesterday afternoon because I had to return something at Niketown nearby. I instantly got food coma right after taking my last bite of Chicken Over Rice w/ Hot Sauce and White Sauce. Geez, is that yellow rice legal? That shit was the devil with the wonderful grease and buttery taste. I'mma call you "Damien Rice". Yeah, you're related to Satan.
