Awesome breakfast sandwiches! I usually get a pork roll egg and cheese on an English muffin, with a hash brown on the side. Once they put the hash brown in the sandwich, which was also delish! They serve lunch and I've been meaning to check it out. One thing to note, though -- they are a little on the expensive side. We spend the same amount on two breakfasts sandwiches that we spent on two full breakfasts (pancakes, eggs, hash browns, toast) at our old breakfast haunt in PA. Maybe that's a PA/NJ thing, though? Regardless, it's a good breakfast place!
