I review mainly on quality of food with the other stuff: service, ambience only skewing up or down half a star.  I've eaten at LIC Market twice (both times takeout).  The first time I had the chicken salad sandwich on bread so hard i could barely get through it.  Not cool.  Today, I had prawn salad which was creative and tasty with two huge prawns.  So the food ranges from mediocre to pretty good.  What skewed this rating down to 3 is the weird vibe I've gotten both times I'm there.  There's no set place to stand and order...I don't know if they weren't expecting to have a big takeout crowd when they opened or what...but I find myself milling around kind of hoping someone will help me.  And they don't really make it clear if you're supposed to pay when you order or when you get your food.  I guess I like lunch places with a little more snap and organization.  The restaurant is really cute though and I'm sure if you were sitting down to lunch it would be awesome.
