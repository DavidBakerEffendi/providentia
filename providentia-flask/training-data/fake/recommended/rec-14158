This was one of the best burgers I have had in New York.  The patty was HUGE, which I usually don't like, but for some reason it was so juicy and well made that it didn't feel overwhelming.  Nothing special to be said about the bun or the cheese (which was not very well melted on), but the bacon was really delicious.  This is one of the few (if not the only) burgers where I'd actually recommend getting the bacon.  The fries it came with weren't worth it.  Also, for some reason my burger completely fell apart.  I mean, half the patty broke off and the buns didn't do much keeping the rest of it together.  So the fact that I enjoyed my burger while it was falling apart around me means it was really good. The place itself is fairly small and really crowded.  The servers were not friendly at all, ignoring us while we waited to be seated, barely giving us a nod while seating us, and then doing as little interaction as possible when serving us.  We also heard them complaining about the "water drinkers" and how they should be ignored.  It's the usual curse of the delicious bar/food place.  They know people are coming for the food and not the service, so they treat you horribly.
