I went here with a large group of people on a Wednesday Night. It was nice cause there wasn't a lot of people there.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, especially if you are a party of four or less because they have those U-shaped booths, I love those.  When I'm sitting in them I just want to drink martinis and say, "Play it again Sam."  To unsuspecting strangers.  As far as the food goes, the calamari was solid, and I really liked the bread.  I ordered the gnocchi and it was sub par.  Desert was amazing though.  I had chocolate mouse cake.  That was something special.  My cousin ordered the cream puff and that was delicious as well. Service is friendly and the girls that work here are adorable.
