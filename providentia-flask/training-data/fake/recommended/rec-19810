Parc was a delicious meal!  We had a fantastic time dining at this place.  The food was great and the service was excellent.  We came here on New Years Eve and the place was packed to the MAX.  Our server did not miss anything.   We started with the fresh tuna, mushroom tart, and escargot.  The Escargot and Tuna were delicious.  The Tuna could have used a little seasoning or truffle oil.   I ordered the Lamb Shank.  It was a very large portion and could have been shared.  We ordered the crème Brule for dessert and was shocked as it was one of the best Ive ever had!  Highly recommend this spot.
