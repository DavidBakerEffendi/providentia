Loved this place! Wonderfully complex but light dinner options. Great, unexpected flavor combos. The cocktails and service are just as sparkling. One of my personal favorite dining experiences I've had in the past couple years because it hit everything I'm looking for in for a date or low-key celebration spot: pretty intimate, not overcrowded, played a surprising amount of The Nerves, which made it feel like my living room, super flattering lighting from art deco, futurist chandeliers. I will definitely be back again. My server was super knowledgeable and crazy cute while still being really casual and conversational--which kind of encapsulates this place. High brow ideas but in jeans and tees. Tonight was my first time, but not so for the others in my party, who recommended this place expressly for the drink selection when our original destination had a 90-min estimated wait. I enjoyed the food as much as I did my mezcal-absinthe concoction: salted cantaloupe, purple basil & mozzarella salad, then chilled mussels in an herbed oil served with crusty bread. I will back again--soon! Highly recommended!
