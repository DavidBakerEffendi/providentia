As a newbie to Clinton Hill I'm excited to have a place so good and so reliable around the corner.  I've been here for drinks and dinner and it's always been a great neighborhood crowd.   Food, cocktails and wine selection is excellent!  Dinner menu is gastro-pub fare:  steak sandwich, fish and chips, mac and cheese w/ lobster or truffle oil, pork, chicken, veggie dishes too. The interior is reclaimed wood and electic sculpture which is cool to look at!  I have not experienced slow service that others talk about, in fact just the opposite, i felt the service was superb.   So happy to see an affordable, friendly, and local place in this area!  Close to the Franklin C stop or a 7 minute walk to the Bedford Nostrand A/C.
