I happened to stumble by this bar.  I think I stayed because I was hoping something would keep me there.  I finally left since I saw that the time was going to drag even further while everything just kept telling me to find better pastures.   The friendly waitresses were the only strings I was holding onto but then that even wore thin.   The jukebox plaid lame 80's Hall and Oats songs, while flashing some annoying neon lights. We asked for sliders, which surprisingly were very good, and they even gave us a custom ordered slider. I didnt try the 51 drafts, but I saw a lot of drinking going on.  The need to work on the mixed up decor, then giving out there staff more information so they can best serve everyone.
