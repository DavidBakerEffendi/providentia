House special, nice portions of flavorful oxtail, tripe, and beef tendon, also fan of the an fried noodles.  The dumplings are OK, the pan-fried are definitely recommended over the steamed. The broth has great flavor, generous portion of noodles and the price is unbeatable.  The only thing I would like is a little more meat in the noodle bowl, and a poached egg over a fried one, but for $5 this is an incredible spot (prefer it any day over David Chang's $17 momofuku special).
