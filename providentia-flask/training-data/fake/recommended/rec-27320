in love, in love, in love with their ginger mojito. I've had a lot of mojitos but not as well mixed and sweet as the ones here and you still get a buzz from one. I got the Pollito Asado Con Salsa Verde which was a cornish hen dish and it was amazing. Reasonably priced and good service. It gets crowded after around 5 or 6 so get there before it gets too crowded or you'll have a hard time or a long wait for a seat...at the bar or a table. The space is a little cramped but you forget about it after your second mojito!
