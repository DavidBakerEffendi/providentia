The place is TINY so don't expect to eat inside.  Also there is definitely no bathroom.  I ordered: 5 dumplings 1 sesame pancake (huge) 1 small Hot & Sour soup (huuuuge) 1 bottle of water Total price: $3.50!!  Holy cow.  I had to wonder exactly how much MSG needed to go into a product to make it taste so good yet cost so little, but figured I was better off not calculating that.  We sat across the street on the curb by the playground and I felt like a Chinese construction worker on my lunch break.  The food was extremely fresh and really hit the spot.  The ladies working there were surprisingly nice considering how crammed the place gets.  The line usually goes out the door.  Totally worth it.  In fact they could charge double and I'd still come here.  Make sure you ask for Sriracha too.  I am looking forward to the soup in the wintertime when it gets cold.  If dumplings were healthier I'd eat here every other day but am going to at least try to get there every two weeks.
