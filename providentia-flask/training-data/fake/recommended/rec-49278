Great Food! - Stopped by for lunch. My wife had an Eggplant sandwich. Great flavor. The spicy sauce that they serve on the side was amazing. The heat didn't take away from the flavor of the sauce. I had a chicken salad sandwich on cranberry & pecan bread. I would eat it again.... very good. Sweet potato fries, one serving good enough for two. Very good. Â Prime 16 still my favorite for SP fries. Next time, we'll hit them up for breakfast.
