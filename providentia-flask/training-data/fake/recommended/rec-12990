Ate dinner here with a friend and had an overall pleasant experience. We had the beet salad, eggplant ravioli, and squid ink pasta. The squid ink pasta with shrimp is absolutely amazing. Pasta cooked to perfection not to mention very hearty portions. The service is attentive and food delicious. The only thing is they charge for gluten-free bread (which tastes great) but only a few tiny pieces for $5 bucks and didn't tell us. Would definitely go back again regardless.
