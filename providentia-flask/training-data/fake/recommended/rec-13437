I can count the number of times I've had meatballs before (exactly 2) but my sister loves them so I decided to up that count to 3 and scout out this place for when she visits. It wasn't too crowded on a Sunday evening, but I ordered it to go anyway (in and out in less than 15 mins). I went with the traditional beef meatball with marinara sauce, and it was simply delicious. The meatballs were juicy and the marinara sauce was well-balanced. For the naked balls, you get 4 meatballs and a Â piece of focaccia, which is plenty for a meal. For something even more substantial, you can add salad/pasta/risotto to go with the meatballs, or order them in the form of sliders, sandwiches/heroes, or burgers/smash. I'm definitely taking my sister here next time, and I have a feeling that we'll be going more than once!
