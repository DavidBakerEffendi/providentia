After reading these reviews, we figured this place would be a great place to go for a bite. We walked in and the place was empty and the woman was reading a book at one of the booths. She had us seat ourselves in the dark dining room. All the tables were dirty and sticky but at this point it was too late to turn around and leave. The food was edible but was not very great. I got the chicken francese and the sauce was way too creamy and thick. The older man and woman were arguing in the front during our entire meal. Horrible experience, bad food, won't go back.
