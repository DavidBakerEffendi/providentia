Nice ambiance, great waitress..., but the food was nothing special - not anything you'd want to go out and pay for. There's some sort pf glass work business next door and we heard them hammering through the wall the entire time we were in the restaurant. Vida is nice, but it's more like a house, not a restaurant. My soda was flat (it came out of a big bottle), the steak was bland, my husband's pasta was tasteless... But the music was good!
