So do I start when I called and try to add one more for the reservation that was made a week ago and they had the name down but couldn't find the reservation time... We  have a large party of 12 which when we got to the private room was impressed.. Our server was sweet but seemed brand new.  As we ordered our bottomless drinks  we  enjoyed the room.  I read on the yelp review how are you doing some customers loved the bread that was given in the beginning.. No bread was brought out until I actually got up and asked for a  manager .. Not only did I speak to him about no bread but also my entree and another's was cold.. So they took our entrees and came back with the same temperature entree.COLD!  I didn't want to send it back a third time and just ate what I could.  The bottomless drinks were nice but it took awhile to get a few rounds in.  I brought a small cake for my daughters birthday and was told there would be a $3.00 a person cutting fee for any outside food brought. So we  decided to wait for cake after we left. The waiter did not even offer the birthday girl a birthday dessert.  What he seemed concerned about was letting us know that their was no big group tip and that there were suggested tips on the bill.  He was very nice but food and service was lousy.  The ambiance of the private room was nice but when you get a large room and a large group  what tends to happen is everyone in that room will tell their experience and pass it on.   More attention needs to be made to the basics.
