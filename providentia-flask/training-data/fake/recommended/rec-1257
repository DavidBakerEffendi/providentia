Great little spot in Hell's Kitchen. Food is tasty without also being super expensive. As a new resident in town, this was one of the first good finds. I recommend the corn empanadas particularly the rice and beans and the chorizo. Takeout service was a bit slow but with good company this shouldn't be too much of an issue. Small space but the staff was very gracious and patient. However, WARNING: Do not order the sangria. $8.50 for a fairly bad product. The food made up for it though. Great late night eatery.
