I need to try this place out in person, because my delivery order was a bloated mess. I got the calzone, and the cheese inside tasted awful. I felt like throwing up purely from the flavor alone. Awful. I'll give these guys one more shot and edit this if they impress, but this is a rough start. Yuck.
