I have finally found my authentic, sit-down Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn!!!  Hallelujah! I tried a sampling of tacos, one of which was all veggie (fresh and delicious), the al pastor (pork, pineapple, delectable) and a scrumptious quesadilla with that hard-to-find queso Oaxaca in full effect!  It's not a quesadilla without the queso Oaxaca! I'm going back tomorrow with a group to celebrate some good stuff.  The happy hour specials here are insanely reasonable ($2 tacos! Half price drinks!)
