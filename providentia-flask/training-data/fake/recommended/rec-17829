My wife brought me here for a wonderful birthday dinner.  We each ordered the rodizio which was an assortment of 18 different cuts of meats, sausages and chicken. I made a cardinal error and filled up on bread, salad and rice.. I should have held off for the delicious and perfectly cooked meats.  My favorite selections were the flank steak, spicy sausage and the bacon with filet.  I would definitely recommend this to any carnivore who wants a good quality cut of meat.  I would also recommend dessert, if you have space, as there was a great selection of cheesecakes, cakes and other sweets.  I recommend the chocolate cheesecake and the cannoli cake!   I would recommend this for any special occasion or just a nice dining experience.  I would love to return to try a regular entree as well.  Keep in mind that the restaurant is very busy and loud and there could be a wait without a reservation.  However, the staff was very friendly and attentive.
