Great addition to the neighborhood! My boyfriend got a cheese steak and fries from there and was very pleased with his meal!  The staff is very friendly (and flirty might I add) with a great sense of humor.   Two comments:   1.  hoping they will expand the menu and perhaps add chicken cheese steaks and maybe a veggie option; 2. add more meat to the sandwich, it was a bit too thin for a cheese steak. otherwise, we'll be back! good luck fellas!
