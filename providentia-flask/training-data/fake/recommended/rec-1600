really pathetic cheesesteak. my brother in law actually meant to go into pat's but somehow went in and bought the wrong thing. Not sure how that happens, but that was his story. Cold and flavorless. I live in NY, and surprisingly I have yet to eat a cheesesteak better than Back East Cheesesteaks in Murray, Utah. Laugh all you want, but if you ever get a chance, your mind will be blown!
