One of my lunch rountine. It has the best Katsu pork in town! The portion of rice/curry is big although I wish that they could give a little more of the pork katsu! Bershire pork is the best yet it's pricey. If you want a FULL lunch that last you for the rest of the day (yea you might not even need a bite for the night!) then it's worth going. However, other than curry katsu, other donburi and soba/udon are just so so. It's also good that they have the take out section which sells half of the portion of the dishes of dinning in.
