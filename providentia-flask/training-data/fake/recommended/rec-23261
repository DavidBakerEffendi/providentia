Just went in tonight for the first time (a Tuesday) and we started out as the the only table, but when we left there were 4 other tables filled, and rightfully so!  We started with the steak tostado, and it was fresh and well balanced with the meat, crunch from the veggies, and just a little beans on the corn base.  I had the special sandwich (not on the online menu so can't remember the name) with steak, pork, ham, pickled veggies and an egg.  It was incredible.  So different than anything I've had before.  My significant other had the tilapia (breaded) tacos and they were also delicious.  Service was attentive and the BYOB feature is always good for the pocketbook.  What a neighborhood gem!
