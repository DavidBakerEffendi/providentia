Tucked away in a little alley on the LES is this gem. The decor is very fun! Hunter-chic? I prefer the brunch and drinks here over dinner. None of the menu items were particularly resplendent to me (as in didn't make it to my "best of NY" list), but I have never disliked anything I've ordered here. I love the skillets or the trout and hard boiled egg platter for brunch. They do a decent job with scallops (generous portion size and cooked well), and everyone should start with the devils on horseback.
