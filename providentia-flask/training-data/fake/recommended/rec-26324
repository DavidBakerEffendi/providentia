I am Ukrainian and I approve this place :) Seriously the food is as good as my mom makes it at home.  I pretty much have had most of the things on the menu and would recommend having it all.  Come back a few times and try different things.  I have to say portions are way too small for the money you are paying (makes me want to open up a restaurant).  But it is definitely good food.   Vodka is great, and I am not a vodka drinker.  But their bacon vodka is delish.   Also where can you eat with interactive staff, props, and a shot of vodka when you leave!!??
