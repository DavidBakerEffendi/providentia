weekend brunch here is idyllic. which is quite a statement given that this michelin starred spot in smack dab in the middle of downtown. the boy and i grabbed a spot on the small veranda outside. nicely shaded area for people watching. best of both worlds. we both got the weekend brunch special ($22 for brunch cocktail, entree and coffee / tea plus a mini apricot scone). fig / vanilla bellini was divine. i had the venison burger with tomato confit and miso bun plus cassava chips. he ordered the poached egg with harissa hollandaise. all expertly prepared. bun / meat ratio was bit off though on the former, but no matter. can't wait to try sunday supper!
