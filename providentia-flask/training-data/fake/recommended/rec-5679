After being a Temple student for 2 years, I finally made it over to the Crepe truck. Man they are delicious. I had the tuna crepe, which included a ton of vegetables and mozzarella cheese. It was only $4.50, $5.25 with my drink, and it was HUGE. Better than any sandwich I could've gotten. My only complaint is that the sauces made it a little soggy toward the end, but the only way to fix that would be to eliminate the sauce. Both of my friends were satisfied, they had steak and pork I believe, and there is a nice array of beverage options. I can't wait to go back and try the dessert crepes!
