I've been looking for a good Japanese izakaya on the East Side and Udon West definitely fills that need!  I came for dinner on a weeknight and the place was packed; my eating buddy and I had to wait 10 minutes before they seated us.  I immediately liked the blond wood floors and open kitchen design.  The place is deeper than it appears from outside, and I really enjoyed the overall vibe here. I was in the mood for pork cutlet curry all day, and it did not disappoint.  The meat was juicy, the curry on point, and the portion was just enough to fill me up.  I also tried the Yebisu beer which apparently is made by the Sapporo folks.  It was a bitter beer which was a surprise because most Japanese beers I've tried were lighter in taste.  I think I'll stick with Kirin next time. The waitstaff are all native Japanese and provide very good service.  I think I've found my new Japanese go-to place in East Midtown because my experience was near flawless.  There are 50% off dumplings and draft beer specials on Saturdays and Sundays so look for me there come one weekend!
