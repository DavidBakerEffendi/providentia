Really enjoyed my hand pumped local beer along with two appetizers. First was grilled caesar salad - the taste was perfect. Second was the steamed clams. The broth was excellent.   Crowd was young with a hip / grunge vibe.  Only negative was that we had a late dinner so the noise level from the bar sound system was a bit loud.
