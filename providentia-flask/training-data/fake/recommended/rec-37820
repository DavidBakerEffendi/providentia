Fried Shrimp Po Boy........ This was my first meal in Philadelphia during my 4-day stay, and did it ever set the bar high. While planning my trip, I searched for places that would offer large portions at a low cost. This sandwich fit that description to a t. The sandwich was nearly a foot long and was filled with a generous portion of deliciously fried shrimp and creamy cole slaw, all at under $9. While waiting for my sandwich to be made, I was offered a sample of their Gator Gumbo, which was equally delicious and was something I would probably order for my next visit. On your visit to Reading Terminal Market, definitely give Beck's a shot.
