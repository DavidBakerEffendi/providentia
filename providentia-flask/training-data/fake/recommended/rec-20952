I heard several people rave about this place, but food-wise, nothing jumped out to me. The sushi was a-okay...but based on that and the service, I would have given this place a 3. It's not bad, by any means, but the prices are a little high for the serving sizes. They do have happy hour prices for select appetizers, so if you're looking for some decent calamari, check it out during that time. I wouldn't pay full price for most of it. I gave the fourth star based on 2 things. 1. There's an upstairs that is great for larger gatherings. 2. They do have quite the variety of Asian alcohols that you might not get elsewhere.
