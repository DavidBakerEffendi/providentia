This is why I love NY. You can walk down the street hungry as hell and have a million choices to satisfy your hunger. This night we were craving italian and the smell and look of their dishes lured us in. (so did the hosts lol) It was a total little Italy experience. Excellent service- the waiter split my meal on two plates for my friend and I to share. Both beautifully presented. My other friends Abalone Pasta looked delicious too. The people eating next to us could have very well been from the cast of the Sopranos. lol!!!! I loved it. Check out my pics for the lobster I had here. It was very very good however I could have had more shrimp than calamari.
