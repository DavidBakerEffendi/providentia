This place is great for brunch! My second time eating brunch here and love the food. Ate here this past Sunday. It was very busy with a 45-60 minute wait time. Luckily, had made an 11:45 online reservation and was seated a little after 12. Ordered a grapefruit momosa and the Cookshop scramble with bacon, served on a biscuit. Both excellent. My wife had a poached egg with a killer cheese sauce and chives served on a popover. This was extremely good. Will definitely brunch here again!
