Oh, baby!  I don't know where everybody else is eating (or where I'm NOT eating) that this place is only ranked at a 3.5, but if you have teeth and even a fleeting affinity for a finer thing in life, I don't see how you could be disappointed.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and everybody working was professional and helpful while keeping their real-person vibe intact.  We started off with this beautiful specimen of a pizze (I'll never eat pizzA again).  I think it was a new addition, because I can't locate its first name on their online menu, but key words are:  sweet corn, scallions, and bufala cheese.  We kept commenting on the magical corn flavor that seemed to exist throughout the crust even where no kernels lay - turns out there's a corn puree throughout; science wins again. Next came the wood grilled octopus - gentleman's choice - I didn't expect much from it, but those squiggly little legs are undeniably appealing.  Just when you thought we'd be full came a special roasted vegetable salad and our his and hers entrees:   zucchini lasagna meets pig that's been lolling around on a skewer - what a handsome couple.  Everything was beautiful and awesome - I think Zeke fell a little out of love with me when he met that pig. We topped everything off with some drinks and a taste of the chocolate flan - think toasty, upside-down cupcake toiling with molten chocolate.  It's not cheap, but you can escape relatively unscathed with a little smart meal planning.  I'd bring my parents here to finally make them proud.
