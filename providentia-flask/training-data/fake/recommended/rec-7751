With the DINKification of Walnut Street over the years, it was inevitable that 1) the Eagan brothers would eponymize a restaurant/sportsbar/Hi-dB-rated/more noise=more fun kind of place. Â It was a natural step to add on an upper-scale venue which could share the highly costly and difficult-to-get-in-Montclair liquor license. Halcyon is the result. We went with some friends a while back. They had eaten there several times before and had even had a private party in the upstairs catering hall. We were seated at a corner table in the front-left area of the restaurant, farthest from the bar and the ubiquitous TV. The seating was comfortable and the table size generous. The room itself is nicely designed, with high-quality workmanship evident. The only negative for me is the over-use of white marble and subway tiles. After a couple of glasses of wine I lost track of whether I was in the dining room or the bathroom. Hmm, should I belch or pee? Both? Neither? Here's how the meal fell out: one swordfish on a bed of broccoli raab, two glazed salmon of a bed of nothing, with a mound of seasonal vegetables, julienned and served cold (why?), one fish special=red snapper in a potato crust - also plated on broccoli raab. The swordfish - a "nice" piece, as we say - was pronounced excellent and there was enough left to pack up and take home. The service was a bit relaxed for my taste. Ah, well... coulda gone to Eagan's for a nice burger and fries... Next time.
