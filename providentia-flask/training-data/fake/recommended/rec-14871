I came to Khyber on a Monday night as I was in the neighborhood (seeing a movie at the Ritz) and a friend had recommended it.  I had no idea that this place served New Orleans cuisine so I was quite happy when I arrived and saw the menu (I was expecting generic pub food).  Our order included the chicken po'boy, the muffuletta, and the rib/pork sampler.  All were delicious.  They also offered a side with the entrees and had plenty of options to chose from.  I personally was not a fan of the baked mac n' cheese, as I think I tasted goat cheese in it which I do not enjoy the taste of.  However, someone else had it in my group and did enjoy it.   Dive/hipster bar atmosphere.  Prices are reasonable.  Good beer selection.  Service is excellent.  Great place for dinner or late night snacks/drinks.
