A splendid meal in a great place. I normally do not like butternut squash because it doesn't taste like butter, nuts or squash, but the butternut squash ravioli here is wonderful, sweet and nutty melting in my mouth like butter. Also had the scallops wrapped in prosciutto  - awesome - the delicacy of the prosciutto  doesn't overpower the scallops like bacon usually does.  And I just found out that was served on a cauliflower truffle puree with sliced apples.. Cauliflower puree! - another thing I thought I didn't like.  The atmosphere is lively and cozy at the same time.
