I haven't yet been disappointed by the atmosphere of a wine bar. And Ardesia graciously continued that trend. The space oozes sexy sophistication. Even the playful elements - random, funky, chalk drawings on the walls and a goldfish in the bathroom (Poor thing must tire of always having such a horrible view.) - have a cultivated feel. I ordered a glass of the Chilean white wine, followed by one of the Italian Pinot Blanco. Both were fine, but they tasted virtually the same. (Or maybe I'm just not enough of a wine connoissieur to detect the subtle difference.) The spot is a bit out of the way: It's not one that you would pass by and consider entering on the fly; You would have to plan to patronize it. In fact, I, myself might have to arrange a trip to return for their delectable-looking S'mores...
