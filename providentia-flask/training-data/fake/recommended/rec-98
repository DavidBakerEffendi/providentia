"New Rudy's" actually does pretty well in its role as a bar/restaurant rather than the dark, dingy, charming dive that it once was. The frites are still excellent. The sauces are still excellent. Honestly, the only reason I don't go even more often is that Prime 16 is a little closer, a little cheaper, and a little tastier. Rudy's is a great place to grab a burger and a few beers and watch a game, and I can't help but respect the optimism of the bartender who never fails to inform me that my Patriots suck but his Jets are going to the Super Bowl.
