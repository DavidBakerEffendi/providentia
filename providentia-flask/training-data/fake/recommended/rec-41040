Brunch: Most delicious scrambled egg and steak burrito.  Hash browns are the most wonderful shoestring frites you've ever had!.  Sooo good.  I'm writing this after my second prickly pear margarita... Oh ya, and the margs are bottomless for $19.95... Just waiting on the churros for dessert.... (later: - which were great - and they also served me surprise dessert of tamarind sorbet with chili... Excellent!)
