I DEF recommend this place! I've eaten there a couple of times & the food is pretty tasty! I can say the Nosh Burger with Fries & Dirty Rice was excellent & the Smoked Brisket was awesome too & the friendly service you get is a plus too! If you live or if you ever visit the Astoria area try them out, I'm sure you'll love the place & the food!!!
