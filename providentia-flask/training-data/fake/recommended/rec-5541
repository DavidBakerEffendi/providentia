Burger was great, got the truffles, avocado, carmelized onions with the duck fat fries.  Did not need dinner after that lunch.  Great service and nice crowd.  If you are a whiskey drinker (I am not) it is definitely a place to check out as their selection is impressive.  overall a great experience, a little pricey though..
