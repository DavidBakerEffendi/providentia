Came here for dinner on a Monday around 7. We didn't have a reservation (apparently they only take reservations for 6+) but were seated right away for a party of 2. My friend had been here a bunch of times so he recommended the Room Service Pad Thai. It's like an omelet-style noodle dish. Not really like pad thai -- it's glass noodles with a lot of shrimp and mixed seafood with mango on top. Bill came out to about $20 a person just for those dishes.
