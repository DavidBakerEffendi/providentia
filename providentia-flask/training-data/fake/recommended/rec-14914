Awkward seating, sat at the bar type table by the window and had to squeeze ourselves in. I'm a small person too. Food was good. We got fried pickles of course, they fry them in spears, it was good. I had a "BLT" chicken sandwich which was huge. Chicken was good but could have been crispier, the slaw was good and the fried green tomatoes were good. Biscuit weren't amazing. Desserts were good, nice rice pudding and fried Oreos. Cute mason jars and bottles, good service.
