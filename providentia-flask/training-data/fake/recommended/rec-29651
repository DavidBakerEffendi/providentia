A great, authentic-feeling Italian restaurant amidst the touristy-ness of Little Italy. Server was very friendly, and the owner came out to talk to us as well. When we complimented the food, he offered us free lemon drinks that were very delicious! We also met the owner's sister, who happened to be eating there that night as well, and she told us the stories behind some of the old pictures hanging on the wall, and the history of the restaurant. This is definitely a family owned and operated business, and everyone there was very pleasant to talk to! The food was very good as well, I definitely recommend getting a dish with meatballs or ordering one on the side; the owner makes them himself and they are fantastic!
