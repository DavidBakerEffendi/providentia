This place is crazy good . The tacos are full of meat and cheap . The enchilada with the green sauce is out of this world . And very fresh . The owner can not go out of his way enough to make sure you are satisfied . They even gave us a glass of sangria on the house . You will be satisfied going to Maddy's
