All evenings are not created equal..and all horrible places only make you appreciate the amazing ones even more..please refer to Bubble Yuck and Lore-something to understand..for a night Id thought was shot to bloody hell..we walked around looking for the Glass Slipper at 2 am..a burlesque show place..apparently..turns out where it was is now scaffolding..so my best friend looks across the street and goes, "Ohhhh, that's the meatball shoppe!" I look at her, Im halfway convinced she knew it was there (the meatballs) and the slipper was broken..anyways, she's been waxing lyrical about this place since I got to NY... Im trying to remain respectful and objective. But if some food is sexy, these meatballs are a veritable multiple orgasm. In a very humble bowl. In a very quaint restaurant. Where they have taken apart meat grinding machines and stuck them on the wall. Where they have Brooklyn lager. Where everyone is super nice. Where you can scribble on the menu with a thick black marker. Where you leave utterly satisfied with breathing. SIGH. Honestly, phenof***ingnomenal. We had the specials, corned beef with sauerkraut and spicy tomato sauce and spicy pork with mushroom sauce along with a side of fluffy, yummy, flufffffffffy mashed spuds and roasted brussels sprouts. Spot on, perfect meatballs, flavoursome, no fillers, not dense, just amazingly delicious. My friend and I each had 4 and felt no ill effects. We finished off our meal with a homemade cookie and vanilla ice cream. We went home. We had weird dreams. Totally worth it. Try it. I will be back. Very very soon.
