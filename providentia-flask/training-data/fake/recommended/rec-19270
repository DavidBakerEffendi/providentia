Green Rock is an adorable place.   Probably not one to go out of your way for, but if you happen to be in the area, especially if you're a vegetarian - it's the place to be.  The area is sorely lacking in veggie options.  The pierogies are amazing and are extremely filling.  The menu is written in chalk, so not sure if it changes frequently, but they also had falafel.  The desserts sounded good but we were too full.
