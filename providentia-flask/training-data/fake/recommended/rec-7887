First impression, was "oh what a nice quaint place." After I went inside "oh wow it's really nice looking" Unless you are taking out it is good to make a reservation otherwise you have to wait a bit. The price shocked me the most, they offer a appetizer and entree size. The cheapest entree starts at $14 and the portions are not too great for the cost. I ordered the pasta fussilini or whatever it's called. I ordered the appetizer size for $17.00. Once I got my order I was disappointed. It was a tiny miniscule box. My tv dinners from Wal-Mart gives more food for the value. The entree size cost a whopping $25.00 and that is before taxes, hence me opting in for a smaller size.  Go here if you want to pay high costs for a snack-size meal.  But to give it something positive in my review, the food tastes great. It probably didn't help that tonight was the University of Pennsylvania's graduation dinner lol.
