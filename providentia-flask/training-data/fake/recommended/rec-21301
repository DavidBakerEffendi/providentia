One of the best restaurant experiences I've been in.  Amazing service and the food is just out of this world.  I did the five course lunch and I left thinking about how it was such an amazing deal.  I've made up my mind that every time I come to NYC, I'm going to eat at Bouley.  The atmosphere is beautiful, relaxing, and completely impeccable.  So was the service.  I cannot describe how much I enjoyed the food.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves amazingly made food.  Just solid and heavenly.
