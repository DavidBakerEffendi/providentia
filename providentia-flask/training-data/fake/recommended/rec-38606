Out of many of my vegan dining experiences in Philadelphia, this has been my best one so far. I always enjoy a vegan place where I don't need to analyze the menu and ask tons of questions about the ingredients. I have been to both fast food Govinda's and the fine dining Govinda's. I would give the fast food Govinda's a 3 and the fine dining a 5. I went to Govinda's a couple of weeks ago with a friend to try the fine dining part of the restaurant. We ended up getting two appetizers and salads. I never thought I would brag about how amazing the salad was. I got the vegan Caesar salad with "chicken." It was amazing. For dessert I got the vegan strawberry marshmallow creme cake. It was extremely yummy as well. I've been back there since and it hasn't let me down. It definitely has gone down as one of my favorite restaurants. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well. You can be seated either upstairs or downstairs. Just a warning though: if you end up bringing wine there I would recommend sitting on the lower level just because those stairs can be treacherous. The waiter was very friendly and gave great recommendations. The only problem is the fine dining part is only open Thursday-Sunday, but you can always go next door and get something to go and a great dessert.
