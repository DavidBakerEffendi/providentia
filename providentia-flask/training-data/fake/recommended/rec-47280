Been here twice now both very good experiences, great ambiance. first time was last year but remember ordering a delicious fish dish w/ mussels i belive for a starter which were great. drinks are always delicious reccomend the watermelon martini. had lunch there recently fries w gorganzola are a great twist & tasty, the avacado cobb salad was pretty good but salads are salads. Will definately be returning to this place only thing is the service could be a little better there not very warm or sociable
