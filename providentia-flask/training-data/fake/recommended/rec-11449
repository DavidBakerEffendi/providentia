Be careful at Rex, too much of a good thing can be reality. I knew as soon as I saw the menu what I wanted. Craw fish pot pie on south street west, are you kidding me? The answer to my rhetorical question was a booming NO. There no joking when it came to this beautiful biscuit topped pie filled with deep southern treasure. Â The craw fish filling was so rich and delicious, I felt like pointing my finger in the face of anyone who did not order it and telling them they sucked. I was quick to declare this dish one of my favorite in the city. Be warned, the pot pie is a starter on the menu. Its sooo filling, it is enough by itself. Maybe a salad to pair. I made the mistake of ordering a chicken entree, but was so full I could barely eat it. My buddy had great things to say about the burger and I want to try it soon. It will be hard not to order the craw fish pie again, but if the burger is as good as i have heard a five star may be in the works.
