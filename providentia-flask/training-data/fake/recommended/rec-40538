We made a special trip out to the Franklin Flea at the old Strawbridge's building and were looking for a decent and kid friendly place to eat lunch.  I have never been to Jones before but thought it was a fun place to try since it has a retro vibe and that was our theme for the day. Even though it was lunch time on a Saturday we were given a brunch menu and the bloody mary clipboard.  I surprised myself and passed on the bloody mary and we ordered sodas instead.  The kids ordered lemonade and it turned out to be extremely sour.  We had to flag down the waitress to ask for a replacement (chocolate milk) and she kept getting weird about it.  "I'll just leave those here for you guys!!" she said two separate times like I really wanted those extra cups of lemon juice around.  Finally when hubs and I tried them it was outrageously gross and sour.  Poor kids! I got the cobb salad, husband can't remember what he ordered (?!) and I don't either... something with skinny fries that were really good, the kids split a pancake and we all shared a side of macaroni and cheese. The cobb salad all tasted like lemon (which I thought must be a real theme of our meal: overly sour) and the pancake was really hard to cut and dry.  The saving grace of the meal was the macaroni and cheese which was awesome. When the waitress dropped off the check and disappeared for...pretty much ever, we noticed that she charged us for 2 kids' lemonades and 2 kids' chocolate milks.  At $5-6 extra on our bill I wasn't happy.  I flagged a manager, who was super nice and took care of it immediately, but by then I was annoyed with my space cadet server. It was somewhere in between meh and a-ok, more like 2.5 stars. FYI- they were able to check our stroller in another storefront outside, so that was convenient.
