I am biased because this is my go-to neighborhood restaurant, but I have been eating here consistently (at least twice a month) for the past six years and have had consistently good experiences. The name is a bit misleading, as the decor is much nicer than I would expect for a traditional "tavern." It can get a bit loud, which to me is a good sign, as it shows that people are enjoying themselves, but you can also find a corner table here or there where it'll stay quiet. The drinks are excellent (Long Bottom Bramble is a favorite), they always have a good selection of beers (Captain Lawrence) and wines, and the food is always a winner to me. I highly recommend the Hangar Steak, the Mac and Cheese, and the Ricotta & Butternut Squash Ravioli. Their burger is also excellent, as are the mussels. Come to think of it, I have had most of the menu and am a big fan of all of it. As a side, the brussels sprouts can't be wrong. Their brunch is also worth checking out, but they can get a bit busy.
