Visited on a Tuesday at about 8:15pm. The Ambiance at this place is amazing, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside. The two times that I have been, I have sat outside. They also provide water bowls for any doggie pals you bring. Food would rate an 8/10, Burgers are awesome! and my friends say that the shrimp Po boy and pulled pork are good. I've tried the jambalaya and...eh, didn't wow me. In general, their "cajun" food has failed to impress me. But good burgers and fries are great. Service: 5/10 had to ask for water refills twice and food took forever! Was at least a 40 minute wait, for two bugers, one po boy, and pulled pork. Wasn't crazy busy either, but it seemed that the owner may have had family there visiting, so maybe that was why service was distracted. So on a whole, worth a visit for a burger at least once, just to enjoy the atmosphere, but don't expect food to be prompt. Which is sad, since it has potential, they just need to get tighter on their service and some of their dishes.
