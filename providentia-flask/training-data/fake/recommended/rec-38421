Yesterday afternoon we where driving on 95S and started searching Yelp for a great lunch to feed the hoard.  We found Sandra's Next Generation in New Haven.  OMG, you need to go eat here.  We tried the Turkey w/ corn bread stuffing, BBQ pork, Baked Chicken, OxTail and dirty rice, for sides we had the Collard Greens, yams, Buffalo Mac n'Cheese, String Beans, Corn and Sweet Tea.  From the minute we walked in the door we felt like family.  The service was great and the food was spectacular. This is definitely a home cooked meal.  We even took a family picture with Sandra in front of the restraurant when we left.  I just need to figure out how to post it on yelp.
