The food is wonderful, and the service was fantastic! Came to watch the Oscars! The interior is lovely and very intimate. Wine selection is (obviously) quite extensive. However many are bottle only which is a real shame. Quail egg toast. Get it. Ice cream sandwich. Definitely get it. Only real complaint is that it's a little pricey especially given the portions of the food. Tapas and small plates shouldn't run $14 for one plate.
