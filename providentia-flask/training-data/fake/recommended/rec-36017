As a returning customer at Balthazar's for a few years, I have never been disappointed with their food or service until tonight. Our food arrived within ten minutes of ordering. One on the main courses we ordered was the Butternut Squash Risotto. We were surprised when the order arrived in less than ten minutes considering risotto takes around 15 minutes to cook. Upon looking at the plate with risotto, we saw that there was a strip of plastic film on it. Immediately concerned, we called the waitress over who brought the manager over. He admitted that it is pre-made. Really? Who pre-makes risotto? Especially a restaurant like this where they charge $19 for the appetizer plate. Being the manager, at least lie and don't straight up say that it is pre-made so later your ongoing customers come on here and post what went on that night. I love this restaurant, but seeing that plastic wrap makes me question how fresh their food is and if it's worth paying $200+ for dinner for two people for drinks, appetizers, main course and dessert. Peace!
