A definite must eat when you're in the city, late at night. Be careful that you don't get swindled by one of the nearby carts trying to pose as the Famous Halal Guys. Get the chicken, lamb, AND rice. Don't forget your white sauce either. Be weary of the hot sauce, it seriously is one of the spiciest condiments I've come to taste in my life.
