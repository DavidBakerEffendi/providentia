This place is a complete hole in the wall masterpiece of french fries with crazy dipping sauces. If you are a french fry sauce kind of person, go to St Marks for Pommes Frites. I had one order of fries with 3 sauces. There was a SMOKED EGGPLANT MAYO, was one of my fav's!!! A HONEY MUSTARD MAYO, which was alright but nothing too crazy, and also the PINEAPPLE MAYO, which had a tart but super yummy texture. If you feel like going out with some friends to enjoy a relaxing evening of great company, GO THERE! ENJOY!
