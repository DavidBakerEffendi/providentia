Went here for dinner with another couple and had a delicious meal!  I'm pretty picky about Italian food after spending a semester abroad in Italy, so I usually avoid Italian restaurants, but overall this was really good.   Some dishes stood out, including the pizza with cauliflower and anchovies and grilled octopus appetizer.  I wasn't that impressed with my pasta dish (one of the specials, ricotta tortellini with persimmon), but my friend's chicken liver pasta was amazing.  The suckling pig for one was pretty delicious, too, with yummy crispy roasted potatoes.  For dessert, I ordered the pear tart because it sounded like it wouldn't be too sweet, but I was wrong.  I tasted my companions' polenta budino and semifreddo, which were both much better than my dessert. Maybe it was because it was a Monday night, but our waitress wasn't quite as knowledgeable about the menu as I would have hoped.
