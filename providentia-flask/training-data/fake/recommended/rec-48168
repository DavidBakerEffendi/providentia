We had some friends who had been and we're here to go as its close by and we're hoping it might be a place we can frequent. The food was good although it was slightly more expensive than we could do on a regular basis for a full blown night out. Enjoyed the atmosphere. The dim lighting made it feels bit more ... romantic, and they've done a nice job fixing it up from the previous  Have a mix of tables and high tops to eat at.  Wife thought it was loud but I didn't notice. We had three glasses of wine, the muscles for an appetizer, 2 entrees (one was a bit more $ special) and then the tiramisu and coffee for dessert.  With a good tip it was just under $100.  You could easily get a dinner with no apps, no dessert, maybe a beer for a LOT less though. Our waitress was great and food was out quick.  The menu seemed like it covered a lot of bases and had a nice selection, although it was just printed on some plain paper which made it seem a bit tacky.   I'd give it a 3.5 but you can't do half stars.  Think it's going to be promising though.
