I came here with a group of 10+ people for AYCE hot pot on a Friday night and had a fantastic time! We were able to make a same-day reservation for 8:30pm and they seated us promptly when we arrived in a nice private room upstairs for large parties. I was impressed by how big and nicely decorated the inside was, and it was packed on a Friday night. The AYCE hot pot is a great deal for ~$25 with tax and tip! Each person gets their own little pot of broth (original vs spicy) in front of them, and then you order ingredients as a group. They had all the standard hot pot ingredients, of pretty decent quality - I particularly enjoyed the beef, fish fillet, enoki mushrooms, and watercress, and one of my friends was obsessed with the fish meatballs. I also loved the sauce station, where you can make your own dipping sauce from around 20 different sauce options as well as garlic, cilantro, and green onions. The servers checked in on us frequently to see if we needed refills and brought new food back quickly. The BYOB policy made for a fun evening of food and wine. The waiter even brought us an ice bucket to keep our wine chilled :). Overall great experience and I will definitely come back anytime I want AYCE hot pot!
