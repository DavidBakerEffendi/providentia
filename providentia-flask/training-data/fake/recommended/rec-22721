DO believe the hype! The roast pork, provolone, and broccoli rabe combination is insanely delicious. I would not normally imagine those flavors together but they work so well and with such balance. I am not a huge fan of broccoli rabe but found that its bitterness really worked with the sharp cheese and flavorful meat. Only complaint is that it could have used a bit of heat. DiNic's is a must try in the Reading Market. The sausage looked great - I'll have to try it next time.
