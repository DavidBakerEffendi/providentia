I've been meaning to update my review of Iron Chef for about 2 years now. Mea culpa, mea culpa. Iron Chef is a cozy little Japanese restaurant/sushi bar located near the heart of Brooklyn Heights. After experiencing all of the sushi restaurants within a 10 block radius of my home, I must say that Iron Chef House has now become my favorite sushi joint in B Heights. After switching to brown rice sushi, I have found that nobody else makes brown rice as well as they do. It's fresh, fluffy, and obviously not made in a microwave. Often I go to ICH for their Saturday lunch special to enjoy a peaceful, cheap meal of yummy sushi. Their lunch special is 2 rolls for $7.95 which comes with soup and salad. Brown rice costs $1 extra per roll. My favorites are their spicy tuna roll, the Rising Sun roll (eel roll topped with salmon and cavier), spicy salmon roll and any other special roll combos. I think they excel with rolls more than they do with nigiri or sashimi but that is just my opinion. I also love their miso soup but it's hard to screw that one up. Plating is always nicely presented and service is attentive. ICH also has a nice sake list which is decently priced for the money conscious drinker. If you do go for dinner, please note that the environment becomes completely different as it can be extremely crowded and LOUD on a Friday/Saturday night. This past weekend was no exception as my friend and I snagged the last table available and saw a line of people waiting outside to get into this little place. Prepare to have people practically on top of you on either side as they are trying to fit in as many tables as possible. One of these days I need to throw all caution to the wind and order the Sakura Roll (spicy tuna and salmon roll, topped with king crab meat) and the Special Lobster Roll (spicy lobster, crunchy flakes and avocado on top). Yummy.
