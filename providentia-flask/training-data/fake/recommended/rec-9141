I was here sometime last year, and I thought it was pretty nifty. Never really had non-sushi japanese before, and went with 3 other guys. We ordered a bunch of beer and more food than I can remember. We spent a lot of money, but I guess we got tipsy and ordered quite a lot. The squid I thought was pretty good, but the duck was even more amazing.  I was told after that people tend to order one or 2 things and then the fried udon noodles, but I guess 4 guys and beer get out of control. There wasnt much in terms of seating, and you write your name down on a list when you first get there. First come first served for sure.  All in all I really liked it and hoping to go back soon.
