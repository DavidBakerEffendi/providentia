I really enjoyed my visit. The prices are reasonable and the food and service were all good.  I will definitely come back! I ordered the village burger which was tastey.  The fries fried in duck fat was pretty good, thick fries though so not how I prefer my fries, but I love potatotes nonetheless. I forget the name of the drink I got, peachy tea alcoholic one, but it was also very good!
