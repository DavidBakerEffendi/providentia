I work right by this restaurant and never had time to stop by. Today I did with my wife, and this was a very nice experience. It reminds me of P.J. Clarke's, with better food. I highly recommend it. Everything was very tasty and cooked perfectly. We also received impeccable service from a server named Conor. I wanted to give him credit as I am hard to impress on service, and he did. Thank you.
