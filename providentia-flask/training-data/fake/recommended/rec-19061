I went went with my girlfriend and a friend for brunch. List mode: 1. cash or Amex only (but they have ATM inside). 2. Free churro if you check in on Yelp. 3. great french press coffee 4. portions are relatively small - crepes w/nutella and bananas only had 2 small crepes, french toast dish was ~2 slice of brioche. My dish (corn beef and eggs) was the largest, but I would not get it again. 5. service was okay, not incredibly attentive, possibly because we were outside 6. the staff was cool and the French-Mexican theme sort of works
