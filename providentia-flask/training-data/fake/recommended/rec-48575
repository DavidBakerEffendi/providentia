We had donna for a server, she was the NICEST server we encountered all evening. The food menu looked incredible, we would have eaten there if it wasnt 1:30am and the kitchen was closed. She made me a drink called Garden Crisper and it was incredible. LOVE her. Going back when shes working, shes the only server i want to give my money to.
