What a disappointment at this place. My boyfriend and I went to Eulogy and although we weren't crazy about the vibe in the place- we were satisfied with the service. When we sat down at BT tonight at the bar- it took about ten to fifteen minutes to order. When we were literally just about to get up to leave the bartender came over and asked what we needed. We decided to stay and order since they had some biers we wanted to try. When we got our frites we asked for an additional sauce since we finished the first one. Our bartender disappears and after ten minutes of waiting we ask the second bartender who then tells us it's extra for the sauce. He comes back and then says that they just ran out. All this after about fifteen minutes. Also did NOT like the vibe here either from either of the bartenders. Sucks because we did want to order more. We won't be going back!! Ever!
