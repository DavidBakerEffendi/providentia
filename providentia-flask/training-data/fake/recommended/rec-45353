Delicious sandwich!  I had the steak with provolone and onions and it was awesome.  The bread rocks, too.  One of the easiest ways to ruin a good sandwich is to put it on crappy bread, but that definitely didn't happen here.  For those earlier reviewers who said the bread-to-meat ratio was 80:20, that's definitely no longer the case.  Service was excellent, too!  We will absolutely be back!
