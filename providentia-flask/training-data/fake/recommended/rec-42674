A small pizza shop in Hartford that packs a big punch, when it comes to their Calzones!  This place is not runned by Italians, but who cares if they can make some of best tasting food.   The Pizza is filling, definately go there and pick up a small pie, and you will notice the big sword that they use to chop the pizza into slices, talk about a pizza cutter.. wooh! Wings there are decent, not bad, but their signature item I think is the Calzones! Give it a try, bring a friend to share, or a hungry stomach because it will definately fill two stomaches if you got it.
