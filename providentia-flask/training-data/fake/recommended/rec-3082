As I have said in my recent review, I would come back for the brunch that everyone raves about, and that I did. Stopped in for new year's day brunch with the bf to a surprise it was jam packed! Lucky for us as soon as we walked in we got a table for two right in front. Score! Looking over the brunch menu I decided on the "burekas" which came with an Israeli salad, labane cheese, eggs and some pita. The bf ordered the "Israeli breakfast" that consisted of eggs, labane cheese, Israeli salad, potatoes and pita. Basically same as mine lol. We also ordered a side of their blueberry pancakes that came with fresh fruit. When I got my dish, I wasn't too pleased. First of all I ordered burekas, what I got was they smallest little puff pastry. I atleast thought I would get two! However, it was decent, filled with feta and olives. The eggs were good and the salad as well. I enjoyed the cheese and pita the most. Same goes for the bf's dish. The pancakes were really good on the other hand. The fruit was super fresh and juicy and the pancakes were made well. I was a little disappointed with their brunch but their menu was also large, so I still have some hope that the other options will be better. I will come back to try some other dishes. Sidenote: brunch was a little pricey!
