Wonderful first time experience for Burmese cuisine. The Coconut Galanga soup is amazing with a small spicy aftertaste to cleanse your palate for the main course. Galanga is akin to ginger in taste. The Burmese Tofu Salad was a perfect light course sprinkled with sesame seeds and a very tasty dressing. I indulged in the 6 layer bread with Curry Potato dipping sauce. Beware, I took too much of a hearty bite and ended up burning the back of my throat with the soups spicy goodness. Once forewarned I worked my way around the bite and enjoyed the bread and curry. I must confess I went all in, and had the Rice Pudding with Mango. Yum. Hope to be back soon when I am in Philadelphia.
