Pricey, pricey, pricey -- but worth every penny. Amazing knowledgeable wait staff, impeccable delicious inventive food (inventive does not mean trendy or whacky here), great wine list. It is my favorite restaurant in NYC. Marc Forgione is a great chef/owner and he and his partners obviously do a great job of operating. We live in the neighborhood and discovered the restaurant before Marc became famous and the restaurant sought after. So our only negative is that it is extremely hard to get a reservation!
