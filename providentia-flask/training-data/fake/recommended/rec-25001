Had dinner on Sun actually for my birthday.  Was excited to try it out but left disappointed - the service was very poor.  The appetizers however were good but it went downhill from there and they really didn't seem to care although they did give us complimentary champagne when we got the check.  I may refrain from returning until I hear they beefed up staff and enlightened them on customer service
