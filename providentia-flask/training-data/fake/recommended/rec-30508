I love love Hillstone... The Greeters here don't quote proper wait times. If it's 40 minutes I'll wait, if it's an hour and a half I won't. If I'm quoted 40 minutes I want to sit in roughly 40 minutes. This particular greeter, Hari, told me after quoting 40 minutes and an hour had elapsed, that it'd be an additional 10 minutes. Just be honest up front. As a former Hillstone employee I know if a shopper came in and wasn't seated within quoted wait time, greeters were written up.
