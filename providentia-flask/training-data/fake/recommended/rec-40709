The crepes were good but there were two problems during our visit: 1. everything was being prepared by the same person who was accepting money at the cash register, no gloves.... crepes and fruit on them arranged by hands. This is unacceptable. 2. the person had no idea about their current deals and no clue what to do with our Amazon Locals coupon. We ended up trading a $25 coupon for a $17 bill and no change... sorry but even if this was a replacement and the owner of the business or the person that normally works there couldn't be present - it is still your problem to train them properly before you use them.
