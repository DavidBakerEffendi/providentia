I have to review this because my experience was just OK and I feel like I have to share. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was about half full. The hostess told us there would be a 20 minute wait. We all found this strange as there were clearly many empty tables. So, we stood around for 20 minutes then finally got seated. Once we did, we waited another 10 to get our order in and then a good 40 minutes for our flatbreads. They actually brought us one by mistake at one point and then realized it wasn't ours and took it away. The food was good once we got it, but the lack in good, quick service kinda ruined it for me.
