This food was fine. It reminded me of wedding food-- It sounded fancy on paper, but the execution left something to be desired. "French fries with beef aioli" sounds pretty good, but when you factor in the fact that the fries tasted like they were from McDonald's, the beef aioli just ended up tasting like mayonnaise that someone dropped a burger in and left it there. This place wasn't terrible, it was really just meh, especially given the price. Oh well. At least the brisket tots and the bread were decent.
