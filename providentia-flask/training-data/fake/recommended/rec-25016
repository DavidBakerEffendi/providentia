Clean, bright, friendly service.  While I waited, I watched the chef pull the noodle dough into a long rope, twist it into a noose, and THWACK it against the marble table.  Great theater!   Got the pork chop hand-pulled noodle soup, which came with a knife and plate for cutting into the big ol' pork chop that I fished from the bottom of my bowl.  Toothsome noodles, heady broth, all made better after I stirred in some cilantro and hot sesame oil.  A great bargain for less than $6.
