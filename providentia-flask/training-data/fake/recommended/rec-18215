OK, $13 IS pricey for a bowl of noodle soup, but this was some seriously good noodle soup. Nice texture on the ramen (although I agree with tahnee a's review that they're a bit on the thin side) and the soup was really delicious. The pork melted in your mouth and I kicked myself for not ordering more. I do wish there was less MSG in the broth...I found myself parched walking out of the place. and some more veg toppings, like the ones at Mitsuwa. And the hard-cooked eggs were overdone with that ugly green ring around the yolk. We also tried the shisito peppers which were deep fried, I expected battered b/c they're fried, but they're not. The peppers came with a little dish of seasoned salt that tasted a little citrusy, maybe yuzu? Tasty, but again, pretty pricey at $7-8 for a small dish. Lastly, the wait staff were not especially friendly. They weren't rude by any means, but for a sit-down meal where I need to tip, I just expected a tiny bit more. Still, I'd go back.
