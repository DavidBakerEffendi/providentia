The wings were phenomenal, spicy BBQ sauce yum. However I got the fish and chips and subbed the fries for the veg of the day which was asparagus. The homemade coleslaw looked like it was a chopped onion salad with about an inch of liquid in the bowl it came in. The asparagus was mushy and greasy and the fish itself had a pool of grease in the center. I understand it's fried food but it wasn't seasoned and after 4-5 bites I put my fork down. We have had good experiences but will stick to going for lunch and for drinks and appetizers. Knowing that Halverson's is connected with the new strong steakhouse I'm a little skeptical of heading over there when the basics haven't been mastered at their sister restaurant.
