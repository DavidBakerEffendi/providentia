Great food, meh service.  Went here with another couple for dinner on a Friday.  Didn't hardly have to wait to get in, which was great.  I got the beetroot ravioli, which was dreamy. So good. The butter lemon sauce was delicious. My guy ordered the chicken, which was good, but not stellar.  Not sure what the other couple ordered, but they both seemed happy. I was thrilled to get Anchor Steam beer here, as I'm missing my SF home a bit and so it was a nice taste of what I could get there. Our waiter was meh, a bit slow, and so was the kitchen.  Took FOREVER to get our food and since the place played the music just a tiny bit too loud, it was kind of obnoxious, since it was kind of hard to talk through our wait.  However, the food was good, so it's mixed bag.  And the place was cuuuute.  Overall, few complaints, but just not a five star experience.
