I love the atmosphere of the place, love that it was playing the Cramps while we were there. However, the sandwiches, though tasty, start to feel like a very limited choice after two times of going there. Also, they are actually a bit too heavy on the cheese side (to the point of getting super greasy fingers). The coffee, on the other hand, PERFECTION.
