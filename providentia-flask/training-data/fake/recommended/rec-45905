Stopped in with a large group and ordered a cheeseburger,  after a long wait finally got our food one bite of my burger I realized that I had bitten into the paper that separates the cheese slices gross.  Haven't been back since.  They do have a large bar area with several small televisions so if you were looking for beers it's acceptable.
