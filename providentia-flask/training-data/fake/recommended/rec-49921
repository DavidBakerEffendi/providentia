Pinto is definitely the place to go for people who want to dine in a nice restaurant without paying for it.  We were shocked at the size of our bill, which easily could have been twice that.  Pinto just feels expensive: the service is great, the decor is subtle and sophisticated, it has the exclusive feel of a very small restaurant, and the food is interesting enough to set it apart from a run-of-the-mill Thai place. I don't want to repeat what others have said about the Thai iced tea, but I will reiterate that at least one person at the table needs to order it. We started with the dumpling appetizer, which was an herbed shrimp in what looked more like a ravioli than a dumpling and came with a truffle-infused soy sauce.  This was tender and delicious, if a little hard to eat. My boyf had the crispy chicken with 5 seeds that he really liked.  I had the basil with tofu and despite the tofu being a little chewy (I'd ask them to use shrimp or the soft tofu instead of fried the next time), I really enjoyed my dish.  The flavors were nice, and it came with zucchini, mushroom, asparagus, and onion.  It was not spicy at all, though, so if you get this dish and want to sweat, tell them. All in all we loved this place and hope to go back some day.
