one of the VERY BEST cheap eats in NY or Anywhere. But it's also super delicious, forgetting the unbeatable 5/$1 price. The huge cast iron grill creates the best crunch to the pan-fried dumplings.  Go for the boiled 10/$2 if you want a healthier eat. Scallion Pancakes, focaccia-to-die-for for $0.75  a piece.  Worth the subway ride & a walk to eat here! This is a real place that you go for food.  For hipster ambiance, go down to Vanessa's..
