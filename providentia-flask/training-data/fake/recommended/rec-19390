Went here with a few friends one night after a long day at work. Since it was later in the evening, the wait wasn't too long, but the place was still packed. Overall, I was not blown away. As a vegetarian, I was disappointed that many of the vegetable dishes had meat in them. However, I think if I ate meat, this place would be great. I got the tofu garlic sauce style (I chose the extra firm tofu and probably I should've gone with firm) and it was just okay. Kinda like eating paneer (cheese) stir fry. Not my idea of a stellar meal. The star of the meal, though, was the spicy crispy cucumber. Two words: damn good. I think about them regularly and it's been months since I was there. I would give this place another chance just off the strength of those bad boys.
