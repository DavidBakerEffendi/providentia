Delicious.  Fresh pasta, nicely done vegetables, tender grilled calamari, warm cozy dining room.  Nothing super creative about it, but a really well-executed neighborhood Italian joint. A cautionary note is that the carafes of wine are small (half liter), but are about the right size for two people who don't want to get tipsy over dinner-- just don't expect giant pitchers of wine for 15 bucks.   Good place to keep in mind when everything else is super busy on a friday, and its too cold to stand around on the sidewalk waiting for a table.
