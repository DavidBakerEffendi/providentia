Modified banh mi! Stopped by here for a quick dinner before getting my haircut. I got the "hog" to go and was going to only eat half, but it was so good that I just ended up demolishing the whole sandwich right on the spot. Price is good too and the guys that work there were so nice. They even brought out a tray for me since I had decided to stay. There's not much seating minus a few stools so you gotta either take it to go or hope that there's an open seat for you. Cheap eats in the village! I shall be returning for another hog or something new!
