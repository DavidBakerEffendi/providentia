Not sure why we were the only table here between 7-9pm on a Sunday, because the food/drinks were great and waitress was lovely. Def recommend the chiatara pesto with shoestring fries (carbs on carbs but whatever, worth it) and the burratta appetizer. Leather booths, cool wallpaper and an overall old school vibe. Hope this spot picks up because a date in a silent restaurant doesn't feel very cozy or romantic.
