Now that my proximity to this fantastic little establishment is coming to an end, I'm growing a bit nostalgic and may wax a bit sentimental in my review. First of all, I find it hard to believe I haven't written a review of this gem of a spot already. Atmospheric with a Victorian/French steampunk/bicyclist theme, this spot occupies a strange little corner in a neighborhood that offers very few charms. I have to say, I was thrilled with that I found when I pulled open that heavy rusted door that first weekend I moved in down the street almost a year ago. Come in for lunch! They serve that now. Cash only, as always. But it gets really lovely in the evening when they turn the lights down low. Then, you're someplace that's not Brooklyn anymore and Â there's a warm, sticky date cake with real, unsweetened cream that will shut you up for several good minutes. The rest of the food is decent, but I'd say Moto is more of a spot for ambiance, perfect for lovers and good friends--gather in circles at the bar or elbow-to-elbow over a small candlelit table--and just listen to that live band playing their old timey jazz.
