Pricey and pretentious, but good. Another user stated, "reputations are earned over time, not conjured by appearing elitist," and couldn't be more correct. I work in this neighborhood and live nearby, so I was excited to see a new dining option. I'm not sure if the owners considered the fact that this neighborhood is home to a lot of offices, perhaps mostly offices. As such, a lot of restaurants in the area aren't even open for dinner. Unfortunately there are no options appropriately priced or sized for lunch. The pizzas can easily serve one person, but at about $12, are not priced for lunch. If you try to share one, it's barely a snack. The fact that a new restaurant with a very limited menu felt the need to specify the "no substitutions" policy in writing was a bit of a turnoff. You expect that arrogance in fine, established restaurants, or in the rude, family owned dives rooted in nostalgia, but not from new businesses trying to establish a reputation. The food is made to order, so there is no reason the chef couldn't leave one ingredient out of a salad or off a pizza. New chefs need to stop watching Food Network. Your customer comes first and foremost, and some of them don't like spinach. That said, I can't complain about the food itself. It's pizza. It's good. There's not much more to say. I hope this place finds its niche in this neighborhood because I'd like to see it stick around. But if they don't add some lunch options and drop the attitude, it's not going to last.
