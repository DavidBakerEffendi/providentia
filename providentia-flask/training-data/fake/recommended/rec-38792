The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the eats are basic coffeehouse eats. This place is standard. So why the four stars? Because they have softserve. I'm not vegan, but I'm always watching out for places that keep even a couple vegan alternatives and B2 certainly knows its clientele because just about anything on the menu can be vegan. It's all pretty good, too, from the vegan softserve icecream to the vegan cupcakes. The staff is perfectly happy to make suggestions to undecisive people. I'd asked for some tea advice, and the barista came through and delivered on the spot. What more can you ask from a coffee joint?
