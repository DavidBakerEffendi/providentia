This lovely Worcester Diner Car has been cleaned up and lovingly restored inside by the new(er) owner of the Parkway. As a local I went to the Parkway when I was young and took some time "off" as the quality of the diner slipped. When Corey & Phil opened this back up under the Parkway name I was thrilled!!! The interior is clean & sparkles as it used to when I was a kid. The food. Â Oh the food is AWESOME! A basic, simple menu but done well. Locally sourced food is used when possible and the quality of all ingredients is great! *Nothing* languishes in a freezer at this diner. The home fries are top notch along with the pancakes and eggs benny! Corey & Phil like to put a twist on traditional dishes and giving the patron a scrumptious meal. (Ask Phil about his Chipotle Hollandaise sauce for eggs benny) Just remember folks that this is a SMALL intimate diner. 7 booths and roughly 30+/- stools so be prepared to wait if it is a busy day. Per "diner etiquette" the unspoken rule is that you wait for a booth or, if counter space is free, you sit at the counter. (NO going from the counter to a booth) Well worth the wait!
