When you don't feel like making it yourself, I think Amy Ruths is the best alternative. It's always packed (it's a landmark, so I expect it), but once you sit down to eat, your mouth and gut will be glad that you did. The coconut cake is to die for. And they're open 24 hours on weekends. How much more amazing could it possibly be? I love this place.
