This place is great in concept, but poor in execution. It's concept is that it's convenient healthy food. But it's really just clever marketing of pre-made food. I went for line one day and thought the food was OK, worth a 3 star rating. Chicken felt slightly rubberized and portions were small (any place can keep the calorie count down if the portions are small). Then I decided to go for breakfast on my way to work one day... I go up and look at the menu, and see everything has mushrooms on it. Ok no prob, I'll just get it without mushrooms. I place my order and ask for no mushrooms, and the cashier pulls out what looks like a nfl coach's play card and says "I'm sorry but the only thing we can take off that item is...the sauce" I change my order to something else, and she goes back to that card, they can't take anything off but the sauce. The third selection? You guessed it, everything stays on but the sauce. So this place fails in two ways: you can't customize an order, big no no. Second failure is that it's clearly all pre-made. You expect me to believe a place is really that healthy if all the food is pre made and frozen/preserved? No thanks, I'll just go to juice generation for a breakfast smoothie instead.
