I don't know about this place, just ok... Not good, not bad, but ok. I expected a lot more. Came for brunch with 2 other couples and the food had no zazazu to it, the restaurant had no energy, and food took too long to come out. Maybe we need to try it for dinner, but our experience was just bluh. Also they have no liquor, only wine and beer.
