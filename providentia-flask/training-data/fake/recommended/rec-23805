Fogo is one of those restaurant's thats so good you hope they'll have a location in heaven. I have been fortunate to visit the location in Brazil (Rio) and I can tell you that the location in Philadelphia is no different... simply amazing! I love the fact you can try any of the delicious meats prepared in 3 different temps. My fave is Picanha! In addition to that the salad bar is the best I've ever had as well. I mean you have a bowl of bacon up there for Pete's sake! Keep it up Fogo your bringing smiles to meat lovers faces Worldwide!
