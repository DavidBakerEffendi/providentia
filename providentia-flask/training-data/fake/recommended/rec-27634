thanks yelpers!! this place was freakin' de-RICIOUS. i brought four of my good friends to this place and i tried to make everyone get a different entree so i could sample but the pork tenderloin seemed like a hit for two out of the five of us. i personally ordered the snapper in a green curry sauce - which was yummie!!! if i had to rank our dishes... 1. spicy meatballs (this should come as an entree or something) 2. snapper 3. fluke 4. pork tenderloin 5. hanger steak *i posted pics of the entrees in here.
