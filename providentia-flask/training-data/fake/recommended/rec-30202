The food is authentic Japanese an te restaurant is nicely decorated, but the night turned sour when the waitstaff painfully brought out dishes in 15 minute intervals one by one with not regard for what dish was an entree or appetizer, or who ordered what. I also tried to order out for lunch and the wait was 30 minutes. Too bad, it's right next to my office.
