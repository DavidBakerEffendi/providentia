Really really heavy pizza - Just  not good.   I went here with my wife due to all the hype we had been hearing from friends and reviews and it was soo bad.  We could not even finish the slices (we split a plain and an artichoke slice).  Bad ingredients = bad pizza.  Too oily and the slice just fell apart - cheese falling all over.  Not worth a trip - actually not worth it if it was free! I understand all people have different tastes as some of my friends enjoy the pizza here but just way to heavy for my stomach.
