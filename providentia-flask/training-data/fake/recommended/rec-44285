My wife and I moved to Hamden from New Haven about 5 years ago, and were excited by the idea of walking to the local Spring Glen restaurants (we kept resisting moving out of New Haven because we didn't want to go to the suburbs and miss out on being able to walk to lical shops and restaurants, which turned out to be pretty silly since in New Haven we lived a mile from any stores and now we have a ton that are a five minute walk away). We quickly grew disappointed with the local options...except for Paul & Eddy's. This place has become a regular go-to restaurant for us, somewhere we get takeout about once every 2 weeks. We'll still hit Frank Pepe for a special treat once in a while, but Paul & Eddy's is our regular place and we're happy it's so close. This is New Haven style pizza without the lines and attitude and hassle of going to the best New Haven joints. To be clear, if you are traveling specifically with the idea of sampling the best of the area's style, you should go to somewhere like Frank Pepe or Sally's. Paul & Eddy's isn't quite up to those standards in terms of pizza (not quite same char or the same quality of toppings), but it's still very good. You don't have tomwait forever, they do delivery and takeout, and the pizza is always hot and tasty. And everyone is nice: the guy who runs the place, the kids working there, the people eating there. Recommended.
