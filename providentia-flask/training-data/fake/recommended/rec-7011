I came here at 10:30 on a Saturday--no wait right off of the bat, which was awesome, although the place quickly filled up as I was eating.  I was instantly greeted & sat at a cute little spot by the window.   My service overall was amazing--my server was super attentive and helpful; she clearly enjoyed working there.  The owner, John, also introduced himself-- this is a man who takes pride in what he does and knows his breakfasts!! I was torn between several menu items but decided in the end to build my own biscuit.  The fried chicken was crispy & delicious, the gravy was light & flavorful, and the biscuit was buttery heaven.  The portion was perfectly sized and a great value for the price. I also recommend the prickly pear mimosa.  It was tart & the most beautiful shade of pale pink. My only regret about my experience here is that I didn't take a bag of pumpkin biscuits to go!
