I have been staying in philly for 6 years and always come back here for the Â linguini cielo e mare as pasta dish. Pizza was okay here....kind of dry....and salad was not that tasty. The only dish dragged me back is this pasta dish. Also their stuffed mushroom is pretty delicious too...crispy top with marinated mushroom. Meatball spaghetti was pretty good too. Its basically street parking and they are located in center city so you can def walk around after a nice pasta meal.
