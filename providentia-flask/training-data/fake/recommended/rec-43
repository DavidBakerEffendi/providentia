Came here for the first time last Saturday and was really impressed. This is a really good indian restaurant in the city. It's not authentic indian but it's more modernized indian. The food is amazing here some of my favorites are the drums of heaven and the seared scallops. The drums of heaven have a nice spice to it and it's not overwhelming spicy and everything in the dish complements well. Seared scallops are out of this world it goes especially with the sambar it just makes the dish even better. For those not in the city not to worry they have a location in collingswood, so def try it out you won't regret it.
