Had lunch here today - Thin fries were very good. The turkey sandwich was very good too albeit entirely too packed with turkey. There was easily enough turkey in the sammie for a second one! Overall good comfort food, good service and a nice and airy restaurant. It was packed but didn't feel crammed.
