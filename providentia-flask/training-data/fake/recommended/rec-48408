Boyfriend and I had such a magical date here, that I can't give it less than 4 stars. The wine pairings and service were exceptionally good. He had the $65 tasting menu. I ordered multiple delicious things of the menu, mostly seafood or vegetable dishes, in no particular order. Each dish was loving presented, a tad too salty, and immersed in butter. I enjoy rich food, but this was too much. The meal ended with bittersweet chocolate truffles. When they arrived we both laughed and shook our heads. We couldn't bring ourselves to eat more than a nibble despite both being chocolate fiends. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will order the lightest things on the menu. Most of us wouldn't think of applewood as a soup and salad place, but I imagine it is the most decadent soup and salad anywhere.
