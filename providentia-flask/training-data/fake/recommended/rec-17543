I love cuban food and this restaurant is currently on my top list! I went here after my friend recommended this place and fell in love with it. The food is great and the decor makes you feel like you're in a cuban restaurant in Miami. My favorite appetizer is sangria ceviche - and i usually don't like ceviches - but this one definitely made me melt! My favorite dish is churrasco el gaucho! I only gave 4 stars cuz they only have 0.5% of alcohol on their sangria so you have to bring your own wine! But, my absolute favorite sangria is the asia de cuba :) I would definitely come back here again!
