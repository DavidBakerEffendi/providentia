We visited this restaurant for the first time on a Friday evening to celebrate a birthday.  We had a great overall dining experience. The host took us down the hall, through the dining room, to the garden outside and sat us a great table in the back where we could soak in the whole atmosphere.  It was still light out and the air temperature went from hot to comfortably warm making it the perfect evening to dine al fresco. The entire staff was friendly and helpful and often very witty. You could choose from a 3-course, 4-course, or 5-course menu each at a fixed price.  There were approximately 14 small plates to choose from plus dessert.  Each dish was more interesting than the next. We finally figured out what courses we wanted and the food came shortly thereafter.  Prior to that, we were sipping our San Pellegrino and snacking on the delicious marinated olives. The food was presented creatively and was very delicious. Although on the expensive side, we felt it was worth the money for a memorable dining experience to celebrate a special occasion. BYOB
