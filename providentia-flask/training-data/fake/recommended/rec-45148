I love this place - the food is really, really solid. Great entree choices, pasta cooked correctly and you get homemade Italian cookies after dinner. People who complain about the lack of parking, or bad wines by the glass really don't understand the appeal of this place. Being Italian myself, Sunday gravy is a must in my household but there are some weekends where a break is needed. Do you go to this restaurant for an elegant Italian meal (no) - but I would (and have) gone here on a Sunday as a "substitute" for my cooking and have always had a great experience. Wait staff is very friendly and the chef is very accommodating in regards to tweaking entree selections. Oh and the portions are immense - not huge to cover up the lack of quality ingredients, but huge as in anyone who grew up in an Italian household knows that you will never leave the table feeling anything less than satisfied.
