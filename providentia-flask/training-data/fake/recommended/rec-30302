My husband and I came here for dinner by the recommendation of a sales person at one of the stores in Soho. I loved the food. The only downfall is the restaurant's small space and the fact that we can only pay in cash. It was a bit hard to find in the dark since their sign has a black border. The place is rather small and cramped (just about 4 tables and 4 sets of benches) but luckily we found a whole table to ourselves...for a short time until 2 girls came to sit with us at the end of the table. I had the posh PLT panini (prosciutto, lettuce, and tomato plus aoli sauce and avocado), which comes with a small side of salad drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. It was amazing! The sauce and the vinaigrette really topped it off. The girl next to us kept looking at me because I kept saying "OMG this is so good!". Apparently, this wasn't her first time here, and she was not as impressed anymore. My husband's pesto spaghetti was really good too. He was really into the pesto sauce. It was not too creamy and not to strong. We knew that the burgers were good here, but we weren't in a burger mood. We'll definitely try them next time!
