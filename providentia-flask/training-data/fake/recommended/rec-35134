I had heard about the place through a friend and wanted to try it.  I was surprised, my initial impression from the pictures and menu online was that it was a small cafe where I could grab a quick bite and some coffee.  I was pleasantly wrong.  The food was good, the staff attentive and the space calm and welcoming. Maybe I was weirdly early or cause it was because I was by myself but it was a bit awkward.  It's a great place that definitely needs to consider it's audience a bit more, especially since it's so close to city college but doesn't really have a menu or setup geared towards a commuter school.  Can't wait till they are a bit more grounded and ready, it will be great!!
