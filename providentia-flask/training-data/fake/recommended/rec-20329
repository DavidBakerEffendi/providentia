We love Frankie's--the food is fantastic and we love that they're totally open-minded about making vegetarian substitutions to what is a a pretty meat-heavy menu. The ambiance is cozy and cute, and their outdoor garden is gorgeous. We've been here for lunch and dinner on weeknights and weekends. Although there is usually a wait, it's never terribly long and the staff make you comfortable during your wait. Highly recommended!
