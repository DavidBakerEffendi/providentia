Absolutely my favorite restaurant in NY. The burgers are famous and have been shown on Food network as one of the best in the country. Personally, I have never ordered one, but my friends love them. I order everything else. D Their menu changes seasonally, so it's hard to reccomend the food items other than the wonderful burgers. However, there are some that keep coming back. Duck Confit with veggies and Butternut Squash Gnocchi is my favorite meal on the planet! Cod and Chips are perfection. They do a fried chicken once a week that is to die for. Because they are in a polish neighborhood, they get the best sausages you will ever find. THE BIG SECRET.  They do this thing called a Langos which is a fried dough that seems somewhere between a pizza dough and a funnrel cake. You can order a dessert langos but on the original menus were Langos with sausage garlic and cheese. they called it a Pub Langos. I don't know why, but it was taken off the menu but it was the most exciting appetizer I ever had. Wether you are having a meal or something to eat at the bar - THE GREATEST THING EVER. it's not on the menu but..... you can request it. Ask for a sausage and cheese langos ! You will love it and hopefully they will put it bck on the menu. One order gives you a small pizza looking thing 9 inches diameter. Great for up to 3 people. On a rare occasion, the owners wife makes her specialty. It's a dessert cake called Kremish. Should you be there on a night it is available, order it and  bask in it's glory.
