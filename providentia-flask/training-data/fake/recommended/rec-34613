To say this place is playfully eclectic is an understatement.  Its quite difficult to find a place that offers classic asian dishes reinterpreted for a modern vibe and dishes that fuse different cuisines and does it all well.  Case in point the ridiculously good pork buns with crispy pork belly, a wonderfully crunchy crunchy slaw that still tastes asian...and then the smokiness of the mayo suddenly reminding you of smoked pork butt ala Carolinas! Contrast this with the roast duck with beautiful crispy skin, but  yet with enough of the fat to inform you that it is definitely duck you are eating...a dish elevated by the grains and winter squash accompanying it.  On other visits the small dishes have varied from excellent pickles, a mackerel that reminded me of dingy Korean joints to so so hearts.  But its always fun to eat and and fun place to be.  I could talk more about the other dishes on the menu, but this would then turn into a drool fest that my bib cannot take, so I will stop at saying stand in line if you need to for getting in an grabbing a bite in this place. Better still if you can get 4-5 other people with you and order most of the menu to enable gustatory delights for the entire party.
