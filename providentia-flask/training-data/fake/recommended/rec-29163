This is a great place to eat sushi in Center City. I ordered the sushi lunch special--a Rainbow Roll which came with miso soup and salad for $13.00. If you have time, it's so worth it to pay the extra money to eat here rather than take-out sushi. The roll was just so fresh and sushi rice was cooked perfectly. Miso soup was so flavorful that I just wanted to drop my spoon drink from the bowl. The salad was pretty big and served with a side of tasty ginger dressing I love. The restaurant decor is classy. Everything is served in nice Japanese style plateware. Service is attentive and food came out timely. Cash only and BYOB.
