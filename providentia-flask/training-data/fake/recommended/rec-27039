Good Sicilian pie however the penne vodka was pretty tasteless and super heavy. Way too much cream in the sauce here guys. Have yet to try any other non pizza item on the menu and doubt I will if u can't nail down a good penne vodka. Maybe just a bad day in kitchen Â shape up here mr Bruno I mean the pizza terminal.
