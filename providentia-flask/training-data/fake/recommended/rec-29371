The roast pork sandwich definitely rivals the cheesesteak. I ordered mine exactly like Adam Richmond from MvF. Classic roast pork with greens and sharp provolone. The broccoli rabe gave the sandwich a slight bitterness, while the sharp provolone took it to a whole new level. The roast pork was perfectly cooked and juicy. If you are new to Philly, deviate from the masses and skip the cheesesteak. Drop by Reading Terminal and grab a roast pork sandwich from DiNics. The wait is worth it!
