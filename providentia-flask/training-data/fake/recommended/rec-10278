I was visiting Hartford, Ct. from the San Francisco Bay Area and decided to try City Steam Brewery.  I went here the four nights I stayed in Hartford.  The bartenders and patrons were friendly and the beer was good.  I really nice place to hang out.  I would come back to City Steam if I was ever back in Hartford.
