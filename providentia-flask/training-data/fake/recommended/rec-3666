Everytime I've come here (for brunch... must try dinner soon!) I've walked away fully satisfied. A few friends have commented on the choice "Mexican for breakfast? That's aggressive." But it's not exactly what you're thinking. This is the richness and warmth that you want from brunch food, with a slight bent towards avocado and beans. If you're in a sweet mood there are pancakes and french toast. Every brunch-er walks away happy! Brunch ($11.95) comes with coffee, tea or juice -- a few bucks extra for a boozy drink -- and a basket of mexican sweet breads to nibble on while you wait for food. The huevos ahogados have soo much flavor (thin chorizo slices, fresh guac, poached egg and jalapeno hollandaise on a slightly sweet bun) served with a generous salad and ungreasy breakfast potatoes. If you're not in a hearty mood - go for the eggless plato don... but its certainly not "lighter" -- you'll get a stand and a humongous platter of refried beans, grilled veggies, and various spreads and a pile of corn tortillas to experiment with. Obviously, others in the neighborhood know about the beauty of Chavela's brunch, so it fills up fast. It's not that it feels overly loud and crowded inside, but the wait can be unpredictable. Last time I went, we arrived before they opened and there was already pockets of groups standing patiently outside waiting to be seated.
