Pretty amazing. Great selection of sides, very unique dishes, great specials, packed but friendly and inviting atmosphere. Love the handwritten menus. Delicious. 3 locations...will return when I return to NYC. Not much else I can say--it's a pretty good healthy place in the midst of the crazy greasiness of NYC sometimes.
