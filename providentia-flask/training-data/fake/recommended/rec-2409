Maybe it's because I'm from California, and have always had crappy cheesesteaks...but Geno's cheeseteak with Provolone was the best darn sandwich I've ever had.  Being back home makes me sad, because I wish I could get a cheesesteak from Geno's.  Someone please tell me where I can find a comparable cheesesteak in Southern California and I will love you forever.   By the way, the Hot Sauce is really really hot...be careful.  All in all, I enjoyed it a lot and wish I had gotten one to go while I was there.  Unfortunately I was only there for one day.
