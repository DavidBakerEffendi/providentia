I have been coming here regularly for about a year now, and my last visit the food was not great. The famous grilled Mexican corn was not evenly seasoned and seemed to have been thrown together. My fish tacos seemed a bit soggy, and worst of all the chicken in my husband's enchiladas suizas was totally dry (overcooked) and the enchiladas were folded like tacos (not enchiladas). I'm not sure if I'll go back.
