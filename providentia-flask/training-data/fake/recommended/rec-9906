I was looking for something "different", read the reviews and discovered it was super close, so went there with 2 friends. I concur with the reviews -- A yummy find with super large portions. The beef dish was absolutely delicious, the chicken was great too. Sauces are spicy just right and the side dishes are appealing. Covina fish with mustard sauce gets a thumbs up. The Sangria really packs a whollop.... I was expecting watered down fruity wine, but... this one has a surprising large amount of rum and brandy!! And yes, the drawback is the noisy dining area. My advice is to come for an early as possible dinner. Â We went around 6-ish on a week night. Quiet at first, but by 7:30 / 8pm people had literally poured in and the decibel level had gotten to the uncomfortable level.
