"This place survives because of its name, not its awful food or racist business practices" Food: 1/5 Service: 1/5 Atmosphere: 1/5 Parking: 1/5 Cleanliness: 1/5     Geno's will receive the worst review I have made on yelp to date. Absolutely dreadful.    Philadelphia is certainly not famous for being a "clean" city and the surrounding neighborhood of this restaurant is testament to this fact, almost third world actually. However, this famous Philly restaurant surely does NOT live up to its name.    To begin, the whole restaurant is surrounded by bumper stickers saying "speak English to order" or "Press 1 to speak English, press 2 to get deported" Wow, way to live in the legal gray area we call being a rude, bigoted business owner. Not to mention the outdoor area was absolutely filthy with trash literally in the streets, dirty unwiped tables, the whole nine. Looking indoors, the food prep area looks aged, dirty, and overall unsanitary.   Service is rushed, rude, and very gruff. Perhaps coming from the suit-and-tie culture of DC and landing in the blue collar world of Philly is the real culture shock for me but more likely, the employees here just behave rudely and rush people through.  Parking is non-existent, good luck. Otherwise, I've had better cheesesteaks at diners in rural Virginia...I'd rather eat at subway in fact. Maybe I'll order in Spanish just to spite this terrible restaurant we call Geno's.
