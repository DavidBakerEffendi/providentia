It wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but it was certainly tasty. We got one cheesesteak from Pat's and one from Geno's and to tell you the truth, they were pretty much the same. The main difference is the overbearing "America is for English speakers RAH RAH RAH!" crap at Geno's so should I find myself standing at the corner between the two again, I'll go Pat's all the way.
