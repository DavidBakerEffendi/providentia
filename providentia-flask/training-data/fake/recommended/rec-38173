The ambiance is awesome. The bartender, Andrea, was incredible. She was very friendly, made great drinks, and is extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We decided to sit outside on the heated patio, great choice after the horrible Winter we had it was nice to get some fresh air. We ordered the table side guacamole which was light and delicious. I had the chicken burrito (do not think Chipotle) very manageable and fresh. He had the lobster mac with chourizo. Being 6'10" with a large appetite, he actually packed half of it to go because the portion is SO large. Obviously we needed to finish the meal off with dessert. We chose tres leches, which was moist and delicious. We both had driven roughly two hours a piece to meet up, with New Haven being the half way point. Neither of us had spent time in NH and we were really happy in finding Geronimo's. We spent over three hours catching up, and our server was kind and not overbearing. Thanks for the wonderful dining experience!!
