i went there just because a friend of mine who's visiting from wyoming looked inside and found the bar and the idea of japanese grill interesting... i'm a big fan of cheap eat. but robataya did a decent job of defeating me. we sat at the bar where all the yelling and grilling was going on. the server took the order from you and then yelled it out to the chefs who did the grilling in front of you. the chefs will climb over the grill or use their little oar to get the raw ingredients, which were hanging out in front of you. you know fish, squid, steak, veggies, etc. the whole thing was fun to watch. and it's fun to see the way they prepare the food, which is very cool. we ordered a whole red snapper, scorpion fish, cod fillet, enoki, zucchini, japanese yam, and mochi! they were all good. but the cod was the best thing of the meal. oh and we also got the rice with salmon and salmon roe. the food was excellent. but the service was really slow though. we waited for 30 minutes, which wasn't bad for a friday night dinner. but the whole cooking thing took kinda forever. they grilled things very slowly. that made the food really good especially when you have to grill the whole fish. but the whole meal just took forever because we had to wait for 15 minutes for anything we ordered. we had a lot to catch up so the wait wasn't a problem. but it would suck if you came with someone you bring to entertain but you don't want to hang out with e.g. customers from work. but it should be good for dates though. and the chef was attentive. he knew that i was waiting anxiously for my enoki to come and told me that he would make that next. and he had a nice smile but that's beside the point. interesting dining experience. but i love my hole-in-the-wall food though.
