I agree with everyone on the price but I did receive a coupon for a free pitcher of their house lager.  This was also pretty good. I ordered a pizza (with anchovies) and thought it was quite tasty.  I like my pizza a bit softer but still, I enjoyed my meal...and hearing the Italian accents in the background. Another cool note...I do like the bathroom with the vintage playboy covers.  It was fun random aspect of the restaurant/bar. AND....(sorry)...I also agree with the poster about not going here unless you live in the area.  I only heard about it through a local paper.  Still though, I'd go again.
