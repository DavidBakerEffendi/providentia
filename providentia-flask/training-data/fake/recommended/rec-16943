Great SANGRIAS! [BYOB] The food is pretty good depending on what you get. I've been here a total of 3 times and ordered the flounder, coconut shrimp, and pork chops. All were priced well with decent flavors, not too dry or bland. Service is always on the slower side.. They are always packed so you have to pick the less busy times to go, such as late lunch or early dinner. Come with cash! Or make sure you keep your copy of the receipt!! The 2nd time I ate here, they overcharged my credit card and when I called to get a copy of my receipt the manager was never around!!
