At this place, it's all about the quality baguette, great head cheese, and great pate.  This is a good hearty sandwich that will just make you happy from the inside out. Plus, the guys that work there are super friendly and fun.   Prices here are great for the fresh quality ingredients you get.  The bread is always perfectly toasted.  They have whole wheat baguette too, if you're feeling healthy.  I always stick with the Super Cub Classic.  It IS super classic, and it never disappoints.  Especially if you don't skimp on the head cheese, pate, or hot sauce.  Yum! Note that the restaurant is small and there are maybe only 5 counter seats.  It's a quick eat & go type of place.  Orders also take quick some time -- about 10-15 minutes for your order, whether you ordered 1 sandwich or 4.  All that is totally worth it regardless.   Best banh mi in the city I think.  Hands down.   But don't tell everyone i said that.
