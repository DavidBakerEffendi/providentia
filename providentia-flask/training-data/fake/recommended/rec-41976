One of the BEST dining experiences that I have ever had. Perfect food, perfect service. Drink: From Beruit with Passion cocktail with basil and passion fruit flavors. It is unique and memorable. Eat: 1. You MUST order the Brussel Sprouts with grapes, fig jam, walnuts, and mint yogurt. They are over the top good, especially with the homemade pita bread. 2. The Chankleesh with rich and creamy feta cheese, onions, tomatoes, and zaatar spices. I was skeptical of this, but it was way better than the other traditional salad options. 3. The Mixed Grills for two people with chicken shish taouk, kafta, lambchops, and lamb kebabs. For only $64, it is the best way to sample a variety of dishes from the menu 4. The Ilili Candy Bar3. It is obnoxiously rich and delicious. I also loved the labne cheesecake though! Cannot wait to go back!
