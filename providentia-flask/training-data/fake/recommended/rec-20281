I went to Buttermilk Channel for a Christmas date dinner with my boyfriend. After a brief discussion on whether or not the bartender was more "lumberjack" or "seaman," we sat down at a cute two seater near the entrance. The menu was very much "home cookin'" and reminded me of the dishes you see at The General Greene. Lots of fried chicken and roasted, oily vegetables. One of the main reasons we chose Buttermilk, besides their reputation, is because they have a vegetarian menu with about 5 or 6 main veggie dishes. The waiter brought us two delightful and fluffy popovers as our bread. We ordered the hush puppies as a "snack" and the butternut squash tart as a first course to share." The hush puppies were crispy and delicious. The tart had interesting flavors. It was sweeter than we expected but still great. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles and I ordered the cheddar waffles with roast brussel sprouts and mushrooms as our entrees. My veggies were very roasted (meaning there is no doubt they were swimming in oil) and my waffles were fair. Considering everything else was so hot and crispy, I found them to be cold and limp. Great beer and wine list as well. Â Our bill totaled around $100. Overall, this is not a health food place! Come hungry and be prepared to see lots of fried buttery dishes. Like other Yelpers, I think it may be overrated considering that my dining partner and I felt like the menu was very familiar. For me, the snacks and veggie first courses seemed to be more interested than the entrees. I would go back.
