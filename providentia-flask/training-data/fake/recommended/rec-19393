Wow!!!!!!!!! I was in Philly last weekend for a short trip and it was recommended to go to this place. I had the burger which in itself was amazing but we ordered a side of the Fries that are fried in duck oil and topped with cheese. They were probably the best fries I have ever ate. There was a little wait for our table but our server was awesome and even recommended several bars for us to try why we were in town. Definitely find your way over to this place and get the fries!
