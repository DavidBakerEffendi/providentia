This place is a godsend.  After working in this area for over ten years, I was thrilled to see a place this good open up.  The Turlu is amazing and always made fresh.  Their lunch wrap specials are a great value for the amount of food you get (7.95 for a good sized sandwich and soup).   The Lamb and Okra stew has been the best thing I've tried from them so far.  Fresh okra that still snaps in your mouth, tender, well seasoned lamb chunks, and a slightly spicy tangy tomato sauce that makes your mouth water.
