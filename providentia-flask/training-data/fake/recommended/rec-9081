Went here with my wife and it was good.  Arrived at 8:00 p.m. and were seated within 20 minutes.  The sauteed calamari was decent-- a very large serving with tasty broth in the bottom of the dish.  For a main course I had the duck breast which was awesome and wife had skate with bacon on it-- a tasty piece of fish.  Dessert of flourless chocolate cake and ice cream was very good.  The pace of the meal was maybe a bit too rapid for me (seated for perhaps one hour total) but the service was good and the atmosphere quite nice.
