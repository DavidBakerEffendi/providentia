Stopped in last week with the wife for dinner, we took advantage of the "2 for $24 special" which was a great deal. A little disappointed that even though we only had soda, they only give you 1 drink per person. The menu did clearly state that so it wasn't a surprise, but I can't remember the last time I've been to a restaurant that wouldn't give you a free refill on a fountain soda. The shepherds pie was decent as was the brownie for desert. I gave this 3 stars as it was good but just not anything special; I'd call it a good "bar food" type of place. And come on, give your customers free refills on a coke.
