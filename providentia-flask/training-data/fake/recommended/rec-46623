so good! glad I found this place! I had the falafel sandwich! my only complaint is they only take cash(atm in the restaurant, nice), the girls aren't the friendliest (the girl w the short hair haha) at explaining what the food is bc I had no idea what they were putting in my sandwich or what any of the food was. While i was eating a lot of people walked in confused looking at the menu on the wall and walked out bc they were unfamiliar with that type of food. a detailed menu would be nice I think. ( as a vegetarian you get paranoid. but the sandwich was awesome and I will go back!
