cute and cozy little place to dine with someone you really like. i Â had the fish which was excellent(swordfish) fresh and zesty and cooked to perfection. my man had the pork which he seemed to love (ugh) only wine to be had here so have a stiff drink on your way. service was great; attentive good feeling place for that great meal you have been waiting for. pricey but worth it.
