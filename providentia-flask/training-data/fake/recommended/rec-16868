Back at Dartmouth to visit my grandma in the hospital. Sunday morning, hungry and looking for some delicious breakfast! After getting lost trying to find 4 aces, we found it and gave up once we saw the line that was out the door, it was rainy and a bit chilly, we drive over to the dunkin donuts and on the way I noticed Shyrl's. We park and walk over. The pros: My food was good tasting and I had no complaints, my mom liked her food and their homemade bread! Prices were affordable and extremely reasonable. The cons: My aunt thought her food tasted a little odd.The place is quite loud, cluttered and the waitress seemed a little frazzled, not friendly or welcoming really. Â  I probably wouldn't come here again, I wasn't fond of the vibe of the place. Too many people in a small space for me.
