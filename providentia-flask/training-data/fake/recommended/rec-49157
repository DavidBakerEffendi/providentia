Everything about his place was great - from the attentive and helpful servers to the tasty food and the atmosphere. It's definitely worth a visit, but you can't mind crowds or a wait. We had reservations but wound up having to wait an extra 45 minutes. The hostess was really on top of it, giving us frequent updates and bringing over some champagne for the inconvenience - exactly how the situation should be handled. Our server gave us her honest feedback on the menu and made recommendations that did not steer any of us wrong. The brussel sprouts are a must as was the cauliflower. And the fries. And the...well I could go on.
