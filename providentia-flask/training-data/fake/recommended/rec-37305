the steak was amazing , one of the juiciest I've had by far and the seasoning was abs amazing. I would definitely come back here for their steak. my boyfriend had their chicken entree and it was decent. we've had better. the atmosphere is really romantic and dark at night. good for those nervous first dates lmao
