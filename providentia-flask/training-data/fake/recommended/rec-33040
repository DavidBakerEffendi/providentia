Big big fan of Mistral! We have only been in once, but we were VERY impressed with the intimate and unique atmosphere, friendly service and delectable food!! We had such a great time and ordered just about everything on the menu - there were four of us! My highlights were the beautifully prepared Aged Muscovy Duck, Squash Bucatini, Smoked Pappardelle, and the warm melt in your mouth biscuits!!! (Salivating thinking about it)! My husband also loved the octopus!! This weekend I'm bringing a group of girlfriends (visiting the area for the first time) in to give them a taste of what I've been raving about and can't wait for round two!!!
