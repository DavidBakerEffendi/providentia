I was there last night with my wife and daughter for dinner. The place is really nice makes you feel like you are in a Miami style Cuban restaurant. The prices on the menu are really good because you get a lot of food. A lot of flavor on the good, their tapas menu is really good too. They also have a large variety of different Mojito flavors. I drove all the way from NYC and it was all worth it. I will recommend this place to everyone. You can also bring your own bottles of wine or beer to the place. The only thing I didn't like too much was that the mojitos don't have much alcohol but they are very refreshing and delicious.
