Thanks to Yelp and previous reviewers, I discovered this place today and had a great lunch.  It is so worthy of the 4.5 stars.  The Texas dog was awesome, very tasty.  I will be back for another one, or two, very soon.  Earl, the counter man, and owner, makes you feel like you are having lunch with him at his personal home.  Very friendly, attentive and totally welcoming!  I like my fries crispy and do wish they had been a little more done, but that's just me.  All in all a great fun place for lunch.  I will return soon.  Thanks, Earl!
