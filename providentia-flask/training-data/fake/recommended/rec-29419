This is the first true cheese steak sandwich I've had.  Nothing I've had back west has even compared (except Greasy Tony's in Tuscan, but they closed I think).  I got the steak with wiz, onions and peppers.  The roll was packed with juicy tender, gristle free meat and just the right amount of cheese.  The roll was chewy perfection, just enough bread to hold all the goodness in.  I got there around 1:30, so the lunch crowd had died down and I was able to sit down and order...no problem.  The staff was awesome.  Now for the sucky part.  I relied on my Garmon TomTom to get me there, and used it to get from there to the airport.  I figured I had plenty of time.  Well, having never driven in Philly before, I got a rude lesson in TomTom douchbaggery!!  This damn thing took me through every shithole neighborhood, project, crackhouse row in Philly before dieing just as it finally got me to the airport 30 min late for my flight!!!!! So, tac on the extra cost for fare, change fee, hotel, and car and this wonderful sandwich cost me over $500!!!!  Was it worth that much...no, but it was damn good, and one sandwich I will NEVER forget!!
