The food is always wonderful, but the lighting is always dark there. The service can be hit or miss but is usually OK. As it is in a very hipster area, it seems to be the trend that looking more hipster somehow excuses service ability. Aside from that, the food and margaritas are very good. Update: it took over an hour to get a check, let alone a glass of water the last time I went. Icing on the cake -- no toilet paper in the restroom. Get it together.
