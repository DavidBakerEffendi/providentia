If I had been shwasted, this greasy, salty hot mess would have been good. Alas, I was not, and so my sober taste buds nearly dried out from all the sodium. And the taziki sauce was gross. Like mayo-all-up-in-here gross. BF and I shared a combination platter, and asked for no lettuce per the advice of a regular customer. We thought that by asking for less lettuce we would get more meat or rice...I think we did, but some greens would have been a nice refresher in retrospect! But for six bucks and a fast moving line, you get what you get and so I shouldn't be throwing a sober fit.
