We came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy. We had to wait for about 25 minutes for a table. Thankfully we found seating in the bar and were able to grab a drink while we waited. We were seated in the patio area. We had good service. I ordered my own gf flatbread pizza and a gf beer Â and the rest of our party shared a pizza. The pizza actually was really good. The one start off is because I thought they were a little pricey compared to a other gourmet pizza places that I have been too. If I am back in the area I will definitely check this place out again.
