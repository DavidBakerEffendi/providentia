First visited the Dosa Man in 2007 with my daughter while visiting colleges. Just returned to NYC during Spring Break with my wife and made it a point to take her as well. She was not disappointed and we still wonder how he is able to serve such large and amazingly tasty portions. We also are I impressed with the amount of time he must put in preparing his "appetizers" in advance. If you are in lower Manhattan, treat yourself to the Dosa Man's cart!
