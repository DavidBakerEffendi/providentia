Small deli with decent prices for the city. It's simple and gets the job done. The staff is courteous. The only knock against the place is that their food is fresh, but not spectacular. Their sandwich names are pretty cool. Maybe I'm a tough critic or someone who is used to having a delicious lunch. Either way, this place is 3-4 stars. I'd go back if I was in the area and wanted to grab a sandwich.
