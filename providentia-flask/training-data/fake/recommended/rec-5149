Loved this place! Food isn't particularly unique but the ingredients seem to be really fresh and flavorful- definitely order things based off of what's in season (when we went, there was a list in the front). Boyfriend and I got the pre-fixed menu with wine pairings, and boy was that a treat. The atmosphere is very cute, romantic if that's your inclination but just intimate otherwise. The waitress was really friendly and explained each of the wines in detail. Great for special occasions
