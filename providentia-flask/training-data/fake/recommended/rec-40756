Was at Jones this past Saturday night and I absolutely loved it! The place was packed so the wait for a table took awhile. They have a bar where you could have a drink while you wait but again the bar was packed as well. The decor is great - from reading other reviews, I expected something more Brady bunch but I didn't get that at all. I liked the whole decor and ambiance of it all. It does seem much bigger when seeing pictures online - the place is not big at all - one open area with booths and tables and one bar to the right of the open area. As for the food, I loved it. I had pierogies - which were amazing and a iceberg wedge with blue cheese - which was great as well. My BF had a cobb salad which he loved and there was a lot of it - came out in a huge bowl. The only negative I could say is that it was very noisy due to the tons of people there...but that's not the restaurants fault. If you want a quiet night out for dinner, don't go on a Saturday night.
