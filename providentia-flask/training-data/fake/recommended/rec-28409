Funny story... We stopped at Breakwaters after the Booze Cruise last night on the lake watching the fireworks. We found a table and sat down while two in our party went to the bars to grab some beers. A waitress came by, asked if we were having food and gave us a menu. Then she didn't come back. For like 20-30 mins. We tried flagging someone down, but they were cleaning and clearing and not payin attention. Finally we saw a waitress helping the table next to us and when she was done, another guy and I said, "Excuse me" and got her attention. But at the same time, one of the guys with us said TO HIS GIRLFRIEND "Tits McGee". The waitress got very offended, saying, "That is NOT my name and I'm NOT your waitress" and stormed off. We weren't really sure what had happened because the guy wasn't talking to her nor paying attention to that side of the table. We watched her march up to her manager, gesture angrily toward our table, and then another waitress came over and basically told us - though very nicely - to leave. We explained what happened, saying many of of us worked in restaurants and would never say that to a server. She seemed to understand and returned to her manager, but again, from his gestures, we knew we had been blacklisted for the night. We didn't get any food but luckily one of is was up getting another round while all this was happening, so we at least had one more drink before we were followed out the door with angry eyes. It was just silly and unprofessional. Had a manager come over himself we could hve explained the situation. Instead, they got no more of our business, and since I don't live here, probably won't again. Sorry dudes.
