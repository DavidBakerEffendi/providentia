For starters, we made a reservation for 7:00 for 6 people to celebrate a friend's birthday.  We arrived 5 minutes early at 6:55 and were told that it would be at least a 35 minute wait.  Surprised and quite annoyed at having to wait so long, with growling stomachs, we were told that we could sit upstairs in the lounge near the bar and enjoy some drinks while we waited.  The atmosphere was modern and futuristic but quite odd, in my opinion.  The drinks were good, but pricey.  After around 30 minutes the hostess came over to where we were sitting and escorted us to our now-ready table for dinner.  We were seated, and then waited at least 10 minutes until we were greeted by our waiter.  At least we already had drinks to hold us over.  After our nearly dead waiter reluctantly and miserably took our drink order (waters all around) we were approached by a very irritated waitress.  The first words out of her mouth were, "What exactly are you ladies trying to get away with here?"  We were completely taken back by her question and asked what she meant.  She then informed us, that "All drinks ordered upstairs can not be brought downstairs until they are paid for!"  At this point my blood was boiling and I gave her an obnoxious apology and told her that we were unaware of their policy and we had assumed the drinks would be added to our bill, and that I did not appreciate her demeaning tone and assumption that we were trying to avoid paying.  I was highly offended and she offered no apology.  Our dinner was fare, and it came so quickly (less than 5 minutes after our appetizers) that the table became so crowded that we could not enjoy what was already in front of us.  We boxed some of it, left most of it unfinished, and left as soon as we could.  We finished our night at a cute little ice-cream shoppe across the street, to try and lift our spirits and satisfy our not-yet full tummies.  You could not pay me to go back.
