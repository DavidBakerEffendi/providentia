This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. It was introduced to me when I first moved to Manhattan and I have been a fan ever since. As everyone else says - yes - be prepared to wait. And be prepared to not get in on Saturday. They close briefly on Saturday afternoons before dinner. While "closed" isn't really closed - they stop taking new customers at 3:30 and reopen at 5 while trying to accomodate those that were already in line waiting. I recommend the Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri. It sounds strange - a cucumber with sesame oil - but it is delicious. As for the ramen - I haven't found one I don't like. Try the Miso. Unlike other ramen places in the East Village and another I have been to Uptown, the noodles are fresh. Ippudo's noodles are soft and chewy and not like the prepackaged ones I have had in other locations. Other than that, I love the atmosphere - it's dark and comfortable and you get a good cheer when you walk in the door. It's definietly an experience to be had if you are in/around Union Square.
