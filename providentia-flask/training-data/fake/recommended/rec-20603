It always happens that I find phenomenally wonderful places when I am hundreds of miles away from home.  (Boston)  This is one of those places. I just can't say enough good things about this place!  The pizza is amazing and not at all greasy or oily.  I loves the different menu choices and I love that they use local meats and cheeses.  It was delicious.   Also, the staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The food arrived quickly and was even better than we expected.  It was inexpensive, too-Dinner and drinks for two was less than $30.  You won't find that in Boston.
