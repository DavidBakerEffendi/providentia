If you are looking for some great tasting pizza with a spectacular view of the city skyline, go to Grimaldi's down by the Brooklyn Bridge. The wait can range anywhere from 10 minutes to more than an hour long, but if you happened to be in Brooklyn, it's not a bad stop to make. Patience is a virtue and it is worth the wait to see that steaming hot pie come right in front of you. I suggest getting a large pie, which is eight slices in total, and any topping that suits your fancy. The tomato base is slightly sweet and the cheese isn't very heavy on this thin crust pizza, so request for extra cheese if you're a cheese lover. If you are a fan of personal space, this is not the place for you! The tables are set up like a family-style sit down, so you'll be sitting very close to your neighbors. So close...you can reach over and grab a slice of their pie if they aren't looking! For those who are unable to make it to the Brooklyn location, Grimaldi's does have two new locations in NYC. The first location is right off the Long Island Expressway near the Douglaston area. The second location is right in Manhattan around west 20th st and 6th avenue, where Limelight use to be located. Both are fairly new and not quite well known as of yet, so check out those locales for some fine pizza!
