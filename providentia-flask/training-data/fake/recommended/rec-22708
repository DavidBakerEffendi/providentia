Cavos is one of our favorite places, and we come here quite frequently.  The staff are always friendly and it has a warm, casual environment.  They have the best hummus I have ever tasted.  We love to get the cold pikilia platter, which comes with their amazing hummus and also Skordalia, a great garlic potato dip that is delicious.  I love their lentil soup and my husband loves the creamy lemon chicken soup.  They also have delicious pizza and calzones.  Their entrees come with a salad and an entire loaf of garlic bread.  You get a lot of food for your money.
