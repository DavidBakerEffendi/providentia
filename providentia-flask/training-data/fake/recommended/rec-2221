One of the best paninis I've ever had.  I'm never disappointed when I come here.  I usually don't eat meat unless it's organic, but I'll eat it here because they import it from italy.  One of my favorite panini's is the gorganzola with prosciutto and fig spread as well as the one with speck and apricot spread.  (I love sweet and savory) Crostinis and antipastas are also always good.  On a cold day it's always nice to have some warm maple milk too!
