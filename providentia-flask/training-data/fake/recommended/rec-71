Fare was our local date night staple of choice. That may now change after a really disappointing visit. Ambivalent service, food was ok but lacking in imagination and execution. Seafood pasta was given flavor only by drowning it in cream, which felt lazy and unappetizing. Wouldn't have minded so much but it's not a cheap night out, and it used to be such a great place. What has happened Fare?! Not sure if the usual staff and chef we're missing in action or whether it's changed hands. Either way, we liked you just the way you used to be. We wouldn't be in a hurry to go back after tonight's performance. Â Pity, as this was one of Fairmount's stars. Hopefully it was a blip, but not sure if we'd want to revisit.
