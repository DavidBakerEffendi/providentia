I agree with all the reviews, eventhough they're all from out of town ; ] Pellegrino's is the best of Little Italy by far and I've been to a hand full of them. Pellegrino's really stands out and not by one certain dish, or the warm and attentive vibe you feel, but based on many positive factors (too many to list). And OMG the mozzerella corrozza beats any I've tasted before - it's perfect. This placed it unbelievable compared to their counterparts, the go-to spot when craving fine Italian cuisine in the neighborhood.
