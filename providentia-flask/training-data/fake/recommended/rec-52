I enjoyed this place, Its not everyday you get a creole based brunch. Its a nice alternative to the regular eggs benny, omelets you get at most brunch spots. Don't get me wrong, they serve up the regular items but its creole based which makes it pretty awesome. I ordered egg benny with crawfish ettouffe!!! It was pretty freakin delicious!!! I have not been here for dinner but will most certainly try it out now that I know they serve up creole/cajun food.
