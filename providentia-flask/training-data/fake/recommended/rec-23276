May have been the best Ribeye I have ever had last time there.  The pasta is the best pasta in Philadelphia.  Pizza is out of this world.  My go to place on Wednesday nights.  We love going, sitting at the bar, and sharing a couple dishes.  I have been there so many times and can't think of a single bad experience.  Ok.  Watch the white napkins on your black pants/dress.
