This place is a relic! One of the first Thai places in Chelsea.  I am surprised to see they are still kicking.   The decor was cool 10+ years ago when they opened, now it just looks/feels like a tacky, divey asian disco threw up in there. The food is okay...nothing special...not the biggest portions as far as Thai food goes.
