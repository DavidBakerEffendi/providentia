Really great spot. Love the interior and the service is awesome! We had a party of 5, a bunch of girls just coming out of a law school final. We needed some delicious food and drink. We got a bunch of salads and burgers, which were great. They were very attentive and brought us all the crazy things we asked for (we had a stressful week!) and many plates of fries. I love that they let us be kind of crazy, we were so delirious and out of it, and they made us feel casual and comfortable and were really accommodating. It was lunchtime on a weekday, but we had no wait, even without reservations! I will definitely be coming back, perhaps for their famous brunch. I will say its a bit expensive for the quality of food. I mean to charge $18 for a cheeseburger and put zero fancy stuff on it? No fancy cheese? No creative aoli? I was expecting a bit more for the price. I would say I did not get my money's worth on the food, but I'm reserving judgment until I try some of their other options. Maybe they're just not good at expensive burgers.
