Great food. Great service. Excellent atmosphere with just the right amount of lighting, and background music. My wife had the dumplings as a starter and were very good. Delicious! I had the Cod Fish, and she had the chicken. Again, both were excellent. Very well prepared, and fabulous taste. I would easily recommend this restaurant to anyone. Also, beer on tap, and a long wine list.
