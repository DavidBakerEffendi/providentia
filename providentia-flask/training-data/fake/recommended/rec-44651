Pretty disappointing... the most painful three-hour dinner that I've ever been to, which took place in a hot, poorly ventilated back room with another large party squeezed into the same room and shouting from both groups reverberating against the walls all night.   Two of the three hours were spent waiting for menus, waiting for drinks, waiting for food, still waiting for food, waiting for check, waiting for fixing the check, waiting for getting our cards back.... Food-wise, the tacos and guacamole were good -- probably because we were starving by the time they arrived -- but I can't believe I paid $12 for two tiny tacos, $xx for chips and guac and this crappy service.  I won't be coming back.
