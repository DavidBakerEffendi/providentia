I'd have to give Alla Spina 3.5 stars.  My first visit there was awesome.  We had delicious drinks in celebration of my boyfriend passing his CFA Level 3.  Very creative cocktails and an extensive beer list.  Not to mention, the atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous! However, our 2nd visit was for dinner with a good friend.  The service was very awkward.  We were seated next to the cash register when there was plenty of nicer seating elsewhere.  My friend was late and we were hassled by the server for drinks every 5 minutes before she arrived.  Kind of annoying. We ordered a few appetizers:  the pretzels were great, the deviled eggs were ok, the eggs/bacon/toast was aight.  For dinner I had the potato gnocchi and it was honestly inedible.  Potato with cream sauce and corn on top.  Not exactly what I expected.  We also had dessert...the strawberry jelly roll was absolutely delicious! So all in all, I would NOT come back to this place for dinner.  Maybe a drink or two and light apps.  It's far too expensive for much more.  But I do hear the brunch is good, so I really want to give it one more chance.
