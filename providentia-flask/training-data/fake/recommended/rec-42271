My husband and I used to visit Blue Ribbon for date night on occasion and always loved it. Absolutely loved it. They offered great service, nice cocktails, a huge assortment of menu items, and a very, very, pleasant night out--even a little romantic. Tonight we went back and found what felt like an upscale Bennigans. It was packed with Park Slope families and zillions of kids. It was a little less than sexy to order a martini with a mass of sippy cups surrounding us. We usually split a ceasar salad and the lobster/ny strip platter so we've got room for dessert. Every time we do this, the chef splits the portions prior to the plates' delivery to our table--that courtesy is no longer. They delivered one platter, and I had to do the honors. It was seriously annoying. The steak, ordered medium rare, came in at medium. The lobster was slightly overcooked. They gave us one cracker for the lobster shell instead of two. It all just felt cheap. It felt like we'd walked into some wealthy version of the neighborhood diner. Sad.
