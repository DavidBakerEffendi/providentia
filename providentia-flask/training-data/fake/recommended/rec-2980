Loved this place! We came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and seated immediately. Our server was attentive and pleasant the entire time. We ordered the mussels and calamari for appetizers. We chose the lamb chops and lamb shank for our entrees. The food was delicious. Though I preferred his shank over my chops. I couldn't leave without trying the oreo beignet and now I have a foodgasm every time I think of them!! The ambiance was also very intimate and sexy. I will definitely visit again.
