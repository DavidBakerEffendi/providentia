I like the idea of this place but I don't really love the way it comes together in real life. I mean, there's no denying that a big outdoor beer garden is super nice so long as the weather cooperates, but the night scene gets a little too crowded/bro'd out for my liking and the day scene tends to involve too many small children romping around. If neither of those things bother you (or if only one bothers you and the other is cool), you really should check this place out. As for the food/drinks I'm ALL about the happy hour specials: $5 half liters work for me, but $3 any sausage is an awesome, awesome deal. I've had the Weisswurst (veal and pork) and it was WAYY delicious and worth every single penny (it is either $7 or $7.50 normally, and I can't say I'd be jumping to pay that much for it but I'm no sausage connoisseur). I've also had the fries (because how could you not get fries?) which are crispy and tasty, but I'd highly recommend getting the sweet mustard from the condiment stations -- much better than the curry ketchup they are served with. Overall totally worth experiencing but maybe not worth becoming a regular.
