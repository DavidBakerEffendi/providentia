During my last visit to NYC in May, I knew I wanted to try my first New York style pizza.  After searching on yelp for a good place to go to grab a slice before heading to a musical that night, I came across Patzeria perfect Pizza.   After reading the reviews already posted, I knew this would be the perfect place go.  The store was very small and cramped.  Not very many people can fit inside let alone eat at the tiny counter space.   We ordered a slice of the tomato, basil, and garlic and a slice of the mushroom and spinach.  Both were very good!   After eating here, I can definitely say that I'm a fan of New York style pizza and will be sure to visit this place again the next time in NYC. My only complaint was that it was difficult to find... this may be due to the sudden rain showers and lack of umbrella...
