Great and unique food, and wine and beer selection. This is my favorite place in all of New Haven for a romantic (yet relaxed dinner). They are always thinking up new and unique recipes, and if you are not much of an explorer into the unusual, they also have delicious takes on grilled cheese, mac n cheese, etc. Just hope that you are not lactose intolerant. Wine and beer selection is also great, they have lots of local choices. Price is very reasonable for the area. In fact, it is less expensive than some of the fancy restaurants in downtown, yet so much better. Did I mention they have a beautiful patio where you can eat outside on warm summer nights?
