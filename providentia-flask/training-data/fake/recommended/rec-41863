Chewy, thin, crispy crust. Tasty toppings (though yes, pizzas in this part of Brooklyn DO all have the same toppings, thanks for asking). A huge pizza oven with burning fire right out in front. What looks like a decent bar scene. For some reason the acoustics make it hard to hear, so I recommend going there with someone you don't really like talking to. And since their mouth will be crammed full of pizza, well, no loss.
