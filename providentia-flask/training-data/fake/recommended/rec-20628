My new go to for quality Greek food!!! I ordered delivery and they were really fast and the food was hot and so darn delicious! Make sure you know the difference between chicken gyro meat and chicken souvlaki! I ordered one thinking it was the other...if you like chicken kabobs, then order the chicken souvlaki! The chicken gyro was really flavorful though! Lemon potatoes were good too! I absolutely loved my dinner tonight! Can't wait to order again from this place!!!
