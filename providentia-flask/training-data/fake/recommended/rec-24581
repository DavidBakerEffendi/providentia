I came to Salinas a few weeks ago on a date and was instantly amazed at the vibe of the place. The hostess was extraordinarily friendly and the atmosphere exuded class and sophistication. When we sat down,  we were greeted by a waiter who was extremely knowledgeable; he explained the dishes and answered our every question (I never actually have been to a Spanish tapas place before so I had a lot of questions!). As for the actual meal, there are no words to describe how amazing it was. The drinks were delicious and exquisite,  and the food was incredibly savory, from the appetizers to the entrees. If you're looking to visit an impressive restaurant, I highly recommend Salinas as one of your first choices. I will surely be returning here again.
