We enjoyed lunch here, pretty inexpensive at $17.00 total for our table, mind you no drinks were ordered.  My husband had the pad Thai, which was very good and had a cool presentation.  I had the beef pho, which was good but not great.  Overall good meal and great price... Very eclectic atmosphere.  We would go back.
