Wednesday evening started off on a chilly note with a slight mist of rain. After having a bottle of hearty red wine at a wine bar, Amado (my foodie partner in crime) and I had realized, time once again escaped us. It was 10:48p.m. We rushed on a hurried walk, to a favorite wine bar in the LES, for more red wine :-) and dinner. To our disappointment, even as regulars, we were too late! Wiping an almost tear, from our hungry faces we trotted on. Out of hunger and desperation to not settle for the neon fluorescent lit pizza place, we braved a new place. The Supper Restaurant. Low and behold, we were welcomed at 11:08p.m. with a smile by the host and had a front seat display to all the kitchen action. The cozy flames of the stove and grill welcomed us, like a fireplace....sigh. Step one: We ordered our wine. And with happy salivating mouths our food : Soft fresh bread with spicy oil/beans were brought out to ease our hunger pains. (or to stop our salivating and panting on the partition that separates the bar from the stove) Appetizer: Grilled Polenta - grilled to perfection yet still rich and creamy. Entrees: Tagliatelle with prosciutto di parma and Risotto with Pancetta Parmigiano & Mushrooms. Both dishes were perfectly al dente. The Tagliatelle was a bit salty, however the waiter warned us before we confirmed our order..aka "Enter at your own risk." We threw caution to the windy misty night and ordered anyway. (Asking for more water of course.) After an hour an a half (slow lingery eating) of our glazed eyeballs, staring away at the kitchen flames, our meal ended. Fat, dumb and happy, as Amado would say. The only little peeve? Cash only. Ugh. But how could we complain after being feed and brought in, like two homeless children? Our food and wine only amounted to about $70. Rubbing our bellies, we left to continue our mischief...
