I WILL ABSOLUTELY NEVER RETURN TO THIS PIO PIO. If I could give a negative star rating, I would, but unfortunately I must leave one star just to review. I visited this particular Pio Pio restaurant with a large group of my girlfriends one evening and I was super excited because my family is from Peru and l always love to try Peruvian cuisine in the city. However, the customer service alone was enough to make me walk out. At the end of our meal, we asked the waiter to split the check. However, I was horrified to find out that the waiter had not listened to our request and charged over $100 on my credit card alone, even though we wrote down how much money should be charged on each card. I had essentially paid for everyone's meal. When I spoke with the hostess at the front I asked her to refund my credit card. She informed me that she could not do that right away and she proceeded to argue with me and tell me that I was wrong. At that point I asked for a manager and she told me that there is no one in charge at all; essentially the hostess and wait staff were running everything on their own and had no one to report to. I have never been treated so poorly at an establishment in my life. I was saddened at my horrible experience and I honestly will never return to any Pio Pio establishment because of this. However, I can at least take comfort in the fact that there are plenty of other wonderful Peruvian restaurants in the city that I can visit.
