I love YELP for helping discover little gems like this place! My bf and I were in the area for the weekend. We wanted to try a new place for brunch on Sunday, so I looked up some suggestions for restaurants in the area. This southern girl was drawn to this spot, hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed as I often am with restaurants claiming to specialize in southern cuisine.  I was not. We sat at the bar and chatted with John, one of the owners, as we ate. John was friendly, asking us about ourselves and what brought us to the area, telling us about himself, and making sure we enjoyed our meal. We shared the fried green tomatoes served with remoulade sauce. It was delicious! I ordered the shrimp and grits--perfection.  Trust me...there aren't a lot of spots that get this dish right up here.  In fact, even though it's one of my favorite dishes when I'm down south, I've pretty much given up on ordering it when I'm anywhere else. But something about John's friendly banter made me feel like he wouldn't let me down.  It was awesome! As an added bonus, he gave us two delicious mimosas on the house because it was my bf's birthday weekend! We will most definitely be back during our next trip to NYC!
