The reviews (good and bad) that I read are very consistent with my experience.  Fun place with great food!   It was a little overcrowded and the music was way too loud.  That forced the conversations to be even louder.  We were definitely rushed and moved out quickly.  My server was poorly trained. It was noticeable and annoying.  However, I'll be coming back.  I really liked it!
