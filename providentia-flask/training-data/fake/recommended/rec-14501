Though the food was good (had the overpriced reuben) the wait staff I can't say the same. I sat at a dirty table but luckily the waitress wiped it off before my food came (into my lap, that is). Then, the check didn't come until after I had to bother someone about it. They took my plate but didn't leave the check. I totally could have walked out without paying, so if anyone plans on doing that it's pretty easy.
