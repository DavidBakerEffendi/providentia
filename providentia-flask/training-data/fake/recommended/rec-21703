Great restaurant.  Nice ambiance and delicious food.  They have a wine list of $25 bottles, which is awesome.  They also have a very affordable pasta special.  A great spot for a pre/post theater meal.  Come here... order pretty much anything on the menu, get a bottle of wine and finish with an Irish coffee that comes with their homemade whipped cream. You will not be disappointed.
