I heart this place for pizza and can't speak for its dinner/other food options. Definitely specialty styled which sets it apart from other pizza options in the area. I always used to run in for two slices (which is serious because one fills me up). Kinda expensive for a slice but the toppings are insane, so it's okay. Only thing I can say is it gets kinda busy and the counter layout (non-dine in side) is not conducive to any sort of line or organization during prime times.
