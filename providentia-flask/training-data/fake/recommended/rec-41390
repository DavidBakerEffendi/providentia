I don't want to come on here and pretend I am a food critic like some people tend to do on here. I just know what I like and don't like. This place I like. My girlfriend and I both had the miso ramen with pork. It was delicious! The staff was great, welcoming and made you want to come back. There was no wait at all even the place looked crowded. If you are looking to have great food, friendly staff along with an inexpensive menu this is the place for you. This place is a great addition to the area!
