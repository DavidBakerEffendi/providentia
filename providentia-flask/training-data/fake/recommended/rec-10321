This restaurant is a true disappointment. My girlfriend and I live in hartford, and when we heard a new restaurant was coming to the city we were anxious to try it out. We decided to go on a Friday night, in hopes that the staff would be on their A-game and the atmosphere would be lively. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and shortly after being seated, our server came by.... And it was downhill from there. The bar appeared to be fairly full, but it was clear that all of the staff had invited all of their friends to come by because almost ever staff member was busy chatting and goofing off with them... It was very unprofessional. When we needed our server we had to interrupt her giggling and hugging her friends at the bar?? No thanks. We ordered our drinks and the tater tot appetizer. Our appetizer came out frozen in the center, so we promptly sent it back. No one in the kitchen came out to apologize.... No manager came over to us..... Instead, our server came back with a tiny house salad and tried to say they were sorry. Not appropriate. Meanwhile, the manager was shoving food in his mouth off in the corner. We would have appreciated someone in charge at least showing us they cared about their patrons. I guess that type of expectation is too high for nixs. We ended up leaving and going to another restaurant.we agreed we wouldn't be going back for awhile, if ever again. It is a shame that our experience was so poor. It will be interesting to see how long they last, considering the unprofessional staff, inability to cook, and disregard for their customers.
