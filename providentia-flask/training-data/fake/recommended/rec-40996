Went at 5pm on a Wednesday, so there was no line. I guess I like a more straight forward burger.  Just good old beef and a bun.  Too much fuss for me.  It was fun to try it but I wouldn't bother again. Did have one celebrity sighting and rarely do I get to try a restaurant while the newness hype is still active. Ordered a diet coke with my burger and a little 8 oz.,in a glass bottle drink came.  I'm sorry - I like a big cold drink with a burger not a little cocktail size drink.   The medium rare burger was raw in the middle.  Maybe that is how proper medium rare should be prepared and I will order medium or medium/well in the future. Anyway - everyone should try it for themselves and see if they like it.
