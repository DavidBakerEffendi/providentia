While I was in this area on evening checking out Cafe Grumpy, I asked a patron sitting across from me if he had to suggest the top 2 restaurants in the area that I should try he suggested either the cookshop or gramercy tavern.  After looking at each places menus I chose here!  And I was happy i did!  Even though it was packed and there was an hour wait....with in 10 mins i was able to snatch up a seat at the bar.  The service was decent and so was the food.  I ordered some pizza app, although it was big enough to be a meal, and a steak dinner.  It was a great spot and I made a new acquaintance as well.  I would highly suggest giving this place a try:-)
