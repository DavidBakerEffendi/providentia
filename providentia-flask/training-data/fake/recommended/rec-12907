This little French creperie was a great experience. I ordered the chocolate, rasberry and ice cream crepe with extra strawberries and it was a great combination with not an overload of chocolate. The portion was just fine - though is smaller compared to other similar eateries in NYC. The service was prompt and friendly and the fact this is quite a small place made it cosy though its not suitable for groups more than 4.
