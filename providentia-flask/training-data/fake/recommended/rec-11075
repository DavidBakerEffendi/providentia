It seems pointless to add to the hundreds of positive reviews...but I have to. I was at a conference looking for a break from the bland conference lunch. I ended up at Reading Terminal Market and looked for the longest line figuring that the locals would know best. They were very right! I asked the large chap in front of me what the "go to" item was and he suggested the pulled Italian pork with provolone and broccoli rabe. Wow. Wow. Wow. Juicy, bitter greens, garlicky. Why have I never seen these before?
