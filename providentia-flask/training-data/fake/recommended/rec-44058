The first time a friend and I went to Ulivo on a Friday night, we were turned away because we didn't have a reservation. I was disappointed, because only a few tables were full, and I didn't understand why they wouldn't seat us. Luckily, I returned a few weeks later with a reservation and now I absolutely understand - the place is not that big and gets absolutely packed on the weekends. With good reason - the food is amazing. I lived in Italy for a few years, and I am not exaggerating when I say that the ricotta gnocchi at Ulivo are the best that I've tried anywhere outside of Italy, and hands down the best in Philadelphia. As opposed to some of the chewy, heavier types of gnocchi that other Italian restaurants serve, Ulivo's gnocchi are pillowy mouthfuls of delight. Now, whenever I go here with friends who haven't been before, I demand that they order the gnocchi and they always agree with me that they are hands-down the best gnocchi ever. In fact, I rarely ever order any other entree, which is a shame because there are so many other delicious-looking meals on the menu. I must also give kudos to the delicious starters, including the grilled octopus and the creamy winter squash soup. The desserts I have tried, on the rare occasion that I'm not stuffed from the other courses, are also divine. Ulivo is a BYO, which is yet another perk of this fabulous neighborhood restaurant. Oh, and the service has always been delightful. I've had the same waitress everytime and she is always attentive, kind, and great at recommending things to try. I look forward to going back many more times.
