A great neighborhood spot.  The food is good (although the dinner menu is still pretty small) and the coffee is very tasty/strong.   Aside from that, Brooklyn Commune represents the best of Windsor Terrace.  It acts as a focal-point for a developing neighborhood.  Feels welcoming regardless of whether I'm just running in for a cup of coffee or coming in with friends for dinner.
