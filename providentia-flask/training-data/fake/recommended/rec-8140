Review is for drinks, ambiance and crowd... can't comment on the food.  I've noticed there's a lot of negative reviews for the food, but this place is so OBVIOUSLY NOT the kind of place you go for food.  This is a shoulder to shoulder, get your drink on kind of place.   It's a regular folk, 20 to 30-something kinda joint and not one of those poshy upscale places that are so popular these days.  Good strong drinks, fairly priced, bathroom not too disgusting.  A-OK.
