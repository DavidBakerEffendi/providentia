Excellent food and the environment really gives you a flavor of the Latin culture. The owner is always there working, making sure everyone is well taken care of. Dom is the man. I see some complaints about a wait. Very simple to say that the wait is because of the demand. I much prefer to wait than walk into an empty restaurant. This is an awesome place! We always feel like our business is appreciated and have had the opportunity to catch a cigar in the from after dinner and chat with the owner. Reservations- give me a break! Go to a Cuban restaurant in the city that takes reservations and compare the food and price. Remember you are not paying 35-40 dollars per plate. What's next expecting Panera to take reservations?
