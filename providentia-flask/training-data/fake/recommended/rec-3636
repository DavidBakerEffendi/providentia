I went to Market Table recently for lunch with my boss and coworkers. It's gorgeous inside, and the owner greeted us upon arrival and checked in with us a few times during the meal. Our server was fantastic, friendly and gave us just the right amount of attention. The food was solid but not amazing. I ordered the poached salmon salad, and it was sort of a pile of mayonnaise-based salmon salad next to a bed of greens. The greens were lovely; the salmon was just okay. My boss ordered the cuban sandwich, and it was mostly just filled with deli ham. Nothing to sneeze at. The other dishes ordered at our table were the falafel (served elegantly as a large patty over tzaziki and topped with feta) which looked a little undercooked inside, and the skate wing which was definitely the winner at our table. The skate was served over an almond gazpacho, and was cooked to perfection. The desserts were also a highlight. The chocolate terrine was gorgeous, topped with salted caramel and caramel popcorn! The panna cotta was equally lovely, served with black pepper shortbread cookies, succulent black cherries and a port reduction. The coconut sorbet and blackberry port sorbet were to-die-for. Overall, a lovely dining experience but some of the dishes felt a bit tired and didn't really live up to the vibe and the service.
