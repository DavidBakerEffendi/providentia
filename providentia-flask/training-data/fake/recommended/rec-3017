This was the setting for Gorge Fest '08, '09 and '10.  Fogo is the enabler that pushes people to stretch their stomach more than needed. The decor is upscale and the help is very attentive.  The bar inside the door has a superior selection, however the prices are above average. The salad bar is absolutely amazing (and this is from a guy who claims to be allergic to chlorophyll).  The meats and cheeses are tasty, fresh and delicious.  I could honestly make a meal on prosciutto, peppers and cheese. Then the fun starts.  Sit down at your table and flip your chip over to green.  Immediately the gauchos will swarm your table like blond Perkins waitresses to Tiger Woods.  Some could say that the gauchos are overly attentive, but personally I like it being all about me.  What I learned from my experiences is that you have to tell the gauchos that you don't want certain cuts of meat and focus on what you really like. My personal favorites are the Parmesan encrusted pork chops, bacon wrapped fillet, bacon wrapped chicken (bacon makes anything better) and garlic steak.  I am not a fan of the sausage and consistently pass on that option.  I will say that the cuts are not the most tender and the meats do skew to more well done.  However, if you speak up and make requests, your meal will be close to perfect.  Complimenting the plethora of meats is family style sides of mashed potato, plantains, polenta and cheesy bread.  The polenta and cheesy bread are consistently my favorites. This is the perfect setting for business lunches/dinners, bachelor parties and anytime men want to bond over a "meatgasam".  This has been an annual event for my crew of bros and will continue to delight our appetites of excess.
