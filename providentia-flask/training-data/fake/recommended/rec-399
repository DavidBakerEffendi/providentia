Umami burger is legit.  The place has concrete everything so it is LOUD.   We sat downstairs and it was maybe 80% full and it was pretty freaking loud.  We ordered the original, and the manly burger.  Both were pretty awesome.  Meat is fresh, juicy, but not bleeding/dripping on your plate.  Bread was soft and warm.  We also ordered the truffle fries that is covered with truffle cheese and truffle salt, a recipe for some truffle-y goodness.  Their beers on tap are $8 which i find pricey, would rather just pay $4-5 more for another burger.  So is it better then shake shake? Its different, totally different flavor profiles.  There really isnt anything quite like this place.  Definitely worth a try, beware no take out allowed.
