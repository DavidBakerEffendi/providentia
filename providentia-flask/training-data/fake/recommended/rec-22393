I know this restaurant has gotten consistently good reviews, but I was pretty disappointed.  Three stars for great wait and bar staff, and a cozy intimate feel to the dining room. My friend and I shared a rice and beans empanada, yummy, but over-breaded, and a chicken avocado cheese arepa, which contained a teeny amount of shredded chicken and cheddar from the bag on a very hard flatbread.  I know they're apps, but both were small and we could've easily eaten our own.  We shared the entree of beef and plantains over rice and beans -which was larger, thankfully, but came out on the cold side.  The meal itself was delicious, tender meat with great flavor, but I've gotten the same exact thing in the not even scary section of Bridgeport....for literally a quarter of the price.   As mentioned before, I thought the staff was great.  One server eyed my empty wine glass and brought me another drink while our own server was busy.  Awesome.  A chef was also checking on each table personally.  This place is lovely for the shoreline and undoubtedly authentic, but for my high expectations and varied food background-it did not suffice.
