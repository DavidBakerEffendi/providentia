I really can't see why this place has such a high rating on yelp... My group made a reservation for 7pm. we were running late and called ahead of time and let them know that we would be 5min late. Â After telling us ok, when we showed up at 7:04, they told us, with an attitude mind you, that they had given our table away... Ok, I get it, were were late and the place is bussy, but the fun does not stop here.... While having to wait for another table we decided to have a few drinks at the bar. They tacked on a $3 service charge per drink... When we finally sat down and placed our order, all our dishes came out at different times. Again I understand that they are bussy, but come on I should not have to wait 10min to eat with the rest of my table. To top it all off most of the food people got was luke warm at best. Everything was obviously fresh from the microwave (unless some has figured out another way to cook a bowl of rice where the outside is lava hot and the inside is ice cold). Then we ordred more drinks and they were week and watered down. If you want mediocre Thai food with crummy service and bad drinks, this is the place for you.
