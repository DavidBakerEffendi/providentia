Came here for dinner with my mom after seeing a play (kinky boots) on Broadway. The restaurant was kind of hard to find... We walked right passed it even though there is outdoor seating we didn't see the name of the restaurant on the side. We were greeted very kindly as we walked in. The hostess walked ahead of us and took the time to wait and make sure we were following her and that she wasn't walking to fast for us. She kept looking back to ensure that we were ok. The seating area downstairs is very large and dimly lit for a very Latin romantic feel. Soft Spanish music playing in the background. Great for date night. Our waiter was very courteous and patient with us because it took my mom a little while to figure out what she wanted to eat. Finally we ordered the arroz chaufa, Camarones Cuzco and an order of maduro on the side. Also a pitcher of white sangria. The food was amazing. It came out steaming hot and fresh! My mom said it was a lot better than she expected. And might i add she is a VERY picky eater. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for some Hispanic cuisine.
