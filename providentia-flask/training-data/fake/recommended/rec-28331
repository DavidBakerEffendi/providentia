Hmmm...Empanadas...ehh...I'm not a big fan of them...I've tried the beef empanadas...one of each kind (corn, white, organic flour). The meat is a little dry for my taste. Definitely eat it with something else inside (Cheese or vegetables). The organic flour empanada with ground beef and mixed vegetables was quite tasty. The vegetables helped the beef seem less dry. The chopped pork empanada was a little better. I can't really say much about them but definitely give them a try. 3-4 empanadas should be enough for the average person. What really got me were the plantain or banana empanadas and the ice pops! The sweetness of the bananas made me love the empanadas more than the beef ones (It's shocking to me too since I love beef). I think I will just stick to those from now on. The ice pops are great on a hot day. Eat them fast though! They melt pretty quickly unless you don't mind drink the ice pop instead. They are frozen in plastic store bought cups. It's the same concept making flavors ice cubes with an ice cube tray and toothpicks. The trick to getting it out without breaking the ice pop is to twirl the cup in your hands and warm up the sides. After a couple seconds, the ice pop should slip right out of the cup with ease! *licks ice pop* Delish!
