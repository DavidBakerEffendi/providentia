After seeing this restaurant on Triple D, we had been trying to make our way over. We finally had that opportunity last night. Well the food did not disappoint. The burger was great, my wife loved her shrimp and grits and our good friend really enjoyed the fried chicken. The cocktails were equally impressive. The pretzels we had seen on the show were also good. All that being said, we will never go back. The waitress who was assigned to our table projected absolutely ZERO warmth and personality. She did not smile once during our entire meal. Honestly it felt like she would rather be anywhere but there. She reacted to all of our questions and interaction with a stone face and robotic like one and two words answers. But I guess she really had no incentive to be friendly in any way since apparently The Redhead has the egregious policy of automatically adding a 20% gratuity for groups of 5 of more - so she was getting hers no matter what. Â Not 15, not 18 but 20% - for groups of 5? When did this happen? When did 5 become a large group? A 20% gratuity to me has always been reserved for somebody who provided exceptional service - and being friendly and communicative is part of that service process. In fact I don't even know her name for this review since she never actually introduced herself. Bottom line is that there are plenty of places with great food in NYC where we can spend our money in a more friendly and warm setting - and not feel like we are having our pockets picked.
