I booked my son's first birthday party at In Riva on a Sunday evening on the second floor of the restaurant.  There were different food options and we chose the buffet option where guests were offered meats and cheeses, 2 different antipasti (Mommy's meatballs and the fried artichokes), the Riva chopped salad, and 3 different pizzas (margherita, burrata, and prosciutto and arugula).  Dessert was canolis with coffee.  The food was absolutely delicious!  For kids, they offered a cheese or pepperoni pizza which was great since most kids are picky eaters.  I loved all of the food, but I would have to say I kept going back for the meatballs, they were out of this world!  The meatballs were a big hit for the guests as well.  The service was outstanding, the entire staff, the servers, the bartender, and the event manager were exceptional and attentive to all of the guests.  I couldn't ask for a better venue since the party went so smoothly.  I would highly recommend going here to dine and for having your events here!
