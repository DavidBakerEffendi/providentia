I LOVE the feel of Dante & Luigi's! It's as if an Italian family opened up their home for guests to dine. LOVE the music that plays. Like a Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra feel. It's simply classy and classic. Service was great. Friendly server, water topped off, checking on us. I ordered a baked gnocchi because I really wanted something cheesy. I definitely got it. However, when I tasted Mark A.'s rotini carbonara, I wish I had ordered that instead! Delicious! Not an overwhelming bacon taste, but complements well with the sauce. Mmm, I wish I could have some again. If I were a local, I'd make this a go-to spot for special occasions for sure.
