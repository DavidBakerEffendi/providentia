Phenomenal. I've only tried the chicken and steak sandwiches, but god damn they are very very good. The meat was well cooked. The corn they give you is ridiculously good. It's crazy too cause I couldn't figure out what they put on it until I tried. Â They managed to put some sweet/spicy orange sauce/cream whatever with coconut. Insanity! I LOVE coconut and this shit cause me by surprised. Make sure you get extra napkins cause it will get kinda messy with the sauce over the corn. This spot is automatic win.
