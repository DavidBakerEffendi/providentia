to all the negative commentary here-  at the time that i was here it was not busy with a pleasant quiet atmosphere and plenty of sitting space- i went in with a friend / no i did not arrive in the middle of the night nor would i ever want to/  the sandwich was delish as well as the homemade cheesecake/  personally- the restaurants i've been to lately in hartford are downright nasty including the much hyped max-mara's (esp. the one in downtown- food was awful) i mainly go for food to a restaurant not to get sloshed or bitch for 3 hrs / also cheesecake factory in the downtown 'swank' area of west hartford literally smelled bad/ there was so many people scrunched in there / waiting and hanging all over the place/ i've eaten in restaurants all over the u.s. incl. california and florida and the write-ups about so called 'bad service' , et al / ??
