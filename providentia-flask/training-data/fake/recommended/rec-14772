Ate here the other night and must say its a very welcome spot to the neighborhood. I've seen this location go through many transformations and restaurants and this could be the best one yet. Great menu and food which fills a taste that is otherwise absent from the area. Good options and good service. Food cooked just how you want it. Hope this plays does well for a long time to come because its a good addition to the neighborhood.
