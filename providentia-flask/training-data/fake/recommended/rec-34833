Food at Cheryl's swings towards Caribbean-inspired comfort food.  The restaurant's comfy decor gives you the feel of dining in a capsized boat, though dim lighting in the back means we usually crowd by the window.  Despite the dishes's  island influences, they are so hearty they seem best suited for winter.   The fish soup daily special was almost bouillabaisse with tasty fresh tarragon.  The BBQ shrimp is delicious, but much more like curry than BBQ.  The tagine is also worth it, and deserts are always solid (save $ with an off-menu oatmeal raisin cookie or brownie).  Our cachaca-ginger beer drinks lacked punch, stick with the rum punch.  The entrees could afford to be a few dollars cheaper, but this is a great spot to follow up visits to the Brooklyn Museum with.   I'd like to try brunch here once, but no free coffee refills is a no-no.
