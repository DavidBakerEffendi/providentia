I think this place uses their reputation as a local landmark to take customers to the cleaners.   I've been here 2/3 times since 2008, thinking (maybe wishing? lol) that their food/pricing would improve with time, but it didn't. On my last visit, I was charged about $12 for a 10 in. tuna grinder with lettuce, tomato, onion, and mustard, a 10 oz. bag of potato chips, and an 8 oz. can of Coke.  This is robbery. Although the grinder was satisfactory for a bite on my way to work, it was nothing spectacular and is certainly not worth such prices.  To top it all off, they took about 10-15 minutes to make it when there were less than 10 other customers in the store at the time, and they made me late for work.  It shouldn't take more than 5 min. tops to make a sandwich when there were so few other people in there.   There is a place in the area on New Britain Ave. called Veggie World that I frequent much more often.  They have a special in which you can get a large grinder for only $5 and it includes a can of soda.  I would much rather go there. All in all, the feeling I get from this place is they will charge outrageous prices because they are getting business mostly from tradition and past reputation.
