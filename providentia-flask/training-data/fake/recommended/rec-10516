To begin: there's a menu by the door with prices clearly listed as well as ingredients.  No complaints about the "overpriced" "simple" food any longer.   Unless you're Stevie Wonder, there's no reason for shock at what arrives during your meal or after it. Inside it's really a great little space, intimate with full windows out onto the Williage/Village border buffer zone. The inside is simple, stacked with food and basic country/market kitsch, without seeming overly-stylized. On to the food: The pork loin was exquisite.  Tender, bacon wrapped and clearly well-sourced. The brussels sprouts, with bacon (sense a trend?) retained just enough bitterness to give the dish a bit of flavor, and the pear gave a welcome sweetness to the whole equation. The Old Bay fries were, predictably, excellent as well.  I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested that they seemed at least twice-fried.  Continuing our study in gluttony, we ordered the hushpuppies.  These should not be missed and absolutely must be dipped in the accompanying mayo. The staff was efficient, helpful and polite. Our server forthrightly told us that, for two people who weren't ravenous, the amount of food we'd ordered would be fine. And it was.   Market Table's real success is its ability to live up to the romantic ideal of downtown New York and the Willage. Fresh, spot-on food, excellent laid-back service, a crowd of attractive young creative-looking people and big windows framing the downtown street scene truly concentrate and amplify the sense of place. Congratualtions, Market Table, on living up to an idea.
