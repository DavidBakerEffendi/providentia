After enjoying a few years of homemade filipino cooking and learning how to cook flip food, I have usually been disappointed by Flip restaurants. Golden Bread is awesome for their sweets. They have an awesome selection of cakes: ube, macapuno, sansrival....and they all look really fresh and expertly decorated. They also have smaller pastries to takeaway and potato bread and rolls. I ate from the lunch buffet. I say lunch because I was told they don't really have a dinner buffet and that everything is usually sold out by 6pm.  I got two things; a pint of sinigang sa baboy  (pork belly soup in a tamarind broth) and a pint of Guisadong Togue (sauteed bean sprouts with tofu). The soup was good, the broth was perfect, not too salty, and there were a good amount of big pork belly chunks. There was a small amount of tomato and spinach; i would have liked to see more ripe tomatoes and more spinach in the soup, but it was still tasty. The sprouts were good too, a little bland, could have used some scallions and more tofu. I saw some yummy diniguuan in there too but didn't have room in my tummy for another item. I would really like to see a dinner menu made with seating during the evening. I think they would thrive if they promoted more.
