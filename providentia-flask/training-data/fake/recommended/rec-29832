i hate having to say this, because i enjoyed the friendliness and enthusiasm of the owner so much, but we were so disappointed!  coffee and pastry are a far cry from vienna. the coffee tastes more like an ok version of italian espresso.    it is served on a little silver tray as they do in vienna, but unlike vienna there was no napkin under the cup, no glass of cold water on the tray, or biscuit to accompany the coffee. we had two desserts, one better than the other. the apple strudel filling was very good, but the pastry was undercooked and soggy, rather than crispy and flakey. the portion was quite small for the price - really, just a few bites of apple. the marzipan cake was a tremendous disappointment.  the slice was huge ( nice for sharing) but - the cake layers themselves were dry and not very flavorful, the raspberry filling between the layers almost non-existant, the  band of marzipan with which the cake was iced was really too heavy and thick - but most egregious for a european cake was that the whipped cream - which was between the layers and under the band of marzipan - was sweetened, making the whole thing way too sweet. europeans NEVER sweeten their whipped cream! it seemed like an american diner dessert where the predominant taste is sweet not flavor. in my opinion, though i love being able to sit outside and watch the princeton world go by, and though i love the attempt, much better coffee is down the street at small world, and much better pastry is also down the street at The Little Baker.
