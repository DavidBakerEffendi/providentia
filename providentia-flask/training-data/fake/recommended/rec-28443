This place is beautiful!  They remodeled and now it's an Astoria hot spot.  Every time we go now it's crowded.  The best thing about it is that it kept the same menu and the same prices!  The owners are great and super friendly.  The staff is always attentive.  They changed their burger because  I used to not like it, but now it's my favorite thing to get.  AWESOME PLACE!
