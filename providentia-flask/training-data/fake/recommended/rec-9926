An uber-hip trendy place with very affordable lunch selections. Who's ever heard of getting a lunch entree and appetizer in the city for less than $7? The Pad Kee Mao with chicken was very good, and by default excluded excluded the ubiquitous broccoli that so many other places put into their Kee Mao (I usually ask to remove that anyway). The Chicken Satay skewers were decent, and a fine accompaniment to the meal. Definitely recommended for lunch!
