Wonderful breakfast foods -- unique options that you don't think will work together, but they do. I've been to Hapgoods a few times, including for a large family gathering, where everyone else raved of the food as well. The Pecan Banana french toast is especially FANTASTIC. Â Omelets also tasty. One note: Lunch menu is just "OK" in my opinion. I ordered a sandwich and was deeply disappointed. They tried to correct, but I think I just had too high of expectations because of the wonderful breakfast items I've had previously. Still deserve 5 stars overall I think.
