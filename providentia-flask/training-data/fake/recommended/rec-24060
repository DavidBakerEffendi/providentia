Oh my gosh everything was delicious.  I just love this place.  I brought my husband and kids this time.  We ordered the shrimp & grits and apple pie french toast to share with my husband.  My daughter ordered the omelet.  My husband and daighter tried the lemonade.  Wow the lemonade was delicious.  I wish I could drink it and have my coffee.  I will have to have it the next time I come.  If you haven't gone to the Green Eggs Cafe you are definitely missing out.
