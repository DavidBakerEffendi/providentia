Finally a contemporary cafe for the neighborhood.  My wife and I have been here a few times, as it is the new neighborhood "hotspot." We haven't yet been disappointed.  The space is airy, although I think they could do well by adding a few more tables.  The food is delicious.  There's nothing classic about the BLT, which is why it is so good.  The complex flavors and textures of that sandwich really shows off the chef's skill on something seemingly so simple. The Stumptown coffee is nicely brewed.  The staff are very friendly and genuinely appear to want to get to know you. They also sell beans, dried pasta, and other unique and somewhat high-end grocery items.  I'm not sure how successful that would be.  I'd say stick to what they do best, and that is churning out delicious meals from the kitchen with friendly and attentive service.
