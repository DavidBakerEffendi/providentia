Loved Upstate. I met a friend her tonight for drinks, oysters and appetizers. Our waitress was super accommodating and friendly. She had great suggestions about wine, as well as their oyster/beer special. We wanted to catch up, and definitely didn't feel rushed though there was a crowd of people waiting at the door. Will definitely be back for more oysters and to try the other items on the menu. It's so nice to feel like you are going out, and getting beyond what you pay for. Loved it!
