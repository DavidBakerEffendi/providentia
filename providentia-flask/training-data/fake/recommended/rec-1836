What can I say that hasn't been said?  I was in Waterbury for work and had to drive to Corona, NY for a night before flying out of LGA, and they said I HAD to stop here for pizza before I left.  So, I leave Waterbury (what a friggin hell hole that is) and drive down to New Haven, get lucky with a parking space right across from there, and get the joy of standing in line, by myself, OUTSIDE WHEN IT WAS ABOUT 25, for a friggin pizza.  After about 20 minutes of that nonsense, I went in an ordered a small pie to go.  I can't remember what she called it, but I got the tomato/mozzarella with pepperoni, onion, mushroom, and garlic.  What a sight to watch.. a real coal fired oven, watching the pizza's go in and smoke right away, the 20ft long poles the guys use to mastery to make and move them in the oven.  Real tomato sauce.  The damn things come out BUBBLING with orgasmic frenzy.  After about a 25 minute wait for a TO GO pizza, I got my little box and headed to my car.  Opened up the box, pulled a slice (these are not foldable NYC slices) with a base so delicately thin but a crust so awesomely crunchy, and bit down to some REAL GARLIC SLICE goodness.  I ate a bit in my car, then packed it back up for the drive to Corona.  Even when I got to my hotel and opened that bad boy back up it was still good.  But I think this is a pizza that must be enjoyed at Frank's while it's hot and right there.  Taking one to go is only insulting the pizza.   If you're ever in the area, do not hesitate to go.  You may have to wait an hour for a table (not a big place), but it's well worth it.  You don't get pizza like this everywhere, and I've had it all over the country from traveling for work (too many places just in Manhattan and Brooklyn to mention).
