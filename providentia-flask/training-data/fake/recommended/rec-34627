We went in a lunch time. So, there was a huge line with 30 mins wait. I tried Unda roll, Veggie roll and Paneer achari roll. Everything tasted good. If you are going in lunch time, be prepared to wait. Location is as mentioned here but I was little confused as it was a small place. Tried their Mango Lassi. I did not like it. It got more Yogurt taste than Mango.
