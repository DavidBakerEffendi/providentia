I had Bistango on my bookmarks from Yelp for a while. We went for an early evening dinner on a Sunday just before a play. Our waitress was gracious and service was good. We tried 3 different appetizers which were excellent: Artichoke-  great sauce and tender Lobster salad- had delicious pieces of lobster Braised short rib-tender with a good reduction Our entrees- we all had the eggplant/lobster ravioli which were very good. For dessert we shared the tostada di Mele Gelato di Vaniglia (warm caramelized apple tart, vanilla gelato) and the carrot cake with buttermilk frosting- both a very nice finally.  I was  very satisfied with Bistango  and will add to my "keeper" list.
