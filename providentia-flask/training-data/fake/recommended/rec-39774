Came here a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch. I ordered the churrasco + eggs - the steak was VERY tough, but tasty, I persevered. My wife had the huevos rancheros, which was nice. Fresh squeezed OJ was nice. Overall OK, but a bit overpriced. You can do better for the price elsewhere in the east village.
