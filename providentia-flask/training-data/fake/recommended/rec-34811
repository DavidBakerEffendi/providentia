I went twice in one week! Kinda crazy for me. Guess it's getting added to one of my fave spots for grub in Williamsburg. Good service, good music, good drinks, goooood arepas. I've tried three different kinds, and they each definitely have their own distinct flavor, which is cool. (I hate it when places use the same sauce on various things.) Also a fan of the fact that you can substitute baked tofu in for the meats on most of them. The guac is decent, and so are the plantains. (Though not sure fried plantains can ever go wrong!) And the review wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention that the happy hour is amazing. Only 4-7, but $3 for a PBR plus a shot of rum. Yeah; unbelievable. See you there!
