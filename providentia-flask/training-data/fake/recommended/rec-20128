I was really excited to finally make it to Buttermilk Channel. We did the usual wait for a table for Sunday brunch routine except the hostess started seating people who came in 15 minutes after us so that was a bit annoying. The service was fairly poor throughout. Our waiter had holes in his shoes which made us question the health code. The decor was a bit UWS for me. I did indulge in a very delicious version of a Bloody Mary which had stout in it. Oh my! They have a wonderful selection of Bloody Mary's! Well, forget your cholesterol and go for it here... the only issue which is thus my rating is all our food arrived cold. We were so hungry at this point and unable to get the staff's attention we just ate it and it was decent, but I'm sure eggs and rib hash are a lot better hot. Really cold eggs. I must've really been hungry. Then we waddled away feeling a bit cheated. Not sure that I would bother to go back but my companion did and said it was much better the second time. Frankly when there is Prime Meat & Colonie I most likely won't bother.
