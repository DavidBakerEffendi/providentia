Let me start off by saying I LOVE the Max restaurant group. I'm a frequent flyer at all the other locations but for some reason I had never experienced the wonder that is Trumbull Kitchen until a friend invited me to check out the Taste of Hartford menu. I can't believe what I've been missing out on! We got there at about 8pm on a Monday and it was pretty full (always a good sign) but we were seated right away. After we were all settled our server brought over our drinks and these amazing papadums which were wonderfully crispy. They were served with a mushroom cream cheese which was absolutely to die for. I'm not lying when I say I would go back again just for these! After I demolished what had to be at least half a dozen of those miracle crackers, I opted to start my meal with the golden beet and cara cara orange salad. It came lightly dressed in a pistachio vinaigrette with plenty of gorgonzola crumbles- just the right balance of sweet and savory. For my main course I had the herb crusted lamb sirloin which was absolutely PERFECT. The crust was great and the meat itself was wonderfully juicy. The highlight of this dish, in my opinion, was the goat cheese and polenta cake which complimented the lamb perfectly. Dessert was a brandied pear tart with a hazelnut crust and vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely delicious, but I found myself lusting after my friends espresso pot de creme with cinnamon creme. If you haven't been to Trumbull Kitchen do yourself a favor and go NOW! I can't wait to hit up the happy hour for the tapas menu and of course the fabulous wine selection. Braised pork cheeks and lamb sausage involtini?! I'm there.
