Food is average- we had cheap clams which were pretty good for the price, chowder soup (not so much), and their chicken sandwich is pretty tasty with a side of macaroni and cheese (delicious!).  But the space is what makes this place one to remember.  It's view of the water is great and since we first started going to Brooklyn crab, they have made their mini-golf free. Great for budget-friendly fun! The staff definitely needs some attitude adjustments though. Girl named Valerie was very rude and brought this rating down.
