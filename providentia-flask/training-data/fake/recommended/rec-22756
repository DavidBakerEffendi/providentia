We had heard good things, and came looking for our holiday korean bbq fix. We had an average sized party (4 adults, 3 kids) and were seated promptly. So far, so good. We had 4 orders of BbQ in addition to a bevy of other dishes, all of which came out relatively quickly. After that, whether through lack of manpower or just plain bad service, we were left on our own. We had to very aggressively flag down someone to replace our charred and smoking grill, not once but three times, and were essentially left to cook our own order. We couldn't decide if it was lack of attention due to being second-gen asians (who are sometimes second class customers in korean restaurants) or overall incompetence. I did bring it to the attention of someone who seemed to be a manager or owner, and she Â apologized and promised to improve next time. That said she still didn't send anyone to our table, where another grill was charred and smoking. In the end, the food was very tasty, and came out fast. But for the price of the meal, the service was plain bad, whether through lack of manpower or bad planning. Definitely worth another visit, but service desperately needs to improve.
