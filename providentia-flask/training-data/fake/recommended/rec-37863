The $15 Burger special with BBQ pork on top was awesome. And the sweet potato fries were so good that we ordered a second helping. Overall they did southern fusion pretty well. Â And the menu was perfect for a date: an indulgent option for the BF and a healthy vegetable risotto option for me. This welcoming, airy and romantically lit restaurant is right in my neighborhood and I'm sure to frequent it on weeknights.
