I'm in Manhattan for a conference titled, 911: The Conversation We Never Had with Odyssey Networks held at the Desmond Tutu Center. Right next-door is The Cookshop. I've eaten three meals here. One dinner and two breakfasts. Fresh and artful are the words that come to mind. Home made granola with Greek style yogurt and Bosc pears greeted my taste buds on my first morning, and for dinner the next night - swordfish with pine nuts, fresh greens and finished with a chocolate peanut butter meringue  topped cake and a micro ale that were all Deeeeelicious.  If you're in Chelsea it's right across from the current northern end of the High Line.
