All I have to say is wow I am impressed by this place. It's small, which makes it easy to pass by and or dismiss. But if you're in the area definitely don't miss a chance to eat here. What I had: Jamon y Queso and the Domino Arepas Delicious, and most importantly I was COMPLETELY full for only $8! Â (It was seriously like 3-4 dollars each...) How can you beat that? Also try: Brown sugar Lemonaide. Truly unique and I hear it tastes amazing with a bit of spiced rum...
