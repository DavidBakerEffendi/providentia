I've been to Chavela's a few times with friends and family on the weekend, late afternoon to early evening. The staff is friendly and the wait is never too long. The restaurant is tight but cute and I love the decor, there is so much to look at! The food is good, their fish is very good, I recommend it, not too salty not too bland. The "plato don" is a sampler that brings a little bit of everything for a Mexican fiesta, it's good for 2 - 3 people. The sangria is a bit expensive but good. The prices are moderate and you will not break the bank at Chavela's.
