Right around the corner from my office, 500 Degrees is my late lunch salvation.  Ever since watching Food, Inc, i upped my food criteria and they "meat" it.   I used to order burgers medium but 500 does a perfect medium rare.  I get the provolone, lettuce and tomato.  (My friends lean to cheddar.) If they had a thick slice of Spanish or Vidalia onion, it would be 5 stars.  But I'm not a fan of that red onion. Bring back a burger to your office and every one asks about it.
