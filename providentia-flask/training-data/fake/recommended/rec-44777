Two of us went for a  lunch midweek. There was only one table of customers downstairs. We ordered a simple salad, some bread (toasted), and a spinach gratin with chickpeas. The salads came quickly - they were good. We had to ask for forks and napkins (there were 2 knives on table). It took probably another 20 minutes for the toast and gratin, which was lukewarm when it arrived. We didn't have time to wait for them to heat it up at that point.  They did deduct it from the tab. So, I think the food is probably very good, but on this particular day the service was pretty sad, especially since there were 2 wait staff and 2 tables. I might try again, because others seem to have really liked  it.
