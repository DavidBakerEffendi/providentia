Went here for the first time just the other night.  We got there at 5pm and were the only ones in the cozy dining room for about 10 minutes, and suddenly the place was full of people.  My boyfriend and I split the crab cake appetizer which was tasty nicely arranged on top of little brioche toasts, and accompanied by a few greens with a wonderful dressing that I couldn't quite identify.  He got the Diablo mussels, which he enjoyed very much, especially the chorizo pieces which added to the heartiness of the dish.  I ordered the Japanese tuna sandwich which came out perfectly cooked to medium with a wasabi sauce on a big piece of thick toast, and it was delicious!  The curious thing was that it was open-faced with only one piece of toast, but I picked it up, ate it, and decided it didn't need another slice of bread.  In hindsight, I perhaps should have eaten it with a knife and fork like I later saw another diner do, but I enjoyed it very much anyway!  We also tried the creme brulee for desert and it was a very nice finish to the meal.  The draft beer list was fine, and I always enjoy it when the waitress brings you a big glass of ice water without having to ask for it.  My only less-than-great comment is that the french fries accompanying my tuna sandwich could have come from any ol' diner.  I love diners, and the fries tasted just fine, but I had been expecting a little something more...different or unique perhaps...even a nice side of tasty aioli would have kicked them up a notch.  Definitely had a good time though, and would go back!
