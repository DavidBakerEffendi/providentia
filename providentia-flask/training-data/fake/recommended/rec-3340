My fiance and I went to Kim's for dinner the first night we moved to Rahway, and boy am I glad we did!  Amazing food!  I think I actually had dreams about the chicken and waffles (which, by the way, is so huge that it generally equals two meals for me.)  We've been back several times and each time it's a delicious experience. The staff is super friendly and they make you feel like you're family.  The place is adorable.  My only complaints?  I wish they were open during the week!  As some other reviewers have mentioned, service is a bit slow, but that's only because everything is cooked to order so it's super fresh.
