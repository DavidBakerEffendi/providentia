The highlight of my visit to Extra Virgin was seeing Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley! I was less impressed with the food. The prices were exceptional, but aside from the fries, I actually didn't find one thing on the menu I wanted to eat. I didn't like what anyone in my party ordered, including my own food :( Everyone else loved what they ordered, so I think it was a matter of food preference, not the foods' taste. I agree the hostesses are nowhere to be found and after we made eye contact with one, we were told we could sit "anywhere". The waitress seemed harried and overworked, but she was very nice and even split our bill. I'll try this place again one day; hopefully they will have changed their menu by then....
