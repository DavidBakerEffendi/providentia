Delicious! Very fresh! Went with friends to this wonderful restaurant for dim sum. We got lucky and managed to not wait too long. Ordered beef rice rolls, chicken feet, Chinese broccoli, rice in leaf, tofu skin wrap, pork tart, and seafood with double pan fried noodles. The tables were nicely spaced so you won't feel crammed in like some restaurants. The waiters gave us fresh new plates as we went from dim sum to the noodle dish. Definitely will go back for more dim sum. Yummy!
