First off, waitress acted as if she could barely be bothered to wait on us!  We even had to ask her for a refill of my Diet Coke which she acted totally put out about. Hubby was afraid to ask to have his water refilled! Food was just okay.  I ordered the beef hash with poached eggs and it was okay, nothing spectacular and should have been served with toast or maybe even a little fruit.   Hubby had the hamburger and he said that it was just okay.
