City View doesn't beat Eddie's or Fame's for pizza, but they're the closest thing to a all-in-one pizza place you'll find at Temple. They have steaks, burgers, chicken, gyros, etc and they're all really good. They also deliver late night and, if for nothing more than having a delivery boy risk his life for my nourishment, that gets bonus points. I would go with 5 stars, but their pizza can tend to be dry. Don't be upset owners, just turn the oven up to 575 and cook for like 30 seconds less!
