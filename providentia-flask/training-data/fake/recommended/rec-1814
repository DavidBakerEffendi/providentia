Went up to the window, and noticed it was the guy I saw on TV. Forgot his name, but he was pretty robotic when I ordered. The line looks looks long, but the wait goes by fast. This sandwich was pretty greasy. It started to fall apart before I even ate half of it. The taste is pretty much the same as Geno's, but it was more moist (that's what he said) because of the grease, and the meat was cut up. I'd probably gravitate towards this iteration if I was drunk, but I was eating it in the middle of the day so I didn't care for it much.
