So... as you may notice from some of my other reviews... i am not the healthiest eater (.. I DO try).  Snack has about the BEST Greek Salad I have ever tasted.  Big juicy tomatoes... crunchy fresh cucumbers...fantastic olive oil dressing.  I don't eat greek salads typcially - but I do eat them at Snack...Actually, I crave them when visting New York.  You should try it!
