Sangria was very good.  The appetizer we had (a black eyed pea fritter with a topping made of cashew fruit) was a delight. The accompanying grille shrimp were perfect and the fresh salsa together made this a new experience I want to repeat. For a main dish I had the quail and my partner had one of the grilled chicken entrees. OverAll the food was a bit heavy for the warm weather we were experiencing Both were very well executed.  The vegetables were nicely prepared and the beens were very good. The crispy spinach was interesting but only for the first few bites and afterwards grew old. I would have preferred a good sautéed spinach.  The mashed potatoes and rice of each of the dishes were simply prepared but each was nicely seasoned. The desserts looked appetizing but by time we completed our meal we were no longer sufficiently hungry.  We decided returning and ordering differently. Would allow that extra space to experience the dessert.
