It has been a while since I had the lobster roll here so I thought I would try it again. I like Connecticut style and I don't need my lobster drenched in butter, but buttery would be nice. My lobster roll was lacking that perfect flavor and texture. It was also smaller than I remember... I never expect lobster rolls to be filling, but I'd at least like to satisfy my craving, didn't really do it for me here. I wouldn't mind coming back if I were in the area.
