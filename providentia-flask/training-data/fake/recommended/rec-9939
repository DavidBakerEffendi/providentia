Went to Vic's for lunch during a visit to Philadelphia. It was fine. It was probably in the middle taste-wise of sushi that I've eaten in my life, but I don't know how it compares to other sushi places in Philly, so maybe it is as good as everyone says? I got the 3 roll special for 10.95, which is a wonderful deal. I ordered the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and a Philadelphia roll. The Philadelphia roll was fantastic. The salmon in it was perfection. The spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls were okay. I don't think they had water, but we were able to get some tea. And, it was nice sitting in front of the chefs and watching them work. Also, this is absolutely not a place to linger. There are about 7 or 8 chairs at the bar. And, one table of four. We were basically pushed out of the door. I would recommend ordering and picking it up.
