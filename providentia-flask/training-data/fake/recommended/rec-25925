Definitely one of the best burgers in the city - have beers while you wait in line for your table.  Dark interior of a pub - usually filled with prepped out guys who want a beer, burger while watching the game on TV.  Completely no frills - the menu is short but perfect.  It's also such a deal - $5 for a burger.  A definitely NY institution.
