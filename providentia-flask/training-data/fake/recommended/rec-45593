Oh how we needed thee in G-ho This is what an adult sports-bar looks like.  TV's are huge and everywhere, and there's really no bad seat in the house.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The food is far better than the next closest 'true' sports-bar, Fox & the Hound.  It's a good blend of small plates and entrees, sandwiches and comfort food.  The tap list wasn't striking, but solid.  A sports-bar doesn't need to bowl me over with their taps (I'll go to Jose Pistola's or Monks for that) but it needs to cater to the 21-40 crowd that likes an occasional heady draft. Prices were par for South Street, but likely higher than you might expect to pay at other sports pubs.  I suggest aggressive specials for games. On our first visit we had the BBQ pork sliders, "First Meal on the Moon" sliders, wings and split a burger.  The sliders were excellent (i could eat 50 of the Pork ones) and the burger was an excellent "pub" burger - again, no need to overdo the creativity at a sports-bar. The beef was cooked like asked (MR), the toppings were fresh and I'd definitely order it again. The wings were cooked perfectly, nice and crisp, but they came out a little dry and had to ask for an extra ramekin of buffalo sauce. I've heard and smelled good things regarding the Korean BBQ wings, that's next on my list. Went in for the Eagles-Redskins game on our second visit and was stunned at the size of the crowd.  Seeing as the place is so new, I'm not sure if I was witnessing a "friends and family effect" (there are four owners) or if it was entirely randoms. We struggled for a place to stand near the bar, and there was a first-come-first-serve policy in place with the tables, similar to a bar seat. I'm fine with this but my wife started asking why we didn't go home and drink for free.  I can't chastise a place for being packed, just an observation.  I'd definitely call this my new go-to for Phils-Flyers-Birds nights, and intend to bring more folks soon.
