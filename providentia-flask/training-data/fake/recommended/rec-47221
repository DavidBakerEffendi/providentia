Why did I move out of Brooklyn? Nowadays, the Ke$ha crowd seems to be more concerned about bottomless drink deals on a Sunday morning than pancakes. Shame. I've only ever been for brunch, so I can't in all fairness proclaim this place king of prospect heights, but the brunch menu never fails to impress. Speaking of pancakes.... Best I ever had. Slightly dense, slightly sweet, drizzled in nutella (if you're into that sorta thing) with a chantilly whipped cream that Jesus himself put his foot in. I've forced myself to try things other than the huevos rancheros, like the salmon hash which was good, but I gotta say, this place made me a true believer of Mexican eggs (I mean, beans and eggs, who wouldn't be skeptical?). When the yolk breaks and mixes with the salsa and warm crunchy tortilla, you'll know why that dish usually sells out before brunch-end. The bloody mary was admittedly a little watery. I like 'em kickin' though so it might be just fine for you pansies. (Tip: though it ought to be assumed in the brunch-mania that our Lord's day has become, get there EARLY. They have outside seating but the place is small and it seems to be "the spot" for the hip urban BroMA crowd, so the wait can be a minute.)
