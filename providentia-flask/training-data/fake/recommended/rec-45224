I love kafe neo! I wish they had more of these type of Cafes locally. Been here around 25x. I like how u can make ur own wraps, paninis & salads. This place is perfect if you wana war healthy, Â the food is fresh, the coffee selection Is good & tastes good, I like the green lychee tea which u can get as many refills as u want for free. I've also tried the soups which aren't overly salty like alot of soups are. Waitstaff is always friendly & smiling. I like the outdoor seating & it's byob . The couches in the back are comfortable & the music is always good n not too loud to the point u can't hear urself talkin with a friend that ur catchin up with. I hvnt tried the crepes yet but I will soon!
