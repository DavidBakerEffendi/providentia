This place should actually be 4.3 I LOVE THIS PLACE!  it is in a very good location.  beautiful city scenery and lots of neat space (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get seated in the back of this restaurant.  Food is great!  I get everything and anything here.  I highly recommend their philly cheesesteak rolls/burritos?  They are amazing!   And service?  Excellent.  Servers are wonderful and place is happening!
