Slightly off the beaten track in Chinatown, this place is representative of most restaurants you'll find here. The windows are somewhat dingy. It's small, and you may have to rub elbows with a few strangers depending on how crowded it is or where you sit. Most of the walls are mirrored. Some of the dining area doubles as storage space. But none of these are complaints. Just an observation of the wonderful norm, so don't avoid based on looks alone. The menu's pretty basic offering more or less the same pan-fried and noodle soup dishes. I ordered the #1 House Special noodle soup with hand pulled noodles, which came with oxtail, beef, tripe, and something else I can't remember, In the back of the menu, they give you a visual guide of the types of noodles you can choose from. To (knife) cut to the chase, it was delicious and satisfyingly sized. The soup was especially tasty, soaking up all the flavors of the different meat in the bowl. However, throughout the course of my dinner, I did notice an amazing influx of people who, shall I say, didn't look like they were Chinatown locals. I dunno who's been talking but beware! The foodies (local and not) are coming. Oh well. What I really enjoy about this restaurant is that it still feels like NY circa 1998. Even despite the masses of tourists that come to parade down Canal St, Chinatown itself sometimes still feels like one giant hole-in-the-wall. Please don't ever change.
