Everything on the menu is quick, delicious, and at least feels healthier than most options in the area. The staff (I believe two brothers share ownership?) is entertaining. It's a little tight inside with room for about a dozen people to eat but if you don't mind the intimate atmosphere it's a cool little spot.
