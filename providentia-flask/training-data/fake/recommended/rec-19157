Threatened by employee. Wow their employees are crazy women, I was just threatened. I ordered food for delivery including a cold milkshake, after 45mins called to see if it was on its way, & it still wasn't so I cancelled the order. A girl calls me back after 1hour of waiting to tell me if I want the order I asked for a fresh unmelted fruit milkshake cus she made it an hour ago and she said no that she was doing me a favor by calling me and then threatened me if I didn't take the delivery that they won't deliver to me ever again! Wtf! I said excuse me did you really just threaten me wow. I was really ptfo and as hungry as I was it wasn't worth getting cold food and a melted shake I ordered an hr ago, that still wasn't on its way. I told her she could keep her food calling me with a nasty attitude. unbelievable Never again, I always like this places food and ate there in person and ordered often but they just killed it for me. This is why I dont support small business in this town so disrespectful and rude, who the hell do these women think they are? You wont need to deliver to me ever again, cus I wont give u my hard earn money. Like what a threat your taking away money from your business not mines what a moron. Sad that they make Spanish woman look nuts.
