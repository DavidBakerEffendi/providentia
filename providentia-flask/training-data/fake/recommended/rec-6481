I've been dying to try this Greek restaurant for months, and I finally had a friend in town and figured I would give it a go. The food was good...nothing exceptional, but I would have gone back if I was craving Greek. The maitre'd (or host) came over at the end to ask us about our meal, and I was thinking how nice! Until he revealed the real reason he came by our table was to ask us to move into a little cubby in the corner. My friend, who I haven't seen in a year, and I had already paid the bill and were finishing up our final glass of wine Â (literally leaving in 5 minutes). I found his behavior extremely rude and off putting and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
