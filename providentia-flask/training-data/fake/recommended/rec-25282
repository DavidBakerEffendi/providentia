Grab lunch here from time to time.   Always have a good experience and enjoy the meal.    I usually eat their sandwiches (Turkey Club) but they come with a very fresh salad.  There specialty salads look excellent.    From a service perspective, everyone working here is very friendly and you won't have to wait long for your food.  Good for a quick lunch, although they are happy to have you hang out longer if you need to meet with someone.    Last, they have very interesting specials and they change regularly so you can tell they take a lot of price in their restaurant.   Background music is always interesting and they also have great cookies for desert!      I live in Manhattan and would visit Harvest Table regularly if it was in my neighborhood.
