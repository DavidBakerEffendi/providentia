Highly recommend! Definitely come here with a group - I was with four people, and even then we could have used some extra help.  It's a great place to come and orders lots of mezzes and share everything.  The place is huge inside, but packed on a Saturday night and very posh feeling. They originally tried to seat us in a small room upstairs that had a totally different feel and no ambiance, but luckily there was another table available in the main downstairs area.   Cocktails were all great (I loved my Fresh Meadow), and we got 7 mezzes to share with 4 people.  The waitress tried to tell us we needed more, but we couldn't even finish what we had! Highlights were the cauliflower, brussel spouts, and fatoosh salad.  Falafel and hummus were good, but not as unique.  Lot's of things to try, and definitely a group crowd pleaser.
