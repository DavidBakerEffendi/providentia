So, after waiting in traffic and driving here from the northeast we finally got to Koch's. The place is teeny tiny and there are only three chairs. We were greeted by a woman at the other end of the shop who took our orders. The man slicing meat in the front put some pastrami and corned beef out which was kind of cool. Â I ordered a corned beef special, the sandwich itself was pretty good, not as huge as some others I've had but still decent. Now for why I gave it two stars. This place takes FOREVER to make a sandwich, apparently they are known for this!!! Who in their right mind would get a deli sandwich that took an hour and a half to make! It doesn't even need to cook!! There were 4 people behind the counter and it looked like only one was making the sandwiches. I heard the staff talking to each other about someone canceling their order because it was taking to0 long. This is an insane way to run a business and I'm not sure how they are still standing. The staff was nice enough but it shouldn't take an hour and a half to make a sandwich, not even the samples helped the matter. Also not only did it take forever to make but it was like $11 for my sandwich which is pricey to being with. Not sure how the college kids are affording it on campus. I hadn't eaten in preparation of coming here and by the time it took to make the sandwich I was not only starving but had a migraine. Your corned beef isn't bad but sorry guys, never again.
