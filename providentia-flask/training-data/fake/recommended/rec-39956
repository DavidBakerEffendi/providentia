Update:  I finally tried the Frites, and they were fantastic.  They also had a great Belgian beer on tap which my wife and I both enjoyed.  And I topped off the evening by having a fine Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout.  This place is the perfect unpretentious place to have a snack and a beer.  And may I say, I was playing some mighty fine tunes on that Ipod-style jukebox.
