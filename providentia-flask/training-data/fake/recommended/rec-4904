You can't take points away for being small. Big things come in little packages, and Uzu does it's best for such a limited space. A beautiful piece of golden art welcomes you, and of course what is a sushi place without wooden fish on the walls and etched into the sushi counter motif. Â  The location is great obviously, right on the edge of old city. Good overall vibe, and even clever usage of bamboo (or what looks like it) to hide miscellaneous materials on the way the bathroom. Once again, I emphasize the place is small. Like red blood cells moving through a capillary small. But small places need love too...
