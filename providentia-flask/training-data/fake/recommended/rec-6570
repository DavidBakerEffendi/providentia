This was a great place to enjoy our Saturday morning brunch. The freshly squeezed orange juice was delicious. Since it looked like they specialized in crepes, we ordered crepes. The Crepes Chevre and the Salmon Crepes were both really really good. The service was very nice and the restaurant was adorable. This was a good spot to eat before heading for a nice walk around Williamsburg.
