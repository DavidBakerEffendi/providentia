My favorite go-to restaurant in the city if I'm craving Italian.  Now this isn't Italian-American, this reminds me of the authentic, fresh real Italian I had in Italy.  Servers are all Italian, which is awesome, and they are very attentive.  I love to go when the weather is warmer... they open all the windows/doors so the entire restaurant is open-air, or I sit outside.  It's a fairly small restaurant far west in Greenwich village, but worth the walk.  It also gets crowded during dinner, so be prepared to wait.  Try the homemade spinach gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce, it's exquisite, and remember, cash only!
