This is our preferred sushi location in Brooklyn, or all of NYC for that matter. The most important thing for you to know is that you must order the monkey roll. Everything is good, but it's all about the monkey roll. Monkey roll, monkey roll, monkey roll. (It's probably good luck to say it 3 times.) Otherwise, the ambience is lovely, the service is great, and the presentation of everything is wonderful. Oh, and try to avoid sitting right next to the door if it is crazy cold and windy. Enjoy!
