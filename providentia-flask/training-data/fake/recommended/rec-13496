Love the outdoor seating when the weather is nice! Haven't been to Malatesta in a year or so, but every memory I've had there has been great. Really fresh and light pasta, great ambience and close to the piers. What more can you ask for? I usually opt for the gnocchi or just the simple spaghetti with marinara and the fresh mozzarella--beyond delicious. Can't wait to go back!
