I had dinner here and the food was terrific. It was really inventive and well prepared. The small plates are good starters...ie, hearts of palm fries, calamari,and rice balls. The short ribs are intensely flavored and can be orders as mini sliders which were served on a corn bread bun...Wow! The paella was really wonderful and the entree short ribs are worth tasting. The place has a great little vibe going, a real find on the LES. I am definitely returning. By the way the service was so nice and vey attentive.
