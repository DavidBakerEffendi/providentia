The best sushi I ever had!   I saw so many pictures of this amazing sushi on yelp.  I've been meaning to try this place for some time.  I finally tried it and it's so good! Usually when you get vegan sushi it's just boring avocado or cucumber rolls.  What you get at this place is creative and well though out sushi rolls, that are made with real fresh ingredients.  The presentation was really high end too.   I ordered the special January roll which had grilled eggplant, black rice, and an olive sauce to name a few ingredients.  I also got the piece of the month which was a Roasted Caviar with Dehydrated Kalamata Olive.  I also got the Mighty Mushroom.  Everything was full of flavor. Also the staff was really friendly too.   My favorite sushi place in NYC.  It's such an awesome concept.  FInally healthy creative vegan sushi!   Can't wait to try more things from their menu!
