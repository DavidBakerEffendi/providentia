I went here with my boyfriend for his 30th birthday.  He wanted to spend a few hours at an arcade...Nomads sounded like the perfect place.  Everything we touched was broken.  The bowling alley had 4 lanes - 3 broken.  Shooting games only one gun worked.  Air Hockey was super reflective and hard to play.  We purchased tokens thinking we could use them in some of the games and they were only good for like 5 machines.  all but 1 of the ticket counting machines were broken.  Lazer tag wasn't too bad but the music was too quiet and you could see everyone which made it a little dull.   All in all it needs some money to be poured into it to make it an actual attraction worth the money.
