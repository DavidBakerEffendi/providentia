I've only been here once, and it was right before the holidays. The crowd seemed a little older, which was nice because I hate a "college bar" feel. It might have been because colleges were on break, so I could be wrong about the crowd. My friends and I liked the beer/wine list and tried a few new ones. Any bar that serves Lindemann's gets a gold star in my book ;-) We had the wings as an appetizer, and the maple flavor of them was really unique...the sweet and salty thing together really made them memorable. I had the scallops entree, and it was fantastic...I would definitely recommend it. Overall, the menu isn't very extensive...my friends both had steaks and enjoyed them thoroughly. I'm giving three stars for now, but if I go back and it still doesn't feel like a college bar, then I would upgrade to four stars.
