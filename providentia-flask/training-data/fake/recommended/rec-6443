I've been dining in and ordering delivery from Sanford's for about 2 years now and have yet to be disappointed.   The Butternut Squash Ravioli is a must! Another personal favorite is the Organic Whole Wheat Linguine with organic chicken, sun-dried cranberry, apple sausage. I've tried numerous salads, quesadillas, wraps, burgers, and chicken dishes.  All delicious and very generously proportioned.  The Chicken Paillard is another great choice - it is topped with a yummy tomatoe/spinach salad. Definitely save room for dessert!  The Banana/Caramel Xangos are amazing.  So is the Reese's Peanut Butter Pie. It's a great brunch atmosphere on the weekend, a great place for a date at night.  Also, I had a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend here and they were very accommodating to our group of 10. LOVE this place.
