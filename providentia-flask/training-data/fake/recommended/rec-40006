This place was a GREAT find. Very small and quaint but I didn't have to wait for a table. The room has exposed brick and wooden tables and seats and the lighting is pretty dim (candle lit dinner). Food - we got A LOT of food (onto the good stuff): PAPPA AL POMODORO (Tuscan soup of tomatoes, bread and basil topped with fresh ricotta.  Served warm) : This soup was the first part of the meal we tried. It was very thick but so good. The mix of the different ingredients really goes well together. POLPETTINE DELLA TOSCA (beef meatballs): among the best meatballs I've had. There were 6 of them in a tomato-like sauce. We dipped these in the tuscan soup (above) and it was heavenly. Each meatball was about 1 inch in diameter STRISCE ALLA CHIANTIGIANA  (pasta strips with pork cheek and a wine sauce): I am not a pork eater but I was (semi) forced to try it and it was surprisingly really good. The pasta and wine sauce though was the best part. Cooked to perfection and (again) a great blend of different tastes. PESCE DEL GIORNO(fish of the day we went was snapper): Never had snapper before and it was so good! Not over cooked, not under cooked. LINGUINE CON RAGÙ DI CODA DI ROSPO (pasta with monkfish): unfortunately we did not get to spend as much time on this dish (as it came last). The fish was a new fish and was a bit chewey-er than other that I've had, but the dish was still really good. Everything was prepared SOO nicely! Service: The service was IMPECCABLE. I drink water very quickly and not once did I have to ask for more. They were all over our table. Additionally, our food came out very quickly. I would definitely come back here. It is relatively casual and can be for anything from dates, to family dinners, to eating by yourself.
