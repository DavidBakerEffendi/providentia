This place is why I've decided to join Yelp. There are so few good and cheap Mexican places that I like in the New Haven area. I'll be honest, this place is a little weird. It's on street parking but most of the regulars hop the curb to park on their grass. You should probably speak a little Spanish, though they are good about sending over someone that speaks English. Good thing they have a menu in English available where you can point to what you want. I've been several times and I've never had soggy nachos, don't know what the first reviewer is talking about. Everything I've had there appears to be homemade and I've never noticed any "packaged" taste, this place is family owned. I will warn you that the regulars will stare at you for being a gringo. It's worth it for the authentic and delicious food. The burritos are gigantic, so keep that in mind when you're downing the nachos. I've never sat with someone who's finished one. I've requested mine with no meat with no problem. My boyfriend loved the tamales. If you want to get out of the slump of the regular New Haven restaurant scene and are feeling adventurous, this is the place to go.
