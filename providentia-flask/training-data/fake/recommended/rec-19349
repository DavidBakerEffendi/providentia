Ok...at first glance you're not quite sure that the building that you're entering into is actually where you should be.  I came in thru the Washington Ave entrance..there is also an entrance of the 16th Street side.  I found the secret Vietnamese restaurant stash of philadelphia... and OMG!!! FABULOUS FABULOUS food. They were super nice and very attentive. I ordered the Thai ice tea with bubbles and the Bun Bo Hue.  I thought I would need a bed afterwards... total itis situation... :) And the Thai ice tea with bubbles.. when I came in there was a woman walking out with 4 of them.  Now I know why.  I'll be back tomorrow to take one (maybe 2:) to go!
