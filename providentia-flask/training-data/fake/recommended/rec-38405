We were privileged enough to catch the birthday celebration of Miguel (husband of Sandra - happy birthday Miguel!) and this restaurant definitely lives up to its 5 star rating on yelp. Sandra, her son Miguel, and everyone else at the restaurant gave off such a warm, cozy atmosphere. Staff was extremely helpful, and you could tell that they truly loved their food and their restaurant. My husband had the BBQ Pork Ribs, Caribbean rice, dirty rice, fried okra, and the string beans. I ordered cajun fried chicken, mac 'n cheese, sweet potato fries, collard greens, and the sweet plantains. Only amazing things to be said about our meal. This definitely brought back memories of soul food down in the south. Can't wait to go back to try the other sides!!
