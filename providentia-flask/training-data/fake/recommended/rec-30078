Remarkably unprofessional e-mail sent to us through Yelp from our ULC waiter.  ULC is clearly not the fine dining establishment it purports itself to be, or employees would not be e-mailing nasty things to customers post-facto. Hi, I was your waiter this night. I'm sorry if you had a bad night but I want to clarify some points with you. Before you say things like you said, "Our server spoke in a fake French accent", you should make sure what you said is true. I was born and raised in Paris (29 years) and move in America in 2005. Second thing, I'm not a thief like you said. What I remember is your bill was about $ 120 and you left $ 150 , so I took your check to give you some change. I took the check when you left from the table [THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE, HE TOOK IT MOMENTS AFTER HE DROPPED OFF THE CHANGE AND BEFORE WE GOT UP] and you left $ 9. I don't know how you can leave less than this. I think we ve you a dessert that was free and you eat it quickly [THEY TOOK BITE-SIZE PEICE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE AND CUT IT IN HALF FOR US] In France we have a saying, chacun voit midi a sa porte. You should look at it. Also stop thinking that the world turn around you because you work at Yale. That was really funny. I am glad that you won't come back, because this restaurant deserves better guest than you. I was sad to see this review because it was my last night but i am glad to make thes poit with you. Bien à vous, The Fake french
