I'm gonna start off and say that i'm giving 3 stars because they were the only restaurant in the area that had availability for us without a reservation.  Our waiter was very nice but service was SLOW.  We all went with the prefix menu.  Our appetizers came out in a timely manner.  Then we waited almost an hour for our entree.  The strip steak that I got was ok but it was not cooked to my liking, I asked for medium well, and they brought it medium rare.  I didn't complain and ate only a small portion because I was so hungry and service was slow that I didn't know how much longer it would take for them to cook it more.  Then it took about another hour for our dessert to come out.  When they took our order for dessert, everyone ordered a coffee.  So the dessert comes out but no coffee.  We go and complain and it still took another 25 minutes for our coffee to come out.  We asked the waiter what the problem was and he indicated that they had to pull two servers from the Montclair location to send them to the Morristown location.  But reading the other reviews it seems like this is a common problem. Anyway, to sum it up, the garlic shrimp was ok, the mixed green salad wasn't anything special, the steak was ok, and the creme brulee could have been made better.  It was caramelized on top but it was like pudding on the bottom.  Will I go back, no.  I've had better steak at outback for a much cheaper price.
