my last proper meal in philly was at amada and this was after a slew of starr restaurants under my belt. i found that the ambiance and decor for this place was slightly lacking at first glance only because it seemed so NOT over the top the way morimoto and pod were. but then i realized the beauty in it's subtlety and i was quite pleased. then it came down to the menu.... i have quite a love/hate relationship with tapas restaurants. love because ALL the food is generally so tasty looking that i want to try it ALL. hate because my stomach says "why? why are you trying to feed me til i burst?" we were 5 at the table and the lovely waitress came by and said she recommended we get btwn 3 and 4 plates per person. we went with the ladies orders and rounded up about 17 or 18 dishes we had our eyes on. by the end of the meal my love for the place had turned to hate. my stomach was about to burst. but all because of the amazingly good food i had just ingested. the two women who took care of us were super friendly. the one woman managed to remember ALL of our dishes as i rattled them off one by one. she didn't make a single mistake. that alone deserves an over-the-top tip. all the food was delicious and my white wine based sangria was very very good. even if my stomach was hating me, i still loved the place and would easily return.
