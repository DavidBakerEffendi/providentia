I went here for restaurant week and we had a great meal!  We were kept waiting after our reservation, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the ambience (it just feels like it's trying too hard).  But the food is excellent.  We started off with the hummus, which came with slightly sweet, delicious pita bread.  The falafel was also a winner.  And the mexican corn was sooo good and cheesy. Then I had the gnocchi for my entree (I was leaning towards the risotto, but the waiter recommended this instead).  I'm glad he did, it was very unusual and a smaller portion, but it was fantastic!  It came in this yogurt sauce that reminded me of an Armenian dish we have called manti.  So good.  My boyfriend had the duck which was amazing too.   For dessert I was excited to get the candy bar (from all the reviews) but it was just okay...too heavy for my liking (and I like sweets!).  My boyfriend had the ice cream, which wasn't anything special either.
