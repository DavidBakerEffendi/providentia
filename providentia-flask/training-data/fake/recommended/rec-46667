I love getting the poppy seed bagel, cream cheese, whitefish salad and tomato here, and washing it down with an iced tea. There's always seating - and big roomy tables, too - and there's wi-fi. The queue to order and pay is a tad confusing, and the servers are ... something.  Neither friendly nor unfriendly.  They are not like Last Drop servers ("I am infinitely more hip then you and am so superior to you I refuse to acknowledge your presence") - but I get the odd sense when I am in there that I'd wandered into some tight group of friends that I am not a part of.  At Chapterhouse, Philly Java Co. and La Columbe, you just order and sit and that's that, but I get an odd sense of not quite belonging at B2 when I am there.   Ellen O. said it well.  Maybe it is the patrons and not the staff.  They all seem so intertwined, though. It's a good spot, though.
