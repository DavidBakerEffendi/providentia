Larger than it appears, I was pleasantly surprised at this neighborhood gem.  My apple and cheddar omelette was different for me but excellent.  Everything on their breakfast menu looked really good and dinner looked even better.  There is almost always a wait but like I said it is pretty big inside and they have RC cola so...it's worth the wait.
