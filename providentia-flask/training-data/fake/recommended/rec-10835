Ok so this place is definitely a bit gawdy with the giant chandelier in the middle of the restaurant, all the mirrors, and the waitresses dressed up as flappers... but the bottom line is the food is great and the prices are cheap.  The chicken spicy basil noodles I ordered were fantastic- I could taste the basil, there was fried eggs and basil, and it was just spicy enough!  The noodles here are definitely better than the ones at Qi and Q2.  The portion was also quite generous.  And at $8.95 (on the dinner menu)- how can you beat that?!  My friends ordered the pad thai and the mango chicken- both very good.   It was packed on a Friday night though, so come early and don't expect to be able to linger after you finish eating.
