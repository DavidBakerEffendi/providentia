OMG! if you are ever in a bad mood jut go to Max Brenner and order The Spectacular Melting Chocolate S'mores ice cream. It's amazing. the combination of marsh mellow, chocolate and ice cream is out of this world. they have liquid white chocolate on the side which adds more flavor to the ice cream. They are opening new restaurants in Boston and Las Vegas. They should open one in every cites.
