This place is worth the glowing reviews and Â 5 stars it currently has. Small clean dining space but the important thing here is the food. The chaats are truly a flavor explosion that is custom built for you. I order spicy and find it perfectly so, not too mild but doesn't leave me in tears. The number of lassi flavors and combinations are impressive. I've only had Cardamom & Mango so far but both were delicious!
