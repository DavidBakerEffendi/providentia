I love this place. I've been eating here for years-I have never had a bad meal here. My fav dishes are -the Bacon Dijon Turkey Burger, their Salmon has always been the freshest and best I've ever had, I love their fabulous Mediterranean Salad....great breakfasts as well. Bakery and desserts are wonderful. I always tell people it's "restaurant food" not diner food. Â I prefer sitting in the Lounge Section of the Americana, & they happily accommodate that request everytime. This is one of my favorite places to eat. Hope to be eating here soon!
