I'm not going to lie.... I am extreeeeeemely picky about Thai food since there is a large Thai population in DC I was very spoiled for 4 years. That being said.... I 100% approve of the thai food at Room Service in Hell's Kitchen! Went here for a casual/trendy date night with the bf after a long work week. Be warned- for groups under 5 people, they do not take reservations. We must have beaten the rush because we were initially told it would be a 20 minute wait for a table, yet we were seated after 7 minutes and by that point, the line was out the door. The GOOOOOOD: Apps: Chicken Satay (we were licking our fingers clean!), Entrees: LEGIT chicken pad thai-- the portion was huuge and after half i was definitely full. Drinks: the APHRODITE!!! OMG ordered 2 of these and the bf definitely had some as well.... strong, tasty... doesn't get much better than that. The ok: App: Green dumpings- tasty, but we weren't "wowed" by it, Drink: Steam room... light and refreshing, but as previously mentioned, the boy liked my drink better. Entree: Lemon grass chicken- according to the bf it was tasty and he would order it again, but not a "wow" factor dish. The portions here were definitely price worthy.. and you definitely know food is legit when you have diners of the nationality frequenting the restaurant. The only complaints about the restaurant was that it was definitely on the noisy side, was kinda small and the waitress was at the table every 10-15 minutes. Would definitely come back again to try out more food on the menu.
