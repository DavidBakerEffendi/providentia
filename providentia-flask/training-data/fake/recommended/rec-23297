This place just rekindled my interest in the Philadelphia dining scene. This little gem of a BYOB offers a 5-course prix fixe dinner with just two seatings on Sundays (10 tables X 2) for $33 which quite likely might be the best deal in the city (forget restaurant week). Last night we were treated to some exceptionally fresh seafood and each course was better than the last. They started us with an arugula-fennel salad, followed by tuna tartare with a spicy garlic aioli and persimmons topped with a sprig of coriander. The third course was a scallop with potato soup, white mustard seeds and crispy potato skin. The scallop was fresh, and delicate, the soup and accompaniments were forceful, a very well-conceived and presented dish. Grilled cobia with caramelized onions and a red peppers was almost as good if not better, it was very flavorful, and very correctly portioned. There was no menu, not even a blackboard menu and it was fun not knowing what the next course would be. We finished with a brownie and an ice cream, and although I have had meh-experiences with dessert at quality restaurants, this was not one of them. A bottle of 2009 Hedges family reserve red from Washington state really complimented what was perhaps one of our best meals in Philadelphia.
