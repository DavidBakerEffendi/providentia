Cute interior, small and intimate. Good food, but I expected better based on the yelp reviews. Most of the dishes are slightly bigger than your average tapas, and therefore slightly more expensive (about $8-$12 each dish), so you need about 2-3 dishes per person to get full. Here's what i got: -Yellowtail Tartare: 4/5- Awesome -Scallops: 3/5- Texture of the scallops itself were eh, but the truffled corn salad it came with made up for it -Pork Belly Buns: 2/5- Ippudo Pork buns these are not. Pork was pretty dry -Oxtail Terrine: 3/5- Good but nothing mindblowing. Too salty (and I grew up eating chinese takeout for breakfast everyday, so trust me when i say i can handle my salt and MSGs) -Pappardelle Pasta and Ramps: 2/5- Pasta was dry and lacked flavor, ramps were good but dish was overall unspectacular Overall, the place is good, not too pricy, but i don't think it's worth all the hype and the 45 minute wait on weekends
