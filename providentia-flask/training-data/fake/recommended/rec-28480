OMGosh!  The panini's are soooo good. What a nice and laid-back place.  It is a bit small and it definitely does get a bit crowded. We went in mid-afternoon on Sunday (2:30ish) and the place was still jumping! Unfortunately, the weather did not allow for the backyard to be open, but the indoor seating arrangement was find.  Note, I'll be back on a nicer day for some outdoor dining ;0p The have great bottles of wine...seems like Tapas!  Yum!   And all types of cured pork meat!  Chroizo, Proscuitto, Jamon...OMG..I've gone to pork heaven. What did we get.... Special potatoe puree soup and it came with a toasted bread with a basil & garlic spread....double Y-U-M! Spicy avocado & goat cheese Crostini....OMG!  Yum-o-licious!!!!! Note, they literally have tons  of selection of crostinis! Paninis.... I got the brunch special - smoky bacon, scramble eggs, cheese and drizzle of truffle oil. My partner got...something with roasted peppers, chorizo and Cheese...of course. Both....delicious! Overall....definitely hitting this joint again! Price:  Moderate Food:  Delicious and decent portions Vibe: Laid-back, warm and inviting Service: Very good, nice and friendly
