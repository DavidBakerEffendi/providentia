Bourbon, whiskey & southern food.  If they let me fire up a cigar for dessert, I'd be in heaven. Char has an extensive bourbon and whiskey menu to choose from.  As much as I enjoy the available variety, I'm a sucker for the spicy ginger ale & bourbon mixed drink that they make. I even started making them at home.  Appetizers are all great with the lamb pastrami being my favorite.  The pickled onions and coriander aioli give it just the lamb pastrami just the right amount of flavor.  The thick cut bacon and cheese curds are pretty good too.  For a main, the smoked sage pork sausage is the way to go.  The jambalaya is great and very tasty.  I thought the steak was good, not great.  My only complaint is the service.   The place seems to get really busy and, as a result, food sometimes take way too long (30 min between courses) to get to your table.  But as long as you have a glass of whiskey or bourbon to hold you over, it's not too bad.  Prices are slightly above moderate.  Well worth it if you're looking for some southern food and drink.
