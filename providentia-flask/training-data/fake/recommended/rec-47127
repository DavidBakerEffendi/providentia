I'm working late, and Hummus claims to deliver to my work address (on campus at UPenn), so I put in an order for delivery, waited 90 minutes, called to follow up, was put on hold for 10 minutes, then hung up on before I called back to cancel my order. Â The food might be fine, but the service is nonexistent - just like my dinner. Guess I'll hit the vending machine.
