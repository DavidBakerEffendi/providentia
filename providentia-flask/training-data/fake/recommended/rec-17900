I tried to get take out here a few years back and the woman on the phone put me on hold then was very rude to me, so it took some convincing for me to agree to eat here.  Husband had a deal-saver or some sort of deal so it was worth trying in spite of my first impression. Food:  Overall the food is a solid 4 stars.  Tasty pizzas with great crust and great toppings, what there was of it. Service:  Top notch.  The server was friendly and quick and our food arrived in good time. Ambiance: 1 star. One of those places that in spite of good food you don't really want to stay very long at but maybe that's what they were going for.   Hopefully they will actually sell me take out next time.
