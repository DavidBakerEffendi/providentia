This place was a total let down, definitely over hyped. Went there with a group and half liked the food while the other half was disappointed. The chicken was nothing to rave about, was average. The worst dish was by far the gnocchi, it was the seasonal dish with spicy sausage. It was nothing special to look at, appeared as if it could have just been dumped out of a can and the taste, ugh was like a soggy sausage pizza. Because most of the gnocchi had burnt bottoms, combine that with marinara sauce and sausage equals awful. The only good dishes were the swordfish & side of potatoes. But still would not recommend, there's much better places around.
