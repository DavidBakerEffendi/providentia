I think I'm easy to please. To me, the best meals are flavorful, come in sizable portions, and are a great value for the price. I had one of those meals at Nan Zhou! The beef brisket noodle soup was simply delicious. I also tried some shrimp, pork, and scallion wontons- also amazing. It's that easy. The service is a little scattered, and the ambience is lacking, but this isn't the type of place you go to for that kind of stuff. I chose this spot based on the favorable Yelp reviews and it did not fail me. Thanks fellow Yelpers! I I'll definitely be back before I leave Philly!
