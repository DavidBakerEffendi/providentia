I used to come here all the time, but I won't ever be coming back. I arrived at 8:15p and put my name on the list. 30 minutes later 5 seats open up. The host seats a larger party that just arrived because "they have to take care of their money." of course he offers me the next seat that opens - assuming that another larger party doesn't happen to be waiting. Is that the kind of person you want to give your money to, in a service industry? I didn't think so.
