My family and I order out once a week for dinner. We decided to try Bruno's for the first time this weekend. Boy are we glad we did! The pizza was hot, fresh and delicious. We also sampled some appetizers, such as fried calamari and buffalo wings. It was all equally delicious. We can't wait to try their hot and cold subs next week. Needless to say, we have found a new pizzaria to enjoy as a family!
