Been once so far.  Super solid cheesesteaks.  LOTS of well seasoned meat, cheese, and onions, cooked perfectly.  A do it yourself fixings bar, plenty of seating (though I didn't care for the decorating), and sports on a big TV. I definitely prefer it over Pat's or Geno's.  In fact, out of the cheesesteaks I've had in Philly so far, this one is my favorite. Did I mention that the people who work there are actually nice?  I was beginning to think cheesesteaks were only made by jerks, but these guys proved me wrong... Thanks Abner's.
