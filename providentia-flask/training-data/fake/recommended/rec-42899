Pro: Time spent at Amélie reminds me about the leisurely there-hour lunches and dinners in Paris, good food, wonderful service, and beautiful wine selections. Con: Don't go if you are in a rush, the clock at  Amélie does not run with New York minutes. Verdict: A great place for a casual romantic outing, and small group gathering.
