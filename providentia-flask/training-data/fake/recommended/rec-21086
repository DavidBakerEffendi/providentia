This bar is basically a pretty normal pub with somewhat fancy pub fare. I had the gorilla platter, which is a chicken Cobb salad with for bundles mini cheeseburgers and avocado. It was a paleo dream! All the protein, no carbs! Also I had a white sangria, because they have no margaritas. Now I'm drunk reviewing, which might be mistake. Too late, I ain't deleting!!! Anyway the prices are somewhat high, but not too bad. But the food could be a bit better prepared for the cost. Service was friendly, if slow. THEY RAN OUT OF ANY THUPE F FIZZY WATER!?!?! I was confused and kinda scared. But I'll definitely return in the near future. Go here if you live nearby and want a nice date spot.
