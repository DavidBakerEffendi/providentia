This is the first time I've ever re-reviewed any place (on earth). I just got home from another great meal at El Camino and I felt it would be a disservice not to give this place 5 stars. The moist beef brisket was a revelation! With no additional sauce needed, the meat was tender, flavorful, and delicious. Complimented with texas toast and pickles, it was as good as it gets. The chips and salsa were also top notch; I love the extra spice they add to the chips. Finally, $20 for a margarita pitcher that poured us about 6 glasses... that's a great price around philly. El Camino, you complete me.
