I loved it, too. The walls opened to the breezy-by-the-river summer night, the waiters were friendly (and way hot), and the food -- OMG the food! We enjoyed a light prosciutto and fig plate, grilled calamari, and of course mozzarella and tomatoes. The wine was flowing well into midnight, when we capped the night with a sensational panna cotta. Cash only.
