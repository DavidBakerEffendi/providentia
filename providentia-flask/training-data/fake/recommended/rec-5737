I decided to try out Memphis Taproom because it's local and has lots of clearly marked vegan/vegetarian items. I ordered the King Rarebit and was not disappointed. It's basically the epitome of drunk food: some big slices of toast slathered with a fondue sauce and topped with 2 poached eggs. The soggy fries it came with were the only disappointing part of the meal. The place is tiny on the inside and we had the misfortune of sitting at one of the tiny 2-top tables in the center of the room. I was bumped into and brushed against throughout dinner, which was annoying and led me to focus my attention on trying to take up as little square footage as possible. I think the servers' and diners' lives would be made much easier if they just got rid of those tables. Despite the claustrophobia, I'm excited to go back again. They have so many veg items that I can come back 6 more times without having the same meal twice.
