My roommate and I stopped in after seeing the great yelp reviews, but upon further investigation...that might just be for their gluten free options. Roomie had the Capellini Calamari and was less-than-pleased. The calamari was chewy and the sauce lacked the kick the menu promised. I had the Cavatelli con Salsicca and it was just...bland. The peppers were delicious, but everything else was meh. Based upon all these other yelpers, I would say give it a shot if you have a gluten intolerance, otherwise, don't bother!
