Our experience last night was awful. We had not even taken our coats off and already the waitress was asking if we wanted drinks.  The server refilling the water must have come over 10 times to top off our water, interrupting our conversation numerous times  Both dinners we ordered were almost unedible.  The baked, sausage stuffed chicken had No sausage in it at all and the stuffing itself had no seasoning or taste what so ever.  The other dinner - the pork Braciole was shredded over cooked pork, Not a nicely rolled braciole. It was served with stuffed rigatoni which was hard, under cooked or worse yet possibly cooked hours before and reheated so it was hard and unedible.   When asked if we'd like pepper or grated cheese the waiter served the my husband first, leaving me sitting there wondering why??  The sever made no effort to correct any of these problems, did not ask if we'd like to speak to the manager, just put the check on the table and made us feel like she was  rushing us out.  We both had stomachs ached the rest of the night.  I have never written a review before, but felt so strongly that I felt I should.  You are paying top dollar for  bottom of the barrel food in my opinion and experience.
