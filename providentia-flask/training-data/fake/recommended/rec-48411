Bijan's may be the coziest tippling hole in the neighborhood with friendly bartenders, well-mixed refreshing cocktails, and a menu of shareable eats that will hold it all down.  There's something so easy and familiar about this place, it'll make you want to stay for hours chatting with your friends.  Groups will find the long picnic tables in the middle convenient, but don't be so loud that you disturb others in this small space.  As a final note, love that it's close to transportation, unlike our other fave happy hour spots on the western end of Atlantic.
