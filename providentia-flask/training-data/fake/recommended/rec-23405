Great little place to go for lunch or a quick meal.  I have been a few times now and have tried a burrito once and chicken tacos two other times.  All of the ingredients are super fresh. Each time I have been in, it has been a good experience from the friendly people behind the counter to the quality of the food.  Glad this place opened up in Hightstown.  Try the horchata!!
