I came here a bit over a year ago, tried the fat noodles with chicken, enjoyed watching the Wizard-of-Oz-like noodle guy in the backroom; but otherwise unremarkable. Today, I hopped over for lunch and Jesus, I don't know if something was different; if one should always order the beef, or if maybe I was a complete tool last year but these noodles rocked. I devoured an enormous lunch and still wanted more. I got the medium fat beef stir fry noodles doused in the sriracha mix. Delicious. Do it.
