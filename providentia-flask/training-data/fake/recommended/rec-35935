The plain pizza is hands down the best item on the menu. Super good and fresh and flavorful. Easily the best pizza I have ever had. I've tried it with chicken as well but nothing beats the plain pizza. The cannoli was also massive and oh so good not to mention those tiny chocolate covered ice cream balls. I had to take a star off because the service was horribllle. Our waiter disappeared and would not come back for ages or ask if we needed anything. The manager is such a sweet guy. If only the staff adopted his attitude as well
