A fanatic of Spanish foods and also a tea connoisseur, Mambo Tea House provided the best of both worlds for me. The interior is beautiful and the statue of Buddha gives a very calming vibe. I tried the plantain chips with the mojo sauce, the Cuban pumpkin soup, and the Cuban expresso tiramisu. Lastly, I tried the Jasmine tea. Everything was phenomenal. The staff was friendly, fast, and very professional. I went on a Saturday and was pleased to not find it uncomfortably packed with people.
