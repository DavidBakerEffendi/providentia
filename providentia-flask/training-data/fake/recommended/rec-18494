I treated a friend (who recently graduated college) to this place last night . Atmosphere:  Nice and modern decor, lighting quite dim.  Indoors is pretty noisy, the outdoor garden is quite nice.   Service:  Abrupt and quick, like most Thai restaurants I've been to.  Our appetizers and food came in maybe less than 20 minutes. Food:  Insanely good. For starters, my friend and I had shrimp spring rolls, and a small plate of calamari.  Everything was incredibly fresh and piping hot, we had to blow on the food before putting it in our mouths.   For entrees, I had the spicy noodle with shrimp, while my friend had one of the green curry dishes.  The dish has very strong garlic and fennel flavors, but it wasn't what I would define as "spicy".  That said, it was still very delicious and filling. Drinks:  We both had Thai iced teas, which was a creamy, sweet and refreshing treat on such an awful summer day. Grand total for both appetizers, entrees and beverages + tax = grand total of $36.90.  I could *not* believe it. The only downside to this place, is that it's cash only. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place for meeting friends, or going on a date.
