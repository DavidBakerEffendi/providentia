Wow!!!!  This place exceeded my expectations (even after my expectations were raised ridiculously high by the Yelpers!)....fresh fish, crusty bread, exceptionally priced and delicious dry Portuguese white wine, friendly service....I loved every second of it. I heartily recommend the shrimp in garlic appetizer and even more heartily recommend the seafood soup...for $8 it is a dense, bursting-with-flavor assortment of shellfish goodies in the richest broth you can imagine....with the bread served along with it the soup could easily make a filling lunch. We also ate a seafood skewer which was very good, but not great -- the monkfish was a tad dry.  But the octopus appetizer was mind-blowing, so tender and bursting with flavor. I can't say enough about this place; I was truly blown away and cannot stop thinking about when I can make it back there from NYC to work my way through the rest of the menu.
