My husband and I went here for our anniversary on a Friday night. The restaurant is small, but in my reservation I had requested a table by the window and not only did they accommodate that request but they also tried to put us a little removed from others (the restaurant is a little cramped). Our food was really good. We got the fresh oysters that came with a nice sauce, the gnocchi (which they nicely split into two bowls for us). I had the lamb which, while a little too salty, was so big I couldn't finish it. My husband had fish that had this sweet fresh corn and avocado- really good. We had the cheese plate for dessert and a bottle of wine. Our total bill was around $160- so not so outrageous (could have been worse!). I'd go back.
