It's a shame that a country with such a deep and respected culinary history is so poorly represented in America. The wife and I tried this hearing it was head and shoulders better than other Chinese food delivery. I'd say it was a mixed bag. The ingredients are far and away better than your typical cheap Chinese food place. No canned mushrooms and frozen veggies. The big let down was that the sauce was exactly the same as cheap Chinese food. I was hoping that for the price, my Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce would be a great spicy savory sauce. Instead it was drenched in the usual sugary hardly spicy gloop you're used to. On the plus side, they do have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options, and my wife's lo-mein wasn't greasy and was much more fresh tasting. But for twice the price of regular delivery Chinese food, I was expecting twice the quality. I've eaten places where for a dollar or two more a plate than here, you get amazing and authentic fare. Sadly Black Bamboo falls in that no-mans-land on the price/quality spectrum. The verdict is, unless you're vegan, you can get much better bang for your buck elsewhere. Although I would consider trying again, maybe at the restaurant, to see if it was just a bad day for them, for now look for other options.
