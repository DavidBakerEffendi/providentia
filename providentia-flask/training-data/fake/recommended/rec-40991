It's a gem in the neighborhood! I used to go to Fanny's for brick oven pizza but recently I found Barboncino on Yelp. We just tried it and really love it! The waitress is friendly! We order two pizza and a cheese platter, the size of cheese platter is large and it comes with a pie! They have happy hours and the draft beer is only $2! Â Love the background Jazz music and the ambience!
