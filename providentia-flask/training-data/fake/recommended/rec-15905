I had a dinner at Balaboosta with my husband and co-worker last week. The cocktails, hummus, fried olives, cauliflower, were all delish! The atmosphere was also nice, being able to look into the kitchen while they cook was an added elment to the atmosphere. I give 4 stars because my entree, the short ribs, were dry, and I wouldn't recommend ordering this. Other than that, it was a fun night and I will go back!
