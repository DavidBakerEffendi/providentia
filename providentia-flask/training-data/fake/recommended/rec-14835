Service was definitely a 4.5 food was more like a 3.5 which is why I gave them a 4. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing...split the warm shrimp salad with my hubby as a starter, totally bland. It was supposed to have Parmesan cheese but I sure could not taste it. I wasn't overly thrilled by the bread basket either. I ordered the beef bourguignion which was decent. My husband got the short rib special which he said was decent too. I just wasn't wowed. Creme brûlée dessert was good but nothing special either. I want to go back and try the burger though that looked lovely.  Overall it was just ok. Might give it another try...
