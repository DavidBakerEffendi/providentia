Tommy DiNic's serves Roast Beef and Pork sandwiches at a lunch counter in The Reading Terminal that brings customers from around the country. People that come here for events at The Convention Center are in love with the sandwiches here. The Beef and Pork are high quality (from Harry Ochs in the terminal) and are roasted to perfection. They are the most popular sandwiches, but I also enjoy the Italian Sausage and the Veal Scallopini. Sometimes it's just great to grab a sandwich at the counter and listen to Tommy and Bo tell you how great life would be if they ran everything!
