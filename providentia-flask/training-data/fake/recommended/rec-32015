I love eating at this place for their Italian food! I go every year for my birthday dinner  and a couple other times throughout the year and look forward to it every time! The mussels are great and the pastas are fantastic. I've had a wide variety of items on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Service has always been wonderful and they they know their menu. Save room for dessert because the creme brûlée is awesome. I've recommend it to all my friends and they are hooked on this place too!
