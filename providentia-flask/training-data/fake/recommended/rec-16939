First things first. I've never had a soup dumpling and heard these are the best, so had to check it out. It may be all the rage, but after trying them, I conclude that I prefer dumplings in my soup vs. soup in my dumplings. Nothing against these specimens, which were tasty. They just didn't wow me, and left me wanting a bowl of Wonton Soup. With that said, I am a simple man when it comes to Chinese food. Wonton soup, Sesame chicken + Fried Rice & I'm good to go. Shanghai Asian Manor is the best I have had in a long time. The sesame chicken was not overly battered or fried, making for a moist chicken bite with a crispy crust, in a very rich sauce. The fried rice is also not heavy or greasy. Â We will be back, though next time for Wonton Soup instead of the soup dumplings.
