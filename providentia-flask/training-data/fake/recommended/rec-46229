Since they reopened as the East Hanover Diner, the service has gotten a little better. At first, the servers did not know what they were doing and didn't know the menu. Now, the staff knows what they are doing, they know the menu better, and they are nice for the most part. Sometimes you wait a little for a server to come to take your order and to come back to check on you. The food is not bad at all, depending on what you like. I love the curly fries here. I haven't waited for a table yet. The decor is nice and the atmosphere is fine. Everything is new and clean.
