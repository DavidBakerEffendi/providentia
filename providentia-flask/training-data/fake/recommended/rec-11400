I'm always on a quest for Â a $5 lunch in Center City. The shear number of suits than can afford $8 to $10 every day makes this task all the more challenging. You bet your britches I was stoked to find out that Jake's offers a $5 roast pig sandwich on Mondays! It was good. Definitely not the best roast pork in the city, but solid. I really can't slam such a cheap sandwich, let alone one made with the most heavenly of meats. 4-Stars for being cheap, but 3-stars overall because at full price, I know DiNic's is just a couple blocks over in the terminal.
