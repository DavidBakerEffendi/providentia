Came here with an deal...which they honored and it was very filling.  The atmosphere was great, but the food was ok...I really wanted to love it here,  but I just felt the food was unfinished..for example the brussel sprout with pancetta and red onions - needed salt added and i think that the onions should have been caramelized
