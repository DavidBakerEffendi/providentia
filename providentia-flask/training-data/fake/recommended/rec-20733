Background: spontaneous visit w/ significant other on a Saturday night as we were craving some southern comfort food. Called and asked about the wait, but never got a clear answer after some beating around the bush. However, once we arrived, was seated in about ~5 minutes (8:30pm arrival time) in back patio. Ordered the mac'n cheese, fried chicken, and bass. Would definitely get the mac'n cheese & fried chicken again, didn't taste enough of the bass to give a recommendation. Best part of the experience was the ambiance & customer service, as the waiting staff was very friendly and the restaurant layout and lighting clicked well together. Overall, very unique restaurant (haven't been/heard of many soco themed restaurants) and a must-try if you are in the mood. Will update review after returning!
