THE BEST CREPES IN NYC! I really, really love crepes but many of the ones I've tried in NYC are just not memorable. I heard that this place was pretty good, so decided to give it a shot. INSERT LIFE CHANGING MOMENT. I got the harajuku fruit cocktail crepe and I was literally floating in a cloud of happiness! So so yummy! It had ripe mango, strawberry, sliced almonds, vanilla yogurt, and custard. I am drooling as I write this ... I've also tried the eight turn lox & the shrimp avocado crepe. Delicious!!! That's all you need to know. Go get yourself a crepe right now!
