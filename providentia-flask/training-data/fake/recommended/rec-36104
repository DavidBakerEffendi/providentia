We have been looking forward to a meal at Balthazar ever since we saw the Chef on MarthaStewart's show. It was the first reservation we made when we knew we would be vacationing in NYC. We saved it for last knowing it would be a great treat at the end of our trip. We had family members with us and one of our members ordered chicken payard and the chicken was so badly burnt he could smell it before he ever tasted it. Several of us ordered steak which was tough, poorly cooked, and tasteless. The frites were excellent! Our waiter rarely dropped by to see how we were doing and drinks sat empty for most of our meal. The bread and chocolate pot de crime were yummy. Â The manager comped our desserts and was very apologetic for the burnt chicken, but sadly our meal had already been ruined. There is so much good food in NYC, that I recommend you go somewhere else...we felt cheated out of a great meal on our last night in town. :(
