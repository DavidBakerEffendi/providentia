I tried...three times. The hype...it's not worth that much. I mean it is good and I will eat it. Each time I've had the lamb and chicken combo. There isn't much flavor from either meat they basically taste the same. The rice is okay, I can't eat the white sauce because I'm allergic to eggs (It's just mayo...like it's not even something that special, mayo, vinegar, pepper and maybe something else), and the hot sauce seems to be cayenne paste (literally the shaker you buy in the store mixed with water and vinegar). I can't say I won't eat here again, but it's not all that. I'm updating my review.... First you have to get lamb...second you have to use the white sauce and a little pepper sauce. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Forget the chicken don't even bother with it. Also the white sauce seems to just be weaken ranch dressing and not mayo. So I've actually been eating it and I haven't noticed any allergic reactions. This is a great place I love it!
