I'm usually one for cocktails and dinners where there is usually only vegetables. That said, corner bistro is my favorite go-to bar in New York. Are the bartenders nice? not really. Is the service spotty? oh yes. But can you beat a 2 dollar beer and GOOD burger for 5 bucks in New York? The atmosphere is this bar also superb. To quote Kat H it like " that I'm-wasted-in-a-cozy-sweater feeling". Corner Bistro is just a comfortable bar: loud enough that it does not lame, but not too loud so you can have a good conversation with someone.
