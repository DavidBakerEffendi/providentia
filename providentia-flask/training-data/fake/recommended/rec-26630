Walking along Sansom street and trying to decide on what type of food to eat, my friend and I caught a glimpse of their menu on the window. We stopped and took a moment to read what they had. Prices weren't bad and the place looked cute, but the ultimate reason why I wanted to try it was that I never tried raw oysters before. It just so happens that my friend Helen loves seafood esp oysters. ! As we got in we were blown off with the beautiful decorated room. I didn't think the restaurant was that big based on the outside. I loved the style  of the place and how friendly everyone was. Since the weather was perfect, we decided to have outdoor seating. We out on the deck and the area was decorated with beautiful flowers. Just lovely!! So we ordered the Doc's Perfect which consisted of jumbo shrimps, lump crab meat , raw oysters and clams. We also ordered Ahi tuna tacos and fish bowl sangria to drink. Everything was fresh and so delicious ! I enjoyed every flavor of each food. Our server was on point. She very friendly , and always came by to our table  if we needed anything regardless of how many tables she had to wait. It was dinner time and the place started to get packed but she never forgot about us. Overall. Best seafood restaurant I've been to so far. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to any seafood lover.  I had a good good experience here and I will probably a regular here being that I work a few blocks away.
