If your looking for amibiance this is not the place to go. But if you are looking for authentic chinese food sans additives and preservatives this is the place to go! I enjoyed both variations of the singapore noodles, fish ball wonton noodle, tom yam, and hock kian (I think that's the spelling) soups. Give it a try.
