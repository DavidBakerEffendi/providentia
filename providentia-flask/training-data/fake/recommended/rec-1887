First of all, I love the decor of this restaurant. Second, the staff was very personable and attentive. Lastly, and mainly, the food was great! I had what I think was called Maltagliata, it was pasta with mushrooms, cabbage and onions. It was so good! The other dishes in our meal were good also, but for my taste, it was all a little too salty. The wine list is a little overwhelming because it is very extensive. However, they do have wines that I have never seen on a wine list anywhere. Definitely worth a return trip for me.
