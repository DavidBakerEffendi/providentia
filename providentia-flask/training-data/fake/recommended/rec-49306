We went to Atticus for Sunday brunch. The food was mediocre at best and the offering was very limited. The most disturbing thing, however, was the way we were treated by the waitress Veronica and later on by the manager. At first we thought the waitress was being unfriendly and slightly hostile but we decided not to let it get to us. We were a party of three and therefore we were seated at a table for four. The food that we ordered took a while to come and my son who had an appointment had to leave before the food arrived. While I was drinking my coffee the waitress, asked us if we could hurry and leave because she had a party that was waiting for a large table. Obviously, I would want to be considerate to the people who were waiting, but I replied that as we had paid to eat and the food had come late, I would like to finish my coffee. She promptly took away my water, huffed and gave us several very hostile looks. I asked her if I could have my water back and a half glass of water (I am not sure if it was even mine) was brought to me by another water. I sought out the manager and explained what had happened. He didn't listen to us but instead he told us what he thought the waitress had said (as he said he overheard the conversation), which was not even close to what had transpired. My daughter and I kept saying that he did not hear what was actually said, nor did he see how we were treated. He asked us, in a rude way, "Well, what would you like me to do about this?" Â We answered that we would appreciate an acknowledgement of what happened, an apology and that the waitress Veronica be reminded of how to treat customers in a more respectful and courteous way. The manager dismissed our request and was very aggressive towards us. We were made to feel as if we, as customers, did not matter in the slightest and worse, that we were lying. I will not, if I can help it, venture into Atticus every again.
