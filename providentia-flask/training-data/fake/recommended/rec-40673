Jones - Ah yes...  Love their avocado green upholstery and harvest gold accents set in a Brady Bunch stone fireplace setting (and I mean that in the best possible way)  Sunday Bloody Mary's were very nice with nicely spiced tomato juice, big pimento stuffed olives, and large leafy stalks of crisp celery.  The build your own salad is huge and worth every penny.  We've also enjoyed the Braised Short Ribs, Pistachio Encrusted Tilapia, Meatloaf, and Turkey dinners.  Quality is high and consistent, coupled with their unique atmosphere; it's definitely a restaurant to add to the "visit" list.
