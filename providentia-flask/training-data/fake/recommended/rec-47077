Wonderful service, of course, and a lovely dining experience. My only two complaints are the that the food was strangely on the salty side. This actually isn't something I usually even notice or consider but I guess it was a bit over the top and undeniable. Even still, the Plin, the Hazelnut Pudding, and the Pizza were all tasty. As I mentioned, great, convivial, and professional service.
