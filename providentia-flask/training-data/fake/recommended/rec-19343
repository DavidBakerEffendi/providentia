I will never get over how much space a typical dive bar can have when its located out of nyc. For that reason, my review is biased. There's plenty of outdoor seating. The 5 bus will take you right here. And it'll take your drunk ass home too. Inside there's a pool table, bar, and some booths. There's a cool space upstairs as well. No complaints. Above average and consistant.
