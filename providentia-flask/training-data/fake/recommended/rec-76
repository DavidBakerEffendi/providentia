This was my second time at Hot Diggity. I took my bf who loves a good hot dog to try it becasue I figured it would be right up his alley. I had the Southern Comfort and my bf got the Fiesta Dog and the Chicago Skyline. We also ordered a specialty soda each and a large order of fries with the house sauce (yum!) and the lemon thyme aoli. I loved the slaw on my Southern Comfort, but the spicy brown mustard on top of it left me with a really bitter taste in my mouth. Not my personal cup of tea, but I'm sure plenty of others would enjoy it. However, My bf enjoyed both of his dogs and I really liked the fries (my guilty pleasure) especially with the HD sauce. The large was a big order of fries for 2 people though. We probably should have gone with the medium. There are so many options at Hot Diggity, I'll have to try some more to see what my fav is. Plus they do a dog of the month, so I'm sure there are some pretty adventurous options there too.
