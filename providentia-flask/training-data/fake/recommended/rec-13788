So I think I like my fried chicken not so breaded, but this is some good stuff. It comes with three pieces, which is a good size for $12.00. Â I had the hot chicken, not extremely hot, or whatever it's called, because the waiter compared it to, "I hate you hot." The hot was spicy enough. I got the crispy grits which were DIVINE and a side of mac and cheese to share with my friend. I wish the mac and cheese had been baked a bit. I felt like it was something akin to velveeta (sorry guys) and therefore didn't leave an amazing impression on me. I also got a drink...something thompkins, which was tasty as well. My friend and I split the apple pie for dessert. The pie slice was large, pretty and tasty, although I have had better pie. Believe me, anything apple is my favorite and this apple wasn't singing to me, but it was good. I think hands down my favorite thing was the cornbread. It smelled like cake. It was warm and wrapped in a piece of parchment paper which was the perfect way to start the meal. One star goes hands down to the corn bread. One star goes definitely to the chicken. Breading aside, was super moist inside. I mean RIDICULOUSLY super moist inside. I also like that the chicken is free range, local chicken. I ate a happy chicken, well before it was killed, so I am therefore happy! Two stars go to the service, and the set up. It's a bit small inside, but I love the decor and the feeling of the restaurant. As a matter of fact, you never feel like you're in a restaurant, you feel like you've been transported to a shack, with style, somewhere in Alabama. One of the two stars goes to the fact that they had killer blues playing. I'm a lover/sucker for blues music, especially when I'm eating fried chicken. I'll be back. For that corner seat in the window with the pillows. And for another piece of hot chicken. YUM!
