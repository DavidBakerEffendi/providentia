We came in a big group recently and liked the place. We tried several things from the menu and the standout dishes were their famous Pollo Al Forno, Rigatoni Amatriciana and the Chocolate pudding. I wouldn't give it a 4-star because my husband's Colarado lamb dish(Agnello e peperonata) was a bit disappointing. Overall great service, good selection of wines, and a great vibe and ambiance even on weekday nights.
