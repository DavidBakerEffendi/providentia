I was in town for the weekend for this is hardcore... all the kids rave about all the good vegan eats in the city, so i was excited to try a bunch of places. my friend and i had come in at 5pm on a thursday and they were already sold out of rolls and a bunch of the sandwiches. they were sold out of the cheese steaks (i blame all the hardcore kids in town, but apparently this is a recurring problem) so i opted for the chicken salad sandwich. Â i got it on a spinach wrap. OMG!!! literally the best sandwich i've ever had. as far as the staff, they aren't very polite or friendly. i went back on that sunday... once again it was very busy. i ended up waiting about 15 minutes for my food, then finally asked them how much longer it would be. they conveniently lost my ticket, so i ended up waiting 30+ minutes for a freaking sandwich. that chicken salad sandwich is so good though. as far as vegan cheese steaks go, go to blackbird's pizzeria. SO GOOD.
