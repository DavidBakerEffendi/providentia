You really can't go wrong with the cantina. The food really is a homerun, the menu has a good variety of options and there are always specials that will make each dish memorable. The drinks vary from a great beer selection to delicious margaritas and a more than satisfactory tequila selection. I have never had anything but a good experience with the servers and only complaint seems to be that it gets too crowded, but not sure that you can fault a place for being good at what they do. Also possibly the best brunch in south philly.
