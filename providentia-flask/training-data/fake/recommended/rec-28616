Our house turned paleo a couple of years ago, and in doing so, became a couple that rarely ate out. The opening of Hu was a wonderful gift! We eat here now, about once per month. It started with special occasions, but we have become hooked.  We are going to see if we can make it work for our vegetarian friends as well. I'm so excited that they have added Brooklyn Kombucha to their bar selection.  The Hu Jo is amazing, and goes so well with the grand master veg. It becomes difficult to try anything new, when those options are available.  I wish they would offer to heat the prepared cold items they have, though, as I've been interested in trying those eating in, rather than taking out.  I'm excited to see what they do with the menu in the summertime.
