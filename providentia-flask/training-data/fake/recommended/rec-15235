Where do I start when I first walked up to the place the Cook was  outside smoking a cigarette. He then  walked inside took my order he started handling money with his bare hands and he licked his fingers to hand  my 2 dollars change back. Then he proceeded to start touching my food with his bare hands without washing them it started to cook after I asked him about why did he wash his hands he stated my hand are clean. I asked how your hands clean when you just touch the door when you came in he was just smoking a cigarette outside you just lick your fingers you just touching dirty money and Then started cooking my food no thanks I don't want your DNA and my sandwich I cancel my order my walk out.
