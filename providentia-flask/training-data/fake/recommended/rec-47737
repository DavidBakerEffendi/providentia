Disappointing... Have heard good things about Agave, so we all thought we should give it a try. The drinks were solid and the bar service was good. Ok that's the end of positive... Ordered table side guacamole and they finally made it to our table about 2 seconds before our meal. Bland and blah... Our dinners were about the same. The service was awful too. My suggestion would be stop in for a cocktail and find another place to eat.
