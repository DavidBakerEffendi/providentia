Came here w my bff Gaby on a Friday night for a "late" dinner. Food was slightly above average. Many dishes were not available and thought to explore by ordering one appetizer st a time. At 945 when my friend went to order fries,  they said the litchen closed - again,  Friday night at 945!  At least i live close by so am looking forward to the new restaurant that will open in six months once this fails. What a shame.
