El Vez is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Philly.  I've been there many times and every time I leave, I feel satisfied and full.  The guacamole is absolutely amazing (you can't go wrong with any of the choices) and the drinks are delicious (my personal fav is the blood orange margarita).  I usually end up getting the chipotle chicken tacos and I have to admit that I was at first put off by the way they were presented--the whole open face, just laying there sort of thing doesn't really appeal to me.  This all changed though as I soon as I took a bite--they are delicious!  The whole place just has a great vibe and the service there is fantastic! The addition of a working, old school photo booth is a definite plus. I highly recommend that you try this place at least once--I don't think you'll be disappointed
