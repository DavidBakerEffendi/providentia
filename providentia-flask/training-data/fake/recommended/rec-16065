The food here is great! Inexpensive, tasty, and decent-size servings. I came on a Saturday evening with some friends and it was crowded. We could wait for a table or sit at a bar-like area against the wall (so we did that and later moved to a table). I ordered a beef noodle soup dish. Very flavorful and yummy. Friendly staff, good atmosphere, won't bust you wallets. Can't wait to come back!
