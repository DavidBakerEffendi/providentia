The first breakfast restaurant that would pop into my head when visiting the Manhattan area. Highly recommended! And I really mean it. Â If you want my recommendation go with Egg & Cheese Croissant with pesto sauce. It might sound undelicious, but I guarantee you the satisfaction! Their coffee is good too!
