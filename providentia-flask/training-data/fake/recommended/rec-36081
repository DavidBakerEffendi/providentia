Unfortunately Balthazar just did not live up to the hype. For the price Balthazar demands I needed a REALLY good breakfast to warrant a 4 or 5 star review, instead I got kind of bland middle of the road breakfast and Latte. For Breakfast, I would say pass on this one and explore the other options NYC has to offer.
