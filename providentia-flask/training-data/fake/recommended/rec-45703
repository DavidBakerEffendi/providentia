I live so close and always passed it but never stopped in until tonight. It was sooooo good!! I ordered the 1/2 chicken with the side of sweet potatoes. I always prefer dark meat of the chicken because I usually find the white meat to be dry but not at Nosh Borough. The chicken was so tender!! I was so sad when I finished it. I also got the white sauce which was very very good. And it comes with a really nice biscuit. The sweet potatoes were very good also, but i think they could have been cooked maybe just a tad bit longer.
