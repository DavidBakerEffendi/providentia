I've been to Three Letters three times now--once for brunch and twice for dinner.  The food runs from good to great, the cocktails are fantastic, and the atmosphere is charming and warm.   The last time I went I started with the mushroom soup, which was just exactly what I wanted on a cool winter's day, and had the steak frites as my entree.  The steak, which was a perfect medium rare, came with a beets bordelaise and goat cheese aoili.  I want to put that goat cheese aolil on everything.  My husband was dipping his trout in it, it was so good.
