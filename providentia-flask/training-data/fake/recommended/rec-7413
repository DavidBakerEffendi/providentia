The location is a bit out of the way, bur our visit was worthy. We took a cab there, and the taxi driver refused to drive into the compound (Alexandria Center) on E. 29th where the restaurant was located in. We just had to reassure the taxi driver that the cab was allowed to go in. We went there for Sunday brunch in June. It was a nice day, so we chose to sit in the outdoor area. It was quiet and pleasant. I ordered French Toast, and my husband ordered Braised Brisket & Poached Egg. My French toast was made of baguette, but it was so soft and full of custard aroma inside. My husband's dish came with hash brown, which was made of a bunch of thinly julienned potato. It was crusty and crispy. Very special! It started to rain in the middle of our meal. The waiter helped us settle in the dining room, which was comfortable and nicely decorated. We shared an Affogato, and ordered a cortado and a pot of hot tea. The Affogato was so delicious! I like that there was no hurry having brunch here. We left after the rain stopped. There was a farm right next to the building. I also saw a chef picking something from the farm. Then I remember that the menu did specify that "Today's brunch is made with produce grown right here, at the Riverpark Farm."
