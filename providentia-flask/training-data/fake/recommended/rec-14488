I'm on my New York pizza trip, and I've been to Lombardis, Rays, and now trying frank Pepes. Lombardis changed my pizza thinking cuz I'm a deep dish and thick crust lover, and made me love the thin crust. Rays continued my way of thinking about thin crust with their pies and now Frank Pepes? Omg! This is by far the best pizza I've ever had! It was an adventure to get to franks as I took the train from Manhattan Â to get to New Haven. Not knowing where Wooster st was, I took a cab from the train station. He took me 2 blocks (pretty much around the corner) and there's Wooster street! I could have walked!! Any ways franks pizza made up for that! I had the sausage mushroom and pepperoni. It came on a tray in this weird shape! Definitely wasn't the normal round pizza! No plates, just me, my partner, the tray and an oddly shaped pizza. My first (rectangular shaped) slice was thin. I took a bite and my mouth was In shock! I was in a pizza coma. Pizza juice drool started developing in my mouth and started to leak out of my mouth till my partner slapped me in the face to wake me up! I began to chew this heavenly mouth watering creation. It was like feeding out of the hand of Jesus Christ! Every bite I took felt like I was getting closer to God as I felt my soul slipping away in to pizza heaven. By far the best pizza I have ever eaten! If you ask me what's the one thing I would eat before I die? It would be Frank Pepes pizza! I can't wait to come back!
