Good food, low key, very inexpensive but they could prepare a little better. For example we got coffee with no spoon. The breakfast burrito was delicious with eggs, avocado, black beans, lettuce and cilantro. Yum! The music is excellent and the staff is very friendly and constantly checking in! Definitely will come back here from the UWS. Again, the music was great!
