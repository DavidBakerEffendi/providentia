I decided to bring some friends together here before a show one night because the reviews were killer. THANK GOD I LISTENED! What a fabulous time we had! We are broke twenty somethings so the prices were a delight! The bread was yummy and the wine was divine. I want to go back again and again and again! We split 2 bottles between the 5 of us. I had an entree and drank about 3-4 glasses (perhaps a bit greedy of me.... the man kept pouring!) and spent $23... UNHEARD OF! $23!? In Soho!? For great italian and wine!? Fantastic. I cant wait to go back. Maybe one day I will muster up the bravery to order the Black Taglierini! :)
