Their mac and cheese spring roll is the bombbbbbbb! The smoked gouda dip is awesome! The braised short ribs sandwich is on the salty side, which was a disappointment but the fries were great! It is a great place for lunch and the music is great there. Â It is a bit intense but I'm sure it's great at night!
