A friend wanted to go here while we were visiting and so we went for Sunday lunch. Our wait was 30 minutes but when we were walking out, the waiting room was so stuffed full of people, you couldn't move. The place is adorable! They greet you in loud Japanese when you are being led to your table by the hostess and then you sit in these adorable seats that were obviously custom made. We had the pork bun appetizer which was delicious but very gamey. We also had two different types of ramen (I don't think you can go wrong here but I recommend staying away from the cheese one simply because it's exhaustive to the palate). Finally, leave room for dessert because the matcha creme brulee is pretty spectacular!
