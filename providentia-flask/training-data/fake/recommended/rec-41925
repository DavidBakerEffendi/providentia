- Food was solid.  As suggested by the other reviewers, their outstanding hummus could be the best I've ever had.  The rest of our items from the tayim prix-fixe were definitely shooting better than par, but neither terrific nor mediocre.   - Good service.  Waitstaff was very attentive and knowledgeable about wine and food suggestions.  No long waits, attitudes, or impoliteness. - Overall:  Worth a visit if you haven't been there, though it might be a while before I come back so that I can try the rest of the Philly area restaurants on my list.  If I returned, I would try the Mesibah because I'm into that sort of thing.
