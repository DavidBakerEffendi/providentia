This is one of my favorite spots in NYC. We make sure to hit it up, at least once, every time we visit. What do you want? Breakfast? Definitely go with the Classic Eggs Benny or Country Breakfast. Lunch? Their Grilled Steak Sandwich or Bartlet Pear and Endive Salad will leave you satisfied. Dinner or REALLY hungry? Then you've got the mac & cheese (yes, I said MAC & CHEESE!) Spring Rolls to start you off. These things will definitely fill your taste buds buds, along with your arteries! If you aren't feeling that daring, then go with their "Mac Attack" tasting of all 3 of their versions. If you're felling a little healthier, the go with their Seared Yellowfin. Their entree menu has just about anything your heart desires. From Chops to hanger steak, this is comfort food at its best! The drinks here are big and stiff, just like she likes 'em, so make sure you are chowing down to soak up some of the booze!
