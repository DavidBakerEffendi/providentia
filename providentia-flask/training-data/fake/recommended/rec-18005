What an epic fail.  First, we were served cold greasy fishy overcooked octopus with rotten tasting watermelon and soggy tomatoes. We complained and got comped with a pasta dish that was almost as bad.  It was composed of salty greasy lamb with an unidentifiable and inedibly bitter green and corn and shishitos and tarragon and and and... Um, less is more, Tom.  Finally, after a half hour wait, the squid ink chitarra with seafood arrived.  No joke, they must have juiced and zested three whole lemons into this one little bowl.  There was no detectable pasta or seafood flavor... might as well have just sucked on a lemon and saved the calories.  Tom, please pack your knives and go.
