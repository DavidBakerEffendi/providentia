Went for breakfast this morning, and it was delicious. Had some of the Japanese iced coffee, and I gotta say it was outstanding, with none of the bitter acidity that usually accompanies iced coffee that was brewed hot then chilled. Guy behind the bar was friendly, knowledgable, and enthusiastic; none of the attitude that can occasionally run with a place of this caliber. Â Happy this place is here; it's a welcome addition to the PPW strip, and I look forward to returning for dinner and beyond.
