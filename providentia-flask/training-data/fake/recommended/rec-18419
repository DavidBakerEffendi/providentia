Ah, Park Slope brunch. For a place full of young professionals and families with relatively high incomes, why is it SO hard for find a good brunch place? I know Applewood is everyone's favorite in this part of the slope but I was left unimpressed. The menu was pretty standard, nothing interesting really jumped out at me at first. I can't eat gluten, so the omelets were the safest choice. I chose the seafood omelet and was a bit underwhelmed. Lots of seafood inside but it was all poached in butter, so I was really struggling to finish this heavy dish. The bloody mary was good but overall I won't be clamoring to return.
