Okay. I really this place! The atmosphere is more date spot but the menu offerings and prices make it also great for group hangouts/girls night out situations. The wine list is well rounded and it offers 3 tiers of size options but the most fun part is the "wine on tap" which was budget friendly (I really enjoyed the Malbec on tap @ $17 for 375ml). Did not try a cocktail but the offerings looked interesting so I will definitely go back and try something. I shared one of the pizzas, broccoli rabe and the wings. All were REALLY good. (this is not the wine talking). They Â had a 2 for $10 app offering that we opted out of, but sounded appealing. For a Tuesday night it was pretty busy and lively with an older after work/ dinner crowd. Based on the layout (curved bar is half of the front room bar area), I can see how hard it is to make this a bar stop type of location. I will definitely go back and try more options.
