PROS: Delicious, flavorful, cheap, lots of interesting layers of ingredients, super helpful & friendly guy CONS: Better for takeout! Not that I'm particularly knowledgeable about chaats, but this is THE best chaat (samosa chaat) I've ever tried. It's like a really flavorful, exciting salad mixture of all things crispy, savory, and sweet! I'll definitely return to try more items off the menu (including the extensive list of fruit lassis)!
