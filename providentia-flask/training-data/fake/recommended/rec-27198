Came in for an early dinner one day. Just visiting the area and since we are from California, Los Angeles area. Â Our daughter now living in New York wanted some Mexican food. We had the Enchilada Verdes plate. OMG...absolutely delicious. Better than most Mexican restaurant in LA. The chips and salsas were excellent. The coconut Mojitos were also excellent. Definitely worth coming in for lunch or dinner. Joe the bartender was great. Will have to come back next time we are in New York.
