Not recommended! If the place is trying to pass for a Mexican restaurant - it's far from it. Food has no taste and nothing is authentic... Not even the decorations! Over priced too! When asked if they had horchata they said "huh?" Staff have no identity so you don't know who is employed and who is eating there. They also have some random guy checking ID at the door in shady attire. Music is too loud and heard everything but Spanish tunes.
