My husband and I enjoyed dinner here last night. We arrived without a reservation and were able to be seated quickly at window seats. We decided to do the prix fixe menu, and the food was very tasty! I had the persimmon salad (awesome) and he had the sunfish cakes (very very good).  Entrees were the fish n chips ( which was good not great) and the chicken parm (delish).  I loved the brownie sundae a little more than the fried ice cream. All around, a nice vibe for a neighborhood spot, and the fact that its BYOB is awesome. Will definitely be back again!
