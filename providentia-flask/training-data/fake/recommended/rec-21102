Definitely a nice Italian restaurant. Buy pizza for lunch in the front or go to the snazzy dining area in the back. It is on the pricey side (at least for my standards), but this is the place to go when you want a top-notch and memorable Italian dining experience with people you love. I'm not an expert on Italian food, but my two friends were going crazy over their meals. I had the chicken parmegian (sp?) and was happy too. "Bring Your Own Wine" - They don't have a liquor license, but you are welcome to bring your own wine. A little different, but so what?
