Pio Pio is a unique but accessible culinary experience. Different than the dining options most people have typically. The Roast Chicken more than lives up to the hype.  This is everything we always hope Roast Chicken will be.  Hot.  Juicy. Jam packed with flavor. And is exquisitely complemented by the Pio Pio trademark green sauce. A huge amount of food,  too.  A whole chicken. Get a side of the saffron rice and you have more food than 2-3 can eat in a setting. We found this out by ordering too much food.  We also ordered the Blue Corn Tamal. (Think Peruvian Tamale). Also excellent. (And I personally don't like tamales. Tamales are really more my wife's thing.) Bottom line: This is not just a meal.  This is more the kind of foodie dining experience that is a highlight of the week,  the trip for a tourist. And for the Times Square area,  a real bargain.  I would highly recommend this one.
