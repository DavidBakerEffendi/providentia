So this was actually a 4.5 but I have to preface this review: I came after a 2 day fake "starvation" diet (to prep for my NY trip where I have a to eat map w/ 50+ food targets, and a walk from Grand Central Station having not eaten for 9 hours (fortunately there wasn't a long line). And of course, I probably have little to write that hasn't already been covered.  But anyways... I got the combo from this infamous cart. The meat (lamb and  chicken) were juicy, the lettuce crispy, the pita deliciously warm but sparse.  The rice was just ok, imo.  It was the addition of the miraculous, often raved about white sauce that really made this come together and worth of a 4.5 star review.  And the size (enough for 2 meals/people) and price ($6) certainly helps the cause.
