I've not gone here a bunch more times, alone, and with my wife and 2year old.  I think my 'wet pizza' situation above was a one-off.  We've had only great food after that, and great service.  I mean above-and-beyond amazing service that would make even a wet-pizza-incident tolerable.  Once case involved a bit of plastic accidentally ending up on our pizza that my child was eating. Clearly an accident, but the waiter apologized endlessly, went to the kitchen to ensure none of the other pizzas had any (I guess it was meat packaging), offered to make a whole new pizza (we refused this offer), insisted on a free drink and a dessert, despite us saying no b/c it really was an accident.  His level of insisting he make it up to us was almost comical and endearing, and made me a permanent fan of this place.  It's one of those great places where everyone is treated well...single hipsters, families with little kids (we're used to getting the stink-eye even though she's quiet and well behaved), black, white, etc etc.
