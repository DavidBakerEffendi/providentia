Come here by 12pm for brunch and it won't be crowded. It starts getting hectic around 1pm. LOVED the Sheep Milk dumplings. The tomato basil lamb sauce complimented these little treasures so well! The Greek spread was also yums. Really fresh and on point. I can't seem to find it on their menu online, but there was a GREAT Prawns dish on a bed of some grain... I don't know what it's called so this is frustrating, but they were small round bits... larger than quinoa. Reallly well cooked prawns and the other stuff was delicious too. haha. Was not a fan of the Greek Meat and Potato omelette. It was huge but the eggs were overcooked and dry. The sausage was tasty though but this dish definitely went back half finished. Service was great until the 1pm rush. Then our Bottomless mimosas turned into no mimosas for half an hour. Talk about a buzz kill. I'd go back...earlier.
