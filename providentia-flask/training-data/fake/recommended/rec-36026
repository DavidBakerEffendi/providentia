Balthazar's irresistible ( Don't EEEVEN try to resist) Le Panier, scrumptious Eggs Florentine (the little pieces of artichoke hearts are ethereal), attentive service, Saturday morning, beautiful snow swirling outside....shared with beloved family: it doesn't get better than this! Arrival at 9:30 am yielded us immediate seating, and after this luxurious start to the day, still provided us plenty of shopping time that followed! ;)
