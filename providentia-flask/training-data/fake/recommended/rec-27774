My husband took me here just last week for our anniversary and we both agreed it was hands down the best restaurant we have ever been to and we have traveled all over and live in NYC.  It was quaint and cozy and very romantic but not over the top.  the entire staff including the chef were unbelievably friendly and welcoming.  The infusion of flavors were amazing and left us wanting more.  It is BYO but they have an adorable little wine shop with tastings and choices for every budget.  I cannot say enough about this place and cannot wait to go back.
