Came here with a group of friends for a weeknight dinner.  We made reservations, but probably didn't need them.   Tasty cocktails - I had the Southside, which is clean and cucumber-y and nice for the summer- but it was a hard decision with lots of good-looking options. We shared a bunch of plates so that we could each try a bit of everything.  The scallops and duck confit were the stars, but the beet salad and crab croquettes were good too.  Seemed like you really couldn't go wrong All in all- great food, nice atmosphere, definitely recommended.
