"The World's Best Pancakes," boasts a giant sign above this charming Jersey diner. This place is just what I want in a diner. 24-hour breakfast, fast service, cushy booths, and lots of senior citizen clientele (hungry seniors really know how to put on the feedbag, and thus, their presence is a good sign in any dining establishment). The food is yummy, and the pancakes -- I simply HAD to try them, based on their sign -- were delish! Coffee refills come frequently. I will be back, Broadway Diner! I will be back!!
