Came for a dinner on a Saturday night. On the upside, they were really accommodating for a rather big group. However, the food was rather unmemorable. Had the cavatelli con salsicca and it was acceptable, but nothing special. If you're looking for gluten-free, this might be a great choice. But if your'e a true pasta lover, head elsewhere. That said, the desserts were outstanding - A+ for red velvet cake.
