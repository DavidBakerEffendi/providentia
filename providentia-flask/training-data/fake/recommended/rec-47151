One on my favorite bars !! Happy hours from 5pm to 10pm EVERY days (yes, including Sat and Sun). 6$ the lychee Martini which is really really good ! The tapas are very good too (especially the fried calamari) ! Be careful, come early as it gets crowded quick. This bar is a bit loud too. So if you want a quiet bar, not this one. Waitress is also good at her job as she always bring another glass as soon as you finish your drink. You almost never wait even if the bar is completely crowded.
