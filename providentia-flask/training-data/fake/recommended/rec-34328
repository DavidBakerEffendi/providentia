Had a really good meal at The Village Inn last night.  Apps - calamari, caesar salad and sausage bolognese rigatoni (an entree that we ordered as an app).  All were excellent, especially the rigatoni bolognese, which has great flavor and was a table favorite.  Hangar steak, double cut pork chop, tilapia and chicken parm with the sausage bolognese were all excellent.  Also, IMPORTANT TO KNOW, our friend purchased a $100 GIFT CERTIFICATE FOR $12 on restaurant.com.  You have to spend $200, not including alcohol, which is tough to do with a small group at this polace, but there were 6 of us, so it wasn't a problem.  With plenty of alcohol and a ton of food the bill came to $72 per couple.  We'll definitely go back.
