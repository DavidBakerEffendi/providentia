I would have given a four for making a space for artists, and clean, friendly atmosphere. Colonel Bao (fried chicken) was my favorite of the two I ordered. It was crunchy and had a good seasoning. The OG was not bad, maybe needed more flavor in the braising. My issue is the Colonel Bao chicken piece sizes seem to vary from full sized to tiny nugget. Both bao fillings were a bit too small compared to other people's photos; maybe it's because I came late in the day, but if you don't have enough to make a full portion, let me know to order something else or throw a snack in there, dudes. The curry fries order was huge and worth getting, but I wish the bao size was consistent. Would try again.
