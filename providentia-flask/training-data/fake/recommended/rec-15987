4.5 Stars. I've been to Alta several times now and each time that I have been there, I have not been disappointed. Moreover, I have been there in smaller and larger groups and each time, the tapas were delicious, service was prompt and drinks were fantastic. Let's start with the very few cons of this place: 1. WAY too crowded.. Alta, what happened? Each time I come here, its more crowded than last time. Alta, I'm sure this is great for you, but for me, it made you lose that star. 2. I keep reading about the amazing sangria - too bad they don't serve it by the pitcher. OK, now the pros: 1. lavender infused goat cheese, braised short rib, and brussel sprouts. Hands down, no questions asked. Everything else is excellent as well, but these three are always ordered when I go there. 2. service: Service is prompt. However, I do wish that when placing the tapas on the table, the server would tell us what it is. With tapas, we usually order a lot of different things and its hard to tell what each dish is at times. However, servers are always prompt and the food comes out pretty fast. 3. location: NYU is my old stomping ground, so I always like going back to the area. Overall, if you like tapas, Alta is a great place to go. I'd say its comparable to Boqueria.
