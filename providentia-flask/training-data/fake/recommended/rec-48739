What a great Indian food experience overall! The restaurant is by no means fancy, but don't let that fool you. The food was absolutely delicious - chicken samosas were amazing with lots of flavor. Best samosa ever! The chicken tikka masala was tasty and the chicken was just right. The restaurant is neat & clean, but small. May not be great for more than a group of 4 people. It also feels like a hole in the wall when you walk in. The service was great - our server was knowledgable, friendly, and polite. The restaurant filled up while we were there and luckily the other customers were not overly loud or obnoxious. An overall great experience at a small Indian restaurant. I'll be back!
