GET THE TRUFFLE BURGER. Went on a Friday night with a friend around 6:15ish after work; totally expected a wait but was so happy when I heard "5 minutes". Yes. I guess we made it right before the dinner rush because when we were seated, a swamp of people came in. I got the truffle burger ($12.50) and my friend got the cali burger ($12... she said it was amazing). People always ask me whether Shake Shack had the best burger and I always thought it was overrated (shake shack is awesome but definitely not the best burgers ever). This truffle burger is the best burger I've ever eaten. The meat was so juicy, tender, and the sauce.. savory and heavenly. Makes my mouth water thinking about it. And the buns. The Portuguese-styled buns. Toasty, soft, and a little bit sweet. AMAZING. The sweet potato fries ($4) wasn't the best I ever had but that's not to say it wasn't great accompanying my burger. The sauces that it comes with are good compliments to the fries. Service is not bad. The guy was pretty nice but kind of looked "whatever" about his job. But the burger doe. That's what earned the 5 stars. We also wanted the donut ice cream sandwich for dessert but they said they never got the shipment so they didn't have it. A must try for next time.
