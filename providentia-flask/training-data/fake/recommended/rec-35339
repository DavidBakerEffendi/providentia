What a lucky find on Yelp. I got the combo, Prawn Katsu (1pcs), Pork tenderloin Katsu (half portion) & Snow crab meat croquette Everything was just great! The pork katsu was juicy and crispy, the prawn was fresh and perfectly cooked and the snowcrab croquette was like the best crab rangoon you could ever have. The salad dressing was amazing, the pickles were great, the rice cooked perfectly and the fresh ground sesame sauce was freackin' amazing. Service was excellent, prompt, friendly and helpful. Will definitely return, many times!!
