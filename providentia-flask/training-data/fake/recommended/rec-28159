I really liked the ambience of this place.  It was very chill, relaxed, and a great place to go with someone who you want to be able to actually hear.  I had the sweet tea and a brown ale (can't remember the name) and both were good.  The bartenders were nice and attentive.  I wish they had a more organized way of getting a table though.  I hate eating at the bar, and we had to wait awhile just to get seats at the bar to eat. The outside patio looks really nice, but I just wish we could get on some sort of list for a table, rather than just hanging out and waiting for someone to leave (awkward...). Now the food...Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really wasn't blown away by it. I had the burger and fries. They were fine, but certainly not some of the best I've ever had.  The menu is really small too. I think I would come here for a drink and good conversation, but not necessarily to eat.
