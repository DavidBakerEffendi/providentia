Amazing food. Best gnocchi my husband (and I) have ever had. I had the duck and orecchiette, also super yummy. Our waiter was great. He opened our B.Y.O.B. wine without hesitating and poured us each a glass as he rattled off the specials. Loved the authenticity of the people and the food. Well-priced too, with 2 entrees, coffee and a shared dessert we paid under $60. Definitely a keeper!
