Oh Egans. Sweet sweet Egans. What could I possibly say about you? I've stumbled out of you many a time. I love you and your upper middle class-ness so much, but can't you just lose a dollar or two? After all you were the first bar in town to stock Shiner, my favorite beer. You also serve great Irish food and your Tipperary burger is one of my favorites.  You didn't mind when I brought my crying son, but still you set the mood on date night's with my wife. But damn Egans, can't I get it for a few bucks cheaper? I only mind a little that you fill my neighborhood with slow moving luxury cars that are oblivious to other traffic. I'll still come here after long days at work and at nights when I feel like staying in town.  Keep pulling in those Range Rovers, I ain't mad at ya.
