People at work have raved about the burgers from Krug's tavern a while back so a bunch of my coworkers and i finally tried them and ordered take-out recently. I ordered a medium cheeseburger. First of all, it wasn't even medium. It was well-done! It was dry and bland. Bland..fine i can deal with that cuz i can season it myself. The only thing that may be going for them is that their burgers are massive for only about $6. I've had my share of burgers from many different types of places and I'm not referring to fast food places at all. I've been to many other dives that serve much much better burgers. I'm just not sure what the other reviewers are talking about here. Even one of my coworkers said "it was like cafeteria school food". The rest seemed to like their burgers. Maybe i just got a bad batch..who knows. But I won't be ordering from here again.
