My boyfriend and I recently dined at Il Pittore. Looking over the menu before hand, I was excited for what this restaurant had to offer.  In short, the food ranged from eh-ok to delicious but our server seemed angry that we ever sat down. Knowing that the portion sizes were smaller and the menu designed to have an appetizer, first course, and second course, we started with the beet salad and baked ricotta, which both were phenomenal.  I absolutely adore beets and this salad is one of the better beet options that I have had in Philadelphia. For our pasta course we shared the ziti with leeks and breadcrumbs and the ravioli.  Both were tasty but extremely rich; a little too much butter/oil for me.   The entrees were what missed for me. I ordered the stuffed trout since I don't eat meat and took three bites and was finished.  My boyfriend loved his scallops and finished my fish, but, for me, it was not a hit.  We also had a side of brussel sprouts, which were delicious. Unfortunately, our server seemed upset at our age from the moment we sat down; as you can see from above we ordered seven courses, four cocktails (delicious), two coffees, and dessert, so we are not cheap youngsters.  We both have worked in the industry and don't enjoy being treated poorly.  The support staff were excellent; kind, attentive, and accommodating.  I don't believe that we will be returning. Overall we spent close to $250 and didn't have the best time.
