Often you can tell how a business functions (particularly a restaurant), when the proprietor is not present. Having heard that the owner was away, I tried Bar San Miguel, for a quick drink and a bite to eat on a quiet weeknight.  The total experience encourages me to come back often, though I live in Boston.     The restaurant, while a little dark, oozes character, from the carefully chosen hanging fixtures, to the Mexican tiled bar (I own such tile, so it's legit----or a great repro), to the tastefully painted ceramic dishes. On the wood benches, a small decorative lower back pillow.  Comfortable neighborhood watering hole. I was greeted immediately by Jake, who apparently doubles as bartender, and  I told him that I had limited time, and needed an app to eat there, with a drink of his own choosing (but one that was popular and typical to the restaurant), and an additional app "to go," for a 4 hour bus trip----something "not too messy."   He returned quickly with a delicious and unusual concoction of tequila, mescal, grapefruit juice and aperol with a splash of soda. The orange-y bitterness of the aperol struck just the right balance. The chili relleno, freshly, crisply fried, was not incendiary, but packed just the right kick, sitting atop a salsa roja which was full of personality, with crema piped across and some queso blanco, to cut the heat. This may be the classic presentation, but BOY was it GOOD!  The tacos to go (carnitas, I think), packaged up and delivered with the chili, on what appeared to be fresh double (thank you!) soft corn tortillas, were topped with fresh tomatoes, onions and the thoughtful addition of lime wedges.  I wolfed them on the bus, and made a lot of people jealous.     There's a famous restauranteur, who is all about "enlightened hospitality."  My whole experience at Bar San Miguel, on a random Wednesday night bespoke this attitude.   I'll be back!
