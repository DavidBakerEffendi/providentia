Very delicious food. Everything from pasta, pizza, gelato to simple grocery items like olive oil, coffee, pasta and so on. You can walk through and just look at the wonderful creations or take a seat and enjoy original Italian food. Delicious! Make sure to stop by at the Nutella place they have (mind blowing)
