I walked by this restaurant a few times and it always smelled good, so I finally went in and ordered a half chicken with roast potatoes and spinach and took it home.  The chicken is perfection: flavorful, juicy, moist, and skin crispy.  Even the breast stayed moist.  The sides were pretty good too, but the chicken was the star of the meal.  I definitely will be back to try some more of the sides. This may be the best take-out roast chicken in midtown.
