ive always wanted to eat here because the lights and the decor are so pretty (and always assumed that it wld be somewhat pricey).  this place is unbeatable.  it offers a nice ambience, and yummy thai food at an affordable price.  i loved the beef apple salad, the vegetarian & green dumplings and sesame tofu.  just like any other thai restaurant, there are plenty of options for everyone! it's definitely worth it to get here early, or else you may be waiting for awhile for a table.  i will be back again!
