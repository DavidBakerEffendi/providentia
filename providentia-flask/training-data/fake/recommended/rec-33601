Phenomenal breakfast sandwich - an artful twist on a classic.  Loved the thick-cut, braised pork belly, brioche bun, etc.  Unsung hero was the Dijon-ish potato salad - unexpected (strong), but excellent (complementary to rest of the meal). Place was hopping (line out the door) midday on a spring Sunday, but able to snag three seats at the bar.  Didn't detract from the experience one bit.  Laid back yet perceptive staff ideal fit for the brunch crowd.       But for living in another city, would frequent regularly.  A polished little spot.
