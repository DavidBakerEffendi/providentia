Oh yuuummmmm Magnolia how I love you! I think Magnolia was my favorite of every meal I had during a 6 day trip to Burlington (for my brother's wedding)... Some awesome veggie migas, a really awesome bloody mary... I loved that the menu had so many vegetarian and vegan options! The atmosphere was so cute, and the waitress was very sweet. I will DEF be back next time I'm in Burlington!
