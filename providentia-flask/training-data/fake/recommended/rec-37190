went for dinner on a saturday night.  it was still crowded around 10pm. great cozy atmosphere but not small..very american/rustic/log cabinesque.  we started with the Pici with octopus which was my least favorite..i love octopus and this just wasn't anything special.  BUT..everything else was yummmm. The tortellini with Truffle Vinegar was delicious. My friend and I decided to go all the way, forget the seafood options.. We got the skirt steak and the short ribs.  Both were so tasty and perfectly cooked.  We usually don't order dessert but couldn't help ourselves.  The Pecan Pie Bread Pudding was to die for.  I would eat that on a regular basis if I could.  Service was nothing stellar, but definitely good.   I'd definitely come back but perhaps next time on a date, not with a girlfriend on a saturday night..  Atmosphere was a bit romantic. Overall, very memorable meal.
