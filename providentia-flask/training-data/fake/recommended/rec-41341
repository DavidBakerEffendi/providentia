This place really surprised me. I did not expect to find a really nice restaurant over on 11th ave, but this place is a testament to the up-and-coming scene of Hell's Kitchen, and its continued expansion westward. The food was some of the best I have had in the city. The atmosphere was classy and extremely well decorated. Service was impeccable. All in all, this was a great night and a great meal. Highly recommended.
