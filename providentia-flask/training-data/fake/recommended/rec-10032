In short a great experience with only one negative. First of all, this place feels very up market, attractive surroundings and what appeared to be attractive people. The first area appeared to be some sort of bar with lots of sofa seating and looks like a fun place to come for drinks. We started with the baba ganoush, hummus and the brussel sprouts. I wasn't a huge fan of the hummus, it was a little bland but the pita breads were excellent. The brussel sprouts were something else however, the most bizarre combination of things that worked very well together. The sprouts are boiled I imagine and fried to the point where the outsides are charred. They mix them with fig jam, grapes and a number of other things I don't recall. Well worth a try if you fancy something different. We then had the mixed kebab plate which was excellent (and expensive at $42) BUT wasn't hot enough. A few minutes after it was served the food was virtually cold which was disappointing and spoiled an otherwise well prepared dish. The serving plate really needed to be hotter. The service was excellent. Our server Manaf was very well versed in the items on the menu and made a number of recommendations. He had the right combination of up sell and being helpful.
