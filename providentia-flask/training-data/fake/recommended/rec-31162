I have been follow Demetri since his 1st restaurant in Montclair. I couldn't' wait for his return! I went to De Novo last night. There we 4 adults and a 3 year old in my parent. We went around 6 and the place was hopping. The atmosphere is wonderful and very welcoming. Service was fast and pleasant. Our waiter Sam was great. Made sure everything was up to full potential and he was GREAT with my 3 year old son. I thought the food was great! Of course the dates were a good I remember them from many years back! My son enjoyed watching the trains go by during the meal! It is very family friendly although I would say maybe having some type of children's menu in the future would be a good idea although my son did enjoy this ice cream! Awesome job Demetri! I will be back again soon!
