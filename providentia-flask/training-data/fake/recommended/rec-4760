Definitely a different style of Mexican cuisine than what I am used to in Texas, but great in its own right. Plenty of choices with steaks, chicken breast dishes, and seafood to please the non-fan of Mexican food. If you are in the need for a Latin fix, I would recommend it. Full bar (although small) is a plus too!!
