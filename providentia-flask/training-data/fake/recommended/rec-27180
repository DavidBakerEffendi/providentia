Harold has been one of my favorites chefs from Top Chef, so I had been dying to see what he had done for himself 4 years after the finale of Season 1.  I've been to this restaurant twice, the first time ordering from their normal dinner menu and the other time taking part in a 6 course tasting. From their regular menu, I can say that my first encounter with the duck meatballs was intense, perfectly seasoned and melted in my mouth without any strong taste of gaminess.  The lobster tagliatelle had good bite with its sauce but the lobster was overdone.  The golden snapper was very good, the farro risotto was actually quite good as well, and the edamame falafel offered one of those "What in the world were they thinkin-Hey, that's not bad..." moments.  For dessert, they make fantastic donuts, but the best end of the night was actually seeing Harold in person, woohoo! The second time around was a bit of a disappointment, honestly.  The best dish may have been the first, which was a small cup of root vegetable soup, pureed into a bisque, heart-warming and well balanced.  The trigger fish was very good with a very authentic Thai flavor to the curry, but the tasting of wild boar left something to be desired, and the duck meatballs this time were a shadow of their former selves.  The chocolate souffle really tasted more like a not-so-molten chocolate cake, the scoop of ice cream served in champagne was actually bad enough that we sent it back, and their baked alaska offered passion fruit sorbet that was much too tart and overpowered the creamy meringue. In general, I would say that I'm still a fan of Perilla, mostly because it challenged my taste buds by introducing me to things I normally wouldn't try and generally executes the cuisine well.  I look forward to trying their brunch sometime soon, and wait for their dinner menu to rotate a little more.
