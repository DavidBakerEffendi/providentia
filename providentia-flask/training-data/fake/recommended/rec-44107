Had I not read favorable reviews, I would never have chanced visiting this small non-descript restaurant.  Thank goodness for yelp's enlightenment! The hot and sour soup was the best I've ever tasted . . .admirably spicy with some crunchie vegetables. Having been weaned to spicy tastes by my West African aide (I am a paraplegic), I couldn't resist trying an extra appetizer  . . the cabbage salad.  It was a real sizzler and most enjoyable. My entre was billed as Hot & Spicy Chicken (or something like that).  It was not as hot as the previous dishes, but very tasty. The server was very willing and anxious to please, but too quick. I had to give him a parting lecture on the virtue of slowing down, with particular emphasis on NEVER having two courses on the table at the same time. He received the criticism graciously. All in all, as you can see from my rating, I liked this restaurant very much, and plan to return in the near future.
