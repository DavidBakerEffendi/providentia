Ah this pizza is so good. You can eat slice after slice and not feel gross about it because it's not smothered in cheese and grease like some other pizza joints. I've always been used to having my pizza smothered in greasy cheesiness (living in the suburbs, delivery is all I knew)... But Lombardi's is completely different. All about that sauce now. It's so fresh and the crust is a nice mix of crisp but chewy. Just tastes like quality. Mmmmmm
