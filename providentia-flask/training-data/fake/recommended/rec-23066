Date night with the Mrs. We dont get out much so when we do, we need the night to be special. Sat. night and the table wait was ok (at 8pm) 45 mins. Past the time with a beer in the lounge listening to a great 4 piece band. I did not love my beer and they replaced it for free....great serivce. On to dinner..,we had Lauren as our server....SHE ROCKS.. best service i had in a long time..... Started with a  iceberg app. My wife had the hanger steak and I had brisket sandwich. Really good. And the bread they bring to the table was  worth breaking any carb diet. Really cool touch, TV's over the urinal. (i am a geek) Will go again.
