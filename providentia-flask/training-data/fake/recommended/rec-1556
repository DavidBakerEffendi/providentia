***TOURIST TRAP*** I was a tourist, saw the familiar sign, and HAD to see what all the fuss was about. After about 45 minutes of waiting in a line around the corner I order my cheesesteak with whiz. Immediately I think "Thats all?". Kinda small, not much meat, a little bland. Theres an hour of my life I'll never get back... YOU OWE ME GENO!!! I know Pat's across the street may be a trap too, but their sandwich is bigger, about $.50 cheaper, looks better, and the line is shorter. Just saying...
