I like Madi & Mia's quite a bit. They have an excellent selection of lunch options and the quality that I've seen has been exceptional. I've had a lot of different things from here, but I think my favorite is the Napa Turkey Sub, but the specials you can find on the website are also excellent and normally quite substantial. Sometimes I think it's a little overpriced, but the sandwiches are huge and good. And I'd rather have a big, filling, tasty sandwich for a little more than something from ...Subway. Also, if you have a small office and need or order lunch in for one reason or another, they do a great job at large orders if you call ahead and have chips, pickles, cookies and drinks available.
