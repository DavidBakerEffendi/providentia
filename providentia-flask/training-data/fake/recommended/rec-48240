This restaurant is absolutely wonderful... The food is original, fresh and delicious . There are many vegetarian, gluten free Â and vegan options. The smoothies and juices all look amazing. The chick pea fries are a "must". Today i had the kale salad and my daughter had the spelt pancakes. Next time i want the chick pea burger . We will definitely be coming back!
