I showed up at Pio Pio with my sister and son for a quick bite based on reading great reviews.  The atmosphere is very unique and comfortable.  We were seated downstairs, a large room that was set up with very large tables.  The wai staff was very prompt and we ordered the sangria since the reviews said it was excellent.  I felt it was too sweet, had a heavy liquor flavor.  We only ordered two appetizers as we already had apps& cocktails elsewhere.  The blue corn tamale was bland, although the chicken inside was tasty and the marinated red onions on the side really made the whole taste terrific.  We also had the pollo empanadas that had a perfect pastry crust.  I'd definitely go back for a full dinner but I'd rather sit upstairs which is more lively!
