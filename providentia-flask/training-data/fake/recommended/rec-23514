we never went into this little downstairs restaurant because there was always a line.  we usually eat at flynns across the street (which is also good), but yesterday, there didn't seem to be a line, so we poked our heads in.  thank goodness we did.  we each had a pasta dish, which were cooked perfectly.  but while eating the pasta, we noticed the most amazing cracker thin pizza!  so, we went back for the pizza the next day for lunch.  TRY THE PIZZA! make reservations.
