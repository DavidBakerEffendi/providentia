Can't go wrong with the duck and the fish dumplings!!!!! soooo good!!! and dont forget the Brown Sauce!!! I can eat a whole bowl of that!!! The dark brown homemade hot sauce, it's so good that they actually bottle and sell it by the counter! This secret recipe has the perfect mixture of chili, sesame, crushed peanuts and I'm guessing some kind of "sacha" sauce (garlic, shallots, dry fish plus shrimp and other spices). I'm telling you, this sauce pairs well with everything, For more reviews visit my blog.
