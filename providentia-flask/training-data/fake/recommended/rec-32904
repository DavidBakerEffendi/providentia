How this place has a 5-star rating is beyond me. People that say this place provides food that's even the least bit edible, let alone enjoyable, must have a steady diet of airplane, prison, hospital, or military food. This gelatinous mass of "rice like product," which appears to have been microwaved in a plastic baggy, can be picked up and eaten like a sandwich. This pad thai is just, well, disgusting. The words flowing through my brain to describe this "stew of eeeewww" are R-Rated. If this place can be called the best Thai restaurant in Caldwell, it's only by virtue of being the *only* one. I will buy a hot dog from the 7-11 down the street before I ever patronize this establishment again. If you want Thai, head down Bloomfield Ave. to Montclair.
