Wayyyyyyy overpriced!  which is why is ok and not 'a fan'.  I will not be choosing this location until they put the price on point with their portions. Customer service was great.  The owner was on point with making sure he was attentive to everyone and the barista was also very nice. I had a caprese salad with a Shrimp skewer.  I very much enjoyed both.  Very Mediterranean, not afraid of spices and olive oil (which you could tell is fairly high quality). half of a whole wheat pita that was good but burnt on the bottom.   You can tell by the branding that this is trying to be cooler then it is.  You can charge extra for ambiance, if it is deserved, but the atmosphere is not enough for the up charge. If you want solid Mediterranean and don't mind getting overcharged then this is the place for you. Until the prices drop to the other already overpriced salad/cafe places in the neighborhood, I will be going elsewhere. Thank you though...it's soooo close to being a staple
