I realized that although I eat at Monte Alban on a semi-regular basis, I hadn't yet left a review for them.  This is my go-to Mexican spot; its close to home, consistently tasty, quick service and serves authentic style Mexican.  Not that I have a problem with Tex Mex- its fine- but its a totally different style of food than the traditional dishes offered at Monte Alban. I'm pescetarian and my boyfriend is vegetarian, so my knowledge of the menu is limited to the vegetarian options, fish tacos, and shrimp salad.  He loves the Enchiladas Huertenas and orders them almost every time.  I switch is up a bit, but have enjoyed everything I've tried.  The portions are HUGE- I love having leftovers to bring to work the next day.  The service is always quick and friendly, and the prices are what you'd expect.  All in all, this restaurant is a pretty solid choice. The thing that isn't so great about Monte Alban is that they upcharge you on everything.  No free refills on sodas, and the glasses they use aren't that big.  I could see no free refills being not a big deal if they used those big giant glasses, but they don't.  $2.50 for one medium-ish soda.  Also, they will charge extra if you request sour cream or salsa to garnish the otherwise plain burrito.  Come on guys. I've seen a few reviewers mention that they wished they served margaritas in addition to beer and wine, but I've definitely had a margarita there.  It wasn't on the menu- I just asked for one and they made it. Also, if you are a fan of eggs and looking for a for a brunch spot, check out their special menu on Sundays.  Its pretty much all eggs, but prepared in all different ways.  I had to ask the waitress for a suggestion because I was torn between about 5 different things, and she steered me towards a breakfast burrito with eggs, pico de gallo, avocado, black beans and cheese.  Super yummy.  $8 and I brought half home with me!
