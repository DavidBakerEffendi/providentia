I've visited Zio's several times in the past without complaint. In fact, I highly recommended it to colleagues and friends. No more.  Every business is entitled to a screw up...just not this.  I ordered the Chicken Antonio platter (grilled chicken breast, spinach, feta cheese and tomatoes on pita bread w/side of fries).  One word: horrendous. The chicken was a huge piece of rubbery, tough glob - full of grease - heaped on just a few strands of wilted, overcooked spinach and tomatoes with ice cold feta cheese thrown across the top. Since it was not diced, I could not close the pita. The chicken was so greasy, it made the pita bread completely inedible. Everything fell apart in my hands on the first bite.  It was disgusting. All of it.  So basically, I paid almost $9 bucks for an order of fries (which was only lukewarm, btw). I contacted Zio's seeking rectification.  Never heard back.  I was more turned off by this than the inedible food. Just another ordinary pizza joint more interested in making $$$ than providing quality.  Needless to say, I will not be returning and really wish I could retract all those good recommendations I gave away.
