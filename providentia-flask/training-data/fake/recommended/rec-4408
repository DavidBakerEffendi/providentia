Umai Umai takes sushi to a totally different level.  I would liken the experience to the first time you realized a pizza could be gorgonzola, figs, arugula, and balsamic instead of Elliots.  I have had sushi at maybe 40 different places and it still blew my mind.   The designer rolls at Umai Umai are so creative and delicious.  The combinations are unheard of, but every bite is better than the last.  (See: Krakken Roll: shrimp tempura, eel, avocado, soft shell crab, cherries, worcestershire aïoli, almond bits). Each designer roll has something like 8 huge pieces of sushi, so don't be scared away by the price.   If you are a "I just want Tuna Sashimi" kind of person this may not be the place for you.  In my book, this is the best Sushi in Philly.  The service is great and it is a BYOB, for four of us the bill was $95 including tip.
