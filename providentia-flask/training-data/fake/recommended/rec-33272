The food is great, you won't be disappointed there, especially if you are a Vegetarian and going for the small plates. The chefs have come up with some truly spectacular ways to prepare olives. I've been to Olea three times and all three times the vibe has been chaotic and stressful. Noisy, cluttered, and too popular for its own good, Olea tries for a relaxed, "Mediterranean" ambiance, but it feels more like a beer hall on a Saturday night.
