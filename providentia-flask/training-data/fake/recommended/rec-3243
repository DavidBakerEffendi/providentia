Yum! Yum! & More Yum!!!! I got the caribbean dream smoothie and a tex mex salad and it was soooo good! My Dad got the ALT and right after his first bite, he said it was heavenly! So next time, I will def get the ALT on toasted multi grain. They have a super cute and cozy upstairs area to eat in, so I am going to bring my book club here later in the month. I was really in the mood for a good salad and im sooo happy I could find one! Great place, will def come back! :-)
