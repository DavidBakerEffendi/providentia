If my rating were based solely on the Truffle Burger, Umami would get 5 stars. There are more than enough reviews about it here, so all I'll say is that you won't go wrong if you order it. (I've heard similar things about the Manly Burger, although I didn't try it.) I was less than impressed, however, with the rest of Umami's offerings. I was excited for the duck burger, having had several people recommend it. But I just couldn't get into it. Part of the reason is that I was told that Umami refuses to cook the burger anything but medium rare--and then I was served one that was between medium and medium well. No good, Umami. The truffle fries were only ok. Be forewarned that the cheese will cool off and congeal if the fries aren't consumed quickly. And the variety pack of sauces weren't anything special, either. (As we left, I saw a server carry out a platter of onion rings. Those looked legit, and I'd recommend them based solely on their deliciously golden brown appearance.) All that being said, Umami is worth visiting, even if you have to wait in line (which you probably will). And it showed enough promise that I'd go back. I'll just stick to what they do best--their burgers.
