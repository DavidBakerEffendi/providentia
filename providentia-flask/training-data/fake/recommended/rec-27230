We tried it based on recommendations from a friend. The look of the place was fairly simple, more of a bar than a restaurant, and we were surprised when seated to discover that the food was very good! They have a good selection of cocktails and cervezas, as well as a good sample appetizer. I had the chevice as a entree which was really good, while my girlfriend had grilled empanadas, which were decent. Despite the food being fairly cheap, we ended up spending much more that we expected--probably due to the cocktails. Overall the food was enjoyable and we had a good time with our friends in the lively and spirited atmosphere.
