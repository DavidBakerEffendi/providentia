Ok this place is awesome, but then again I love any place that does a small plates or tapas style menu because I can never decide what to get!   You can really experiment here and be pleasantly surprised by all the different flavor combinations (unless of course you eat Israeli food everyday). The highlight has to be the tasting menu, the name escapes me, but its $36 for the hummus and salad starter and 4 courses!  This is more than enough food and me and my fellow diner left so full we thought we had just eaten at an all you can eat buffet. Except Zahav has no relation to Sizzler, the food is DELICIOUS.  You MUST get the lamb sausage (i forgot the name!) and the fried cauliflower.
