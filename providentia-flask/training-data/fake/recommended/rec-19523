Outstanding  dumplings that has the soup inside.  Caution, very hot!!!  If you eat it like a vampire (ie...suck out the juice) then you'll have a good experience.  We got two different orders, but the crab and pork were the best.  I think this is the tasting best dish and best value at this place.  The other dishes: Fried Pork Chop and noodle dish were just okay. NOTE:  we saw a lot of young non-Asian types.  My guess is that most of the crowd just followed the Yelp reviews just like us.  Note to self:  when you don't see a lot of old Chinese folks in a restaurant in Chinatown, best to look elsewhere.
