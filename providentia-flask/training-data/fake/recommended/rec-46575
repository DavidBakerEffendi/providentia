I don't venture to West Philly often, but that has recently changed with singular thanks to Mood Caf√©. I love Middle Eastern food and flavors, so when I saw this place as one of the highest-rated restaurants in Philly, I knew it was a must-try. And boy, it doesn't disappoint in the least. If you're an adventurous eater, I definitely recommend letting Hasan, the owner, order for you. If this is your first experience with chaat, Hasan will explain exactly what it is to you (hint: a mishmash flavor explosion). The first time I was here, he put his own lunch down to talk my boyfriend and I through the menu. Also, as other reviewers have noted, Hasan will refuse your payment if you are anything less than thrilled with your dish. Now THAT is having faith in your product! And he should--I could probably eat this once a week for the rest of my life. I have yet to see anyone leave without paying, either. I recommend sitting at a high top table outside for excellent people-watching and to keep out of the way of the inevitable line that will form inside, especially on weekends. See you soon, Mood!
