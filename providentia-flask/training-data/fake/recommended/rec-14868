my favorite byo! amazing food, totally reasonably priced. the amatriciana is so, so good i have to force myself to get anything else (i am determined to try everything on the menu). there's one waiter with a bit of an attitude but the service is all around good. they also don't take reservations on the weekends, but the wait is never too bad. still, it's worth it!
