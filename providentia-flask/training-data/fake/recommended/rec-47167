Brunch was great!! Absolutely love the biscuits! Cinnamon roll was tasty but bottom was a little over done, served in a skillet. Fried chicken n waffles are great, my favorite by far! Grapefruit served with caramelized sugar on top, which was a nice surprise. We also tried the apple pancakes, made with cornmeal which were good if you're a fan. We've been back a few times and will continue to visit as often as possible.
