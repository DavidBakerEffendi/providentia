I'm not quite sure how 1000+ people like/love Corner Bistro. The good service I received, the nice atmosphere of the bar, and the value of the food, and of course the drinks, together did not amount to even 3 stars for me. This was definitely not on the top 5 list for best burgers of NYC as everyone claims. My chicken sandwich was 8.75. Yes, cheaper than a lot of places. But it was also cheap in flavors. The buns were thin and were stuck to the big piece of chicken the entire time, threatening to fall apart with every bite. And it did. The meat was dry, and it just tasted like.. chicken, no other surprise elements there. Overall, a very lackluster sandwich. My date had the Bistroburger. He did not enjoy it either. Dry, not enough juice, and had to supplement with pickles for flavors. The fries were nothing to write home about. It is a rare thing, especially in NYC, but Yelp has failed me this time.
