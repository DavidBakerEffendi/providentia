This gastro-pub is definitely one of the best casual dining establishments in north Philadelphia. It is truly a hidden gem and stands out from its surrounding, cookie cutter pizza shops. They have a great beer selection with original selections that match whatever you'll eat. Simple, common platters that are made with a slight, but noticeabley different Â take. I highly suggest the fried chicken, pulled pork sandwich, and the suicide rings.
