FInally a real NYC style pizza place in the Hartford area! The chef is from Brooklyn and he really knows his pizza. Tried a slice of sicilian, Grandma, and a plain cheese slice and all were excellent. Also tried the Grandpa pizza which was the best of them all. I regularly drive to long island, Brooklyn, and several different parts of NYC for pizza and I an say this place is definitely a competitor. UPDATE Sadly it seems like either the owners have changed or the original owner isn't as involved. Last two trips have been very disappointing. Slices tasted like they had sat out all night and the staff has totally changed. UPDATE 2 Received a message on yelp from the latest owners of the restaurant apologizing for the quality of the pizza on my two most recent visits. I decided to give them one more try and was the quality has definitely improved.
