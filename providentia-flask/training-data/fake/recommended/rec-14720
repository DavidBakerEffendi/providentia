While my friends and I have always called this place the Eurotrash Cafe, it's an unfair attribution.  There is something vaguely European about the atmosphere, but there's nothing trashy about it. The coffee at Cafe Gitane is some of the best I've had at a cafe that wasn't about only serving coffee.  The couscous, which they will make vegetarian or with chicken, is outstanding, topped with a dollop of hummus and served with harissa.  YUM! To think that they make their dishes without a full kitchen is mind-boggling.
