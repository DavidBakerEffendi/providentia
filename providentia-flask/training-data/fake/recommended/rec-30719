I liked it alot. We crossed the Brooklyn Bridge on Foot  to go here. i think frank sinatra used to frequent Grimaldi's as well, and i really enjoyed the sinatra memorabelia.  we had our favorite: thin crust with pineapple, olives, ricotta, peperoni, and sausage. its a mouthful, but it is soooooo good.
