Food is consistent, we only go for Brunch.  My daughter loves the Steak and Eggs, I have eaten their at least 5 times.  If you do not get their early enough you will have to wait, yes it gets that busy.  They use organic eggs and milk, the coffee isn't all you can drink.  Its fresh pressed, one cup is all you really need.  The portions are decent.  I go for the Green Omelet it comes with potatoes, and 7 grain toast.  Anyway its a must try and if you want to eat in happening place with mostly New Yorkers and not tourists this is the place.
