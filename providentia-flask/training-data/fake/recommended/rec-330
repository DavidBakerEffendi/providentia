Took my girlfriend on our 4 year anniversary dinner. It was a great end to the night. The restaurant was very classy and the mood lighting just added some nice intimacy to our date. We started out with the Prairie breeze cheddar, which was amazing. As an appetizer she had the roasted mushrooms, which were delicious and meaty and I had the scallops, which I wasn't a big fan of. They were just underwhelming. For our main course I had the orecchiette which is out of this world, and she had the carbonara special which was also pretty stellar. Desserts: Sticky pudding and the Hazelnut Chocolate cake were both sublime. No complaints here. Would come again for a nice intimate meal.
