Underwhelming to say the least.I would only recommend it for beer and wine, don't bother with the food. Extensive and impressive beer list, the wine was good for so short a list - nothing to jump about, but then it's  not a wine bar. But the food and service? Please do not call cheese dip fondue,there's a difference. It was served with soggy french fries under a small pile of parmesan shavings. Not melted, just under. The mussels were fine, but it's hard to ruin a mussel isn't it? My friend had the duck confit salad, which the duck must have had a fit and run, since it was not really very evident.  The service, you know the fake friendly where they give you the answer they think you want to hear, but then do nothing? This is it. Wait longer for your table than either necessary or what your told, food served whenever, but then it's stated as if it's your fault. The decor is nice, but seriously pop in for a beer and leave. Don't eat and you'll avoid poor food and service.
