love this place. the setting is cute, the staff is incredibly friendly and the menu is full of delicious, fresh items.  it's a great place to meet a friend for coffee, enjoy a leisurely lunch or try to hammer out that paper/article/assignment you've been avoiding.   this is the type of place astoria so desperately needs!!
