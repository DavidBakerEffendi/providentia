I would probably give this place 4.5 stars but I rounded up for simplicity. A friend of mine was gracious enough to take me here for a weeknight dinner. We arrived around 7PM and had no problems getting a table. The overall ambiance was classy, fancy, and quiet.There were definitely plenty of older professionals and I felt like one of the youngest in the crowd. The extensive list of side dishes got the best of us, so we opted out of entrees and chose to share multiple side dishes instead: Lacinato Kale Salad - for a salad that's often boring, this one was delicious! The parmesan combined with a simple lemon dressing was perfection. Frisee, Poached Pear - I didn't expect to love this dish as much as I did because of the bleu cheese, but wow was it great. The chunks of bleu cheese combined with sweet pears worked so well together. Goat Cheese Gnocchi - a dense and filling side dish that was recommended to us by the waiter. Bone marrow - easily my favorite of the night. Bone marrow can be a bit intimidating but phenomenal when assembled correctly. It came with toasted bread and a sweet jam. Dessert = ice cream sampler (house-made and amazing!), chocolate hazelnut cake (stole the show), and port wine. Overall a phenomenal restaurant with great unique food options! Now if only it wasn't so difficult to get to all the way on 11th Ave...
