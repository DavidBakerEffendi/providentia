Went there on a rainy Passover monday for a late lunch with a girlfriend. Both of us ordered the set lunch  that  started off with the butternut squash soup. It was delicious! It's not your typical thick hearty soup. Light, not too sweet, was it truffle oil or something else that made it more savory? It was just plain salt, it had a bit of complexity to it.  Perfect soup for a wet and cold afternoon. Next,  I had the crispy skate salad. The portion was overwhelming for me. It was good. I wish it wasn't so heavy on the tartar sauce and they gave it a bit more of a tang to it. Maybe vinaigrette on the side? We noticed the ladies beside us ordered a la carte and every dish of theirs seemed smaller than ours, but perhaps they ordered small plates, sides and not main course. My friend enjoyed her ravioli, she devoured that but left the ragout meat since it was filling. We both had the sundae to finish off. We thought we were full, but when we started having the salted caramel popcorn sundae with fudge and all .... we were in heaven. Initially we thought one scoop of ice cream is sufficient, but we devoured the two that came with it. It was that good. I spent the next 2 hours trying to walk off just the fudge. Going out of order here... basil lime daiquiri was nothing to write home about. It was way too sweet even though it was really strong. We almost wanted to ask for that in a Bellini format instead. Service was good. I didn't like the fact there were a few of us at the bar with 2pm reservations and they kept us at the bar for a while when clearly there were tables in the back with place settings ready for patrons. It was silly. Really cute atmosphere, great little flower arrangements everywhere, yet the place is lively. Hope I will return soon!
