Could not get into little owl so made a reservation here. Nice neighborhood restaurant with big windows and exposed brick interiors the only negative was the noise. The music was quite loud and it was hard to hear my wife across the table. The calamari appetizer was slightly above average. The beer selection was quite good. I had the chicken that was excellent my wife really enjoyed the skate. The service was excellent. The staff was pleasant and attentive. While i was not blown away I would definitely return.
