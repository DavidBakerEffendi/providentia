*** The best in Philly*** In my honest opinion this is the best cheesesteak shop in Philly. No disrespect to Geno's and Pat's but I like my meat chopped, juicy, tasty and with plenty of mushrooms, onions and peppers. Compliment that with a soft roll and you yourself a great cheesesteak. I can do without Whiz so I just get mine with provolone here. They have a simple menu but that's all you need. And to top it all off, the wait isn't as bad as the other two places, or at least when I went.
