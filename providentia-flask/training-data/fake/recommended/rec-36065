My recent experience at Balthazar was nothing short of atrocious.  While I can tolerate a certain level of pretentiousness and snobbery, I certainly can't when paying hundreds of dollars for wine and other purported delicacies by a wait staff flummoxed as much by the fineries of serving as they were by the English language.  As a discerning customer that has been to Balthazar London and a fan of the chef, I would have been willing to overlook even these indiscretions but for the events that transpired last night. Le Balthazar is a monstrous three tower seafood dish that needs patience, and a small army to conquer.  While there is nothing spectacular about the quality of the shellfish nor seafood served, it is a social dish that requires skill to maneuver and navigate.  While a member of the waitstaff attempted to dissect the top partition of the platter, a large chunk of food and a smattering of ice was launched into my eye, staining my suit.  While it is unknown if this was malicious or accidental, it was reminiscent of receiving a lecherous money shot from a lobster.  Worse, the management and wait staff were incredulous.  Not only did I not receive an apology from the server (who may have a future in fetish videos from Antartica), but they did not even attempt to abate the situation by offering us a drink or comping a measly bowl of soup.  This corporate red-taping epitomizes a profound problem with management run-amok: a won't do, recalcitrant attitude when members of the wait staff are in the wrong. As a former waiter, it is self-evident that "I'm sorry" is a universal phrase that can supplicate even the most heinous of accidents or purposeful misdeeds.  Hopefully, the Asian server who splashed me and was unable to apologize appreciates this notion, and the incompetent managers who were unable to craft a pre-school solution learn some humility. **Please disregard review.  The restaurant refunded items that were not finished.  Will go back.
