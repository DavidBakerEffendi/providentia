Five stars, hands down.  Why?  Cheap, delicious, no bullshit Chinese food.  None of that take out junk you find elsewhere outside of NYC.   Ordered roast duck and wonton egg noodle soup with some shumai on the side.  Total cost?  About $10.  Yup, served with some hot tea. Simple, cheap, good.  Done deal. If you're not from the city, I think you know how hard it is to find good legit Chinese food that's as cheap.
