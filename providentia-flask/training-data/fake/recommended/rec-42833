Employees Only is an upscale cocktail speakeasy. Each cocktail is $14-$15 so come prepared to spend a good bit of money. The cocktails are fantastic though. I had the Amelia, which I would get again. It is way busy. They limit the number of people that come in, but it's pretty much packed standing room only. It's also loud and hot in there, but no worries, they'll take your jackets and bags when you get there. If nothing else, it's fun to watch the bartenders cause they're pretty badass.
