Very creative food.  I normally don't like fusion food but Momofuku deserves two thumbs up.  We came here at the opening time for Saturday lunch, so there was no wait.  My husband and I both ordered prix fixe -- so we could each choose one appetizer, one entree and one dessert.  This turned out to be a good deal and especially got to sample a lot of things in the menu.  The pork bun was really tasty but has a lot of pork fat -- so quite heavy after eating it.  I don't think it deserves "amazing" or " the best" because I had better than this but it is definitely really good.  Sichuan Beef Tendon was ok -- nothing much to talk about. - probably will not order again.  I think the tendon tastes strange.   Grilled Branzini, on the other hand, was amazing -- the fish was sooooo tender and the sauce was really good -- the whole dish was very light -- a good contrast after eating the heavy pork bun.  The Spicy Rice Cake was really yummy  -- it has so many ingredients which made it creatively complex.  Grilled Branzini and Spicy Rice Cake were easily the best dishes for the whole experience.  The desserts - ice cream pie and Thai Iced Tea Parfait were so so - I think they had too much cheese -- I don't think I will order them again.   Overall, very impressed by creativity of Chef David Chang.
