So thankful I came here during truffle season. Had the white truffle ravioli special and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten. Service was fantastic, ambiance was nice, and the food did not disappoint. I will certainly be returning again soon! Only thing I regret is not having tried Scarpetta sooner!
