I give this place 5 stars because my date and I cleaned our plates and the portions were pretty generous. We had the herb-crusted hake and the buttermilk fried chicken. Both were delicious and seasoned perfectly and the sides were great. We went on a Sunday night and the wait was kind of long, but worth it. Not that I've been there nearly enough to exhaust the menu options, but I wish they had daily specials, not just a rotating list of day-of-the-week specials.
