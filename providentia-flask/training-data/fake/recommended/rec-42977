So, I haven't been for anything other than brunch yet, but as it stands now, brunch was five stars - as I'd expect from somewhere with a Michelin star. We scored a table on the terrace, which is an ideal way to spend a Sunday brunch. Elizabeth Street is quiet enough to make it enjoyable, and since it is a loading dock, you're raised above the street's foot traffic. However, the interior design and decor of the restaurant is phenom, so even if you're seated outside, take a quick jaunt through the restaurant itself and take in the decor. As for sustenance, the $22 set-price brunch is the way to go: an entree, a brunch cocktail, and unlimited tea or coffee. My boyfriend's Bloody Mary (Public Mary, I think) was fantastic and my fig & vanilla bellini was an understated combination of fizz and sweet with figgy undertones. The self-serve bread offerings were all quite good, particularly the housemade jams and jellies. My boyfriend had the coconut pancakes with ricotta, mango and a ginger-lime syrup. They were some of the lightest, fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. I typically never order pancakes for brunch, but for these I'd make an exception. My tea-smoked salmon with spinach and poached eggs on sourdough was equally delectable - particularly the yuzu hollandaise. Our Aussie waiter was precious as well - cute, witty and there when we needed him. All in all, Public's Michelin star is well-deserved, at least for brunch anyway.
