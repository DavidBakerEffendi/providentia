Continental is a must when visiting Philly. Â I'll caveat this by saying I love the dinner menu, but less than impressed with breakfast / lunch (it's average, not great). My favorite dinner menu items... -Spinach Ravioli -Jumbo Lump Crab Pad Thai -Seared Tuna with Mushroom Risotto -Lobster Mac & Cheese -Cheesesteak Eggroll (My favorite!!!!!) -Korean Pork Tacos
