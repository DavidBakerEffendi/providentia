Meh.  I don't get it.  Yelp you have lead me astray.  It's pretty far from the subway.. almost all of us cabbed it in. I had about 12 people coming for dinner and we wanted something like tapas and wine.   First.. they should have told me.. we are a wine bar and we don't really serve dinner.  The table they sat us at was awkward.. it was a booth.  We would have been better suited outside at one of their tables put together.. they did not do that. They ran out of the lamb skewers at 8:30 pm.  What?!  Ummm.. considering you don't serve dinner.. shouldn't you plan a little better with a 12 person table coming in? We tried a wide variety of stuff.. I tried the duck sandwich which was okay.. the tuna melt was disgusting.  And the salad was really just standard salad. Waitress was okay.. she was cool to split all of our checks.. BUT it took forever to get water, wine glasses, and one person at our table waited almost 40 minutes for her food. No... I would not go here again.  Dissapointing.
