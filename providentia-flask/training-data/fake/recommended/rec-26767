It can be a little difficult to secure prime time reservations for Osteria, but if you're open to eating a bit later (8:30-9pm) it 's usually much more open. Osteria is another great opportunity to ease into the Vetri experience, without the (as of 9/1/12) $155/person price tag. With options like the Polpo (Octopus, smoked mozzarella and red chili flake tomato sauce-$17) and the Lombarda (Sausage, mozzarella, bitto cheese and a baked egg-$18), these aren't your Bertucci's style wood fire pizzas.  Each pizza is meticulously constructed, making sure each slice is topped with just enough toppings, but also allowing you to enjoy the taste of the dough.  If you're not worrying about looking nice in your bikini, go for the house cured salumi plate ($14) which is a charcuterie board of thinly sliced, fatty, meaty deliciousness.  5 types of meat which nicely display the differences between different areas of everyone's favorite Looney Toon, Porkey.
