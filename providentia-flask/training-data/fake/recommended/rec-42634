I was traveling for work and was in Hartford CT.  One of my co-workers recommended we try Capital Grille.  He indicated that he had eaten at one before and it was very good.  Being a huge fan of a great steak, I decided to give it a try.   It was definitely a classy place, although there were many of us wearing shorts.  So a classy place, yet not stuff or snotty.   I looked over their menu, which was not very long, the wine menu was much longer.  But then again, from what I heard, you go there primarily for the steak.  So when I saw a Delmonico (Ribeye) steak, of course I was gonna go for that.  Well, to make this review short and to the point, it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten!  YUM YUM YUM!  Perfectly cooked and perfectly marbled, just delicious.  I will definitely be going back!
