This is my third visit to Jupiter. I honestly feel that I have never had a meal more delicious or flavorful than Goat Cheese Gnocchi - Â mushrooms, cream, seasonal vegetables... It's amazing. It's so good that I will be back every month . Wine list with great by the glass selection - cab was my favorite. Great service by extremely busy bar people made it all so complete. Well done.
