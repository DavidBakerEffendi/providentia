After the wedding the bride and groom choose this place to have the dinner with close knit family. It was good. The food was good and the service was on point. There were no complaints with the prices on the menu and the menu is great! Though I have only been there once I feel like you can go there after work for a drink or on a romantic date with your man/woman. We ate here in the early afternoon and the place was quiet and no one bothered us. The helped the bride and groom with anything they needed to set up for the family. The team working had great knowledge of the menu which is always a plus. I would definitely go back!
