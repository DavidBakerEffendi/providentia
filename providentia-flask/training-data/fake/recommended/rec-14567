My wife and I came here for lunch on a weekday. It's a small place in Nolita but we were seated quickly. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was fantastic - but what would you expect in this part of the city? Service was quick and attentive, food was outstanding. The tiramisu we had for dessert was also good.
