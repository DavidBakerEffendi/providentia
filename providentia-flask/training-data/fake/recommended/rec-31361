Celebrated my 20th birthday here on January 25th. Â We reserved at 6pm for 6:30pm dinner. It wasn't packed. It has a coat check and the lounge area. Food : We were a group of three people and our waiter suggested us to try sampling 3 appetizers each instead of getting 3 entrees. We ended up ordering 8 dishes because I wasn't feeling hungry and I only ordered 2. To my surprise, we couldn't finish the total of 8 orders. Although the portions weren't huge, they were very delicious and filling. 1.Grilled Spanish Coast Octopus - the octopus was average but I loved the lamb belly that came with it. It was super flavorful and fatty. I don't usually (like rarely) eat fats but this one is a YES. 2.Moussaka- the eggplant dish that I found intricate yet delectable 3.Phoenician Fries - Different from regular fries because it's wider and more flavorful. I loved the dip that came with it 4.Calamari A La Plancha - Calamari and corn! It was the best combo ever! 5. Veal Bacon - Bacons in mini pancakes. I wish they came earlier because I was already very full. Soft warm pancakes with thick bacons inside! 6. Duck Sharwarma - Duck wraps. Nothing very special but I loved it! It's diced duck with salad inside the wrap. 7. Baba ghannouj- eggplant dip that I paired with the bread 8. Brussel Sprouts- I didn't like this dish probably because I don't really eat brussel sprouts. ( I don't hate it) It tasted bitter and the grapes in the dish were very sweet ( not fresh grape sweet, more like syrup sweet) Price : This is not a cheap place to dine. The total was around $130 not including tips. (we got a drink too). But, it is also because we ordered too much! Suggestion : If you are just 2 or 3 people, order 5 or 6 dishes. I recommend Octopus, Calamari, Veal Bacon, Duck Shawarma and the dip. I really want to try their yoghurt dip. I think it is a nice place for fancy adventurous/fun dinner. I only didn't give 5 stars because I had stomach problems at night. I am not sure why though.
