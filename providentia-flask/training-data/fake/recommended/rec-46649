My favorite! The Ethiopian dishes are super tasty and vary in character from visit to visit, so the flavor palate is always a little different. The vegetable dishes here are particularly noteworthy -- I would venture that even dedicated carnivores would be satisfied by the rich flavors and hearty character of the veggie combo selections. Although I can't necessarily claim that the food dramatically surpasses other Ethiopian dining I've had in the city, it is certainly top notch and it's my personal favorite. And Almaz and Solomon (they own and run the place) are such wonderful people that it's always a joy to stop in and visit them. Apart from the Ethiopian dining the coffee here is quite respectable, and they make a formidable hot chocolate if you ever just want to stop in on a cold day (by the way, it's always warm in here). Almaz also makes a couple daily soups that are always delicious if you're around during lunch and can't really handle a filling Ethiopian platter. I had a cold a couple months back that her chicken soup (with something delicious in it like ginger maybe?) did wonders for. Can't wait for my next visit!
