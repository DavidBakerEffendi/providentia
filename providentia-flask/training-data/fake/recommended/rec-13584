one of my favorite places in brooklyn. romantic, dark-wooded, candle-lit type spot. they've got this spicy tequila hot sauce cocktail that i can drink, like, six of and remain fun and interesting. i used to bring dates here for cocktails, but now i go with my boo and stay for the food, too. great roast chicken with crispy, crackly skin just the way you want it to be. lovely cheese plates.
