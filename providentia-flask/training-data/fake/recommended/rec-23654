Great choice for Sunday brunch. We had the pork sandwich, a kale salad, and the pickled and fermented vegetable plate.  Kale could be a cliche in an restaurant focusing on locally-sourced food but here it is scrumptious.  The dressing is so complex that you probably won't guess more than one or two of the half dozen ingredients.  The veggie plate was tasty too, but don't order it if the image of nouvelle cuisine - an assortment of colorful specimens - does not appeal to you.   Normally I wouldn't mention a restaurant's bathrooms unless something was amiss, but the sound system and fixtures in Agricola's restroom were superb.
