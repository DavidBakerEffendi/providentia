My first time in NY I visited this place and I fell in love. This is a great quick snack or 4th meal and it's become a requirement for me to visit at least once whenever I'm in town. I've had every roll on the menu, but my favorite would be beef and egg. I wish they had something like this here in Seattle. I can't wait to get back to NY and Kati Rolls!
