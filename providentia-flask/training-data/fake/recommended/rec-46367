After hearing amazing reviews from friends, a foodie friend who wanted to experience, joined me in taking my Mum who was in town visiting.  An innovative and diverse cocktail list started our dinner; the Celery Gimlet was refreshing and smooth.  They were able to make an odd cocktail at my Mum's request to her liking.    Started with the mushroom pot, which was smooth, creamy and earthy; and the hamachi - beef and yellow tail - both fresh, tender and melted-in-your mouth goodness.  Entrees included the tile fish special, pork chops and filet; all perfectly prepared.  The brussel sprouts side was delicious, though a tad heavy on the oil and sauce.  Desserts - the Donuts were the big hit; airy with a crisp shell, that held up and went perfectly with the vanilla and chocolate sauces.  The s'mores, while fabulous in presentation and concept, tasted like propane (or what I imagine it tastes like), and were disappointing, having been recommended from our waiter.  I'll definitely go back; if not for just grabbing cocktails in the bar area.
