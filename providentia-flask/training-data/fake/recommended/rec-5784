Excellent location. Absolutely delicious. Comfy & cozy. Shepard salad, Zucchini pancakes, Adana kebab, chicken Adana kebab, lamb doner kebab, mussaka. There isnt much to say about this place, it was A+! Absolutely EVERY item we tried was delicious. The service was quick and friendly. Without a doubt, I will come again!
