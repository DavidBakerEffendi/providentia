Seriously. We waited 25 minutes for an omelet that looks like eggbeaters and frozen Green Giant broccoli, and eggs Benedict with NO TOAST and no potatoes. It doesn't come with it, they said. What are you supposed to sop up the yolk with? No one even came by our table so we could ask about it, we had to walk to another part of the restaurant to flag someone down to get toast, and again to get the check. We left still hungry and went for a snack at Root Hill.
