I have been craving Mexican food lately and Casa Enrique did not disappoint at all. Sure, we ate on Cinco de Mayo and the restaurant was packed. My gf and I ordered spicy guacamole which was tasty but not spicy at all. I had a delicious salsa verde chicken enchilada. The salsa verde was tangy and smoky. The chicken was juicy and the enchilada shell was tasty and not soggy at all. My gf had the snapper entree that was a special that night. The skin was perfectly crispy and grilled just right. The fish had a lot of juices overflowing in the bowl. I loved her dish as well. Since it was Cinco I had a resposoda margarita on the rocks that was strong and really wonderful.
