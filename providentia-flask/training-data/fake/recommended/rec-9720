Im peruvian and i was very excited to try this place. After entering and being sitted one foot away from the other table in a hallway we left because not one waiter came to even take our drinks order. We asked a waiter that was helping the tables around us if he could please send someone to help us... Twice. I will not be recommending this place to anybody.
