So we came here in a group of 5 for brunch on Saturday afternoon. The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait or less. Ok so we find somewhere to stay until it is time to be seated because it is freezing outside! After 45 minutes, I went up to the hostess and kindly asked if it would be much longer. She rolls her eyes and says "I don't know. You have to understand that we also have people with reservations coming in". Earlier we had called to make reservations and she told us there are no reservations on weekends! We were seated after 1 hr and 20 minutes of waiting! No apology for the wait, no "thank you for patiently waiting", nothing. Just rudeness from the hostess. To top it off, I was not pleased with the vegetarian fried chicken. I didn't even finish it. If we had better service, the brunch would have gone way better. The hostess is the first face you see as you enter and it should always be a kind person, not rude!
