Yumm a friend and I came here to have some kimchi fries! They were to die for, so if visiting this place please order the kimchi fries. The sandwiches are fairly large so they cut them in half for you. We ended up getting a bag to go, and saved the other halves for later in the day. Surprisingly the place is easy to miss but I see myself becoming a regular here. In terms of staff, they were warm and welcoming despite my ignorance to their menu, they recommended the fries. Preparation took only a few minutes probably less than ten mins so I'd say service is rather quick. The overall presentation of the food is nice and the restaurant is in itself tidy and clean. I'm surprised they haven't expanded to the east village by now. Really cute relaxing place to catch up with friends.
