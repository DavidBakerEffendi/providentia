I agree with most of the reviews of this place...this is a GREAT breakfast place.  That said, I feel that someone (meaning me) should make the point that while the blueberry pancakes are very good, the blueberries are a compote that is dolloped in the center of the stack, it is not blueberries cooked into the batter.  I feel this distinction should be made because my friend who was with me agreed that I'm not the only person who prefers blueberry pancakes made the cooked-within-the-batter way. Still, it didn't stop me from eating and enjoying the pancakes I had and they are good. Another point that I think needs to be made is that we went there at 10 a.m. last Wednesday (June 30th) and we were seated right away. In another words, there was no wait time although it is a small, crowded place even in the middle of the week.  But I feel for people like myself who are local enough to be within a 90-minute train ride to Grand Central that it is worth NOT going on a weekend if you don't want to stand on the fabled 2-hour line waiting to get in. Just a suggestion for us Bridge and Tunnel people.
