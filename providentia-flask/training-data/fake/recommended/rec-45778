I had take out pizzas (Lg pepperoni and Sm white clam) from this place tonight. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their pizzas.  The white clam pie was as good as that of legendary De Lorenzo's.  I personally prefer a thinner and crunchier crust, but it was very tasty!  The pepperoni pie was as good as any in the area - there wasn't a "wow!" factor. I will definitely go back here for the white clam pie!  Highly recommended!!
