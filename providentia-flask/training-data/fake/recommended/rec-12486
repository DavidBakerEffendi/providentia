The food here is AMAZING. These are the best pancakes I've ever had by a WIDE margin and are the gold standard by which I measure all other pancake experiences. The warm apple butter (instead of maple syrup) makes them even better. For myself however I typically order the Spanish scramble. Biscuits come with a fresh raspberry pur√©e/preserves (not sure what to call it) that's fantastic. Get here very early, the line forms on the weekend about an hour before opening.
