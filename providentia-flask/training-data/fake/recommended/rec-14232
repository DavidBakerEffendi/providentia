I was born in New Haven and grew up eating pizza from Wooster St. When I was a kid, the Spot was not a Frank Pepe-outpost and back then, people who knew pizza knew the Spot kicked Pepe's butt. Today, we are minus one great pizza restaurant on Wooster, but Frank Pepe pizza still kicks 99% of most pizza's butt. If you are used to NY pizza, you have not eaten pizza until you have eaten New Haven pizza. That's right, Grimaldi's and John's, you know the game: New Haven has you beat hands down. Here you get a paper-thin crust that is dusted with cornmeal (so as not to stick to the oven), fantastically fresh tomato sauce, and draft soda in the pttcher (you must try the local brew--Foxon's birch beer. If they no longer have it, angels are crying in heaven, this stuff is the best!). Yes, there are long lines, but that's thanks to all the out-of-towners who blew up the spot. Go at lunch time or some off hour and indulge in what is the best pizza you will EVER have. Not doughy, but just a perfect marraige of crust, tomato, cheese, and topping. I'm not a fan of the clam pizza, but the olives, tomato, and peppers are out of this world. Heaven with a cold pitcher of beer or birch beer.
