I came here for my birthday, and I'm so SO glad I did. Upon entering, I was totally charmed by the atmosphere. We were greeted by the sushi chefs and the waitress and since we had reservations, we were seated right away. The menu is extensive; it includes not only your regular sushi fare (tempura, shumai, a la carte rolls) but it offers some Korean fare as well. They set down a big ol' bowl of complimentary mussels in front of us, too. Subarashi! I ordered the tuna roll combo and when it arrived (which was pretty quickly) it was very fresh and quite tasty; the texture was wonderful (bad texture totally turns me off). My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, but he ordered the Shogun roll, and he definitely enjoyed it. I loved the shrimp tempura and have been craving it for the past few days! It was light and crispy and not at all oily. Our rolls were ginormous and they were well put-together. They looked very pretty too. My tuna nigiri: the rice was blanketed by the fish! You couldn't even see the rice. And the rolls held together when picked up with chopsticks. Good deal. My only caveat is to be aware of your surroundings when coming and going. Other than that, I was very pleased and totally impressed. Come hungry; Nizi doesn't disappoint.
