Wow! Me and some friends stumbled upon this hidden gem after taking a wrong turn. It was definitely Â  the best wrong turn we ever made! We stopped in to grab a beer and some food and left amazed at how good the food was, definatly going back again!! I had the chicken parm with some penne and vodka and it was amazing!!! The owner even stopped over and introduced himself and made sure we enjoyed everything. Reminded me of the old school Italian restaurants from way back when. It's definatly a place you'd want to bring a lady on a first date, it's intimate and the quality of food you get for the price is unbeatable. Our waitress was a sweetheart and you could tell this place takes pride in customer service. I'm usually the one who just uses yelp to find a good restaurant and not bother to comment but seeing as we happened to just stumble upon the best kept secret in Belleville I had to give credit where it was due ! Good job Me & tommys's ill be back soon with the ol lady as promised !
