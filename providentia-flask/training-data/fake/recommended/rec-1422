I really want to give it a 3.5. The infamous Pat's vs. Geno's challenge! I really enjoyed Pat's. I loved the many options they offer with mushrooms, peppers, pizza sauce, etc. I got a mushroom cheesesteak with whiz and onions. AND cheese fries! OMG so much cheese! It is fun to do the challenge with friends but it isn't the best cheesesteak in Philly.
