So, Virginia's wonderful stepdad, Pierre, brought us to this place on the promise that in Montreal, there are a ton of Vietnamese people so he knows what is authentic. After this experience, Â I am inclined to believe him. I have never had pho before, but I think it may be my new hangover cure. It's surely time that I step up from hot and spicy chicken ramen. They had a kettle of black tea on the table as soon as we sat down. They also had a multitude of sauces, which Pierre says is important in informing our Austin pho choices. I was terrified of eating raw meat. I specifically asked Pierre how raw my beef would be, and he assured me that the broth would cook it. This is honestly what has held me back from pho in Austin so far. Guess what y'all: that broth will cook your goddamn beef! Shit was delicious. I love pho.
