When I came to Balthazar for a late dinner with friends, I wasn't even really hungry. Two and a half hours, three courses, and two bottles of wine later...I didn't want to stop eating. We started with, of course, fries and mayo. Delicious. Seriously, I dream about these fries. I ordered the Seared Organic Salmon for my main dish and it was absolutely fantastic...finished the entire thing. We ended with creme brulee, which didn't disappoint. The service and the atmosphere were top-notch. It's unpretentious, yet upscale....and totally the type of place you can go to really relax and enjoy yourself with great friends. Can't wait to go back.
