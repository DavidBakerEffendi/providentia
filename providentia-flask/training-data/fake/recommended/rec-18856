A reliable choice right on the cusp of University City. Very friendly(and patient) bartenders, decent food(the hickory burger is very generous and delicious), and an excellent selection of beers on draft. The mixed drinks are also terrific. And the people there-both in front and behind the bar-are very friendly.
