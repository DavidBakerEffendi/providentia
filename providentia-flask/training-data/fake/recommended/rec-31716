One of the great things I love about tapas places is that it gives you a great opportunity (and excuse) to try several dishes in one sitting. Come with someone with an adventurous palette and you're in even better shape! This a great quaint space with dim lighting - great for a first date (which was actually how I the pleasure of discovering this place). He had been here before so we ordered a couple of his faves like the charred shishito peppers and the chicken liver mousse. Both were really good. The peppers were particularly good for sharing. The chicken liver had this extra little something something flavor that made it unique from any other liver mousse I've had before. I think it's the sherry. We also went for the veal tongue. I've never seen this item offered on a menu before. I was adventurous. He was adventurous. We ordered it. Was it good? Yes. Would I want to eat more of it? I'm good on veal tongue for now. On to the suckling pig special! This was indeed a special. The meat was insanely tender and the skin was, of course, the best part. I have no idea what this dish cost, but it couldn't have been cheap. Â  Our meal also included another daily special - the scallops. The dish came with two scallops. They were a decent size, but there were only two...They were tasty, but we ordered them towards the end of the meal so it definitely put me at the point of "how much more can I fit in my belly and still be seen as a lady" threshold.
