YUMMY! The first time I've had an Umami burger was when I visited California. I was super excited when I heard that they were going to open one in New York. I finally got to stop by Umami and thank god the wait wasn't too bad. I ordered the Manly Burger and it was as delicious as I remembered it to be. Everything else was delicious as well, especially their Garlic Aioli! We had to ask for extra Garlic Aioli so we can dip everything (literally, EVERYTHING) in it. Cannot wait to go back and try the rest of their menu! :)
