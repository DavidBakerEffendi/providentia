Hands down amazing! Arrived on a Saturday night with no res, but we found some room at the bar. The decor is lovely and not too overdone.. I love the ceiling made from wine corks.. Very original. Decided we needed to eat so, ordered an arugala salad which was very simple but flavorful, and also had the pesto pasta. I still have dreams of this, it was complete heaven. Give an Italian girl some good bread, pasta and chianti and she will be content :) Btw, the bartender here was super busy but still made time to chat with us a bit, made us laugh and we never felt rushed. Service was wonderful all around. Cannot wait to come back!
