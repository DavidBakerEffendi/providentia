In a perfect world everyone ought to be doing this: offering tremendously good food in a charming environment with great service on the lower side of moderate cost.  You're made to feel like you're guests, instead of just customers.  I was hopeful of all the Yelp five star reviews would lead me to a great experience, and here it was the case! The bread with creamy sauce appetizer is through the roof good.  The mixed grill (at $30 for two) made me wonder why I bother hitting up rodizio joints.  Smoky, rich and delicious without being obscenely heavy, this grilled meat platter was a winner.  The bacon wrapped prunes and chicken livers might not be everybody's cup of tea, but they only added a bit of interest to the spectacular pork and sausage morsels that composed the lion's share of the plate.  A side of grilled veggies (eggplant, pepper, zucchini and onion) perfectly complimented the meal.  The table bread, served with a roast pepper and eggplant spread was noteworthy.  I've been in much posher places that served bread that wasn't nearly as good.  A dessert of wheat berries and walnuts served with whipped cream (cold) was strange at first.  Sweet cold porridge for dessert?  It was amazing.   With a bottle of good Croatian wine we got out of a fantastic meal in a charming place for $90, before tip.  That makes Kafana the most cost effective minor splurge I can think of on Ave C.  I've paid three times as much for meals that were no better than what they're serving here. Serbian food isn't trendy yet; come to Kafana to reap the benefits of that. This is a new favorite of mine, and my wife was blown away as well.  That's great, because in these times blowing her away for this kind of money is just what I like to do!
