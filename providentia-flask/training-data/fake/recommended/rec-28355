New addition to the Ditmars Blvd area. My dining companion and I walked in on Friday evening, memorial day weekend , with no reservation around 7pm and the restaurant was PACKED. We put our names in w the host (who told us it would be about a 15-20 minute wait) and went to try to grab a drink at the bar while we waited (there were no seats available here, either). Just as we were about to order some pre-dinner cocktails, my companion was tapped on the shoulder and we were led to our cozy table on the first level (it had been less than a three minute wait). MP's has a similar menu to the many other tavernas in the area, which in my opinion means they have that much more to prove in order to stake their claim on a very Greek influenced area. Within a few bites of my scallop appetizer, I knew they'd taken the challenge by storm. Our waiter (Roger) and waitress-in-training (Caroline) were both very attentive and knowledgeable of both the food and the -long- wine list, which boasts many Greek wines which they definitely talk up a bit. We noticed that none of the tables in our entirely filled area seemed wanting for anything at any point throughout our meal. We felt unrushed and not hovered over as well. I went w the soft shell crab special (a little over battered but delicious none the less) and he had the octopus appetizer (very tender and meaty) and the Sliders which he couldn't stop raving about (yes, they were amazingly seasoned as well). Only flaws I saw really was the music when we first got there, but it transitioned by the time we left, and the fact the bread came out cold. Other than that, thumbs up and I will def. be returning!
