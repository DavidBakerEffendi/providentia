This is a great place to get your fill of mouth-watering greasy goodness, at a super cheap price.  The employees here have great personality - gruff, but in a nice way that says "Hurry the fuck up and order" but also "You gonna enjoy what I cook up for you. I'm gonna give you a treat."   I love the outdoor bench seating; just watch out for the accumulated grease pools underneath.
