I rolled into Cavanaugh's late on a Tuesday because my friend and I were dying for a bathroom. We grabbed drinks and took care of business, lingering for about 45 minutes. Even though it was Tuesday and the place was pretty dead, there was a lively crowd of fantasy drafters crowded around the TV in the front room. Probably the biggest thing that this Cavanaugh's has going for it is the size. The many different bars and rooms on multiple levels means that you can find a room that works for you and your friends, but still feel like you're in a tiny neighborhood hole in the wall. Drinks specials and food ostensibly don't seem much different than when this bar was Dark Horse, but there were a surprising amount of craft brews on the list, so that was pleasant to see! (I expected it to have a much more limited selection.) I miss Dark Horse (token whine here), but the bones and general decor are still there, so Cavanaugh's is definitely worth a visit if you're looking for a fun place to watch a game, especially if you like when the crowd is involved and enthusiastic.
