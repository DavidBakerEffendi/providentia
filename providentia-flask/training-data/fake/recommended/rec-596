Traditional tapas and red wine with a side of live flamenco?  Yes, please. I went to Nai Tapas with my date on Saturday night without a reservation, and was seated immediately.  Although the restaurant seems small from the outside (it's half underground), the space is sizable with many tables and quite a few bar seats.  The tapas were rich and flavorful morsels - my date's favorite was the grilled octopus in olive oil, and mine was the garlic sauteed shrimp. We were impressed with the long menu - many options came in smaller tapas servings ($5-10) and in larger portions as well (more like $10-15).  We were full and happy after 5 tapas-sized dishes and a bottle of wine.  The best part was the flamenco band in between courses (!)... I'm not sure if that's a weekly performance, but it definitely should be.  This is one of those places that's great for a date night but would also be fun for drinks and food with a larger group of friends.
