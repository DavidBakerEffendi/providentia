Briefly - very nice ambiance West Village ambiance, good food (though I think you need to order right, not everything was a hit), admittedly middling service and cash only, but a good value. Most everyone had an opener, entree, and two glasses of wine (and a dessert and a couple coffees) which was $36 apiece. Not bad. We were able to secure a table for 8 @ 8 pm within 24 hours notice, yet the restaurant was full the entire time - a nice balance of busy but not impossible to get into. I had the wilted spinach as an appetizer and the spaghetti as my entree. Nothing fancy, but both well-executed. Sometimes the simplest dishes are the best. Other dishes that seemed to go over well were the gnocci dishes and an appetizer that was a variety of crostinis with toppings. Seemed like a place that is pretty versatile and could work as a date spot or a place for a larger group. I will definitely return in the future.
