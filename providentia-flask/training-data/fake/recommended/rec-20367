My gentleman friend brought me here for my birthday dinner, and I've been dieing to return ever since.  We'd indulged in a leisurely stroll from my apartment in East Williamsburg, stopping along the way for a few birthday libations. Therefore, by the time we finally reached Marlow & Sons, we were ever so ravenous. We were seated promptly and briefly took some time to delight in the atmosphere of the place before setting our minds to the main event; the art of ordering our food. To start we ordered a Caesar Salad with mustard greens and BACON FRIED CROUTONS; as well as an off-menu special, a rabbit salad with braised rabbit vinaigrette, topped with sliced rabbit loin, and served with a peice of rabbit pate smothered toast.  Then for the main course we decided to share the famous Brick Chicken as well as Beef Bourguignon served atop a bed of polenta, with a small salad of dressed parsely on top. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was delicious.  Perfect.  Fabulous.  I cannot recommend this establishment highly enough; and furthermore I'd recommend every dish we ordered. That said, the Caesar Salad was like crack and I've been dreaming of getting another fix ever since.  I could probably eat that and nothing else for weeks without even thinking of other, lesser foods. My gentleman friend felt the same about the Brick Chicken. Unfortunately for us, the portions are entirely reasonably sized and the food rich and flavorful (and we were unable to stop stuffing our mouths until we were completely full), so we had no room in our tums left for dessert; a grave disappointment. I suppose we will just have to return.
