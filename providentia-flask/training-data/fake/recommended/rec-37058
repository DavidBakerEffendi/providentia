I've been coming to this spot since they first opened. I've recommended it to all of my friends and it's never failed. The prices are excellent and the ingredients are always fresh and delicious. I usually order the falafel or chicken sandwich. Sometimes I splurge and get the hummus which is creamy and flavorful. Sit by the window for some prime people watching. It adds to the Williamsburg experience.
