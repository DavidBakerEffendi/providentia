Pio Pio was very hip and modern, loved the atmosphere.  We sat off at one of the tables to back of the bar.  Downstairs seemed really happening and loud so actually glad we were a little quieter up top.  I had the sea bass and it was to die for.  It was one of the best dishes.  The bartender waited on us and we had great service.  Definitely a must try if you are looking for Peruvian food.
