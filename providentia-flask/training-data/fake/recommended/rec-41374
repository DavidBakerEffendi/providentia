Oh hell yes. Not only did I have one of the best burgers I've ever eaten IN MY LIFE, the chef and server were so nice that we were basically friends at the end of the meal. When my friend suggested this spot, I almost protested because it is three things that I don't love: it's in Williamsburg (so hard to get to from Crown Heights), it's cash-only, and it's BYOB. I am so glad I did not protest. What a gem! What a treat! I had the truffle burger, which was just the most perfectly medium-cooked patty, topped with sauteed portobello slices and drizzled in truffle oil. I almost have truffle fatigue at this point, but the craftsmanship of this burger made this flavor combination seem as fresh as the first time I tried it. Tom the cook and Raphael the server are great people. Raphael was super friendly and was joking around with us within a few minutes, and Tom came out from the kitchen to chat about the restaurant business and the changing neighborhood. We had the best time. Krystal, I'll never doubt you again. You pick all the places we go from now on.
