This place is expensive. I'd read it in the reviews, but somehow thought it wouldn't be too much of a shock compared to SF prices. That was before I saw cans of beer for $3-4. Anyway, I stopped by for lunch while an Eagles game was on. I tried the half meatball grinder, the warm mozzarella side, and the Parmesan popcorn. None of it was very good. The warm mozzarella was ok, but not warm. The popcorn tasted really stale.
