A lovely atmosphere, but don't go for the food. On the several occasions I have come here, I have always been disappointed by the food. The first time, the soup was so salty it was inedible. The next time, the frittata was a plate of rubber. And subsequent times, too salty. That being said, the beverages, pastries and ambience are great.
