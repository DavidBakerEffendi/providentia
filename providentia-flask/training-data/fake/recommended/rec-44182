For my purposes Jay's serves as a viable lunch option, but from repeated aisle roaming I feel this small corner store would be a solid market in any neighborhood (even without beer).  Jay's makes the elusive sandwich that you wish you could make at home and bring in to work; the freshest Metropolitan Bakery bread, crisp veggies, and a thick pile of Boar's Head meat and cheese.  Add a huge variety of chips (Dirty Chips. yum) and Le Bus poundcake for dessert and you're talking the perfect comfort lunch.  You'll see the same friendly faces working here day after day and they definitely remember you; always a solid lunch option.
