I was there last Saturday early evening. Sat outside. I ordered the southwest egg rolls. My significant other ordered the wings. The service was good. The staff was nice. The food we ordered was very good too. Only one problem.... Three hours later I had bad stomach pains and threw up. That was the only food I had that day. And none of the other three people I spent the weekend with in close quarters got sick. Based on the facts, I suspect that either the food handler had dirty hands or the southwest egg rolls were bad.
