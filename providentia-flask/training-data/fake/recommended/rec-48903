This is a small place with not much seating available. I had the burger (which is not always on the menu but if you ask they will serve it) which was featured on triple D (Diner drive-ins and dives). One of my favorite shows by the way, Guy just kills me! The burger is bare bones, some meat and cheese on a bun. No flashing lights, bells or whistles. Just a burger in its purest form and as Guy would say it was outrageous! To accompany your burger do yourself a favor and order the Rosemary fries, they're dynamite.
