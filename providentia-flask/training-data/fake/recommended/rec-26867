This place is amazing. Consistently delicious food, from the arugula salad to the steak frites to the steak tartare to the foie gras to the specials (like amazing stuffed quail). It's just always spot on. Even the fries are amazing. The service is unobtrusive but attentive, perfect for a quiet meal when you just want to focus on whomever you're with. I've been several times and will definitely be back again soon.
