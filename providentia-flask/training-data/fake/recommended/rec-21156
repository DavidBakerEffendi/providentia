Went here at 8pm on a Monday night. Wait was 30 min for 2 so we went around the corner to the other room for a drink. We got a great corner table. Restaurant is quiet loud but has nice ambience. Shared artichoke salad special (raw artichokes, would have been better grilled). For pastas we got tagliatelle with ragu and spinach gnocchi with spicy red sauce. Tagliatelle was drenched in red sauce. I like that but maybe not for everyone. Spicy red sauce was so spicy it gave me a stomach ache. Should have stuck to red sauce. Pastas were average, hearty portions good for a cold night. Tiramisu with dessert was covered in chocolate sauce. After scraping it off, tiramisu itself was pretty good. Update: I actually felt pretty sick after the meal as did my boyfriend. Like the atmosphere but wouldn't go back for the food.
