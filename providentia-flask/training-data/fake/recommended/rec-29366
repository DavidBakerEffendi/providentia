Came here due to there reputation and was slightly disappointed. Seems as though the competition has caught up with them and exceeded them. I still enjoyed my visit, but it was more like going to see a historic site. In this case I was going to see the history of cheese steaks past. If you're a cheese steak fanatic that wants a taste of history, than by all means make sure to visit this place. If you want the best cheese steak in Philly, there are other competitors within driving distance that do it better.
