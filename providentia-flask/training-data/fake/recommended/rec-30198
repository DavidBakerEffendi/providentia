Kefi is inconsistent. I have had wonderful meals here as well as meals that were just meh!  I never know what I am going to get. Their appetizers are usually very good.  Main courses vary widely. While I'm not a bit fan of their brunch menu they take reservations which is a huge plus when dealing with the UWS Sunday morning brunch rush.   Overall it's ok but thats about it.  Not fantastic but not horrible. Every once in awhile it's terrific but since I never know when I'll hit Kefi on a good night it rarely seems worth it to order more than a drink and some apps.
