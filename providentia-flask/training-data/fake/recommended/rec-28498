I went here for lunch with my boss since it's about a 2 minute walk from my building. I made a reservation, but it seems the lunch crowd isn't too dense here so it was unnecessary. It's nicely decorated interior, although the faintness of the font on the menu and the dim lighting present a little bit of a challenge when perusing the menu. I settled on getting the Hot Pastrami Sandwich. It comes on whole grain bread with mustard, saurkraut, and swiss cheese. It was decent enough, although quite heavy and greasy, but I should have gathered that since there isn't a pastrami sandwich in existence that isn't both of those things. I could have used a little bit more saurkraut on it and the pastrami could have been a little bit more tender. The fries were just ok. Greasy, but somewhat soggy and in very small cuts. The price is a little bit expensive which would be in line with most Flatiron restaurants. I'd be hesitant to come here again as the Pastrami sandwich is actually one of the cheaper options at $14. Most other lunch entrees will run about $20. Oh, and luckily my meal came with a side of fries because otherwise they run you an astounding $7 to order them as a side.
