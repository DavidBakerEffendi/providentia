I'm happily stuffed as I'm writing this. Stuffed with two veggie hot dogs that were as good as any I've had. I went with the Maui and the Banh Mi. Both were quite excellent. Fries were good too. Service was excellent. The only non-excellent thing is the price. I'm not sure what I expected to pay for four hotdogs, fries, and two drinks, but $35 is a-day-at-the-ballpark prices.
