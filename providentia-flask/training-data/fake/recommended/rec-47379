Just discovered this place while stranded in NY during the huge winter blizzard last week. For the record, staying for free with a friend in the West Village is not a bad place to be stranded! He suggested this place because it was a short walk from his apt. After trudging through the snow, we walked in to this cozy spot and forgot all about the mess outsdoors. I immediately ordered a tasty sangria to begin the meal. There was plenty of great dishes to chose from but I went with the salmon which was fantastic. My friend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why such a simple meal could cost $22. Until it arrived, the meatballs were the size of my fist - each. I didn't try it, but he seemed to love it. My only complaint, it seemed a bit pricey, but that could be because I'm accustomed to eating pretty cheap in Atlanta. Probably not too bad for NY standards.
