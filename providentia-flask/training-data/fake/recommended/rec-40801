Good food. Love the fact the Jerk Chicken is boneless (I'm a picky eater). Service was ok and the staff was friendly. We intended to dine in however the place is way smaller than expected and when we arrived they had the music blasting like a club hall. Since we could not hear ourselves due to the noise, we decided to do take out. The place is small but good food. About 6 tables and a small bar. I'd return again if I was in the mood for some Carribean food.
