A GREAT diner. The low-star reviews on here are really not fair or representative of the place. I was a student at TCNJ for four years and stopped this this place at least once a week. The staff is always attentive and kind, and the food is good diner fare. One cannot come to a diner expecting gourmet food; it's just not fair. This is not to say that this place has bad food, it's great for a diner! The portions are huge, too. The decor is fun, too. It's a nice interior with tall ceilings and beautiful booths and tables to sit at. I recommend it to anyone. My favorites are the gyro and the reuben. Being Greek myself, I can say the gyro is GREAT for a diner. Also, most dishes come with soup or salad and a nice pile of deliciously prepared fries. Go check it out!
