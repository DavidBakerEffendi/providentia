This is a great place--unfortunately it has become way too popular and is always filled to the brink with people who tromp down there because they are slightly too trendy for the meatpacking district, but their presence in this (formerly) neightborhood retreat makes it just that -- meatpacking south. Perhaps I am old-school when I yearn for the days before the second floor opened up and you could enjoy a leisurely meal in a great pub-style restaurant. For those looking for that party atmosphere, you will love it. Â For the rest, looks like we will have to find another place to hide from the theme park crowds.
