I really like this place, and it's for very simple reasons.  The staff are always friendly and nice to me.  They know their product through and through.  They are like beer therapists here, guiding you to the right choice.  Every time I go I essentially see the same staff.  To me, low turn over is a good thing, it means these people know what they are doing.  The food is good.  I like the burger and fries a lot.  They are not greasy or dripping in oil.  They are fresh and tasty!  The sauces are good too. I can't speak for the rest of the food, it looks and smells great, but I just always get the burger.  You can't beat the beer selection.  I know people rave about Monks' and I like that place but Eulogy, to me has got them beat.   It does get crowded Fri. & Sat. nights.  It can be a pain to get a seat.  If that happen it happens, no big deal.  I like this place enough that I don't really care.  If I can't get a seat, I'll juts try again another time.  It's not going anywhere, and I'll be back at some point.  This a great place.  Normally it's the first place I tell anybody about whenever they ask me a question about Philly.   If beer is you thing, this is the place.  At the very least, it's definitely worth going to at least once to SEE the menu and try SOMETHING. One of my happy spots!
