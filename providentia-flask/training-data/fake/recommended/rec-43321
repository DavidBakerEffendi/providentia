Was served by Tico himself. Very friendly and accommodating. Went off-menu and ordered the cheese enchiladas which were excellent. They were baked, not fried and so weren't too greasy. The cheese was just melted and the rice and beans were a good accompaniment. The fresh juice is terrific I got the orange-mango and was not disappointed. It was slightly chilled, they don't fill up the cup with ice either so it's all juice. Fresh and filling. Bottom line, I'd go there again. They close around 4 though, so go there for brunch or lunch.
