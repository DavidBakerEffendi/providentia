Shows - Fantastic space, intimate, decent sound.   There's room to sit back at the bar and watch or you can get up close - easy to enjoy a great show. Drinks - Timely, local beer selection.  Decent prices.  Be sure to ask for a Bud Light Bottle; they love that. Food - In a word, pricey.   It is plenty good, it's just expensive for what you get; you're paying a premium for the popularity of the joint.   Same basic menu as Standard Tap, and the fries are just as addictive.  Look for the seasonal specials, at least then you're getting something for the price.   Also, take advantage of the half priced raw bar at the early happy hour.
