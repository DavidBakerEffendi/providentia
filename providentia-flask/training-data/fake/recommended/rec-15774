Dear God.....these are good burritos. Pretty small sized space in Union Square- don't bother going there during peak times or weekends, but for takeout or delivery these burrito mavens never disappoint. The first thing I was impressed with was its size, and the amount of ingredients you actually get. I remember reading that this place was another Chipotle, and that couldn't be farther from the truth. First, Chiptole is always in a rush, because, well..its Chipotle. And second, the food here tastes incredibly fresher and seems to always fill me up more. I was genuinely impressed by how nice the servers were too-they actually took time to see if I got the right amount of beans, etc. It's the little things that count. Will be coming back for sure!
