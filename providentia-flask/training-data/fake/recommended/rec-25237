Oh my gosh- the food here is straight up heavenly. Â Definitely get the roasted chicken- so fresh and yummy!! I also loved the pork nachos and the pork and queso quesadilla is incredible. Get it with guac and crema!! This is the kind of magical place to introduce to your friends and be so proud you could do so! Writing this review, I basically want to go there right now. Yum.
