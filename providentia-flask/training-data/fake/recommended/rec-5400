Easily one of my favorite places in Philly. The spring rolls are perfect, especially for groups. I'm always finding an excuse to go back especially for the the number 49 (the easy American guide for avoiding pronouncing the actual name of the dish - you'll see). Also, the setting and dining room atmosphere is great for any occasion. There's so much to love about this place. PS. Feel free to burn off your meal by taking a stroll through University City. Make a night of the visit! Enjoy.
