For my first Yelp review i picked Sabrina's-and how could I not? This place has it all: Great servers, personality and delicious original dishes that are well worth the wait! Was here for the second time today for brunch. Showed up around 2pm on a Sunday and was told the wait would be around 45 minutes. We waited 20 at the most and was seated. Our server was attentive but not over bearing which is pleasant and hard to find these days. I went with the "Tofu Scramble". It was yummy, vegan AND healthy. I regret not getting the sweet potato fries which are a favorite of mine, I will have to return for them. All in all a great Sunday afternoon experience. Enjoy fellow Yelpers!
