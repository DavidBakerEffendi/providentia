My girlfriend and I came in here with no reservation and it seemed like this place was booked, however they found seating for us in the dining room area and it was great! The dining room area was lovely with all the huge Ecuadorian roses, it's definitely a romantic, charming area to dine. Great place to bring a date. The food was absolutely delicious! we had the Crudo tapa which we thought was the best dish and, of course as seafood lovers, we each ordered the Paella which was delicious! The whole restaurant was staring at the dish as it came out! We got so full we didn't order any dessert! As far as drinks we ordered some cocktails and they were very tastey and well made. Overall, not only the food but the customer service there was what helps gives this place 5 stars because they offered us a table at the dining room after we were about to eat in the lounge area, the waiter was excellent giving us information about the food, and the host/hostess were very nice as we entered and left.
