We went at around 1pm on a Thursday and there was an HOUR wait! Good to know in advance if you're planning on sitting to eat. We ended up getting food and coffee to go. The aroma of baked goods and chocolate hits you as soon as you walk in, and there are about 14 tables in the place. We ordered two buttermilk breakfast sandwiches with bacon. It was ready in about ten minutes, and they were friendly and accommodating. However, the hype may have given me higher expectations of what my sandwich would be. The biscuit was flaky and hot, although slightly flavorless. The bacon was not crispy and very unimpressive, and they charged 2.50 for it! The tomato spread on the sandwich was bland and made the sandwich very hard to eat. There was hardly any cheese and overall I was just eating it because I was hungry. Granted, I saw pancakes being served while I was there, and those look like the way to go. Lesson learned. I would give this place another try, but I would have a lot of time to kill and make sure I ordered correctly.
