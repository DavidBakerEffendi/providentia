I can't say enough good about Los Caballitos.  The blood orange and prickly pear margaritas are outstanding....and very very relaxing.  The salsas are incredible and the dishes are plentiful, with perfectly prepared meats and veggies.  Speaking of veggie, the vegan fajitas with seitan and smoked tofu are awesome, even if you are a carnivore.  The mahi mahi tacos are perhaps the best I've had outside of San Diego, or Mexico.  The Enchiladas con Picadillo de Puerco are a favorite of mine along w/ a side of the grilled cactus.  Not everyone enjoys this texture, even if they like okra.  I love it.  I think the guac is outstanding and I could sit and eat that all day.  Right now, this is my favorite local place to eat Mexican, either in Philly or Delaware.
