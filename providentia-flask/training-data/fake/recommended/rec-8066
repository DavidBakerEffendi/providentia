Ate lunch there during the week.  Ordered the Cali-Chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and cole slaw.  My wife ordered the fish tacos.  Everything was delicious, and you can't beat the price.  The service is above par, and the decor is "meh charming".  They can usually seat you quickly, unless you go on a saturday afternoon, then there is typically a wait.  The next time I'm in the area, I am going to try the stuffed french toast and bacon.  The menu is good for vegetarians and meatatarians alike.
