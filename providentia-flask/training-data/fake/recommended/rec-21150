All I gotta say is, FILIPINOS work here! :D Oh, and also that the fries are amazing! Mango Chutney all day everyday.  I shared with my cousin and paired it with a slice of cheese pizza across the street. Best combination ever!   Small place though, don't expect to be able to sit down.  All in all, fries are my weakness and my knees fell to the ground when I went to this place.  I'm glad to say that I found a close twin to this closer to where I live (California) and it's at Disneyland! Who wouldve thought right? They call it Pommes Frites, too and the sauce that comes with it tastes like Mango Chutney but called something else.  Mango Chutney is definitely better though.  Hits the spot always
