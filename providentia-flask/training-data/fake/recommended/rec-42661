Really like this place.  You can go in day and night and get a no-frills great meal. Fresh salads , soups, bean dishes,  vegetables (especially the Brasil style Collard Greens  And of course the roast while you watch meats.   All meats are great from Chicken hearts to Lamb or if your feeling a little spice, the sausages.  Great juices and deserts as well.  The only thing that sucks is that you may get the "Gringo price-per-pound"  Which you may get charged a higher rate per pound w/o knowing.  Mr. Joe Whitey over here Totally got the gringo rate. ...Dislike. but go anyways
