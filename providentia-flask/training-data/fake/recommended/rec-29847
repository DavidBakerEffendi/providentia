This place is average in my opinion the decor is real nice as well as the layout but the food seems to be random nothing really goes well with another dish.. Had the fuji apple salad that was good did not get the speck on the dish or why it was there not too heavy but definitely enjoyable and filling. Then had the Uni Toast after i took a bite i was so confused at what I just ate the sauces they paired with it overpowered the dish leaving me confused why there was so little uni... So lets say you order a pastrami sandwich you do not expect more mustard then pastrami correct well on the contrary... The long island duck was perfect rarely have I ever ordered duck at a restaurant and not regretted it this was not the case. The duck was cooked with all the fat fully rendered and drizzled down my plate.. The dressing complemented the duck enhancing the ducks natural flavour into the dish the frizz was a good touch to add a little bit of green to the dish highly recommended this was the star dish left me and my friend fighting for pieces.. I did not enjoy the yellow tail tar tar probably the worst dish here the chips were great don't get me wrong the yellow tail was great too and the nice sides they had.. I asked the waiter how you would typically eat something like this he says simple just mix everything together like a dip and use the chip did that the meal was sooo heavy I ate like two bites and I was done..And the worst part is I love sashimi..
