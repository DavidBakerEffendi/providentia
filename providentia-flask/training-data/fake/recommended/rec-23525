Was very disappointed with the service from tonight. Server ( named Juri) was too busy eating & and socializing to fill our drinks and decided to tell us after our 1st refill, "geez!! Imma start bringing you two cups at a time." And then turned and walked away. He eventually brought our food and after waiting 15 mins for mayo i decided to eat my food. He finally brings it and says " geez couldn't wait?!?!" Really?!?! Wow god forbid I'm hungry and want hot food. The comments aren't needed. Â I cant believe there are people in the service industry like that. I should not gave to feel uncomfortable by anyone when spending MY MONEY. The one star is for the food. It would of been better if it wasn't for him
