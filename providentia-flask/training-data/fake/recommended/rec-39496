I always have a good time when i go to Yuca Bar. The sangrias are $8 a glass or $50 per pitcher. I'm a woman and 2 glasses of their sangria make me more than happy. The sangria is done at night and they let it "rest" in the fridge so that all the fruit absorbs the wine before adding more the next day... meaning, the sangria is pretty strong and yummy. Their yuca fries are the best! They also have really good empanadas and nachos. But we always go there to drink and not so much to eat...
