How did the smell of my favorite fried food go by right under my nose all this time!  What a hit---it's a yummy assorted fry take-out/drunken pit stop AND in my book of 1000 things to do in NYC!  Of the selection of funky fun dipping condiments, I personally enjoyed the wasabi mayo and the curry ketchup was zesty.  I'm going to call a friend to ask what our 3rd one was---senior moment. Cure for the next munchies---poutine!
