As a New Yorker I rarely go into Little Italy but wanted to get some Italian food close to my office on Spring Street.  I was greeted by James the owner- born and raised on Mulberry Street. The location is great- outdoor seating which is good for people watching and the food was amazing.  I ordered a couple of Italian staples and they all were delicious- broccoli rabe, pasta fagoili, and meatballs.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable. If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant with outdoor seating in Little Italy this is your place.
