This place is really great. Went on a Friday evening at 6:30 on a hot summer day and got seating right away for 4. Service was good and the pizza was impressive with really great flavors enhanced by the veggies from the garden. The apps were really great too. We got the leeks and cheese plate. Extra bonus was dessert. A new addition to the menu was chocolate cake. Â The mint in the ice cream with it really set it off. Go to Roberta's!
