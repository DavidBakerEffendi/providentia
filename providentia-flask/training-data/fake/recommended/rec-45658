i really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but it is a little bit too expensive and the rolls are tiny. that being said, oh how delicious the sashimi! i popped in for a quick dinner before pool league (it was playoffs, i wanted a minute alone and some yummy food to fortify me) and it was absolutely perfect. i ordered two pieces of white tuna (which should've been squeezed for their juice, so moist, fresh and sweet), one piece of australian yellowtail (not on the menu, recommended because i asked for scallop and they were out of it) that was perfect with a beautiful color pattern and texture and one piece of spanish mackerel (i so should've ordered 5 of these) that came with a tiny chop of a mushroom sauce on the skin side, beautiful and unbelievably delicious. also ordered a bowl of miso that smelled very pleasantly of the sea, a side of sushi rice and the toro scallion roll (yummy but plain, and definitely wee). but i was very satisfied by my entire meal and am excited to go back. the wait staff was also extremely friendly without being overbearing and since i was in for a VERY early dinner, i ate the meal in silence and was in a perfect mood to beat some bottoms on the pool table. which i did. :) i read most of the negative reviews below and to be honest, a place like this is in old city, so of course prices are going to reflect how much they pay in rent. but my order was beautifully displayed with edible garnish (chrysanthemum leaves, nasturtium, daikon), so they try to make up for it. and there really isn't much ambience, but whatever, i was there for the food. it was nice enough though, and i liked the plain but stylish tables and chairs. and i think i'm done. :)
