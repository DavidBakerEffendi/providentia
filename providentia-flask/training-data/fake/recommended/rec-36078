The thing about getting a lot of great press and being a famous hangout is that people come in with all kinds of crazy expectations.  Sometimes, I read these negative reviews and even viewing the point of view of the writer, I can see they are the most annoying customer on the planet.  This place is great, the service is great, too.  You must make a reservation in advance, though.  We were seated close to the action up front.  Fascinating.  We witnessed the maitre d' deal with some blowhard who was angry he could not be seated.  The way in which he dealt with this pain in the ass was a masterpiece, he kept cool and professional.   It was dinner theater for us.  Anyway, enough of that.  The food was great, we had the pepper steak, a bottle of cremant, oysters, and the salad niscoise which is the best ever.  The tuna was perfect.  Dessert is not to be missed.  Another great night at Balthazar.
