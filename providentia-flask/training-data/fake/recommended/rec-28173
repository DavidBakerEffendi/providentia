Went here for the first time with a group of girlfriends just recently and it for sure lived up to the hype. We went right at a busy time (which no server likes, am I right?) and they still were able to find a group of us 6 a spot to sit. The worst part of this visit was having to choose between the various mouth watering grilled cheese choices they have. I went with the basic egg and cheese which is one of my favorite guilty pleasures and it was the best I have ever had. Can't wait to go back and try the others...and then onto the rest of the menu! I hear the mac and cheese is to die for too. Just writing this is making my mouth water...
