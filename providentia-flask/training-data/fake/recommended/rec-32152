I've been wanting to check out this new location since it opened, and I finally had the chance today.  For those not familiar with the area, it's located right next to the Griswold Center Bertucci's in a wonderfully renovated new space.   From what I can gather, Hot Table is essentially a panini version of Subway with slightly higher quality ingredients, and a more upscale feel.  You order one of their signature panini offerings and then you instruct them on what toppings / condiments you want as you move down the line.  Pretty damn simple concept, and quite frankly, I'm surprised there aren't more places like this out there.   Definitely enjoyed my 'pepper steak' today, and I'm looking forward to trying other offerings.  That being said, I do have a couple small gripes.... 1) compared to other similar establishments (ie: sandwich shops) it's EXPENSIVE.  A medium panini, with nothing else, will run you a little over $9.  If you're a fatty like me, this will be barely enough to tide you over till dinner 2) for a 'subway style' establishment, I found the service pretty slow.  I came in late, and there were only a couple people in line ahead of me, but it still took about 12 minutes to get back out the door.  That may not seem like a lot, but it IS when you're just standing there twiddling your thumbs.  I'm optimistic this could just be a 'growing pains' issue though, so I will re-evaluate in the future. All in all, definitely worth checking out as a new lunch option
