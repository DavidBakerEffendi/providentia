I never write Yelp reviews but have to for Olea. Had a really memorable meal here last night and had only been to Olea for breakfast before. I was seeking really good food but in a really comfortable environment after a long day and this is just what I got. Amazing service, buzzing but relaxed and casual atmosphere, great table and dim lighting. My boyfriend and I shared the vegetable paella, roasted mushroom appetizer, lentil salad, and the romesco and pita starter. All delicious, really filling, but healthy. Highly recommend Olea if you're in the fort greene neighborhood and don't feel like cooking, want a good meal, but still want to feel at home! Great beer and wines by the glass selection as well!
