I swear these guys put crack in their food... or at least in their secret white sauce. I'm completely hooked and am going through withdrawal right now, ever since I left NY. On my first try, I had their lamb wrap... but I should have gone with their chicken platter like everyone else. It's a whole tin plate full of yummy goodness: rice, chicken, lettuce, 2 pieces of pita and all the white sauce you've dreamed of (not a big fan of hot sauce). I just completely cover the top with the white sauce and let it do it's magic. It's like all my taste buds are doing a little happy dance every time I put of spoonful of that perfect compilation in my mouth. Mmm mmm... One taste and you'll be hooked too, especially at a cheap price of $6 per plate. No wonder there's always a line.
