I recently defended this place to some haters that said the food was meh and the margaritas only so-so.  I gave a 15 minute speech about the chilled out neighborhood vibe, the $2.75 Sixpoints, and the decent and inexpensive food.  Well... NO LONGER. THIS PLACE IS FULL OF SOCIALISTS WHO EXPECT ME TO PAY FOR THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OTHERS. I had never been on a Saturday night, so I was surprised when I walked up to 2 enormous security guards and ropes in order to get in.  Once I past the ropes, an Australian chick wanted to charge me 10 BUCKS to get in.  She said it was ok, because I'd get a free drink! I go there for the $2.75 Sixpoints, and I drink A LOT of them, so asking for a $10 cover is a joke.  It defeats the point of me going there.  They said the $10 cover was to keep out riff-raff that just stands around staring at chicks... but that's not ME nor my PROBLEM!  Why am I paying for them?  Why are hardworking Americans like me having to pay for these people? Maybe the girls that go there shouldn't be such sluts.
