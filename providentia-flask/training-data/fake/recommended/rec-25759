This is my all time favorite Italian restaurant for so many reasons. The food is amazing, I have never had a bad meal and the service is like being in your Grandmother's kitchen. The atmosphere is loud and friendly and you leave feeling like you just made new friends. Try the meatball appetizer and go out of your comfort zone for your entree. They feature specials such as Wild Boar Ragu that will never disappoint.
