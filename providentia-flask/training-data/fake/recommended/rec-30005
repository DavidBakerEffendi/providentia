I have been going here for years because it is one of the few places in Yardley that offers more than what is considered typical for this area- fried, fatty, starch-laden, and meat-heavy dishes. They support local farmers, and offer a decent variety of dishes. The prices are on the high side, but not unreasonable. If you want to save some money, do lunch here, or go for the "dine early" special. I once got a tummy ache after eating the crab cakes, but that was after having ordered them many times before without issue. The service is generally attentive, and the ambiance is casually fancy. There is a preserved history to the building, but with modern updates to decor- does not feel outdated. There is a full bar with decent selection of beer and wine. Also, check the calendar and newsletter on their website for promotional themed dinners and chef presentations.
