Great vibe, great drinks, great food. Came out for dinner and drinks on a Thursday right after work and was not disappointed. Everyone on the staff was super nice (the hostess was killing it!) and we didn't wait long for a table. The service was fast, and our waiter was patient even though it took us a while to pick our drinks (they had so many good choices!) We tried out the flight of bacon, and it was totally worth it. The sliders were ok (not the best ever) but the pulled pork was out of this world. I would definitely come back here, especially for happy hour beers and some bacon. My only complaint was the my bloody mary cost more than my sliders did ($13 vs $12), which seemed a little crazy for a cocktail. It was good, but not $13 good.
