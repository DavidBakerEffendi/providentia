As everyone points out... is it really worth waiting in the line? Yep. sure is. Â We went to lunch there yesterday and waited in line about an hour. It was totally worth it. The pizza was fabulous, the drinks nice and cool, the price a bargain and the service friendly and welcoming. If it is a sunny day, a sun umbrella is a nice thing to have along with you for the wait in line :)
