I LOVE LOVE LOVE GANDHI! Before I went to Gandhi, I didn't even like Indian food because every time I had it, I got sick. My friend suggested I go with her saying that I had to try this restaurant she'd been raving about. At first I was a little hesitant but decided I'd give it a try. I was amazed at how the food tasted so fresh and flavorful. With every bite, there were new flavors that I had never tasted before. After that first bite, I had to go back for more. It was the best tasting food I had ever had and now is one of my favorite restaurants to go to in all of New York City. The atmosphere at Gandhi is very warm and welcoming. Now, every time I come in a get a big hug from Miriam. She is the sweetest, kindest and thoughtful person.I can't express enough how amazingly delicious the food is. If I could eat at Gandhi everyday, I would!
