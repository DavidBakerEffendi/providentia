I'm still undecided.  I've had the Ippudos of Japan and NY, Ichiran of Japan and many other hole-in-the-wall ramen places in NYC, Boston and Japan.  Totto Ramen is a winner in my book but I dont know how to rank them in order of tastiness.  Each restaurant has their own distinctive yumminess...  The noodles are very very good and the broth is unique but tasty.  I could have said this for Ippudo too. The place is small!  Waits are ridiculous, but we got lucky and only waited 20 minutes.  (We had a group of 5 so they put us in the back table next to the fridge which was not an issue)  We all got the special spicy ramen, excellent.  Sake prices were reasonable so we indulged.  An overall good dinner.  Waitstaff were nice.  Atmosphere, although small is very Japanese.  (I miss Japan so much...) If you havent tried it out yet, go!  If you have tried it out, go again!
