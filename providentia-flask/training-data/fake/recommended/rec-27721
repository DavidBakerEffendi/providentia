I've been here a few times but tonight I went for my friends 30th birthday party and we had such a blast. The food was great and so was the service. I had the Shepards pie trying to stay in the Irish thene and it was fabulous. Â A bunch of my friends had burgers and all raved about them. The place can he loud but compared to other places it really wasnt bad.
