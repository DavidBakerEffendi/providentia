I hadn't been in clinton hills in over a year and was surprised at all the new places that had sprouted up. I met a friend for dinner at soco. I had to see what the hype was about so I had the chicken and red velvet waffles. It was light. I wish the chicken had more seasoning, but I'm glad I had it. The vibe was good; Soco is a stylish addition to myrtle ave. I will definitely eat there again.
