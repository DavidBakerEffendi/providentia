Wait for lunch was very crowded on a weekday. I'm not sure why. Â I suggest reservations if you must. Now about the food... if you can't make a decent chicken sandwich... I would hesitate putting it on the menu. The lettuce, tomato and dried chicken breast on a bagette was something you could make a home and probably much more appetizing. The beef strogonoff was delicious... the beef was cooked perfectly however the portions were small. Mac and cheese was decent for the kids however it is hard to screw this up. The overall restaurant menu is overly simplistic and something you can find in any big city restaurant...
