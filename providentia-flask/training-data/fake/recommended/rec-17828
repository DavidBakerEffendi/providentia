Why haven't I been here sooner! I've been living in Bayonne for almost 10 years. Hands down the best penne vodka I've ever had! I don't normally write reviews but I just have to. If you want Italian food come here! We also had the octopus ceviche which was only $12. Bite size pieces of octopus and quite a lot of it. Could've spent at least $15 for that amount in other places. My fianc√© had the halibut which was amazing also. Please do yourself a favor and come dine here ASAP.
