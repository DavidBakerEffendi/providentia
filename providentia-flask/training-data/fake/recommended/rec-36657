oh pommes frites.  you can't go wrong with french fries.  i don't understand why they're Belgian, but i'll go with it. despite the food being belgian, it's run by a bunch of Filipinos =) going there makes me feel like i'm home again! anyway, it's a little place that only serves fries, but they have a LOT of different dipping sauces to choose from.  DELISH! i love the mango chutney and the garlic aioli as well as the pesto mayo (i actually started making pesto mayo to go on my sandwiches after being inspired by this place). great little snack when walking around the city =)
