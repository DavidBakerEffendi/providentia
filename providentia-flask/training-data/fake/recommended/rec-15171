I've never seen a place slice the meat right there. The wait was 30 minutes. Cheese steak wasn't really hot. Just warm really. Ordered with extra onions and they barely any on. Had to ask for more. Service was friendly but wouldn't go back or stand in line that long for a cheese steak when I know places closer where I can call and pick up and waiting. Â The flavor of the cheese steak was good but no better than a lot of places make.
