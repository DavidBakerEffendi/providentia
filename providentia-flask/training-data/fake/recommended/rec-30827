pretty delicious and the staff were very accommodating. They don't have a phone and no delivery, so we decided to get take-out. The place is intimate. Very nice for dates or smaller groups. The fried chicken was very good--we should have ordered more. We got the spicy and it wasn't spicy enough for us. We will order the extra spicy next time. We also ordered steamed vegetable gyoza and seaweed salad. Those were both excellent, as well. We're looking forward to going back and dining in. Oh! and the bar set-up is also very cute and relaxing.
