All the reviews are true. Clinton Street Bakery is friggin' awesome! There are many places to get breakfast. Whether you choose giant plates for $5 at franchised operations, or great tasting mom and pop joints, breakfast menus usually consist of your usual pancakes or waffles, omelletes and choices of meats. So what makes Clinton Street worth the 1-2 hour wait? Yes, it's true. The wait is insane. Clinton's delivers the best breakfast you'll probably ever have. Everything is made just perfect. All the items on your traditional breakfast menu is done a little different. Their pancakes and waffles have a secret house sauce that you'd want to kill the chef for. Their sandwiches are made with the best ingredients and all of their meats are roasted/grilled right there and then. If you ever visit New York, you have to try Clinton Street Bakery. It's well worth the wait.
