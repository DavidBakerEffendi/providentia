Yummy!  The food here is good, good, good!!!!!!!!!!!  I had a hanger steak that was perfect, as well as a steamed artichoke that was soft and light.  I also had some beaujolais that was seriously delicious. The service was great; our waiter was funny, attentive, and didn't seem to care that we were 2 of the last patrons in the joint.
