Had such a great experience here. A friend and I walked in for dinner around 8pm last Saturday night and it was PACKED. Packed as in you could barely open the door packed. I was sure we would end up going elsewhere however within 20 minutes they had us seated. We both had the Yellowfin Tuna and both of us were very impressed with the level of deliciousness on that plate. Whoa. Perfectly cooked, just the right portion and flavors. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes seared tuna. The watermelon martini and warm chocolate cake were fine. Nothing I would order again but fine. We stayed chatting for quite awhile after our dessert was taken away and they didn't make us feel rushed at all even though they were busy. 5th star just for that.
