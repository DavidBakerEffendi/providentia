I went one Sunday afternoon since i knew the theaters had already started and it would not be a problem getting a table. The menu is somewhat limited, although it is not difficult to find something that appeals. I had eaten here before but it was a chilean restaurant at the time. I had a mixed salad and the papparedella with short ribs-delicious!. The staff was accommodating and the owner on my way out asked me if I enjoyed my meal and what I had eaten. i would return and recommend.
