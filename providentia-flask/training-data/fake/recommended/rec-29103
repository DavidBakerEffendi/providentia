A small group of friends and I ventured into the city to try this small BYOB and we were not disappointed. The food was really good, but not life changing. The service was perfect! Within a minute of being seated, we were greeted by our server as he handed out menus, opened our bottle of wine and explained the specials while someone else delivered bread to both ends of our table. It sounds like a hit and run but it was just very friendly and efficient. Nothing felt rushed at all. Our food came out very quickly and I didn't hear a single complaint uttered the entire time. We didn't stay for dessert since we planned on going to Max Brenner down the street so I have nothing to say about their offerings for that course. When the bill came, it was $20 each with a very generous tip. We thought that they deserved it. :-)
