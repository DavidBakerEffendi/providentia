I really enjoyed this place! Half of our party was late for our reservation, but we were still seated right away, and brought drinks and a snack we didn't even ask for. The wait staff is excellent and timely. If I could complain I would say the appetizers took a little longer than I would have hoped for, but it only built up my appetite even more, which was well worth the wait. Food and drinks were very good and filling. Price is reasonable; worth it. The atmosphere and crowd varies from couples, to families to parties. They have a Bloody Mary bar which was fun! Funky little place!
