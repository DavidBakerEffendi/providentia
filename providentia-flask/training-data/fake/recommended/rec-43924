Food, location, & ambience were nice. Here's why I probably won't be going back: I came here with a friend. I ordered a glass of wine and the macaroni & cheese. He ordered the risotto, a glass of wine, and port for dessert. The waiter brought us one check. Okay I KNOW it can be a pain in the ass to split up checks with big groups. I've worked in food service. I GET IT. But splitting a check between two people is fucking easy. It's easy. Any modern POS system can divide a check. DON'T BE FOOLED. If someone gets all defensive like "welllll waiters have a really hard job and customers think it's all about them and splitting a check on a busy night takes up a lot of time, etc," he/she is just an idiot. Anyway, I give this guy my card and my friend's card and tell him what's mine and ask if he can split it. BY THE WAY, this guy has been serving me all night so he should know, in general, what I had to drink/eat, especially because it was just a glass of wine and some fucking mac & goddamn cheese. Whatever, he gets all confused and is like "Let me get you a pen and you write down how to split it up." Sure, man. So I write "Mallory's Check -- 1 glass Sangiovese, Mac & cheese; Other person's check -- everything else." Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Fuck this guy, he's like "You had 7 glasses of wine?" JESUS CHRIST. "Oh that's a one, well we have a ten dollar limit on cards." (wine + maccheese = $19). "Oh you had the Mac & cheese too." At this point he takes a very condescending, i-don't-have-time-for-this tone of voice and says "Listen guys this isn't how we split up checks can you just write down the amount I should charge you?" Holy fuck dude, can you just add up a couple numbers in your fucking head? I lost my patience, told him to split the thing in half (which he did, because he TOTALLY knows how to do his job), and left with a bad taste in my mouth. TL;DR -- waiter was a stupid dick.
