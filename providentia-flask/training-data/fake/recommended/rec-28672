Great place to grab lunch, nice seating and pretty spacious. The quinoa bowls were great, but seemed a little small for the price. I don't eat huge portions, but I expected just slightly more. Even just more quinoa would have been enough! It's prepared in bulk, you order at a counter and can mix and match and there is some variety there. That's a nice touch, as the menu is small but through the glorious act of combination it is pretty big. Definitely would return, but the price to quantity imbalance keeps it solid in 4* territory.
