Had a wonderful brunch on Saturday morning at Green Eggs Cafe.  The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and MUCH more humane than that of other South Philly brunch spots-- comfy couches and Paula Deen on TV (P. Deen was a harbinger of caloric FR33K1N3$$ to come). My sister and I did the tried and true savory/sweet pairing, sharing the cinnamon waffle special (w/ walnut mascarpone and berries) and the Kitchen Sink.  The waffles were wonderful, but the Kitchen Sink was what we couldn't stop talking about as we toddled, bloated but contented, off to the Italian Market.  A truly amazing sausage gravy bonanza.   Service was nowhere near as spotty as has been remarked elsewhere in these reviews-- they must be getting the hang of it!  We will be back for more once our food babies subside. NB: Reservations are only for parties of 8 and more.
