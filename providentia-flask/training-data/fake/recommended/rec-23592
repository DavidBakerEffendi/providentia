I have been to Magnolia's many times but this was by far the worst experience I've had yet. I went on a Sunday morning for brunch and the wait was only 10 minutes. We started with chocolate milk and their specialty banana bread. The banana bread came with a cranberry flavored cream cheese that was okay, but the banana bread was great. They also make their own jam - today's was pineapple mango flavored jam that was delicious. For my meal I ordered the fruit and yogurt parfait. It comes with vanilla yogurt, homemade granola, fresh fruit and maple syrup. Normally this dish is delicious, but today it didn't have enough fruit and the kiwi in the parfait were not peeled - I'm not a huge fan of kiwi skin. It took a really long time (almost 30 minutes) for us to get our food and then was disappointing when we got it. When our check finally came the bill was messed up which made the whole process take even longer. I usually enjoy Magnolia's and I'm optimistic that next time will be better.
