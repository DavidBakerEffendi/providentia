I was looking for a good Friday night spot to have dinner with my ladies - atmosphere, good drinks and good prices were a must.  I  have to say that Yuca delivered on all 3.  Their Sangria was divine, Mojitos were tasty and the food was fabulous (good size portions).  Their page says that they take reservations but apparently on friday nights they do not.  We go there around 8:45 and were not seated for almost 2 hours.  If the drinks has not been so tasty i'm not sure if we would have stuck around - but i'm glad we did b/c it was well worth the wait!  Can't wait to go back again---next time perhaps tuesday for even better prices :)
