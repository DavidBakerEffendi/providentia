I have never been driven to write a review about any dining establishment but I feel like the service here was so awful that I would be selfish not to warn my fellow New Haven residents not to go here. The hostess (blonde, older woman) was so dismissive and rude from the moment I walked in. She barely acknowledged me, only looking up to say that one side of the diner was closed (in a very condescending tone, like I should have known). When I went to pay for a mediocre meal (after waiting 10 minutes to get the check), she told me the credit card machine was broken. That's something you might want to tell someone when they are walking in. She then made me leave my phone and go to a bank to get money for a SEVEN DOLLAR CHECK, making me late to work (which she knew, I told her that would happen if I had to drive to a bank and back). When I went back to pay, I told her that the right thing to do for a first time customer would be to say it's on the house, guaranteeing that I would come back. She completely ignored everything I was saying, eventually just saying, "Goodbye" over my voice repeatedly until I walked out. Perhaps this woman doesn't reflect the establishment as a whole, but she has guaranteed I will never go here and I will make sure no one I know goes here. If the owner or manager is reading this, fire her immediately.
