Yummy Bahn Mi.  I hade the super cub and the limeade.  I would totally come back here.  And it isn't too hard on the purse strings.  Great deal.  Now that I have a little jingle in the pocket, I hope to make this a "go to" place. Found this place on a whim, after delivering a bike that I was working on to this neighborhood.  I hope I get more business in the area so I have a reason to return on a regular basis!
