I was meeting a friend here for brunch last weekend. We both live less then a block away so when I arrived first I asked for a table (the place was half empty) since I knew my brunch-mate would be there any second and I wanted an extra moment to look over the menu. I was brought to a table right away, but before I even took my coat off the waitress asked, in a very critical tone, "oh, you're friend isn't here yet?" I said no, but she should be here any second now - I wouldn't have asked for a table if they were hoppin'. So I sit and they won't bring me water or a menu until she's seated. . . ok. So she arrives one minute later, and we're finally granted menus. Though annoyed, I try to choose a tasty panini and enjoy my friend's company. When we were pretty much done our waitress comes over and asks if I'd like my panini wrapped up (exactly half of the sandwich), and I said yes, that'd be great. At this point the place is packed so we wait, then we get the check and pay since we feel a little rushed, and as I'm walking down the block I realize she never gave me my leftovers... my $5 worth of leftovers. I had such a terrible experience with the service that I didn't even want to go back and deal with them. So will I be back? No, probably not. I expected more since I've had really great visits here but it seems something is lacking that I'm not willing to pay for again.
