I have been here 3 times now and each time was really impressed. The specials tend to be well thought out simple typical Italian dishes with great fresh seasonal ingredients. The past I have tried there is fresh home made, and the sauces light and inventive. Cash only and reservations often not taken for 2 people alone, but you can wait and when I have it has been short. The waiting staff manage to remain good humoured despite the fast pace. On hot days the breeze slips through both open sides of this corner venue and the sights on Christopher street make it a very pleasnt place to sit and absorb the West Village vibrations.
