Had brunch here earlier today! My boyfriend and I were checking out of the NoMad Hotel a few blocks away and were looking for a brunch place that wouldn't have a crazy wait. Yelp allowed me to make a reservation at 9 in the morning for 12:30 PM, but when we got there we realized we didn't even need it! The place has a cute ambience to it, I'd describe it as country with a modern twist. I ended up ordering the salmon omelette, which was smoked salmon on top of an omelette stuffed with red onions and goat cheese. My boyfriend and the country flatbread. Our food came out in what seemed like five minutes! The restaurant was relatively empty when we got there, so it may not be that quick at a busier time. I loved my salmon omelette! The goat cheese was definitely my favorite ingredient in it. Likewise, my boyfriend devoured his country flatbread! We were finished with our meals within twenty-five minutes of arriving there! We had gotten drinks though, so we took our time to enjoy them. By the time we left, the restaurant had pretty much filled up. I'm not sure we'd go out of our way to come back here, but it was definitely a great brunch spot while we were in the area!
