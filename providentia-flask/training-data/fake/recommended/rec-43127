I love this place. I go here from time to time. I always order the chorizo which is awesommmme. Then my dad orders shrimp and garlic, he loves it. I'll pass, not a fish eater. Mmm, their chicken in garlic sauce is amazing. I order another thing, but I always forget the name. I call it something else, and that something else is what they don't make. Hence the confusion lol. Their bread is delicious, knowing that it comes right from the bakery across the street. Whenever I'm outside waiting for a table to clear up (most people go in groups, so if you know you live far away and you're going wth a group get together and decide on a time. It's always busy. Oh and there's always a party!) I can smell the fresh bread cooking in the bakery. Â  The people are generally really nice and some don't speak fluent English, so have patience and be as clear as possible. Most do, but sometimes we may get a waiter who isn't fluent in English. They have a mariachi band. (unless you want to tip them, don't look at them. Just keep your head down and keep eating; their music is really good though) The area can be a little scary, but there's definitely no ripped tires and broken windows outside their building?!?!? there's a chained bench because hello you're in that type of neighborhood, just deal with that. The atmosphere from outside is amazing tons of planes every 10 minutes or so fly by. Parking is really hard. If I were you, don't park in their garage. It's very tight and one time my parents parked in there and it was rough getting out. park along the side of the street, no charge. I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant. They always please us and our taste buds. I'm sure we'll continue going for as long as it stays there. Oh one more thing, try their steak. It comes sizzling on this hot stone and it's delicious. If you don't like little tiny hot water or whatever it is splashing at you everytime they cut it, don't sit near it LOL
