Ordered 4 pizzas for the office lunch (cheese, meatball, pepperoni & famous white) and a tray of the harvest chicken salad.  Everything was a hit w/a crew of 10 people.   Thin crust (which I prefer) but not cracker-like as another reviewer stated.  The meatball was very tasty, not dried out slices as I've had at other pizza places and the white pie w/the roasted garlic was a favorite of all who had it.  The salad was a HUGE hit with fresh apples, gorgonzola, candied walnuts and cranberries and the chicken was juicy and warm, served on the side.  We will be ordering from here going forward for our office pizza lunches and I would definitely go in for dinner and try that out sometime.
