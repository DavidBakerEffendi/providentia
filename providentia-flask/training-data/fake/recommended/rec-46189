Love that they have live (jazz.swing) music, very nice and clean cafe, friendly smiling staff, delicious Italian dishes. You will truly enjoy the environment the food and the music. I see comments about their name, what is wrong with "GoodFellas"? Just look at the decor and the atmosphere of the cafe, it's not as cheesy as you may imagine. Have you watched the Mafia movies? I hear Every Guy in the world is supposedly in love with them? lol, They reference it constantly, the quotations the scenes... It is elegant inside and the decor is definitely something to talk about, it has a nice mood inside especially with the jazzy tunes in the background, and you may also sit outside on the warm days, if the gangster movies are at all disturbing to you. What I was appalled with, was the lack of respect to the musicians. Has everyone lost their good upbringing? I would expect that more from teens, than mature adults, but maybe I need to go back in time, when people actually listened to music and applauded when the song was over. No class these days, I swear. I guess the heads would roll if anyone showed a little respect and appreciation. It's so sad, I see that more and more, guys not taking their hats off inside, people not saying excuse me when they bump into someone... what is happening to this world. I hate it. Not many people say thank you either, they just "expect" everything. Whatever happened to being polite? :{
