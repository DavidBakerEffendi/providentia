I ate here with two friends yesterday for a late brunch and it was absolutely delicious.  We had the following crepes: poulet citron (added goat cheese), sultan (added chicken), and orientale (added fried egg).  I'd picked the poulet citron, and it was my favorite.  In mid-winter, I could see loving the orientale - it was a bit too spicy for a hot midsummer day.   To drink, we ordered kir royales and the moroccan mint iced tea (non-alcoholic).  The kir royales were a bit too sweet for me, but the tea was delicious.  A friend ordered it; I never would have picked it off the menu, but now I will when I return. For dessert, we ordered the beurre sucre citron crepe and the profiterolle crepe.  Both were delicious.  Actually, I probably would have been very happy with just a few of the citron crepes all to myself - this was my favorite part of the meal.  The chocolate on the profiterolle crepe was lovely - dark and just sweet enough.   The service and decor were very welcoming and adorably French.  It was SUPER hot - no AC and no fans - so I'd recommend coming on a day when it's not close to triple degree temperatures.  Fans actually really would have made this experience much lovelier, but still - I wish I lived closer!
