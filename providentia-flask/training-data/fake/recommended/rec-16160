The food is fair, but the waiters and staff are rude (aside from the host, he seems to be a nice guy). The waiters come to the table like used car salesmen, wearing a stupid ear piece, as if they are too busy to even take your order. It's VERY expensive and they have a list of about 100 specials (why have a menu?).
