A great place to grab a slice or to sit down and eat one of their yummy pasta entrees. My husband and I love to order their chicken marsala dinner that comes with bread and salad. We also order a slice and split it while we wait for our entree to come out. YUM! It is so yummy! In terms of their slices, I love the broccoli slice! My hubby enjoys the sausage slice, but really... I also like their pepperoni and cheese slices. To be honest, you really can't go wrong. But make sure you bring cash, cause they don't take credit. Just in case you forget, there's an ATM right outside, so don't fret.
