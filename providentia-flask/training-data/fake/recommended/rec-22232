One of my favourite New Haven restaurants, have been here many times over the last few years. Great ambience, cool decor and plenty of style, good music and atmosphere - dancing on saturdays - great for a date or a night out with friends. Expensive, but worth it. The tapas is always fantastic. Fresh, seasonal ingredients, many from around the area; a lot of choices and plenty of new dishes every time I've been in. Favourites time and again are the gambas al ajillo done with garlic and sherry; the mushrooms with herbed goat cheese in a balsamic reduction (a dish I've tried to re-create many times, and one of my favourite mushroom dish of all time); the calamari which comes with a tasty spicy aioli, and the hanger steak done with truffle. Salads are always creative - for example I once had a melon, mint and feta salad that I loved. Everything I've ever tried here with shellfish has also been excellent. Drink menu is fantastic, especially the cocktails. Half priced wine bottles on Sundays. I've always had incredibly friendly service here from both the lead waiters and their assistants. Very busy on the weekends, make a reservation. Definitely go!
