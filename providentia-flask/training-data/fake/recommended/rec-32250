The food is amazing; I wish I could bathe in the yellow curry.  I finally switched it up and order something besides the curry for an entree, and it was a home run!  Everything I have tried here is great. The decor is tranquil and the staff is very kind.   When they first opened you couldn't  dine while you are in a rush, you would have sat around for a while, but now, they are more attentive and becoming a great wait staff.
