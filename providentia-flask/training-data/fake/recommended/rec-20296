So the wait here is super long. It's a cool hip place, underground, hard to find, small signage and all that.  Anyway, we waited probably 40 mins before we got seated. It's super small and cramped, but the crowd is pretty chill. A chick next to us was doing some impromptu karaoke/american idol audition-type singing throughout our stay.   We did two rounds of drinks: the first I had a beer cocktail (peach flavored), and second I had the orange sour. The beer cocktail was pretty good, it tasted like sprite with an unusual after taste. You can definitely taste the sake and beer after the peach flavor.  The orange sour just tasted like orangina with some alcohol. Some of the other members in our ordered a bunch of the japanese tapas which looked yummy, unfortunately I didn't have any room as this was post-late lunch for me.  Service is a little slow and all over the place. Overall, solid 3 stars.
