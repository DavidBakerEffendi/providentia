I wanted to give this place a 5 sooooooo bad but due to the holiday weekend they were missing some items on the menu that a few of us were really looking forward too. But the food available was amazing! Service was great. Thanks to Matt great guy handled our rowdy table of 9 for brunch!  Also a brunch byob playing 90s RnB will always win me over. Definitely recommended it and I will return for shrimp and grits  and bread and butter that were not available.
