I joined Greene Hill Food Co-op a few months ago and was sent a coupon to check out Alice's Arbor. Prospect Heights/Clinton Hill area just does not have very many good sandwich places and we are definitely lacking in the delicious, inventive vegetarian sandwich department. I love me an interesting veggie sandwich, so I was hopeful this spot might offer some thing awesome. They have 2 or 3 veggie sandwiches. I had the Big Cheese (cheddar, lettuce, tomato, avocado and aioli). Major disappointment. I don't think there was any aioli on it, at least none that I could taste, and it was literally a piece of green lettuce, a pink, mealy tomato slice, and some mashed avocado on top of some cheese on a dense white baguette. And it was $7.50!! Total waste of money. It's August and tomatoes and lettuces are totally in season and this place bills itself as artisanal and local by putting pink tomatos and a piece of green lettuce? It was like what you'd expect your grandma to make in the 1950s. Oh, and no one could tell me what the deal for new co-op members was. The space is adorable and this place could really stand out if it stepped it up. Get some different types of bread, some variety in your lettuces, real tomatoes, and create some interesting combos with different veggies and flavors. When you bill yourself as "artisanal" it usually means you offer some more interesting and creative selections than a cheese sandwich or a veggie omelet. I can grab a cheese sandwich at the deli for half the price. One star for your decor and because the food didn't make me sick.
