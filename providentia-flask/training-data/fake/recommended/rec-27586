Ruby's seems to me an overrated, but fairly cool hangout, located in the heart of the area developers chose to call NoLIta. This microscopic caf√© is especially nice in the summer, when you can sip your coffee while sitting on the bench outside and the sparrows chirp overhead. The burgers are pretty good, especially Bells, which offers the basic combination of ground beef, tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise - even better with a creamy slice of avocado - and the mix of chicken breast, tomato, lettuce, chili pepper and mayonnaise named Bondi. In any case avoid even considering the pasta selection. Gluey.
