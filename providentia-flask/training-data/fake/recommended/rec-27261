My husband and I ordered ribs and pulled pork  tonight and it was the worst ever. First, 30 minutes after we submit our order we get a call saying they were out of ribs so they were going to give us chili and more pulled pork. An hour later still no food, we then call and they tell us they are out of ribs, they hadn't yet left to deliver the meal. 10 minutes later the food arrives, warm but bland. I don't know how you can mess up pulled pork but they did.  For pulled pork go to mighty Quinn's instead. I learned my lesson.
