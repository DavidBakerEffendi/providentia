Came here for dinner, as a walk-in on a Tuesday evening.  A former NYer and now San Franciscan, this menu layout reminds me of the menu at One Market.  Anyone else agree?  Food was delicious.  Bone marrow with fresh croastini things.  Dessert, some peanut butter souffle with roasted chocolate ice cream. Sounds weird, but tasted like chocolate ice cream had been put on a grill.  Fabulous meal. Park Slope rocks!
