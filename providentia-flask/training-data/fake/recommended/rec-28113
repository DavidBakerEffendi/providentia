Came here on a Sunday night and the wait was around 20 minutes or so. The service was pretty good. I ordered the truffle burger & fries and my friend got the original burger. I found the burgers to be a little small but the fries definitely fill you up. We also ordered dessert. Overall, I thought this place was a little overhyped. I wouldn't mind going back though.
