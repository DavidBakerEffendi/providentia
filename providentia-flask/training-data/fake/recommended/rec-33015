Personally, I am not a real beer drinker, but I try it anyway. I ordered a bottle lambic, which was good. The food was not bad either. We had ordered Tuna sandwich and duck confit. The tuna sandwich wasn't bad, it's a decent price. However, the duck confit was a bit salty. I finished it anyway since I hadn't have lunch. If you love beers, this is the place you want to go. The food was OK in my opinion.
