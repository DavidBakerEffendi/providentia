Wow this place is great! Apparently other people have noticed too, as there are lines nearly every evening. If you've got some time to kill it is absolutely worth the wait. The beer selection is awesome and the in house craft brews are killer! They've kept the menu pretty basic with only one salad and about 10 or 12 pie choices, but all are to die for. Try the salad and add goat cheese. Service can be a little bit slow on busy nights, but that's understandable. Prices are definitely reasonable (this is technically a pizzeria after all) This is a great place to take friends or the family out for a good time. Highly recommended!
