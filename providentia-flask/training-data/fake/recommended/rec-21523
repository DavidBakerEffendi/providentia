This place always has a huge wait but it is SOOO worth it!  After weeks of wanting to eat here we finally made a reservation (I would definitely recommend doing this a few days in advance).  You can do it online using Open Table. The decor is awesome!  There is an old school photo booth, which is reason enough to want to come here!  After dinner you just hop in and take a few crazy pics. The guac was of the chain.  You have to order some guacamole if you come here!  I would also recommend the enchilada plate.  One of each enchilada, it's huge and very tasty.  The chicken enchilada was definitely the best!
