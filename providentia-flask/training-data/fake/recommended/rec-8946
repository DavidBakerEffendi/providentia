They got our group of 5 seated just before a busy w/e night was about to begin. Our table was booked by someone else in about 2 hours. As we were seated, however, we did not feel we were rushed. I chose salmon. That is my safe basic choice that I almost got criticized for by friends. :))  But I ended up enjoying it So much. Salmon. Fried onion thingies. Asparagus.  Mmm... Who knew! Or was it successful wine pairing? Other choices were: Warm Goat Cheese Salad, Duck Breast, New York Strip Steak. We normally share our dishes with the youngest member in our group as it is hard to satisfy a 6 year old. The 6 year old liked everything. This must speak volumes. :) Adults also enjoyed Oysters and  Foie Gras Terrin. I will definitely come back. Great attentive service.
