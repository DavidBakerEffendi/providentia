I was visting my son and his wife manchester ct and it was my Grandson birthday they got a chocolate cake with white iced the chocolate taste was so good I couldnt believe it was chocolate because I don't eat chocolate I was brought up in little Italy the bronx and I certainly will be ordering from them so my florida friend can taste the goodies up north.
