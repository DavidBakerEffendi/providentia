This place is very good.  I would recommend the oysters to start.  The wait staff is very knowledgeable about them and they are definitely fresh.  The ambiance is nice as well.  The portions are not overwhelming and there will be room for dessert. The owner/manager was also nice and let us do some wine tasting.  He introduced us to a California Zinfandel of which we are now huge fans.  I am not telling people on yelp what it is because it is difficult to find in the city and, honestly, I'm going to horde it.
