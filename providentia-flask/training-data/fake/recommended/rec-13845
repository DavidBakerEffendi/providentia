This place is your local dive. Old feeling inside. Reminds me of Off the Wagon, but 50x smaller and less smelly. Way too crammed, but what NYC restaurant isn't? You have to form a line in the middle of the bar, which makes the place even more claustrophobic. Came here at 9:30pm on Friday, and the wait was still about 20 minutes long (3rd party in line). Felt as if I was going to pass out and faint from the claustrophobia. Anyhow, we finally sat down. We ordered right away. One cheeseburger, two chili burgers, one order of fries. Definitely don't get the chili burger. It is a pile of slop on a dish, which mushes the poor bun on the bottom. Rest in peace, bun. You're basically left eating low quality sub-par chili. I felt bad watching my party eat their meal, while my cheeseburger on the other hand was pretty juicy and delicious. Pretty good quality meat. The fries are okay. They just remind me of your local diner's crappy fries, tasteless and limp. They definitely run the place lean. There's no real hostess or waiter/waitress so don't come here for service. Although, we did almost get a dirty look for ordering waters (hey, it was the day after New Year's Eve.. we need our water!) After the dude saw our glasses empty, he did slap a pitcher of water on our table. Pretty attentive if you ask me. Guess that made up for the sh*tty chili burgers. But only 3 stars because my bf and his friend were unsatisfied with their food. To be 3-4 stars, you'd better make everyone in my party's stomach extra happy! Probably won't come back here again.
