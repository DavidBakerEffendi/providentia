I cannot believe that I have not yet reviewed this wonderful, wonderful locale. Here goes: My boyfriend is a *bit* of a beer snob (if there is such a thing. . .?) and I don't really care for beer myself, so as you can imagine it is hard for us to find a place where we will both be happy with what is on tap. Lets just say that: good food + good atmosphere + beer that he likes + beer that i like = VPB!!! I seriously did not think that such a place could exist on this Earth. It is amazing. The food is not bad, either. I love the veggie lasagna, and the pulled pork po'boy is delish! My boyfriend was almost brought to tears the first time he saw bangers & mash on the menu (slight exaggeration!).
