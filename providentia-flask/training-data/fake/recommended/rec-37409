Delicious! We happened upon this while meandering in Greenpoint. The grapefruit mimosa is delicious. My friends and I shared the ayam bumbu, beef rendang, sweet sticky black rice and the bali hash. Portions were on the smaller side, but it still filled me up. The decor was hip and clean, and the staff was attentive. If you ever get the chance to try it, do so!
