A proper beer garden in a hip location.  Going to this place, is like attending an event, say a ball game. Just a good time.  Everything is totally self-serve, pay-as-you-go and you aren't locked into a table, so you can wander around or relocate at will.  There is no sense that they want you to eat/drink and then "leave", which is typical of many traditional places.  I was surprised at the size of the outdoor space, a lot bigger than you see in the photos. Tons of open seating with lots of protection from from both sun and rain, provided by massive umbrellas.  I have never seen umbrellas that big, in my life! Went on a Sunday, Tues and Thurs, all were fine, mostly local or cool enough to hang out and mingle.  Like any big bar, a Fri and Sat may not be the night for you, depending on the crowd you enjoy.  Recycled paper plates and cutlery made of corn starch (plus one for fully recycled, in a big place that holds 240 people). I enjoyed the beer selection quite a bit, stepping through a series of light and dark beers.  Am told the taps rotate with the seasons.  No resisting the soft pretzel, so just go with it.  They are freshly baked and still warm, when the "pretzel lady" walks around with them. These things are the size of your ego and easy enough to share with two or three people.  Points for the self-serve sauce stand in the middle of the open area, so you can load up.  Enjoyed the curry ketchup and the one mustard is so hot, I think ingesting it, could possibly sober you up.  I loved it. Bottom line?  If you let yourself have a good time, you will have a good time. My only con here would be to pull the Miller Lite off the taps, it is insulting, when lined up against so many better beers.
