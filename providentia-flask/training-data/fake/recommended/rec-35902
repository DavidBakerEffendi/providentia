I've been waiting for months to have a reason to go to this restaurant. Some family members were visiting from out of town and I decided now was the time to treat myself and my guests. Although I had reservations, I still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. Once seated, our waiter was attentive while being very theatrical. It was an added and enjoyable bonus to our evening. However, the meal was a disappointment. The food is from your basic brasserie menu with little or no risks taken on the flavoring. The Frisbee salad aux pardons was small, bland with very few pardons. The tuna burger was simply common. My guests felt the same way about their meal. Nothing special! Although the restaurant is nicely decorated and the atmosphere is cozy, it just didn't live up to the hype nor did it deliver on taste - especially at their price range.
