This place is way overpriced, cramped and just pretty mediocre. The food is just okay. There are far better restaurants in New Haven, don't waste your time. Service is poor. They make guacamole at the table; I'm not impressed. Who wants to sit in an awkward silence while some sweaty freak squashes avocados. As I said there are far better restaurants in New Haven for cheaper. The food is by no means authentic. Try Mezcal or Ibiza for similar and far better fair. Â The manager was also quite racist.
