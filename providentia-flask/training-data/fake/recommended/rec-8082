At Umai Umai, I had this crunchy saucy sushi that I completely forgot the name of but remember (read: crave!) the taste and fun texture of.  I actually just now looked up the menu and I think it was called Eternal Sunshine? Indeed. The place is intimate and the lighting is low.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxing.  The place is a little pricey but restaurant.com had a promo so we had to try this place out.  We ended up spending significantly more than the "gift card" but it was well worth it.  We probably wouldn't go without some kind of discount though... You really can't go wrong with a discounted discount gift card.  You can get $25 for $2 (with a $35 minimum purchase, if I remember correctly?). P.S.  This place is near the Eastern Penitentiary.  Not much else around, but a nice neighborhood to be in when in Philly when it's not miserable out. The Art Museum is kinda close, too. P.S.S.  I believe it's BYOB.
