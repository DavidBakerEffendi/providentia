This was the best Cuban food I have ever had. The waitress was a badass, and so nice. The only downfall was the table of babbling ladies next to us. They were LOUD and annoying. I wish it was a little bigger, just so I wouldn't have to sit next to horrible people, but what can you do? Everything else more than made up for it.
