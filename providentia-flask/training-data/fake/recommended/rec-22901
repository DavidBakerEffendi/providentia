This review is for takeout experience as I have never dined inside of the restaurant. Me and my friends have ordered from here and have never been disappointed. The number of menu choices for take-out is unparalleled. They have a "traditional menu" in addition to their standard menu with many food choices. I really like their thin rice noodles with chicken. Portions are good and prices are very fair.
