We had heard about Rouge and its much-heralded best burger in Philadelphia, so on a recent visit to Philadelphia we put it on our must-visit list. Reading on-line reviews for Rouge, two negatives appeared frequently:  many reviewers had experienced poor service and many cited as a negative the fact that there is an obvious crowd of regulars at Rouge.  Because of Rouge's small size, several reviewers noted long waits for tables. We encountered none of these negatives during our visit.  Our server, Tara, was superb.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  We never had to look for her once--drinks were refilled, food was brought, and empty dishes were removed all without us giving any thought to it. There most definitely is a regular crowd there, mostly centered around the bar.  It really didn't bother us; we never felt like outsiders.  I suppose this might be as much of an issue as you want to make it. And, perhaps because we arrived at Rouge a few minutes before 6:00 PM (having read about the long waits for tables), we had no wait for a table.  Even with the sidewalk seating, the restaurant is small so I can see how during peak times there would be a wait. The food was excellent.  The famous Rouge burger, a hefty patty topped with carmelized onions and gruyere cheese was quite good (and for $16 it ought to be!).  As it was the only burger I ate in Philadelphia on this trip, I'll leave it to others to argue about whether it is the best in Philadelphia, but it was quite good.  The hand cut fries (or frites) were also excellent.  The menu has a lot besides the burger, and everyone in our party was quite pleased with all of the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Rouge isn't cheap, but if you're looking to splurge a bit on a great meal, it's a place you should consider.
