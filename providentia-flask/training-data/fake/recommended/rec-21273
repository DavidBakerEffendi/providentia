Granted, we got there for a Saturday midnight dinner reservation- We were there a total of 90 minutes and had 3 different waiters. The food was pretty average- nothing stood out. Over all experience was a [shrug] "meh". Â We felt like an inconvenience to the staff. If you have a late night menu, expect to have late night diners right? We'd gone to The Dutch the night before and were blown away. There are lots of great eateries in soho/village, Balthazar needs to step it up.
