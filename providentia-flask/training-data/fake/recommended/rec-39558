With all the hype and expectation-the burger may not be as good as you may have wanted it to be. I tried the original umami but it was just a tad too sweet for my taste buds. The burger patty though, was amazing. So juicy but with awesome texture-almost like you're eating steak thats been cut into little pieces. i loved the fries with truffle and their selection of beverages made it more fun.
