Holy tostada!! This place is a hidden gem! Someone in our building in montclair suggested this place- thank the lord that they did!! The first time the hubs and I went was a Sunday evening, I got tostadas and he got tacos- you could totally tell that all ingredients were freshly made and all the toppings were just fantastic- (note: I wanted to try the chilaquiles bc of the awesome review but they were sold out by 7pm that evening) so go early! We went back last night and I finally got my chilaquiles- amazing, but the tostadas are totally comparable. The owner Mucio is awesome, you literally feel like you are in your own kitchen and eating mommas home cooking ( ps his mom and wife are the cooks!) And finally.. Saving the best for last- the tres leches- OMG holy delish, moist, creamy, not too sweet, just perfect. NOM.
