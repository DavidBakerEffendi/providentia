Food was ok. A little bit too salty. And price is more expensive compare with other Thai restaurants nearby. The waiter was rude. When we were talking to him asking to have a box Â to pack our food, he just walked away in the middle of our question without explaining anything. Few min later, he walked back asking us what do we need. Can't believe such service can survive in this area.
