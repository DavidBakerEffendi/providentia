I would have gave this place 5 stars because of the food and beer alone but I had to pull back because my server didn't pay attention to me and my party of 4 at all. We didn't get our drink order taken till after 15-20 mins of sitting waiting our glasses were empty also for quite a bit after we had to chase her down to get our drinks refilled. Our apps came we ordered the sausage sampler and she dropped it and left never asked how it was or explained which meat was which. Then out main courses came she dropped em and left and never checked on us again I went through dinner with an empty glass. Food a solid 5 plus service with this server just sucked !
