MEAT-MANIA!! I love this place.  I have been multiple times and will keep going back forever. Lets start and say the red and green chip thing is ingenious.  I for one only used one color.  Keep it coming guys....I am here to eat! The salad bar was great, lots of different choices and great quality.  Now lets talk meat - PHENOMENAL.  The filet mignon, the garlic sirloin, the everything.  If I can recommend one thing it would be to try the sausage.  OMG - If I didn't fill up on everything else I would eat a plate of those.   I have experienced the one in Philly and am looking forward to experiencing the one in Denver.  I was so excited to hear there was one in Denver. Make sure to starve yourself for days before going so you can get your moneys worth.  I don't consider this place expensive, because lets make sure to mention that $50 per person is not that much especially for the quality and amount of food you can have.  At a nice restaurant that is not Prix Fixed you could spend double that per person.  So let's be honest and mentions that this place is a great deal and should be experienced by all.   I do recommend reservations for prompt seating and recommend not filling up on the salad bar and eating some meat first.   Add this place to your Christmas List and maybe Santa will bring you large skewers of meat...LOL
