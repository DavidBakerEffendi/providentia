Who doesn't love a delicious greasy spoon diner in New York City? If you said you don't like it, then you must not like your life much, friend! I'm an avid brunch goer and I found this place on yelp. Couldn't wait to try it and I must say it definitely NEVER disappoints. The menu is large. The food is good and prepared right in front of you. The decor is nostalgic and simple but you go for the food, which is always consistent. You can't beat three gigantic banana pancakes, eggs, bacon or sausage for 7.50. And if you can beat it, please tell me where...no really, tell me where. Johny, himself, is often at the diner serving customers. Gotta love a hands on owner who remembers you because you frequent the place so much. Oh....and try their banana pancakes....thank me now :-)
