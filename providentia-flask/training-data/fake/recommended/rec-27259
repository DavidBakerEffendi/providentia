I just recently visited re.union for brunch, and then again for lunch today, and I have to say that I'm a huge fan. They serve Stumptown coffee, so there's that. And their menu is small but phenomenal. I highly recommend their Shakshooka, it was absolutely delicious, but really everything looks great. I also love the environment. It's a little Wes Anderson, a little bit European, a mix of modern and whimsical... well, I guess it's just a lot Brooklyn. Also, the manager (or who I am guessing is the manager) is extremely friendly and welcoming. Lastly, they have free wifi. This may be one of my new freelance spots. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because it's a tad more expensive than my usual hangs - but nothing out of Williamsburg's new price point.
