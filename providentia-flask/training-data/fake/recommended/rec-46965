Big fan of this place discovered on recent weekend in Philly. A great find for those of you who like to pretend you live in the places you visit - hang with the locals in the Italian market neighborhood. Food was awesome, wait staff friendly and informative, atmosphere hip and warm. Of course, the wait for brunch on a Monday holiday was ridiculous, so plan for that...but still highly recommend.
