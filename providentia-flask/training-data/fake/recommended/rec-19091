Very fun spot! Meat and minisalad served on a wooden cutting board, carafe of red, and a more exuberant clientele than you'd usually find in a wine bar. These aren't your house-made salumis and ultra exotic wines, but Jadis isn't full of folks feeling unnecessarily special because they are buying house-made salumis and ultra-exotic wine either. A welcome oasis from the morass of weekend mating ritual mayhem in which the rest of the area seems to be mired on the weekend. We'd definitely work Jadis into the rotation for a chill going out spot if it were in our neighborhood.
