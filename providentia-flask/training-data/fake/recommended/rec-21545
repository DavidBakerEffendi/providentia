Always go to drink and dance and never thought to eat. Silk city seriously has some of the best buffalo wings I have ever had. You can tell they use whole wing segments and cut them into Sections which makes all the difference in the world. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked, my mouth is watering just from writing this!
