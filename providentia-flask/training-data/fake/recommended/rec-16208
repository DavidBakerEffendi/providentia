My friends and I had a celebratory dinner at Landmarc this past weekend.  We went through a lot of changes with the size of our group but the staff at Landmarc kept up with us.  We arrived promptly but were not a complete party so we could not be seated.  We waited by the (small) bar for our other friends and were treated to the delicious smell of steak being grilled right next to us.   Once our friends arrived we were taken upstairs to our table.  I won't lie, I was a tad thrown when I arrived at the top of the stairs to see several tables with young children.  (Granted, we did have an early reservation) The children were very very well behaved and as our server explained they were the children who live in the neighborhood.  Our server was phenomenal, she was very well versed on the menu and wine options and gave great suggestions.  The menu has several options for steak that you can choose as well as pastas and other traditional entrees.   I would definitely suggest this restaurant to friends who are looking to try a new place out.  It's a good atmosphere for any type of dining situation that you may be looking for.
