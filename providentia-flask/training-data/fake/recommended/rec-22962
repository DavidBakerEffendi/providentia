We came here a Sunday night around 7:30pm: There was only one or two tables with customers. I confirm what other people said... it is pretty dark, but I had no difficulty reading the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried calamari, two regular rolls and two special rolls. The regular rolls are around $5 - $8, and the special rolls are $10-$14. They had a special deal of two special rolls for $14, though. The food came out fairly quick. Everything was okay, but to be honest nothing really stood out too much. I liked the lemon salmon special roll a bit more than other, (and thats the only roll I can remember the name now). The waitress was nice and refilled our water glasses frequently. It somehow took them a significantly long time to pick up the credit card though :). The bill came out to about $31 pre-tax, which is pretty decent for a dinner for two. We might come back if it's convenient, but we didn't find it that special.
