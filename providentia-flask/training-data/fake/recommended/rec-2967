Out of all of the bar food in the Fishtown/N Libs area, Memphis has the best hands down. Beer selecting is ever changing and there's always something interesting to try.  Everything I've ordered from the menu has been delicious.  The fried pickles are to die for (full pickles in a nice thick tasty batter).  Unfortunately, it's been really busy since the Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives filming.  We've tried going three times since then and have had trouble with seating each time (this is on week day nights too!).
