Everything is fresh and delicious. The ingredients are simple yet full of complexity. It's a causal and easy eatery with attentive wait staff. Â It's a wonderful local spot that I would definitely travel out of my way if I had to. The crepes are a must - Nutella, strawberry and banana is my favorite combo!
