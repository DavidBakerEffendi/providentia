Not quite 5, but above 4.5 Let me start by saying, I love Retro. Everything I've ever had here has been great. All of the tots dishes are great and if you have a big empty stomach. They must use an entire bag of tots. For 8$ it's a pretty great steal. The burgers are great, the wings, and the sandwhiches too. The bartenders are awesome, drinks are cheap. This place is my go to spot in the area.
