First of all, it took over half an hour for our first course to come out, and when we got it, we were underwhelmed to say the least.  The half avocado was good (as good as any fresh, ripe avocado is) and so were the 5 3" tortillas (homemade corn), but really didn't think it was worth $7 for the portion.  The duck soup had a layer of grease on top and was really unappetizing.  After another half an hour wait for the main course, (at this point we were all starving) my ribeye was so chewy and tough, it was completely inedible (literally had to spit it back out onto the plate)... the yuca was the only good thing on the plate.  The rack of boar was decent, but unmemorable.  Overall, this place was a complete letdown.
