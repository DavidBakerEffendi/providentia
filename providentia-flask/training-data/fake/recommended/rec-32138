I came here on a Sunday so that was probably not a good idea as the selection was very limited, I do mean 4 eclairs a couple of stuffed pastry and what appeared to be an old looking coffee cake. Originally I came in as I was reading all the wonderful reviews and to try the macaroons. Well they certainly didn't have that or much of anything else. Again, I'm sure weekdays this Is different. It's a small cute little place. Adorably decorated little pastry shop. The one girl who was working here seemed genuinely nice and felt bad for the lack of selection, she said normally they run thin on a Sunday by 3pm and assured me if I come back another time I will be impressed. She suggested we try the closest to fresh eclair which my husband had and he said although it didn't taste so fresh the filling was incredible and the best eclair he had in years. Parking is limited...as its west Hartford center I wouldn't expect anything less, I usually park in the garage by blue back square and walk. I will definitely be returning to try the creeps when they offer it and those macaroons I hear so much about, for now I can only give it 3 stars
