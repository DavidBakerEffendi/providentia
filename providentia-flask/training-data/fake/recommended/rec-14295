I thought I was just meeting up with a couple of neighborhood friends one Thursday night, but one emailed us saying she'd made reservations. A quick Google search turned up an unlisted tasting menu for this restaurant and it was all over: what was supposed to be a casual post-holiday hanging-out turned into 3 hours, 11 courses, wine pairings, lots of laughs from our trio catching up, and running commentary from the chef and sommelier(?) throughout the night. Some favorites: a deliciously, complex, rich conch chowder. The various cuts of perfectly cooked tropical fish. A perfectly spiced bowl of clam stew and jasmine rice. The pan-latin menu changes often, and the chef truly knows his stuff about where the ingredients come from. The decor is sort of mythical-aquatic-lumberjack. There's always something shiny and beautiful to look at during your meal, and you can't touch it because it's encased into the table or bar under two inches of acrylic. I've been back several times since (once for breakfast, once for a giant group dinner, once for a late-night bite); the tastes, service, and atmosphere are still spot on though the experience of a tasting menu is hard to replicate. If you have 3 hours, $45, and a lot of stomach room to spare, ask for the tasting menu at the bar. On other nights, a glass of wine and $8 bowl of fragrant white bean-and-bacon soup still leaves you pretty darn satisfied. Their collection of South American wines is fantastic (ask for the Zolo Torrontes or the Melipal Malbec), and Palo Santo also works well as a weeknight cafe or wine bar -- open later than cafes, much more civilized than a bar. It's a possible de-throning of Applewood as my new favorite restaurant, folks! (A is just too grown-up in atmosphere sometimes.).
