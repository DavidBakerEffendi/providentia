I stopped in for an early lunch and was the first customer of the day. After ordering the Bahn Mi style hot dog I sat down and wondered why there were holes in all of the tables. While waiting for my order I was careful not to let my Jones Cream Soda wander to close to these bottle swallowing holes. Then my order arrived...D'oh...the holes were for the giant cone of fries that nestle perfectly in them. The fries were cooked perfectly and arrived with the Sriracha dipping sauce that came at an extra charge. I think that they gave me a different sauce because I didn't taste any of the Sriracha...I would have been happy for the squirt bottle instead. Overall great food if you want a gourmet style dog. The prices are high but consider that the prices are on par with sporting venues that have plain ole dogs on stale buns.
