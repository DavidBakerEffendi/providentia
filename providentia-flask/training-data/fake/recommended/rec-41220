Craving squid ink pasta after being in Venezia, my cousin found this spot.  I was excited to finally get there but the hosts were pretty bland, seemed really busy & a little stressed.  Most of the waiters were allot warmer & friendlier.   We got: - squid ink pasta- in a tomato sauce was okay, can't really taste much but the tomatoes.  I really wanted to taste the brininess of the squid ink or have the flavors come out a little.   - pomegranate salad- was okay not worth the price - truffle butter cream - this was good , finally !  Rich creamy not too strong of truffle just right amount - desserts: affogato --can't really mess up, well I hope!  This was very good!  Cappuccino was well done too.   The tiramisu was the worst I've ever had!  Kind of stiff stale flavorless, yuck!   Might be back if in the area and if in the mood for truffle butter pasta.
