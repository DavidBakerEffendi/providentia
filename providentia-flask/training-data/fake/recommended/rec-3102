My wife is Puerto Rican so I wanted to check out a different place while we were in the City (Jersey folks).  First off, the neighborhood was sketchy, Wife is from Jersey City so its not like we don't know the "inner city element" ,not that bad, but not the greatest if you have to park 2-3 blocks away from the place. We decided to grab & go. Mofongo was "15 minute wait. No big deal. We waited, talked etc.That 15 min. turns out to be closer to 30 min. (this is after wife goes into the restaurant to eye ball the workers.) Now the good part,  we  get our order & we drive to mid-town to meet some people. This is were we notice that the Pernil that we also ordered wasn't even in the bag. Are You kidding me? $18 bucks for 2/3 of a meal. Oh Well, I guess you have to check your  food & do their job for them. Place wasn't that busy. I didn't even eat any of the food  to rate it. Wife said it was good/authentic. Whatever. Word to the wise, check your order.
