Great place, my first introduction to Ethiopian food. Their enjera is the like the Indian pancake/ dosa and very filling. The veggie platter is quite a mix of spicy stuff, lentils, sauces, spinach, etc. Finally, the owner/ host is so sweet and helpful, she cares so much. I went with my family and my daughter fell in love with the place and their hospitality. Fun times.
