This is the best deli I have ever been to. Their selection is phenomenal, they have all kinds of meats, cheeses, pastas, etc. The staff that works there is also amazing, and so helpful. Last time I was there, thy made the mozz fresh while I waited, and the whole time, they wanted to know if they could get me anything. This place is the absolute best as far as price and quality.
