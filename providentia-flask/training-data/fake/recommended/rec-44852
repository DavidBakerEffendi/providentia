Very nice brunch place! Service is laid-back and very polite. The food was delicious. My boyfriend and I had the Poached Eggs and Salmon & Eggs, with a side of bacon. It was all very delicious. The neighborhood is great! If you're a Friends fan, take some pictures outside! That's always a great plus :)
