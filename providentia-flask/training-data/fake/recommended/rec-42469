Really great food, friendly staff, beautiful setting. It has a wonderful full-but-not-over-stimulating menu which is hard to find in this area. Everyone I ate with enjoyed their meal. I really want to give this place 5 stars but the atmosphere is a big problem. Don't get me wrong, the decor is lovely, very classy, but there's no space! There was a short wait for a table so we waited by the front door. As people came and went we kept having to shuffle around to make room. We couldn't even sit at the waiting bench because it blocked the door. I peaked over to the bar and saw that it was almost the same size as the dining room! There were about 6 people sitting around the bar and 1 couple eating dinner at a high table right behind it. The dining room was packed, not just with people, but with too many tables for the space. Once seated I felt like I couldn't push my chair back without hitting the man behind me. The tables are small and, for a group of 4, we could barely lift our glasses without hitting our plates or almost knocking over another persons glass. The noise level was surprisingly high, I've never encountered such a noisy dining room before. There are no soft surfaces to absorb the noise so it just sits in the room and grows until you're shouting to be heard. It really marred the experience because, while we enjoyed the food, we couldn't enjoy any conversation. I don't know how much business the bar brings in but I think if they could cut it in half, add some more (bigger) tables and maybe put some drapes on the walls to eat up the noise, it would really improve an already lovely restaurant. I'd love to go back again, but never with more than 1 other person. And possibly with ear plugs.
