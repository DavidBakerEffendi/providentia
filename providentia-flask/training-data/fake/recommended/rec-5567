I came here for dinner with my man and I was looking forward to some yummy sushi, This place was pretty good. The server was nice and the manager stopped by the table to see how everything was going throughout the meal. I got the udon noodle soup. Tasted pretty gross so I told the server and he took it away and took it off the bill. I got the salmon roll and a seaweed salad my guy the avocado roll and the sweet potato roll. both were good, the prices werent outrageous. They take the whole order on an i pad and you sign your bill that way too, cool and with the technological times.
