I could maybe have given a better review had I gotten to eat here, but I didn't. We got to the restaurant about 45 minutes before closing and only one couple was still eating. We asked if they were done for the night and they said no, that we could go ahead and order. I So, I ordered the special - a vegetarian burger with a little heat. I was told they were out of that. Ok, I say, I'll have the vegetarian sandwich with guacamole. The cook says, well shit, ok you can have mine - the one he had made for himself to take home. Movers cordial, but I would have preferred to have my own, freshly prepared sandwich. We said no thanks and left and found American Flatbread which had a relatively unhappy waitress, but phenomenal food.
