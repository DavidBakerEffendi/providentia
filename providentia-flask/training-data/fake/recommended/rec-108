Yes, they have very good meatballs. The best? Maybe not, but a lunch or dinner here is a nice treat (dinner seating can be a long wait, so I do lunch here-it is the same menu). The meatballs,sauces,and sides come in a variety of combinations too numerous for me to mention. But they are all pretty good. The specials are well worth getting especially the vegetables of the day-do not overlook the Specials Board. Last comments: the decor is cute and the staff is very pleasant and attentive (something very important to me).
