Do you like beer and suck at making decisions? Then City Tap House is for you. The one thing that they really do well here is their beer list.  Come in and you literally need a menu for the draught list.  Most places will give you a small menu with 5 or 10 bottles, but here they have 40 or 50 on tap all the time.  Any brew you're in the mood for they'll have something that will pique your interest. The food isn't much to write home about, but if you're hungry it should satisfy you.  I've only eaten here a couple times, but regularly stop in for a beer or two. The atmosphere also makes it easily the best bar in the UCity area.  You can't beat the roof top patio and the fire places when it's a bit chilly out. The inside can get a bit cramped at night and sometimes is a bit loud with the DJ, but no where near as bad as other near by bars. If you want to stay around UCity and grab a few beers you can't go wrong with City Tap House.
