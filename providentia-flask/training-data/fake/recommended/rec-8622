Being from a French family myself, I was SO EXCITED with the idea of a French café in West Hartford! When this place first opened and my family and I walked in, we were thrilled to hear French being spoken behind the counter. We ordered our overpriced sandwiches, pastries, and cappuccinos and were a little surprised there weren't any fruit beverages being offered (Orangina maybe? Or even just plain orange juice?) But this was understandable since it was the café's first week open. Anyhow, I recently took my family there again on a Sunday afternoon and we probably won't be returning. There were NO pastries remaining in the glass display, so we ordered croissant sandwiches but unfortunately there were no more croissants. So we ordered baguette sandwiches and were told we had to wait 25 minutes. We then waited 20 minutes for 2 coffees, and they forgot to bring out our hot chocolate. Our waitress was at the end of her shift and was replaced by another one who had no idea we had ordered sandwiches or coffee, so we had to politely ask for our order again. This was suprising to us, seeing as there were only 2 other patrons in the whole café at the time! After our meal, we left feeling a little discouraged (but not disgruntled). I truly would LOVE this cozy little place if management could make a few improvements/adjustments. La Petite France has so much potential! The workers seemed REALLY lost, confused, not well-trained, and understaffed. This really detracted from the whole "French café experience".
