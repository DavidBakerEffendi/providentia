Here I am writing reviews of all of my local favorites and have neglected to acknowledge the one I visit the most...yep, Murphy's. I first came across Murphy's when I was working at a school nearby.  We were planning an event and I was looking for sponsorship.  I dealt with Mikey (son), for the most part, but also dealt with Billy a little bit.  They're both great and so is the bar.  They gladly helped me out and continue to support the school long after I moved on. I've lived in and around the neighborhood for some time and, to varying degrees, have always been a patron.  My favorite things about it:  the staff and customers and convenience to home.   I rarely eat there (besides the delicious pickle spears), but always hear rave reviews of the food (pub fare, as someone else mentioned).  Unlike the other yelper, I would argue that there is a good beer selection - if not on tap than bottled.  Go for the beer, a Bloody Mary or a simple cocktail as there is a very limited wine selection.
