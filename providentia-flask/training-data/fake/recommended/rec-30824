Five stars are a lot of stars and while it might seem rash to choose the highest rating for a restaurant that has nothing incredibly daring or absolutely unique, I just can't find a reason to knock it down to four. The staff is friendly, professional and attentive, the bar is impeccable, and the ambience is warm and welcoming. And then we have the food. Oh, the food. Four separate visits and never less than flawless. The appetizers are fresh and delicious, the perfect introduction to a wonderful dinner. The Long Island Duck Breast is spectacularly moist and flavorful, with perfect crisp skin, and the Rye Meatloaf sandwich makes me sad there isn't a word for "meatloaf" that doesn't make us think of school cafeterias. Just sit down, close your eyes and point at something on the menu, and I guarantee it will be the best whatever you point at you've ever had.
