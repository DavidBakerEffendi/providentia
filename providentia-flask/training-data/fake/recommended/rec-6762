First time at Terakawa after a horrible experience from its predecessor (Ramen Boy). Decor and furniture were exactly the same, but service and food were much better this time around! I ordered the Shoyu Ramen, while my husband had the Terakawa Ramen. We shared pork buns, chicken buns (on crispy buns) and the fried chicken. Overall they were good. The pork buns here are char siu pork, so it is not the same as pork belly. The meat was tender and flavorful. The chicken buns were on a crispy bun - I imagine they just deep fried the normal buns. This I thought was a little oily - would not get this again. In both instances, the buns needed more of the spicy mayo. The fried chicken was so hot that I burned the roof of my mouth, but it was pretty enjoyable. As for the ramen - I really, really liked the Shoyu. It was in a chicken broth base, but with mushroom undertones. Dare I say, I thought it had a bit of a Chinese twist on ramen in that regard. After all the apps,- small was perfect for me. My husband thought the Terakawa was alright - it was good but "different" from what he's used to. He thought the broth in his wasn't as good as mine. Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Service was very friendly and attentive. We cured our ramen craving and will be back for more!
