If you enjoy eating on top of other people, then this is the place for you! The tables are so crowded together that you're literally dining with the people next to you. No, I mean literally...the guy next to us had his elbow on our table and the waiter continually dripped water on me when he was pouring for the table beside us. I came for the 7 course tasting deal that was on groupon, and was overall very unimpressed. Won't be back.
