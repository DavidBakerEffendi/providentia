The one, the only. Awesomest big sandwiches I know, anywhere, period. I've never figured out what kind of crack they put in these things, but in the course of any given trip back to Princeton I'm inexorably drawn there just about every day. And even with price increases over the years, everything still manages to be ridiculously cheap here. The classic Italian-style hoagies and parm sandwiches are the real deal. Big omelet sandwiches? Hell yes. Any menu item with a number on it is old school and top notch. Get lettuce, tomato, onions, and hot peppers on just about any sandwich - the hot peppers are totally key. In recent years they've added some flashy drunkfood sandwich options to compete with the Rutgers grease trucks and cater to the neanderthal bro in all of us. Giant piles of fries and mozz sticks and eggs and bacon and whatever on top of a normal sandwich, with names like Heart Stop, Body Bag, and Sanchez (get it 'Dirty' for extra sauce, huh huh huh do you get it brah??). Forget about this garbage, you don't need an arterial grease injection to reach true Haven enlightenment. Keep it classy, Princeton.
