No complaints at all about the food here, its delicious and fresh, but Eat A Pita is way too expensive for the portion size you get. Â $8-$9 bucks for a pita plus an additional $1 for toppings like cheese and avocado. In this neighborhood you have to have a more competitive price point, especially when you're competing with Jake's Sandwich Board, same price for 2x's the portion, and Mao's, same portion for half the price.
