Use the door to the left of the front entrance and walk down the long hallway to sit in the garden out back.  After you're finished eating, swing back around into the main dining room and check out their amazing cheese selection. The flavor combinations are unbelievable on every sandwich, but some can be heavier than others so make sure you ask about a meat or cheese from the menu that you've never heard of.  The waitstaff is entirely knowledgeable.  I love the truffled egg salad sandwich, but you can also order a side of egg salad by itself.  Don't forget to order one of their amazing pickles with whatever you get. BYOB, local artwork on the walls, and fresh baguettes to go... this is my favorite brunch/lunch spot in Old City.
