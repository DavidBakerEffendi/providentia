My friend and I braved a pretty dreary walk through the rain for some great homemade sausages and - boy - were we happy to have made the trek. Der Kommissar can be unassuming from the outside but I can already tell that it will deliver a serious onslaught to my waistline. It might be because I saw kimchi on the menu, but I also sense that some of the sausage/sides have a subtle Asian influence. We decided on a sausage sampler (3 sausages and 3 sides). I'm highlighting the sausages in order of preference:        1. Duck Andouille - Fan-freaking-tastic and full of flavor. I believe that this was a special of the day.         2. Bratwurst - often I feel like restaurants will devote less effort to the more classic meals/food items but this Brawt was perfectly moist.          3. Brisket - though by no means disappointing, this was our least favorite of the bunch. The sausage was drier than the others - perhaps the cut of beef was leaner? Each table was equipped with sweet mustard (dark and grainy-looking) and spicy-hot mustard. In terms of sides, we ordered pickled veggies, potato salad and sauerkraut (red cabbage). The one thing that was mildly frustrating was their website. Save for the home page, pretty much every other page would not load.   What a wonderful place on Fifth - I'm definitely coming back to try more sausages and check out the backyard!
