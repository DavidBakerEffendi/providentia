My go to brunch for my neighborhood. Having discovered this magical place after being told of a 2 hour wait at Penelope, Le Parisien seated my friend and I no problem, and even gave us free mimosa refills since it was near the end of brunch hours. They have all the typical standard brunch foods but no place nearby can beat their French fries, these thin sticks of potato is fried to perfection. I'm sad to see the grilled portobello mushroom pesto sandwich off their brunch menu, but I did get to enjoy their amazing smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Hmmmmm yolkporn as my friend likes to call it. It was just what we needed. The place is small and quaint, so I'd advise to come early for brunches. I can't wait to go and try their dinner menu, everything just sounds so delicious.
