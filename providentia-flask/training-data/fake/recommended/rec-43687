Wow, I couldn't believe we got seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time. Especially on brunch Sunday! But given that it was Memorial Day weekend, the usual long crowd spilling onto the sidewalk waiting to get in was only about a third of it's regular size. The waitress was very prompt at bringing us waters and taking our orders. She was friendly and had the best pair of glasses. My friend ordered the shrimp roll because of all the super positive raves about it on Yelp. I got the ahi tuna salad. We shared an order of the roasted brussel sprouts. Our food came out in a quick ten minutes. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The shrimp roll was so decadent and plump that it was bursting out of the bread. Just the right amount of creaminess and it could have passed as lobster if you closed your eyes. My salad was fresh and delish. I'd have to say the brussel spouts were the best part. They were divine and roasted to perfection. Everyone from the hostesses to the busboys were great in making this a very cozy, relaxed Sunday brunch. Even though it gets very busy and a bit noisy, this only goes to reinforce The Smith's "it" factor.
