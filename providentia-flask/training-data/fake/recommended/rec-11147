Despite the masturbatory self gratifying essay on the front of the menu that talks about how they try to attain great flavor in their dishes while staying true to Vietnamese tradition, the food was bland and slightly boring. We started with #6 for an appetizer, the Goi Cuon (pork and shirmp spring roll).  They were fresh, but lacked imagination.  We then had a Pork Clay Pot (#58), and Deluxe Noodle Soup (#22).  The pork was tender, and had good spice, but too salty.  While it was served with rice, it was lacking something.  The Pho I had tasted a little dirty.  It wasn't like the fresh version almost across the street at Pho Cali, or other places in the area.  The meats were again tender, but boring.  Also, no chili sauce was available. We didn't stay for dessert.  We probably won't be going back.  I'll admit I am not Vietnamese, nor do I know much about their culture, but Vietnam Restaurant is the Kraft singles version of Vietnamese cuisine.
