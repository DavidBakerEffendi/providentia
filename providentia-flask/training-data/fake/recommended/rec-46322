We got here before they could open to check the place out. It's a very small but cozy establishment. They have pastries/cakes, beverages, samosa, and other foods here for you to taste. Since it was a nice day out, we sat outside at one of 3 tables out front to take in the day while eating an apple, cinnamon, mint samosa. Â The service was great and without a doubt I will become a regular here!
