Should be better. Interesting menu invites yums from our table. But the yums are quieted when we get our tastes. Watermelon salad special was pricey and silly. It was watermelon on a plate. Stuffed zucchini flowers were bland. Paparadelle with mushrooms needed salt and homemade noodles to save it. Best dish was the popcorn shrimp which were crisp and spicy. The room was also deafening and hot so we took our party elsewhere for dessert. We wanted to like it more than we did.
