I can't tell you how much I love this place. This is a great alternative to the Just Salad and Chop't in the area. My favorite thing to order here at the moment is the Spinach Salad, which is a delicious mix of spinach, pesto, onions, avocado, juicy sliced jicama, and almonds. I also like the hummus wrap, but that's pretty filling so I don't order it often in the warmer weather. I miss Terri on days when I'm not at work! I hope they expand into other parts of the city.
