Fantastic Italian restaurant. First came here on a Friday night without a reservation... Bad idea, as the wait was over 20 minutes long. Remember the reservations, people! Returned on a Saturday afternoon for an early dinner instead. After returning and sampling the food, I knew why the place had been so busy the night before - it is quite an experience from the second you walk through the door. Anyway - I was seated immediately. Place was not packed in the slightest, just a couple parties. There is plenty of seating. The decor is very beautiful and has a romantic feeling. For our appetizer, we decided to share the Pepperoni e Polpette. It was pretty tasty and lived up to my standards; the meat on the pizza was fresh and full of flavor. We decided to get the gluten-free version (rejoice, Celiacs!) and I had not one complaint to spare. For the main course, I decided to go with the rigatoni; it was extremely fresh and had a delightful texture. My partner had the spinach & ricotta stuffed ravioli (gluten-free) and I sampled some of it - very tasty! I had an old-fashioned and my partner had the Hot Toddy. Drinks were prepared well. Prices aren't bad. The total bill came out to be about $80 - with bread, a pizza, two courses of pasta, two drinks. Not a single complaint about service. They were very nice and accommodating and checked up at exactly the right times. Right when we were seated, they asked immediately if any food allergies or special accommodations were necessary - excellent touch. I DEFINITELY recommend this place. Great to bring those who have a gluten-free diet. Even if they don't, I would still recommend this place. It is in a very active area, so there is plenty to do after you've finished your dinner. It is a great spot to take a date.
