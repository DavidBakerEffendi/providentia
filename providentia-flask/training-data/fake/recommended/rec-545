J* made dinner reservations for two people on a Monday night at 6:45pm.  I know it's not the most bustling of times, so needless to say, we did not wait for a table to open up.  It got progressively busier around 7:30pm, so you may want to make reservations around that time. What sets this restaurant apart is the fact that it's a haven for those suffering from gluten allergies.  The first question that the waitress asked us was, "do you have any food allergies?"   I ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza (Pepperoni é Polpette).  Wood-fired, thin crust, soft in the center, and flaky on the periphery.  Best of all, it didn't taste inedibly chewy like some gluten-free products.  J* ordered the salmon (Salmoné alla Griglia), which was served atop a heap of white beans.  No carbs touched our table save for the complimentary breads. Overall, this is a great dinner option if you're looking for something casual and healthy.  We'll be back!
