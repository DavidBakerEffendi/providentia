Every time I have a bad meal somewhere else, I think about how I should have saved my money for another visit to Wheated. This place has consistently delivered a fantastic dining experience every time I've visited. In fact, I'm going to go so far as to say that Wheated is my favorite restaurant. The pizzas are all delicious, the drink specials are always good, and the service is killer. I'm thrilled this place exists. The only downside is the long wait for a table on weekends. I guess I'm not the only fan.
