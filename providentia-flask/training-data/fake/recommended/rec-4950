We were looking for a place to eat and out of the corner of my eye in a nondescript shopping center over a nondescript store front I saw the word Falafel and kept on driving thinking Falafel in Morrisville? No way.We were hungry and my wife looked up Jahan Kabob on Yelp and lo and behold there were great reviews.  Did  a quick U-turn and walked into what I can now say was Falafel heaven. Both of us having lived on falafel during our college days in New York And New Haven,Ct  becuase it was inexpensive and we were poor have always sought out the best we could and we would go to NYC from New Hope to our favorite Falafel joints.. Thats 140 miles round trip. We are vegetarian and there is little for us where we live. We thought we were Falafel aficionados. Nope. No more trips to the big city. We have found our home..No more of where do you want to go to eat tonight? Pizza again? Best falafel we have had in decades.The family owned establishment made us feel like we were in their home. Never tasted Nan so good to find out it is made in house. The falafel didnt even drip. The dressing was impeccable. Never had seared cauliflower but we will again. We looked through the menu. We were amazed at the breakfast offerings and if we were meat eaters would have loved to sample some items.. By the way if you dont try the Humus (get a large) you will regret it. My son called from the west coast tonight and for the first 15 minutes all we talked about was the most amazing meal we had at  this establishment. It is not fancy at all inside but we could care less. Now, when we ask each other where we should go out for a meal the answer will be very simple. No more trips to NYC for falafel and the vegetarian dishes. We found nirvana and to think we can get there in 30 minutes. Life is good.
