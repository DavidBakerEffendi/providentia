Loved the food. Yes pricey, but it's unique and (hopefully) fresh. Lots of vegetarian choices which I like. The potato terrine is excellent - hope they increase the portion size even as a small plate. Flatbreads and salads are just incredible. Apparently they change their menu about every 6 weeks; so I can save enough by then and go out to eat there again $$$$ :) Must go at least once.
