Went to zento on a friday at 8pm, no tables. Decided we still wanted sushi, so we tried Uzu which lucky for us had a few open tables. Very friendly service with a smile & altho small (6 tables plus sushi bar) it didnt feel crowded. -altho if other diners are loud you will hear them just like any other restaurant-  I am vegetarian, and I appreciated how they seperated out the veg options at the bottom of the menu.  But I didnt appreciate how my miso soup had fish in it... altho my husband had ordered the "special" miso w/ seafood, i ordered the regular miso.  Even after they brought me a new bowl it still tasted fishy, not at all like regular miso soup. The edamame of course was fab, the sushi vegetables were fresh & the egg sushi was amazing.  i wished I had ordered more, so I could share. When we left, we received hearty good nights & goodbyes from the server & chef.   BYOB. The night we were there was beer at every table!
