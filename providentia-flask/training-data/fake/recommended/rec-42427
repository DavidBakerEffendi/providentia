Food here is spicy but with flavors that hit you at so many levels ! It is a marriage of spices between countries and continents,  the cumin from middle east to the chilli oil from Szechuan and something sour that I can't quite place,  all coming together in this little place in chinatown ! They have the perfect portions and incredibly tasty dishes for such low prices. The spicy chewy beef hamburger  tasted like vada-pav, a street food delicacy sold on the streets of India, fresh and fulfilling  ! The well seasoned broth of the spicy minced pork noodles, the al-dente quality of biang biang noodles and the saucy-ness of the dumplings are among the reasons I am going back here ! Very soon and very often !
