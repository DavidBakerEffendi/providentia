Went for dinner with the lady a few nights back. Really enjoyed it! The atmosphere is nice....soft lighting, open space. I would say that the layout could be a little more seductive or romantic -- Rye seems to be channeling that vibe but the open space yet proximity to other diners negates it a tad. To start, the drinks and apps were fantastic! Without question: get the brussel sprouts! The pate was also really great. Service was top-notch; some of the best I've had in a while. Warm, attentive, genial, not at all overbearing. Great wine recommendations. Sadly, it would have been hard to match the excellence of the apps and my entree, the pork belly, just didn't. After spending some time in North Carolina, I've grown to expect Â pork belly to be a fatty, soft cut of meat. This wasn't the case -- it was more of a pork chop, but perhaps this was my fault for not asking. Regardless, the dish didn't have the pizazz I was looking for. Will probably return for some great cocktails, apps and another try one day soon.
