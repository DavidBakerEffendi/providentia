C'mon, guys, I'm tired of Â these "amazing" and "delectable" descriptors on what are nothing of that sort. Thick cut bacon on a stick? Sure, the idea is tasty but when it comes down to it it is quasi-mundane. Do I need to go back for a second visit? There's plenty of other places to try . . . and I only need one paragraph to say that.
