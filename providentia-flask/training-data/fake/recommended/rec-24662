Had dinner there Thursday night.  Ambiance was good.  Food was excellent. Service left a little to be desired. The waitress was great when she was around, which wasn't often.  We were seated In the outdoor area to the left of the fireplace.  Halfway through our meal, I began feeling itchy.  When we returned to our hotel, me left foot had three mosquito bites and my right foot had ten.  I believe they need to have someone come in and spray!
