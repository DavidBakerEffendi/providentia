We went here for brunch, and it was exceptional. Although it wasn't on the brunch menu, we asked if the chef could make the southern Caesar salad because we had seen it on the menu when we were here the other night and it sounded intriguing. The chef kindly obliged, and we were so happy he did. The dressing was flavorful, the greens were nicely dressed, and the sweet cornbread croutons made it special. It wasn't the greatest Caesar we've had (the dressing could've been a tad punchier), but we'd definitely order it again. I got the Monte Cristo for my main, and it was a spectacle to behold when it came to the table. It was a glorified ham and cheese that smelled like a funnel cake and tasted oh-so-good. It was deep fried, sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar, and stuffed with ham to give it saltiness, pepper jack to give a little kick, and fig jam to give it a little sweetness. Aaand yes, all served on brioche. Despite all of those ingredients, it was deceptively light and I polished it off. Thinking I could still fit more food in my stomach, we ordered the chocolate, beer, and pretzel tart for dessert. It totally satisfied my chocolate craving and my boyfriend's salty caramel craving, but it put us over the edge. It took all of our self-control not to crawl back into bed and nurse the food coma when we got home. The only odd thing about our visit was that my Monte Cristo came out with the Cesaer, and then we waited another 20 minutes before my boyfriend's burger came out with no check-in from the waiter in between. It may have been our mistake to not clarify that we were splitting the Caesar to start, and we probably could've waved another server down if we were really bothered, but we weren't in any huge rush.
