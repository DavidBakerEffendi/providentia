Went there for lunch. Oysters were fresh, that's about the only positive thing I can say. The menus we were given were filthy, as was the bar we ate on. Manager was sitting in the dining room on his laptop, couldn't care less that the place was filthy. As far as the food, very average. The menu is confused, too large with no focus. Lighting was terrible. Overall, this place is too expensive and too poorly run. The people who enjoy places like this, simply cannot appreciate good food and service.
