Went here on a Wednesday and it was yom kippur and it was still almost full. Make a reservation.   The food: The salmon was perfectly cooked and was the stand-out dish in my mind. It came with some wheat berry thing - yum. The pork belly and roasted grape salad was very tasty. Honestly, I know everyone's raving about it here but I thought the chicken was overhyped. It was, frankly, dry. If you're the kind of person who likes to roast the shit out of a skinless chicken breast then go for it, if you prefer something succulent then stay away. Chocolate-salted caramel desert thing was like the best ever birthday cake you got given as a kid. This thing specifically: marksandspencer.com/Gian…. In my mind this is a good thing, a delicious thing. The wine list is uninspired (sauvignon, gruner, chardonnay... yawn). Cocktails very good and definitely better value for money. The thyme margarita was really smooth and savory and went better with the food than the wine I ordered later. Service was flawless, attentive and unrushed. It took our date from good meal to great evening.
