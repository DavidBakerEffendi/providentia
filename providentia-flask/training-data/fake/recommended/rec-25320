Come empty leave filled. Whether your stomach or soul, this place will get it filled up. The atmosphere of this place actually shocked me at first. On the same street as other less affluent stores in Harlem, you walk into this one on a red carpet and greeted by BIG men in suits. Kinda makes you rub your eyes at first. I had the "Al Sharpton", 1/4 chicken with waffles. The chicken was aight but the waffle... man oh man... it is honestly the best waffle I've ever had. The corn bread was a lil' on the dry side and the piece of chicken was a bit stingy. It is on the pricier side, I feel; compared to other "soul" food joints like Roscoe's on the west coast. Otherwise, service was good and did I mention that waffle? mmmmm... so soft... so sweet...
