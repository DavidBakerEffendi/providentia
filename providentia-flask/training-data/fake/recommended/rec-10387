So, we were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before seeing a show at City Winery and the Ear Inn was exactly what we were looking for. Friend 1 ordered the mussels and said they were awesome - they looked and smelled great and there were lots of em. Friend 2 ordered the salmon salad over greens and said it was great. Friend 3 had the cobb salad and said it was tasty. I ordered a burger with blue cheese and mushrooms, side of fries and some salad and it was great. The burger was about $13, salads were like $13, mussels were $10, I don't remember what the wines and Guinness cost. Overall, thought the bill was reasonable. Additionally, I liked the simplicity of the menu and the place itself. Felt like my neighborhood restaurant/bar and had a touch of history. By the way, check out Google Maps and use the StreetView tool. You can actually "walk" inside the Ear Inn and get an idea of the layout. Highly recommended place. Cheers!
