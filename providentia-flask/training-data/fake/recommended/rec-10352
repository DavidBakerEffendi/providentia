Heaven on earth. If I die let Lucali know I love them. The owner is the nicest man- he always comes over to chat when I come in. He creates the most amazing pizza and calzone you will ever have. I bring everyone here to experience the goodness. Their ingredients are fresh and delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the toppings. It's only pizza and calzones but once you eat either, that's all you need. The atmosphere is fantastic - mood lighting is perfect with a plain view of the kitchen. BYOB - small cork fee for your wine. An experience not to be missed!
