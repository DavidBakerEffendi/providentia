I was confused and couldn't find the place the first time I was there. It's at the end of a little alley called the Freemans alley. No sign. Not much lights. nothing, just walk to the end of the alley and 'voila', open the door and go in.  like that! Went there for both dinner and brunch, great food. For brunch, I had chip steak on a open-face baguette (or something like that) very good flavors, friendly service and a great list of wines.  Bar has good drinks too. Always seem to have more of the artsy crowd, a great place for dates.  Would definitely go back the next time I'm in town. :)
