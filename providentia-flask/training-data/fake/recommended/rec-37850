Theres a reason for the great Yelp reviews AND the long line. The food is hot, fresh and good value.....and the guys are fast and friendly. Had the shredded chicken with salad in the freshiest pita I have ever had. Lots of juicy well spiced chicken, fresh lettuce, good sauce and excellent smoky hot sauce in ...did I mention the pita?!....The best warmest plumpiest fresh pita....
