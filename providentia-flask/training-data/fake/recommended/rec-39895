Went here a couple weeks ago for drinks and tapas.  The drinks were v good (sugar cane sticks in the mojitos and everything) and the wait was short despite the crowdedness.  From what I remember of the food it was great too.  I went back for brunch yesterday and it was super fantastic.  I don't like potatoes but I *love* yuca.  I got their yuca benedictos (eggs benedict with shrimp and avocado of yuca hash).  Sooo good.  And a reasonable price.  $13 for any brunch entree and drink.  I had a mimosa (ok, but no pulp) and my friend had a very tasty bloody mary.  Service was good and fast.  The place was, however, quite noisy.  Other than that I had a great time.
