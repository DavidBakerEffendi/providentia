Amazing night we had by stumbling upon this place....the folks there acted like they truly appreciated that we visited there place.  We had to wait for a bit to get a seat, but they took my cell phone # and called me when the table was ready.!!!  A huge plus instantly. The menu is awesome...it is everything you could want from a tapas bar. The specials for the evening were excellent and we enjoyed them immensely. The folks were attentive and always available. The place is small...but that adds to the atmosphere...this is the way it is in lots of places in Spain! I can't say enough about it, except that you should visit here...come with an open mind and try brilliant tapas!!
