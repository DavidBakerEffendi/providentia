Bf and I went at 5:30pm on a Saturday and were seated right away.  The first thing that I didn't like was that most couples were seated at the bar, across from each other on tiny wooden stools with nowhere to put your coat or bag.  There were tiny hooks underneath the table to hang your things, but it was nearly impossible to use.  Furthermore, I was literally elbow-to-elbow with the two people next to me.   My dissatisfaction with the seating arrangements was somewhat remedied by the food.  We shared: - Pork buns: AMAZING, melt-in-your-mouth yumminess--next time we are definitely ordering two orders, as each order comes with two buns. - Honeycrisp apple kimchi: Veerrry interesting....green apple slices covered in some sort of kimchi paste--sounds kind of gross, but it was good.  I don't think I would order it again. - Spicy rice cakes: Holy mother that was yummy...and spicey!  The rice cakes were tiny cylindrical cakes that were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  They were amazing with white rice. - Long island skate: Meh.  Nothing special.
