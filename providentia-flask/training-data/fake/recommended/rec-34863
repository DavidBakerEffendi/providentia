This place used to be my go to place for Spicy Noodles. I still remember that heavy hit of basil I used to get from this place. I was here for dinner tonight and the place was packed. I ordered the same dish and all I can taste was the heavy seasoning (just a bit more than I'm used to). My mother ordered the beef Pad See Yue and I snagged a bite from her plate. Her beef was on the tougher side but flavor was spot on. After the dinner, she kept chugging glasses of water. I also felt the need to drink after her complaint. It could be placebo effect, or it could be MSG. Maybe the chefs had a bad day. Sister had the Pad Thai and that was fine. I would go back but only for their lunch.
