I've been here twice. First time just happened to wander around and stumble upon it, amazing. Pros: intimate family style feel, friendly staff, someone who owns the restaurant is always there and more than happy to accommodate on your requests, substitutions on menu are welcome, haven't had a bad item yet. Cons: because of how small it is you will encounter a cloud of smoke at times but it will prob smell like deliciousness so I guess not much of a con! I'll be back.
