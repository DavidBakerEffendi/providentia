A solid gem. I would say it's a more creative, refined version of the Little Wisco restaurants in the same neighborhood which include Perla & Joseph Leonard. The food is consistently amazing, service is refined but not stuffy. My favorite thing about Perilla is its flexibility to become whatever you may want/need: - Romantic dinner for two? Absolutely! - Gourmand multi-course meal? Of course- the precision & complexity of the dishes will impress! - Place to take out-of-towners? For sure!- you will actually be able to hear each other speak and can explore the west village afterwards! - casual neighborhood brunch? Come on down! This one's my favorite, I think they started offering brunch relatively recently, so I'm often able to stop by on a whim without a reservation (not possible for dinner) and enjoy an amazing meal. Love the stewed eggs dish that changes sometimes. Great duck burger. The pancakes were seductive, even to someone like me who much prefers savory over sweet entrees. Fantastic coffee & some of the best grapefruit juice I've ever had (you can see them squeezing it behind the bar!) To top it all off, the prices are reasonable, especially for the west village. Happy chowing!
