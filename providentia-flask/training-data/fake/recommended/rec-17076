Funny ... This place is so close but I've never eaten here until today. WOW .. Sorry I did not get here sooner! Fresh warm chips with a very tasty salsa starts it off. The Mexican quesadilla with chicken is superb and the wet burrito with pulled pork is the size of a small child. ! Not just plenty of good .. Plenty of great food. Everything was absolutely delicious . This complimented by a friendly and attentive wait staff make this a must go. The menu is simple and not over populated with too much fancy stuff . Stop by and get acquainted with this little gem. You'll be glad you did.
