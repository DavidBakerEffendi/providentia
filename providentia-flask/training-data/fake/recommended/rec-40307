Love comin' home and checking out this bar while watching the Phillies or Sixers.  There's nothing like Philly sports fans, the most passionate in America. The food is good and the service is great!  Would give them 5-stars if they had larger tv's for better viewing....you have to go next door to Play2 for that which is a cool place within itself.
