TO DIE FOR food. We ordered the salmon, steak frites and pork chop special: WOW They were stellar. The drinks were unique. I had the jalapeño margarita which was different, in a good way - not too sweet & just the right amount of heat from the jalapeño. It was a busy night but we weren't rushed at all. One waitress (who was fantastic) and one bartender, so it was a teeny bit slow but that was no problem! This is a great place to come, hang out, unwind with friends and enjoy some delicious food.
