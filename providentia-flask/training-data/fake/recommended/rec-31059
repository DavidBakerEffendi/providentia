This place is total meat market, literally. On a day when I had to be in No Libs for a meeting and forgot my umbrella, I stopped to beat the rain and grab some lunch. Among my friends, El Camino Real is legendary for it's BBQ, so I went in with fairly high expectations. I ordered a lb of meat (when in Rome, right?), split between pork belly and the brisket. I was not disappointed. After the perfunctory gawking, photo, and pronouncement of 'get in my belly', I started in on my plate of meat (technically meat and pork, but let's not quibble about the details and it's my damn review anyway). The pork was super tender and flavorful and the brisket was perfectly prepared. I gave each the spoon test... can I eat it only with a spoon? It went through both like a hot knife through butter. Just wonderful. Link to a photo of my pound of manly meat is here: i.imgur.com/mxGkNhW.jpg Since it was mid afternoon and pouring buckets outside, I decided to partake in their large, well selected and priced tequila collection. They have some nice Anejos and Reservas. I had the Cazadores with a few rocks. It was a generous pour and as smooth as an anejo can get for $10. Delicioso! I wanted the 1942, but at $21 a pour, I passed although that might be the cheapest price in town for this rare reserva. What can I say... I was impressed! My visit was unexpected and a nice way to spend an hour on a rainy Monday afternoon. Â Between $$ and $$$ in price.
