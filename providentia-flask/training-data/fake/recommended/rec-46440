Amazing ramen with awesome service has arrived in LIC!  I've been so excited to come and try Mu Ramen, so when I finally got to go, I of course go with my friend Steve, who's a seasoned pro at Mu. They delivered and totally hit a grand slam / touchdown / hole in one with their dishes. Prompt friendly service. Heidy and Michelle couldn't have been nicer and Joshua is one of the friendliest chefs I've come across.   We started with an order of the U + I,edamame and fried chicken. After eating all of this I willed my stomach to stay hungry to thoroughly enjoy my Tonkatsu 2.0 which was top notch flavor, presentation and one of the best ramen's I've ever had.  Of course, my fatness won and my friend and I split a Mu ramen. I then wished I had another stomach so that I could continue eating...their signature ramen was just as good as the tonkatsu 2.0, just a different flavor. I'm a huge fan of bone marrow so this bowl totally satisfied my bone marrow loving palette. I also appreciate the music playing...I won't ruin it for others so get over to Mu Ramen and enjoy!  I know I will :)
