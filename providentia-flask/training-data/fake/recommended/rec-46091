As always great service...only issue we had we were asked if we would like to try the wine of the night...my wife had two drinks... $45.00 for two glass of wine...no one said 22.50 Â a glass very unprofessional. ...manager said he would take care of us next time for misunderstanding. ..will see!!!! Update On issue...I emailed complaint and got call from manager on that night...he told me next time we were in...he would take care of us...apologized and seemed sincere....went there tonight and spoke with manager justin...he said he would cover our appetizers...a total of $9.00....which mean we still paid 25.00 more then we should have last time.. we had a nice time...when time to pay...the appetizers had not been removed from our bill...we said nothing and paid....so much for making it right!!!!! The saga continues...Justin called me the other night...said he realized he did not credit us the appetizers as promised after seeing my old email. ..felt real bad...said he is sending us gifts cards to make up for the series of mistakes...seems to be trying to make it right We cheers to justin....he made it right with a generous gift certificate as he stated he would proving he is a man of his word. ...cant wait to go back enjoy the great ambiance...drinks...and service...bottom line justin made a couple wrongs and right
