warning. ..... not a kid friendly place at all. so we decided to go eat at this place,  been there many times and never had problems sitting at a table with an infant. asked for a table and the nasty hostess at the counter told us that we must wait for a booth, i asked why?  she said it was company policy.. so i said wtf? the hostess argued with me and told me it was a safety issue so i told her it would be more unsafe for my child if you sat us at a booth. she should've asked why (if she had been smart). so let me explain why, now that you and management is not busy arguing with me. here we go... if you sit a family with an infant at a booth the chances of us avoiding a spill is slim to none (you know why right? ) and so with this said, the inevitable happens and a spill occurred. ... i don't mind getting ramen soup all over me but my child got burned on his hand, not to mention management nor the hostess came over to ask "are you ok"? any other restaurant,  even the halal food carts owner would ask. it's just common kindness even if you don't mean it. i told you what was going to happen but you guys seem to know more than the customer. well,  you guys lost me and my crew as your customers. don't let your temporary success get to your head. what goes up must come down.
