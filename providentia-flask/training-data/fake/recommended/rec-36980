Took me a while to find this place but it was definitely worth it when I did.  The place had a long line to get in but was very ordely and efficient in the matter that they conducted us in.  The service was very quick and the pizza was absolutely amazing.  The reason this place has such good pizza is that it has a brick oven to cook the pizza.  Most NYC pizza places are not allowed to use this type of oven for health code reasons anymore though some have been grandfathered in (i.e. Lombardi's) but those ovens are the key to making really great pizza since conventional ovens can't heat pizzas the the extreme temperatures needed to give them the crispiness and flavor that so many people rave about.  Just stop reading and check this place out for yourself.  Quick service and great pizza.
