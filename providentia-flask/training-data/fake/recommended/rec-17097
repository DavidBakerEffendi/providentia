We went last night with some of our friends. We made an unnecessary reservation for 4 (no big deal, rather be safe than sorry), and the table was ready right away for us. We ended up bringing our own wine too. We were seated promptly and they opened up our wine right away. Brought us wine glasses and our appetizers we ordered. We tried the chicken satay and the curry puffs. Both were pretty good. I loved the peanut sauce that was served with the chicken satay. Delicious. I ordered chicken pad Thai (hot) which had the best flavor I've had in a while. The portion size was just right. We also tried the chicken fried rice with basil (medium), which was good, and beef panang (hot) which was pretty good. Our friends also had the chicken pad see ew which they said was pretty good. Overall, the food here was pretty good. We would definitely return.
