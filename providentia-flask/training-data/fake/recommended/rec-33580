I've been here twice and this place has a nice, laidback vibe. Their happy hour specials aren't very 'exciting' -- but, I guess it's good that they have h/h specials at all, and I'm also a little biased because I'm kind of girly-girl when it comes to drinks, so I often prefer winebars and places where you can fancier cocktails. That being said, I've had a good time both times that I've been at Fresh Salt and I like the rustic look of the place. On my second visit, my friend and I shared two dishes (the mac and cheese, and the avocado salad) and we liked both. Will be back.
