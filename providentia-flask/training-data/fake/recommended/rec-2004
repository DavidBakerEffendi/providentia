This was an absolutely wonderful little place to eat and drink.  The decor is simple but well done, the food was fabulous, the wine was well priced, the atmosphere was superb.  It was almost like being in one of those small Brooklyn restaurants thats been there for 50 years, very cozy and welcoming. Best of all was the wait staff, Bud is the best of the best as far as waiters go, hes wonderful at what he does, always friendly and great to chat with. my only criticism for this place was the portions of the food were pretty small for what they were charging.
