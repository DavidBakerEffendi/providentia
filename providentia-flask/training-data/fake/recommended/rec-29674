Love this place. It has a real homey Mulberry feel away from the street hawkers at the southern end and just casual enough to feel home style. Been here with the family twice and the food is delicious. Raviolis, Spaghetti Carbonara, seafood. All good. Chianti is excellent. Definitely worth the visit if you are in Little Italy for an authentic experience.
