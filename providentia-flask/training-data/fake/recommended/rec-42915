After much anticipation of fry consumption and an empty stomach we arrived at Pommes Frites.  The concept of a restaurant that only sells fries and dipping sauces is pure genius; however, the consequences of eating the regular size fries with dipping sauce (roasted eggplant - my fave) are intense.  The fries themselves are alright, not my particular taste ( too thick and not crispy enough) but the dipping sauces are creative and a mixture of savory and sweet. All and all I would say try it once but split a regular size fry with someone.
