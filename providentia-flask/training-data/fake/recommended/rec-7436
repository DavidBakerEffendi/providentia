Walked in and bbq hit me in the face. It's a tight spot especially on a night like friday. Dinner date with my boyfriend and everything was pretty perfect. Service: 5 Price: 5 Food: * Sizzling Sisig: 4.5 ( I know it's the 'fatty' crew but I prefer less fat) * Coconut rice: 5 * Khao Soi: 4 Staff are awesome! Went with a google offer but would definitely visit again without it.
