I wasn't sure what to expect when I first walked in. But this place was definitely cool and fun. The atmosphere was neat. First floor was mellow, clean and unique. I loved the antique chairs/sofa, the green walls and funky pictures, clocks, old toys, etc. The price was perfect - especially since I am in college and broke. The cheapest beer was 2.50 - pabst which is perfect and I could live wit that. And 3 dollars for Lionshead (especially compared to philly drink prices). Doable. Our waitress was slightly scary. She made me really nervous because she wore a sunglasses ... inside... and it was near 9pm. So, I couldn't tell if she was making eye contacts and ready to listen. It was just odd. We went upstairs and the atmosphere was so much fun. The walls are covered with sharpie marks, posters, band flyers, and etc. It was cool and very laid back. I had fun looking at all of the writings. There was a pool table and bumper cars seats. It was neat. I'd definitely go back!
