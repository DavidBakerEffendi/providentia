The Pines has become my favorite restaurant in all of NYC. The food is extremely inventive, with unexpected pairings of ingredients and flavors (foie gras with rhubarb is a particular fave), and it always works. The service is excellent, the cocktails delicious, the atmosphere cozy. I've eaten there maybe 8 or 10 times at this point and it is fabulous every time. I have never had a dish there that was not wonderful. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!
