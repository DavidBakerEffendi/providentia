Oh yes, a classic Jersey diner!  Caters to the 60+ crowd, but the service is great - quick and efficient like it should be.  The food is sub-par, but for the price it can't be beat for the sheer amount of food.  For $13 I received my entree of pot roast with mushroom sauce, two sides, cup of soup and salad bar!  Now the veggies might be frozen, and the pot roast over-cooked, but come on - its a diner!  There are several TVs in the dining room so you can watch your Wheel of Fortune with the old folks while you eat your massive dinner.
