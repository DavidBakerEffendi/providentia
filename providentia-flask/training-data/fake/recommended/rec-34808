The "Room Service Pad Thai" is my favorite item on the menu.  Thin vermicelli noodles are used instead of the usual wider rice noodles.  Sun-dried shrimps can also be requested for a more authentic experience.  The noodles are served wrapped in a thin egg omelet and topped with shreds of mango that add a pleasant sweetness. I have also tried the Bangkok pumpkin curry chicken and the Tamarind red snapper and can vouch for both.  The cocktails are delightful and there are many options to choose from; although sadly, I think they have taken my favorite blended frozen cocktail off the menu.
