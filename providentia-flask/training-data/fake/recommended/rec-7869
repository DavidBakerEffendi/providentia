I don't usually eat burgers, and I cringe whenever I have to eat fast food burgers. I just don't enjoy the horrible, greasy, UGHHHH feeling I get afterwards. But when I had my first Shack Stack, I was blown away! The beef was tender and juicy, but my favorite part of the burger was the deep fried 'shroom, filled with melty cheese that oozed out after each bite. But after eating here 3-4 times, the excitement sort of faded away. The burgers are overpriced and way too oily. The buns sometimes come out soggy and are too small to hold everything inside. Eating it gets pretty messy. The hand-cut fries are a hit or miss; sometimes they're nice and crispy, other times they're soggy and limp.
