I stumbled across this place today and decided to try it out.  I ordered the Holly Burger (toppings include ham, gouda, mixed greens, tomato and pesto) for $7.50 pre-tax and it was actually pretty fantastic.  The burger was cooked medium, just as I requested, and it had two thick patties.  It was totally juicy and flavorful, but required many napkins.   I'll definitely be back to try other burgers and sandwiches on the menu.  There's plenty of variety to choose from and many of the options seem to feature unique and interesting combinations of ingredients.     This is just a hunch, but I think this place may be affiliated with or owned by the same people that run Toasties.  The menu and prices are incredibly similar (though Toasties doesn't have burgers or burritos), the ordering/line system is exactly the same, and even their decor and the font on their menu is reminiscent of the Toasties aesthetic.  Also, I'm a pretty frequent visitor of the 51st street Toasties and I noticed that the cashier at Graso Grill used to be the cashier at Toasties.  Hmmm...
