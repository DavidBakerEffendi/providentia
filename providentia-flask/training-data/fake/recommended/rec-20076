This place is fantastic.  I really don't understand how you could rate it any lower than 5 stars.  The food is INCREDIBLE and very inexpensive ($6.50-9.00 for entrees).  The atmosphere is really unpretentious and very inviting, with a nice bar, an open seating area, and a rear outdoor patio (like many Brooklyn establishments).  The bartenders are so damn friendly, they always end up buying me a beer when I sit down for dinner.   This is easily my favorite restaurant in Cobble Hill, and is currently my favorite Thai place in New York.  That says a lot, considering how affordable it is.  If this place were in Manhattan, it'd be twice as expensive.  If it were in the Village, it'd be three times the cost.  But then again, that would spoil it.
