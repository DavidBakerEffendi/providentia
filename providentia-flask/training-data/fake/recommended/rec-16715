Fresh, delicious New American cuisine. We split a bunch of appies -- gnocci is plentiful and blood orange salad good, too --and sides -- fries, hush puppies with honey butter, and brussel sprouts. Â Whole fish was tender but a little bland; the strip steak was meltingly tender. Only annoying aspect was the waitress kept trying to upsell: pushing sodas when we didn't order wine and trying to get us to order 3 orders of the $13 scallops (2 per order) for 5 people. That would be a $39 dish! Better to get something else to share.
