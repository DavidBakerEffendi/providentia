To add to the barrage of 5-star reviews, both staff we met were extremely solicitous, friendly, and helpful.  We were only in there for about 1/2 hour for lunch and were offered two refills of water-- and we were in the less-accessible upstairs part of the restaurant. The food was excellent, and we each had different favorites from the vegetarian sampler.  I'm not in the neighborhood that often, but I definitely will suggest it in the future. Does anyone know if the Ethiopian menu is entirely vegetarian?
