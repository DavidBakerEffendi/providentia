Ok so here we go.  Today i went here based on the reviews and was I disappointed.  Had the udon with pork belly.  The broth is what makes the udon and I was not impressed it tasted like miso soup with noodles.  The pork belly was delicious as usual but in such a large bowl of soup can you put at least 6 two inch pieces.  Also had the fried chicken with garlic sauce it was ok nothing to write about. I don't know I guess you can say I was disappointed because I went there because of all the reviews on yelp.  I will stick with Brooklyn Wok where the dumplings are flavorful and the broth in the soup is so good you don't need anything in it.
