I was in town on business and fortunately had a few friends in the area at the same time.  We are all beer drinkers so it was an easy decision to check out the Farmhouse Tap and Grill.  Overall I thought the experience was very solid.  Most know that they offer a wide selection of great beers. I started out with the tomato soup and would go so far as to call it some of the best I've ever had.  My friend had the kale and arugula salad and from my perspective it was equally impressive.  For my entree I ordered the  turkey burger.  I am always a little hesitant to do so because I've had more than my share of dry boring turkey burgers over the years.  I'm pleased to report the Farmhouse managed to avoid that issue and delivered a juicy and delicious burger.   I should note that this place gets really busy.  We waited close to an hour for a table in the middle of the week.  However, the beer garden proved a great place to get warmed up for dinner.  Might also be worth noting that you will pay a few extra dollars in comparison to other pub/tap houses, but the quality of the food and the beer is apparent.   My only gripe would be with the layout/feel of the main dining area.  Tables are a bit on top of one another and it doesn't really have the feel of a tap house, but that is likely a personal preference issue on my part.  I would go back.
