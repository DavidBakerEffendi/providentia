Wow.....I will never step foot back in this place again. Absolutely awful, a waste of time and money!!! I am seriously so mad at myself for wasting my money to eat here. Not only did it take forever to be seated but to be charged $65 for an appetizer and two crappy entrees is just ridiculous, especially when you feel like you're eating at super busy food court in a mall. Everything you touch in there is overpriced to the max. Again I feel really stupid for not getting up and walking out of this place. I was just really uncomfortable the entire time I was there. People were walking by, bumping into my chair, hitting my with their bags, bumping into each other....it was just complete chaos the entire time. Ughhhh, I'm getting anxiety again just thinking about this place. Save your time and money and just don't go here. If I could give this place a ZERO I would.
