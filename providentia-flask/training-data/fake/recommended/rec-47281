Extra virgin came to mind when my friend said she is on a vegetarian diet for a bit. When we arrives we waited on the side walk for 25 minutes on a Tuesday night. Jammed packed! No space to go around you when you are sitting. The waitress before attending us hit me four times on the shoulder and back to get to the next to table! They keep the place dark a bit for mood and a lot to hide the interior condition , if you know what i mean. we ordered 8 items on the menu for 4 of us. The pussy waiter manager pushed the bottle water as their tap water was not recommended to drink by the manager. Â after being pushed a couple of more times i decided to go to the men's room. There was a line and one only functioning. The food had changed a lot for commercial meals as they are very popular and busy now. i only going to say the wonderful hand cut fries '$8 portion, was changes to the one comes in a bag at ant frozen supermarket!. Then before we were finished with any meal the boss boy removed our dished from us while our mouths still moving! Since they need to get you out and sit other people! The waitress and the help did the same thing about the dessert BEFORE WE WERE FINISHED WE WERE RUSHED OUT! Oh well, it is not about the food , it is all about service and the company you are with..So we had a lovely time and we know we will not go back to EXTRA VIRGIN EVER! FYI the hostess was dress lovely
