I graduated from college 6 years ago and have no business being in a college town. They mostly suck, New Haven included. I was beginning to regret visiting here... until I ate at Soul de Cuba Cafe. I just ate the best Cuban food in the U.S., and this beats all such restaurants I've tried in Miami. The beef and chicken empanadas are PERFETO. Like a Ruben's empanada just authentic and more refined. Ropa vieja is flavorful but gets a bit boring at the end. Great experience overall. All other meats are amazing!
