Best BBQ in Philly. I came here with my friend a month ago and we got the deviled eggs, the mac and cheese, spare ribs, brisket, and baked beans. EVERYTHING was just awesome. The BBQ ribs and brisket were so tender and had the perfect smoke flavor. The mac and cheese was some of the best iv'e had in awhile, as well as the beans. What I loved the most though were the deviled eggs. They were so good that I ordered more to go. Definitely try Percy Street if you're in Philly!
