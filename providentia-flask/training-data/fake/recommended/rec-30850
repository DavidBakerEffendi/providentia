My boyfriend and I finally just tried SUD after living around the corner (and peeking into their lovely backyard from our window) for over a year. We were celebrating a new job and came by early on a weeknight. The staff was really friendly and helpful without hovering too much, and pretty much everything on the menu looked great. We settled on the antipasto italiano, which I highly recommend. Great selection of cheeses and meats, with a decadent truffle-balsamic reduction and honey for dipping. And they were very generous with baskets of bread to go with. For entrees, I went with a spaghetti that came in a fresh tomato sauce--so good. My boyfriend really made the right choice by ordering a fish special. It was served in a caserole dish with tomatoes and a light sauce. Perfectly cooked. I definitely recommend both the almond cake and tiramisu for dessert--although the almond cake was a bit more of special treat since you don't see that on every menu around. Can't wait to go back!
