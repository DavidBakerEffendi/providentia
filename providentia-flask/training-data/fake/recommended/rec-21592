This was the highlight of my trip. First of all, make sure you have a reservation. 2nd, don't go crazy at the salad bar. We went up to sample some of the many offerings, but as soon as we sat down and saw all of the meat flying by our table, we pushed our plates to the side and flipped over to green. Everything was delicious, the staff was very friendly, and we never had to wait for anything. Shockingly, we still had room for dessert and that was wonderful as well. This is not to be missed. I cannot rate the sides because I didn't even bother with them. We weren't there to fill up on polenta and potatoes, you dig? Also, if you have a big group, this is the perfect place.
