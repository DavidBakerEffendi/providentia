Words can't begin to explain the excellent flavors that come out of this small place.  If you haven't been here before, try not to be to surprise how small it is but then you start to wonder how they make food in such a small place.  The major problem is that the chef is going to be on iron chef and so the place is going to be packed.  So we are trying to go as many times as possible before that happens.
