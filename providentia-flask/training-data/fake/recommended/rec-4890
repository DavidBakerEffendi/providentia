Black Lips show! how can it be bad?  and it wasn't! I like this place, it reminds me of all the "edgy-ness" the troc had in the 90's.  The staff see to not over think how "cool" they are or anything.  they focus on things where it counts, getting good bands, serving good food, and beer. started off eating there... Edamame to start..then a falafel (cruchy pattys)...   to say it was good, is kinda funny... japanese & greek, but it worked.. it was good. service was good.... headed up stairs, now keep in mind your right there, the band is right there, not a big stage, but that is the coolest part, you can actually see your band.
