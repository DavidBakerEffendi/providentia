After asking many of my friends what the best pizza was in New York this place came up came up twice. If your looking for a quick slice of some of the best pizza with the freshest ingredients then this is your spot. If you are looking to sit down and have a beer or appetizers then this is not your place. The restaurant is the about the size of a walk in closet with a few standing tables and some wall stools. Although being small the pizza was on point. Some of the freshest tomato sauce I've ever had. I would suggest the square margarita pizza. I went up for a 3rd slice.
