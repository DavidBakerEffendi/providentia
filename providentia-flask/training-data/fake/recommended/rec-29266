Memphis Taproom is a very interesting little bar.  It has a very interesting selection of brews on draft, many of which are quite tasty.  Their food selection is very creative, a lot of interesting things going on and most everything I've had there is very good.  Very friendly service, good beer and good food.  I think it is a tad pricey for what it is, other than that, I think it's a very solid spot.
