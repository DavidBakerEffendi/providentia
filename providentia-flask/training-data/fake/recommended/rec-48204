I am visiting from Hawaii, so my Philly street cred is right out the door. That being said, I stumbled across this place after a night of mad insomnia from the jet lag of a six hour time difference. I was starving! In my delirium, I just drove my rental car down a random street hoping it might lead to food. Like a nighttime oasis in downtown, these yellow orange lights told me that this place is something special. I pulled up right in front at 2:00 am which would be right around supper time according to my body clock. I ordered a cheese steak with provolone. Remember that movie the Coneheads, when Dan Akroyd was hawking subway, and devoured his sandwich in about three seconds? He was slow compared to the speed I wolfed this thing down. How do you guys in Philly survive not having to see your cardiologist monthly with this kind of food around? If it does do you in, I'm sure you would be very happy going that way. Now I can die a happy man, having a great Philly Cheese Steak knocked off my bucket list. Aloha!
