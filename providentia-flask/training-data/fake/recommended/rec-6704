We stopped by here for lunch on a Friday around one and found the place packed.  We knew this was a good sign.  We had to wait a few minutes and were quickly seated once a table was available.  The menu was crazy huge, but we went for a few of our typical favorites, plus an appetizer.  The highlight of the meal was the spicy chicken dumplings.  I am usually a potsticker kind of girl, but these might have changed my mind.   They come with an amazing red sauce and peanut sauce underneath and if it was okay I would have licked the plate clean.  The ladies at the table next to us saw them and ordered a plate for themselves.  The other food that we ordered was good and the portions were huge.  As far as the service goes, they definitely aren't the most friendly of waitresses, as mentioned in other yelp reviews, but when there was a mix up in the order our server apologized and handled it and made sure the correct food came out quickly.
