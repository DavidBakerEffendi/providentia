Great prices, awesome service, delicious food and a ridiculous beer menu. What more can you really ask for? I would not hesitate to recommend anything we tried from my cream soda flavored beer (yeah, you read that right) to the basket of knishes, and finally the delicious grilled cheeses (so far, my fave is the Gouda with pickled jalape√±os). I only wish we saved room to try the desserts! A true Astoria gem. I think this one could stick around for a while.
