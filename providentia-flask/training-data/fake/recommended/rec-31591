Bruno's was the pizza I grew up with in Clifton. We were regular customers since the time they opened in the 1970s. My mom worked at McHenry's Drugs in the same shopping mall, and it was always a treat when she would bring a Bruno's Pizza home for dinner. I haven't lived in Clifton for over 30 years now. I've struggled to find a pizza that is as good as those I remember from Bruno's, and always wondered whether it was because of nostalgia, or was Bruno's really that good? I have my answer. I live in Oklahoma now, and this weekend was back in NJ visiting friends. Had some free time so drove back to Clifton for a nostalgia visit. Stopped at Bruno's for a slice. Nothing had changed - same layout, same pizza ovens, I think even the same guy behind counter. And the pizza? Every bit as delicious as I remember. Perfect crust thickness and crispness. Perfect amount of tangy sauce. Perfect amount of cheese. I took one bite and was instantly transported back to my moms kitchen table. To the little league end of season pizza parties in the back room. For that matter to those days as a CHS stoner curing a wicked case of the munchies. Bruno's Pizza set the standard by which all pizzas have even measured for my entire life. I'm 49 years old now, and it still does. Cliftonites, you don't know how good you have it.
