Was soo shocked at the sheer scale and decor of this place.  I work at a mag that threw a Halloween event here and everyone had a damn good time!  Everyone was like, umm they need to throw parties here because the space is entirely conducive to facilitating nite life (and they'd turn crazy profits, you'd think). Didn't have any of their food, but apparently its pretty good and inexpensive.  Rarely in the area it's located in though.
