If you removed the douchebag crowd, horrific service, and poorly thought out table seating/execution, I would probably still only give this place three stars. And that's based almost entirely on the fact that they have really good, cheap beer. Honestly, if this is the best burger in New York, I've found plenty of motivation to go back to California. I'd take an overpriced Burger Joint burger or Five Guys any day. Yes, the patty was thick and juicy, but I'd give up a little meat for a lot more flavor. It's like this big hockey puck of tasteless beef oozing some kind of mixture of water and tasteless lipids in my mouth. I thought I had found New York's most overrated burger at The Spotted Pig, but Corner Bistro definitely proved me wrong. 4 stars for the cheap beer. -1 for the sea of d-bags you have to swim through to get to the bar. -1 for the opportunity cost that prevented me from eating at a place that actually had waiters who pretended to want my tip. -1 for the burger. Bottom line is this: I wouldn't come back here unless a group of pricks stuck a gun to my head and forced me to buy them a few rounds of beer.
