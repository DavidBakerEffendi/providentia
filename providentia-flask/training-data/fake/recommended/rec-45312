Came for lunch on a Saturday. I read all the reviews of the bad or so so service on Yelp before I went, so I was prepared... We got seated right away by the lovely hostess, but then 10 minutes later we were still being ignored by wait staff who were just chatting with themselves (looking at their cell phones???) and serving other tables around us, even tables who came after us. It almost seemed like the waiters and waitresses didn't get along and no one wanted us. I mean, I think that its just not cool to not come over to customers to at least welcome them and give them water? Hello management? So after 10 mins of being ignored, we got up and went and sat at the bar. The wonderful bartenders took care of us lickety split and we had drinks in 2 minutes and food pronto. Great food and great personalities at the bar. Too bad the wait staff in the main room gave us attitude. On the way to the bathroom I saw our same first table with a sad couple waiting for service too, what a drag, I almost told them to sit at the bar! Maybe the wait staff doesn't like tables for 2? Anyways, the ribs are fantastic and the dino burger to die for. Go!!!
