This is a tough one to review.  I love the food here.  The hibachi is wonderful- they cook the steak very well, the hibachi fried rice is fantastic, even the onion soup they bring before the meal is great.  I've had their sushi- just a basic roll or two- and it's fine- fresh enough, but nothing to write home about.  In general, Koto is quite overpriced, especially for this area, but they don't really have any competition from other hibachi restaurants. But- and here's a big but- I almost always get very sick after eating the hibachi here.  Not food poisoning sick, but an hour after eating, the "my body just can't handle this and I want to die for a few hours" sick.  I don't know if it's the oils (the hibachi fried rice is unbelievably delicious but very, very oily) or some seasoning they use, but man, I am very happy while I'm eating, and then very, very unhappy later.  Sure, sometimes I have a sensitive stomach, but Koto brings that to a whole new level.  Interestingly, the same thing has happened more than once to my husband after eating here, too.  We often reminisce about "the day Koto tried to kill us both."  It's pretty sad. So, the food tastes amazing, so if you don't mind spending some quality time with the public restrooms in West Lebanon, and you don't mind a bit of pressure on your wallet, I highly recommend it.  :)
