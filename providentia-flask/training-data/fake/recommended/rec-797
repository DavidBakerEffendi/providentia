I came here again last night and took my friend and her mom when they were in town! This time, I was not sick and was able to enjoy the food in its entirety. We ordered the fish ball noodle soup, the house special meat ball noodle soup, the chicken stir fried noodles, and we wanted to try their shaved noodles so we ordered a small side of shaved noodles with peanut sauce. Everything was delicious! I must say I really enjoyed the meatballs in the house special, and the broth was on point. Of all the dishes, I think I loved the stir fried noodles the most. The flavor was perfect, and you just can't go wrong with hand drawn noodles at this place. The fish ball soup was good too but I wouldn't say it was my favorite. I don't think I would order it again but that's just out of preference. We barely touched the shaved noodles with the peanut sauce because we were all incredibly full from everything else. I had a bite of it, but I still like their hand drawn noodles more. Again, you must go here if you're in Chinatown or are in Philly and want a good bite to eat. WORTH IT (and it's cheap!).
