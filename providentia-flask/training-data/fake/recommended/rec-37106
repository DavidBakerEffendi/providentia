Came here only two times in my life around 10pm-3am and it's earned its place as my default bar to go for the night. Great drinks (and drink menu! Sake sangria, Lycheetinis, Lychee Caipirinha anyone???), great music (old skool hip hop woohoo!!), fair prices, diverse crowd -- no douches. The bar takes up more than half the place. It's a giant oval shape and the bartenders serve 360, which = super fast attentive service. It can get pretty crowded but everyone is civilized and chill.
