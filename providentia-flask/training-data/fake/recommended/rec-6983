Took a friend from Florida to Williamsburg to show her around. Not many places were open since it is Christmas Eve. Fairly priced, this place got amazing mini-biscuits and really delicious and rich chicken potpie. The fried chicken steak has very special breadijg that adds a nice crunch. The vanilla pear marmalade is very impressive. Service was great - no complaints. Will come back here with others for sure.
