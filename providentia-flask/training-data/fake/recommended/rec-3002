19 Degrees has changed a lot in the past few months. To begin with, they are now open later: 11pm Mon-Thurs Midnight Fri & Sat 10pm Sun And, most importantly, they now sell BEER! This is a blessing in the South of South neighborhood, which used to be a verified "beer desert." They offer six packs, 12 packs, and single 24-oz bottles to go. Over the winter, they've fully remodeled the place. Their Facebook page states that they now offer delivery, have outdoor seating, and are dog-friendly, but I can't personally verify any of those claims. They sell sandwiches, wraps, sushi, fresh baked goods, La Colombe coffee, and fresh smoothies. Just about the only thing that hasn't changed about 19 Degrees Cafe is the genuine "Mom & Pop" feel of the place. It's run by a family of generous, caring, friendly, and hard-working people who aim to please every customer and give back to their community. This is the type of refreshing neighborhood spot where they get to know you by name, and if you're short a few cents on your purchase, they'll trust you to pay them back next time. Don't take advantage! This small-town style of generosity is hard to find in the city, and it doesn't always last! 19 Degrees Cafe is a diamond in the rough. Let's return their spirit of kindness with appreciation and frequent business.
