I went to Formosa tonight with my family after hearing great things about the food and the all you can eat deal.  When we got there, there was one waiter and one hostess.  The waiter was running ragged while the hostess was more like a sloth.  It took at least 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and much longer for our food order.  After about an hour of just sitting there, our food finally came out.  It was decent but nothing extra special.  By this time we were so annoyed and tired of sitting there that we just wanted to leave.  They left the check off list for us to order our second round of all you can eat sushi but we didn't want to wait another hour for then next round.  The waiter was very apologetic and offered us free dessert but we decided against it.  It was a huge disappointment and waist of money because we did not eat enough sushi for what we paid.  The food may have been better if we were not so aggravated by the time we got it, but all in all they were understaffed, slow kitchen, decent food, and I would not be going there again.
