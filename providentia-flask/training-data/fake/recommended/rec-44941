One of the best meals I've had in the city. This place is small and unassuming but it packs a punch of great food. Definitely get the meatball sliders for an appetizer, it change any bad feeling you have about veal. For a dinner, get the crispy chicken. Every ingredient was so good, I was close to licking the plate. If you're in the mood for fish, get the halibut, which was also perfectly cooked.
