I decided to sit at the bar since I was solo. It took approximately 15 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge me. Yes the place was busy but not super busy where there's a 45 minute wait. I sat and waited and waited until the owner decided to take my order and the hostess decided to give me chips and salsa. The waitress finally acknowledged me after my order was taken by the owner. I ordered a chicken taco, which was blas√©. Fish taco- dry and missing some kind of seasoning. And a pork belly taco, which was cold. I will give this place a try, once they've been established for 6 months. I totally understand there are challenges for a new restaurant and I hope they achieve those challenges. The decor is very pleasant and it's bYob!
