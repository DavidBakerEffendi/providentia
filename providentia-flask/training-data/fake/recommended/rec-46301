Amazing!! I'm a picky eater but our amazing waitress Miriam gave us suggestions and tastings that were perfect for all of us!! The buttered rolled with Black Sea salt...speechless!! We started with the Kampachi...I'm not big on Tartare, but I'm so happy that I tried it.  An amazing stater, so fresh and flavorful! After that the Chili Lobster...amazing does it no justice! spicy...yet perfect!  Texas toast covered in spicy "soup" with big chunks of lobster! Mouth watering!!! We also had the Cavatelli! Perfectly made Cavatelli with amazing spices!!  Moved onto the Fluke!! W O W! Amazing brown butter sauce, lightly crusted!  Melts in your mouth!!!! Finally...Chicken under a brick...it's a whole chicken perfectly cut!  So moist, flavorful, juicy, tender, beautifully put together with amazing spices and slices of potatoes!  We ended with dessert....had to try two! S'mores and baked banana split! HELLO!!! Everything was perfect from the H2O to the rolls, to the cocktails (spiced rum, vida mezcal).  EVERY single bite to the amazing chef and staff...beyond amazing! So happy we took the trip out to TriBeCa! Will definitely return!!
