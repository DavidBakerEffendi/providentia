This place is amazing. PROS: Truly unique flavor combinations. Amazing setup, wherein you are seated around the kitchen and can watch the dishes being prepared. Limited seating, which lends itself to a convivial atmosphere... BYOB, to help mitigate the dent on your finances. NO CONS...but be aware: The way the seats are set up, you really can't converse with more than one person at a time. Â So you can't, say, go with a group of friends and expect to all talk. That said, good luck getting a reservation!
