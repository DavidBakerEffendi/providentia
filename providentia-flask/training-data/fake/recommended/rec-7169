The quality of the food is pretty good. One of the better Chinese buffet's I've been too. They have a great selection, food is hot and constantly being refilled. They also have sushi. They have a "limit" of two pieces per person, but give the guy a tip and you'll have all the sushi you want. Simple place, quick service, definitely great for the price.
