I love this restaurant. I used to be in the business in my former career. There are things here that are not perfect and truthfully no restaurant is every time. I love the ambiance and took a friend from out-of-town here who absolutely loved it!!  Oysters are on the mark, well they're raw, but you can tell they are fresh.. The wines are excellent. Each entree I've had has been great.  Boulliabase is excellent and so are the tacos. It's definitely a cool date place.
