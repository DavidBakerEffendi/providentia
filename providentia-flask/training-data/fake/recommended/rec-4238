I used to attend Technology High School which is directly across the street from the restaurant. I graduated in 2011 and back then the service was so DISGUSTING I made a stop there recently and I wasn't surprised by my encounters. The service is disgusting. If you don't speak English they treat you like crap , they will skip over you and take forever with your order. When asking for management ( to complain ) they give you the WORST attitude you could ever imagine. The service brings the quality of the restaurant to the ground. The food on a scale of 1-10 on a good day is a 6/7. They need to hire more bilingual staff members so that the environment is comfortable for everyone.
