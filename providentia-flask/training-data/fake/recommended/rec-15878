Oh Pats. How I love you so. My love affair with Pats started in 2000. I was in college in Delaware and heard about amazing cheesesteaks at Pats. We went and then continued to go multiple times a week. Who doesn't love a cheesesteak spot that is open 24 hours?! Make sure you know how to order before you get to the window. Wiz wit please!!! That means cheese wiz with fried onions. OMG incredible. The bread is super soft and the steak is perfect and delicious. Don't bother going to Genos across the street, those neon lights are ridiculous. It's Pats or nothing at all for me. Now that I am back in NY I do not get to eat Pats as often as I used to all those years ago but luckily I have a friend that lives outside Philly so if I go to visit her I make sure I hit up Pats on way home. Pats is the best!!!
