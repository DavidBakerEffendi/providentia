Chhaya has become my go to place for coffee and breakfast on the weekends. While I wish that I could sit down and eat waffles or eggs every weekend, I usually get oatmeal, which comes with get, fresh berries. The food is always excellent, but the highlight that keeps me coming back is the excellent coffee. The staff is not only incredibly friendly, but also so knowledgable about brewing styles, beans, and roasting. One other great thing about Chhaya is there support for local artists. I love looking at all the great art they have on their walls. Bottom line, whether you are planning to eat in or get your coffee to go, Chhaya is a great, unique place to go.
