Upon the glowing recommendations of Richard K, I sought them out. There were two carts on opposite corners but they had the exact same sign so I figured either was probably OK. I wasn't feeling terribly hungry so I decided on the falafel plate--meat just seemed kind of heavy at that moment. I kind of regretted it, though, because the falafel were not really hot; I think they'd been sitting around a little while, but the flavor was good. Accompanied by the sauces, rice, and salad, which were all great and in generous portions, it ended up being the best bargain I had in NY! STEPH JUDGEMENT: One of the best values in NY, just watch out for those pigeons.
