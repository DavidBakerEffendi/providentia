Really, the food is just o.k. -nothing special at ALL. Everything we tried was fairly ordinary which includes the highly touted              rabbit meatballs.   For some reason everyone was pushing the bucatini as the most "interesting" pasta.  Quite frankly it was awful.  The only dish that had some merit was the pappardelle. I'm wondering  who wrote all these 5 star reviews.
