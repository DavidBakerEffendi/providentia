I've been here for brunch and lunch. The food is decent. For me, the best part was the bread - the biscuits that came with brunch and the bread with olive oil. Got the kale omelette which could use more goat cheese. The turkey burger I had gotten for lunch was not good. Service at brunch was slow. Couldn't find our waitress anywhere.
