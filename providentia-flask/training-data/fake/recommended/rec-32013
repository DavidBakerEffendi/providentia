We came here during a World Cup game the US was playing in.  All of the servers were far more interested in the game than their tables, so service was pretty terrible.  We were served promptly, and then ignored for the rest of the evening. We got several dishes: The steamed dumplings were nice.  Very meaty, but nothing special. The boiled dumplings in hot oil were very flavorful, but the oil wasn't particularly spicy.  Huge flavor, though. The vegetable soup with tofu was probably the highlight of the meal, sadly.  It was a wonderful broth with chunks of tofu, snow peas, snow pea shoots, and a smattering of other veggies, and was thoroughly delicious.  And a steal, at $4.95. The sliced pork with rice cakes was pretty bad.  It was in a cloyingly sweet brown sauce, and the rice cakes were deep fried, not pan fried, so they were also sweet instead of adding bitterness. The mushu chicken -- which, inexplicably, was on the American-style Chinese menu despite being one of the few authentic dishes that has actually translated well to the American table -- was certainly passable.  It's better with pork, of course, and the pancakes were the unfortunate frozen variety. My wife ordered a glass of wine; they claimed to have both kinds, but the "white" was not white at all, it was white zinfandel. If you come here on a good service night and stick to a few known dishes then this place might be fine, but I wouldn't stray far from the dishes other Yelpers specifically mention -- ma po tofu, dan dan mien, etc.
