Si si si.. Lol went here for the first time during restaurant week with my boyfriend, and I must say both food and service were great. We had: Appetizers: croquetas de quejio- Addicted! Avocado fries - Good Shrimp empanadas- these were yummy Tuna tartar- Ok Mains: Skirt steak with fries- oh so good Lechon- sorry my mama makes it better but not bad hah Desert and drinks: Tres leches- nice & moist Flan- creamy and delicious Poquito picante Drinks- warmed me up lol Loved it! Can't wait to go back.
