I can only vouch for delivery - I've seen the shop and it's pretty small - but I'm a fan! We tried the salty/sweet pretzel fingers and the tex mex. The fingers themselves are great. Nice size, quality chicken, and the breading was crunchy and tasty. If you got them without any of the special toppings I bet they'd still be really tasty. I liked the sauces on both, though the sauces we got on the side - Cray (green spicy salsa) and Sriracha Ranch left a bit to be desired. We also had the tempura green beans, which were pretty good but soggy just due to the fact they were delivered and not fresh.
