Love, love, love!  This spot has a cozy feel to it.  It's super chill, unpretentious and the food is amazing.  I had a chicken sandwich, which was juicy, well-seasoned and fresh.  The bartender told me that all their chicken is organic, free range chicken--which really does make a difference. I came in for a quick bite but, saw other dishes as they came out--everything looked really good and they also give sizable portions.  I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.
