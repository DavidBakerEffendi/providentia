Very good soba noodle soup. Excellent service. Prices a bit up there, but I guess that comes with the airport territory. The menu also had a lot of sushi/sashimi choices, soups, tempura. They really should put the three TVs on mute and turn on the audio descriptive service (English text at bottom). Travelers don't need any more noise, especially while dining. Glad we found this place--it seems like the best dining choice in this terminal at this point.
