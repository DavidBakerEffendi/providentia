I just moved to the neighborhood and tend to be a little shy about going into established neighborhood spots like this because I feel like an outsider.  But since this place has such a great reputation, I got over myself and went in with a couple of friends.  We were greeted warmly and made to feel welcome.  We sat at the bar and shared a seafood special, calamari with spicy relish, ribs, salads, and mozzarella sticks.  The food is all delicious.  Especially the seafood.  Wow that red sauce is addictive.  As we sat and gorged ourselves, lots of  local families and people of all ages started to pile in for dinner.  The place is tiny and cozy with a comfortable, familiar vibe and friendly, fast service.   I love it and will be back often!
