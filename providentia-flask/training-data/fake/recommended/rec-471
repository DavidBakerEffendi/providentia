After having been to this restaurant for the sixth time since first trying it in May, I felt compelled to create a Yelp account and write a review. This food is delicious, the ambiance is great, the service and staff are fantastic, and the Sangria is amazing! This particular time ( and many times before) we got skirt steak, cheesy potatoes, roasted pepper and melted cheese on toast, tuna empanadas, beef empanadas, the ox tail stew (special of the day), and the lava cake. EVERYTHING was delicious and well prepared! In addition, we had the mango sangria which was perfect! I've also had a variety of their sangrias and they are all very good! Thank you again Nai Tapas for you very tasty food and your warm service! *GREAT for a group of people or a date!!
