A cute little place with cozy seating and small plates. The three of us were seated at the communal table toward the back of the restaurant. Though the table was small, we were quite comfortable. We had a bottle of red, the coq au vin, the mussels, and a couple of things from their cheese & charcuterie menu - the moses sleeper, the tomme-- (made from sheep's milk, full name of which I can't remember), the duck confit, and the chicken liver mousse. The coq au vin was extremely small, and not very good. The mussels were also nothing special. But the cheeses and meats were delicious. The chicken liver pate had a layer of fat at the top, which looked a little strange but was still tasty. We ordered a second round of cheeses and asked for nearly 5 refills of their delicious toasted bread, which they generously brought to us. We finished with the homemade apple tart, which did taste very homemade, but also not very special. The entire restaurant smelled warm and buttery. Our server was sweet and accommodating. And while none of the food was really outstanding, the meats, cheeses and drinks might be worth returning for.
