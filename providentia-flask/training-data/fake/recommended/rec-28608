Went for brunch on Friday, which of course does not offer the full brunch menu. Nevertheless, we had the egg sandwich on the croissant and the eggs Benedict with the smoked salmon. Egg sandwich - razor thin omelet style egg (probably just one egg used) with overcooked and dried-out bacon. The croissant was fine, nothing special. The brussel sprouts were good. Nothing to write home about. I get a better egg sandwich from the bodega around the corner for $4 (and that includes a coffee). This one cost $15. Benedict - Wow, I have never seen poached eggs that were so incredibly overcooked. They were basically severally hardboiled eggs. So, definitely not worth the $18 price tag. The salmon was average and the pain perdu was unimpressive. But really, did the cook forget he was poaching eggs and left them in too long? Overcooking eggs this badly and then charging $18 is ridiculous. The service was nice and the food was edible. So that's why it doesn't get 1 star. But Â overall it was very mediocre and I would not recommend it. You can find better food most anywhere in NYC.
