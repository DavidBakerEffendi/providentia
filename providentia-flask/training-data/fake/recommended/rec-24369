We have been going to Zinc for 10 years.  The food is always very good, fresh with lots of interesting and delicious combinations.   We don't go as often anymore because the menu hasn't changed much and the specials selection is slim.   Recently we went again and stayed with our favorites Duck Nachos, Hanger Steak and Tuna.  All done perfectly with just enough twist that its a unique experience.   Would like to go more often but there are so many other good places to go.
