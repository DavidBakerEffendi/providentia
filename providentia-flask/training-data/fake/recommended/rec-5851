Good for beer but for anything else I would choose another option. Food was standard pub food but tasted pretty bland. Also my friend found a hair in her food. The waitress didn't remember our drink order and wasnt too attentive. Â Definitely wont be back. Much better options in the area, after all it's NYC.
