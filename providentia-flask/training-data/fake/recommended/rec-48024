hey. hey guys. have you heard of this restaurant? its name means non-kosher in yiddish. did you know that? well i'm going to tell you regardless. isn't that edgy? oh man i love pork, i'm just one crazy girl living in williamsburg. just like that show on the network my dad watches after midnight for the breasts. but seriously, traif is great. pricing is phenomenal for what you get, which in my opinion is a 3-4 star small plates dining experience. the scallops are the best i've ever had, cooked to perfection. duck confit is excellent, the tongue is good (i like frenching with it while staring directly into other people's eyes at my table), and soft-shell crab is great. i'll be here at least every few months, it's a pleasure.
