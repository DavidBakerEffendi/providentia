I really don't even know where to start. This is my first review and I am only writing it because our night here was such an epic failure. We made reservations for nine on new years. One of our party had their entre come forty minutes after the rest of the table. We never saw our waitress after she took our order. I got so fed up at one point I tried to go to the bar. I never got that drink order either. Food was mediocre.
