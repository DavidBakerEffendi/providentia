Sakura establishes itself at the top of my most horrible restaurants in Glastonbury list.  Ordered a meal for three people which included three items off of the happy hour menu, several sushi items from the regular menu, and 2 drinks. Attempted to use a CouponConnecticut.Com coupon and was told that cannot be combined with other offers. Because I had ordered from the menu and not used any other offer I objected and the smug and cocky manager said "too bad." Would not recommend this restaurant to anybody for this lack of courtesy. My wife did not even eat her dinner, finding it inedible and foul tasting.  The waiter/bartender cleared it away without asking. Min Ghung has better sushi. Hibachi is only average. Really no reason to eat here. I give this place my lowest rating of any restaurant since moving to Glastonbury.
