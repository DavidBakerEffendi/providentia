One of the best meals in 2011. The tempura eggplant topped with spicy tuna appetizer and drizzled balsamic was insanely delicious as was the duck confit, the best I've ever had. As other reviewers have noted, get the pillowy soft and oh so delicious donuts. In terms of portion size, I couldn't tell they were "small plates" since I think of the portion size at Casa Mono and these were noticeably larger. The value really cannot be beat. I can't watt to go back!
