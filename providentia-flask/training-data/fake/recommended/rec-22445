You can read my whole review to get an idea about how good they are, but here's the main thing you need to know: This is one of three stops you need to make on your sandwich tour of Philadelphia. I'll mention all three at the end: Atmosphere - Reading Terminal Market! Touristy, a bit... Quality, unbeatable. The hustle and bustle of DiNic's keeps you going, whether it be during the busy lunch rush or an early dinner, the place is packed. Counter style service in more areas at the new location and a simple selection of menu items. Fast, efficient, and great for dining. Waitstaff - You're on your own here. Counter service is just one of the cook or cashiers asking for your order and bringing it promptly. What they lack in staff is what they more then make up for in quality of sandwiches. Food - Hey wasn't that on... yes, yes it was. DiNic's has been on a lot of shows, and that's where the touristy part comes in. But the quality is unbeatable, the staple you have to try is the Roast Pork Sandwich with Sharp Provolone and Greens (broccoli rabe for the uninitiated). Flavors come together and will make you use the generous supply of napkins in each bag. Best part, if you go with a small eater, you can split a sandwich and a drink for a little over $10. Unless you don't want to share. Roast Beef is excellent as well, but plan to know your order BEFORE you get in line to pay. Intangibles - One thing I appreciate about DiNic's is the quality. Like other places in the Reading Terminal, unmatched amount of care and emphasis placed on the quality of their products. You get more then what you pay for out of each sandwich, take that to the bank. Overall - Is it something you should try in Philadelphia if you're visiting. Absolutely. But also make sure to try the Chicken Italiano and an Original Cheesesteak while you're in town. DiNic's is only a part of the three headed monster of savory sandwiches to try during your trip, and well worth the value.
