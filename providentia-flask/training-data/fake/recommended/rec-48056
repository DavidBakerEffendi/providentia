Dad and Grandpa came to town wanting Peter Luger's special burger, they left with the realization that nothing could beat Walter Foods' Short Rib Burger. Williamsburg has no better burger. I used to think of Dumont as one of the best burgers. I realize now, it holds no candle. Nor does Williamsburger or Relish or any other in the area. The use of short ribs instead of chuck or round gave a juicy flavor that didn't leave you with a soggy bun and juices all over your hands. I take my burgers medium-rare, at first look this looked a little under done, but upon initial bite i realized my eyes had lied to me. If I had to design a perfect burger, this is it. With only a single burger on a menu so delectable, this burger isn't frivolous and isn't over simplified, it's quite mind blowing. Their burger comes standard with bacon and cheddar. It is designed for these flavors to be enjoyed together in harmony. It needed no condiments. This burger was indeed perfect.
