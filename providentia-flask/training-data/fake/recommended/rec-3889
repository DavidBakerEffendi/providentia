If you are a lover of burgers living in or around NYC, you must add Umami Burger to your to-do burger list. Umami is known for their special, creative flavors and inventive burgers, and this location is the first on the East Coast. I dined here on a recent rainy Friday night with a friend. We showed up around 6:30 and only waited about 10 minutes--this may be due to the weather or to our smaller party size. The waitress rushed into asking us about drinks and didn't mention anything about the "umami-ness" of certain things. Even though she didn't explain, the menu was helpful at suggestion want to order if you wanted the full umami experience. I went with the Truffle Burger and my friend had the Original. The Truffle Burger had the best flavors, from the cheese to the graze. Also what a great bun! Held everything together perfectly. The burgers were cooked medium rare (I normally like my medium) but I didn't mind the extra juice and the meat was perfect--I too enjoyed the crust on the burger pattie everyone talks about. My friend and I shared an order of the thin fries and the fried pickles and loved all the sauces. Umami Burger stands out and hold its own in a city obsessed with burgers. Not the spot to go if you want a good ole fashioned burger, but worth the hype to try something fancy.
