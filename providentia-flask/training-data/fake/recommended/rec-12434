I've been here a couple of times. The food is fresh but I'm not sure it's worth the wait or the price. One order of pancakes is $14. On my most recent visit I spent $26 on an order of pancakes with sugar cured bacon and a cappuccino to go. Â The pancakes were great, especially with the warm maple butter. The do charge $2 for extra maple butter. The sugar cured bacon was great but the cappuccino was one of the worst I've ever had. It had some weird aftertaste. On a previous visit, I split the blueberry pancakes and huevos rancheros with a friend. The huevos rancheros were ok but nothing special. None of the flavors really stood out and you couldn't really taste the eggs. Blueberry pancakes were good. Take out also takes about 20 - 30 mins during prime times. I would say try once.
