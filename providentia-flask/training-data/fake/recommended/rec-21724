I struggle with the Ippudo and overall ramen craze influencing the city right now. It was good and tasty but the dining experience and price were not worth it. I find it tough to overlook a few of the inconveniences at Ippudo: The hostesses will not seat you until your entire party is present They constantly try to rush you during the meal, you would have trouble sitting here for an hour without being pestered They don't let you split the bill more than 4 ways Of course for large parties they charge 20% implied gratuity(no chance it would be 18%) $60 sake bottles?? Every time you enter the dining room someone is greeting/yelling at you Maybe it's an authentic Japanese/ramen experience but I'd rather shell out this type of cash on a more enjoyable dining experience. Their one win is that the bao buns were pretty good.
