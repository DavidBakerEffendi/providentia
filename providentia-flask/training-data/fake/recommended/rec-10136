Verdict: An amazing place to have brunch in NY. The on the house Sangria bar has interesting varieties and the bread basket is just the way BBs should be at a brunch place. Food's great and the ambiance lively ! Location: We went to the Calle Ocho on the Upper West Side. The place is huge and one might have to wait couple of minutes before getting a seat. No outdoor seating. Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty big, with the bar upfront and big hall at the back. Buzzing with activity, its a very lively place over the weekend. One of the highlights is the Sangria bar which is on the house when you get one entrée, has many varieties and large jars topped up for all "sat-afternoon-is-a-good-time-to-get-tipsy" crowd. Food: As I mentioned the bread basket is great ! Its an assortment of different breads unlike many restaurants which just stack up two types of bread and offer some olive oil to dip it in. This place has atleast 6-7 types of bread, different shapes, textures, fillings and taste. For entree I stuck to a basic omelette but I have to mention the accompanying  salsa was fantastic. I tried the Mojito Sangria and loved it. Deserts - go for the Crema Catalana - you wont regret it ! Let me know how it goes Service: Was prompt except one instance where the server took very long to get us sauces but what the heck ! everything else was as good as it gets.   I am going there again soon ! This place goes on my must-do-brunch list.
