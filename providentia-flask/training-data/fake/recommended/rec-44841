What is one thing I cant go on vacation without? My Yelp app. I am so happy to have found MLC. This place was simply awesome. Awesome beer and cocktail list...awesome menu...awesome service. The menu was inventive and uses all local ingredients. And you can taste the difference. The small plates are VERY small. So if you want to gorge, order the entree for two with 3 sides. There were too many things I wanted to try so we went with small plates. And we loved everything. Everything. We must look like out of towners because our server, whose name I did not get, asked us where we were from. He was so busy but was always sure to stop by several times to ask us how we liked everything and make conversation. SUCH a nice guy. He invited us back for lunch the following day because we told him we were leaving town and we unfortunately couldnt make it due to an unexpected tire repair! But I would not hesitate to return multiple times during my next trip to Burlington. Hell, this place alone is worth the 5 hour drive. My ONLY issue, and maybe its just me being sensitive but due to the open kitchen my eyes were burning like hell from whatever smoke/stuff was in the air. And my hair and clothes stunk like food when we left. So if this bothers you, wait for an outdoor table. I would suffer with stinky hair again if I had to though!!
