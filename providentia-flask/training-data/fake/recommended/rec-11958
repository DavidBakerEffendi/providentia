Eek! Methinks not.  Horrible service, sat down looked at the menu and being a table with 2 vegetarians noticed that there wasn't many options.  Asked the waitress if there were any specials and she said she would explain the menu - and what did we want to drink.  Asked her to explain the menu but she said she was just getting our drink order now.  REALLY?  Ok, well you suck and the place really needs to investigate the actions of their staff.  If a customer asks about the menu, explain the menu.  $350 later totally unsatisfied and irritated.  Wish I could give them no stars. Small portions except if you order the duck liver then be prepared for a pound of it.
