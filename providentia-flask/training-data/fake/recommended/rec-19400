Really wonderful food - quality at a great price. This was my first dinner out in Philly with my husband to begin a weekend trip.  Other reviews helped me bookmark it as a possible place to eat, and I'm glad we ended up going there early on. It's easy to walk to if you have accommodations in the Washington Square West neighborhood and the atmosphere is casual, but intimate.  We must have had dinner on early enough in the evening because we didn't have to wait for a table.   Service was great and I had one of their seafood/pasta specials that was amazing (the seafood was cooked just right).  Portions were nice too.  And although we passed on dessert, our waitress was so sweet to come back with a little slice of tiramisu at no charge.  Maybe she picked up on the fact my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary?  Either way, it was a wonderful meal.  Too bad I don't live closer or I'd make a point of eating there all the time.
