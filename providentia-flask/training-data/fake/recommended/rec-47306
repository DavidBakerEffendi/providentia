This is a very cute and idyllic place. Tucked away in the West Village, it is a great restaurant for weekend brunch! Even though my friends and I had to wait for almost an hour, the lovely ambiance and the food that followed made it worth it. My two friends had Eggs Benedict with salmon and Basque Scramble, and they both really enjoyed their dishes. I, having a weak spot for mascarpone (!), just had to have the banana french toast - and it was delicious! What's not to love about well cooked french toast with melted creamy cheese? The portions are also quite big - I could not finish the plate. My only complaint is that the french toast was a monotonous dish of sweetness and "soft" texture. It could have had less bread and more elements that were crunchy, tart (more berries), or even savory (e.g., breakfast sausage). The toasts were swimming in a pool of Â syrup; having the syrup on the side would've helped to cut down the sweetness. Overall, it was a very good experience and I will definitely be back for more!
