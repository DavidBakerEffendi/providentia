This is a close call--I would say this place hovers on the edge of being four stars, really something like 3.8 in my book. It's a neighborhood joint. If I lived within six blocks or so, I'd eat here a fair amount, it's good trattoria-ish Italian food. Servers are amiable, it's got a relaxed feeling, it's BYO. The food's somewhat uneven, though: I've been a bit underwhelmed by some of it even in its own terms.
