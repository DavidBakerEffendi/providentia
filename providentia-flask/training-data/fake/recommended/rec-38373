So it's a little bit of a dive and for me it's Burlington's tastiest dive by far. You definitely want the Chicken Kabob on a pita... the sauce is divine but wear a raincoat... it goes everywhere! Their fries are dashingly good as well... but I'm too busy squirting sauce everywhere to mess around with fries.
