One of the previous reviews said this was the best Mexican Restaurant in the area. I'd agree, but honestly, that's not saying much. Good Mexican restaurants in North Jersey are few and far between. The service here was good, but the food was just average, in my opinion. You could certainly do worse, but don't go out of your way
