The concept is neat.  It's basically like a convienence store but with a selection of hot prepared foods in containers (rice dishes, noodle dishes, soups, meat dishes) and cold pepared foods (sushi rolls, salmon and rice dishes, salads, cold noodles).  We got the scallion pancakes and a vegetable roll and we were sad!  We shoudl have gotten a warm rice dish instead since that's what everyone was eating.  The scallion pancakes and roll had almost no flavor!  We ended up having to use soy sauce the whole time.  We probably got the wrong dishes since the place was packed!
