As a child my mom was a "career woman" which apparently means you do not cook for your family. We ate at ol' Tiger's Tale at least 2 or 3 times a week. In those days, I wasn't a vegetarian, and I loveeeeed their crab dip, buffalo wings, and salads with little baby shrimp on top. (I was also a fat child) I still love the salads, sans shrimp. Basically, the Tale is just a great townie bar where you can run in to everyone from your best friend's dad, your history teacher, former classmates from high school, single old men on the prowl, or your neighbor. The atmosphere is... almost gross, but the staff (all too old to be working at a townie bar) make up for it. It is the perfect place to grab a burger and beer and one of the few options in Montyg.
