Had dinner with my girl last Friday night.  It was a dead night downtown due to the Phillies game being on, but we still had a 45 minute wait for a table.  Glad we waited.  We had a great little meal consisting of an excellent prohibition cocktail, an enormous chilled tequila that filled a martini glass, a fried shrimp appetizer, and a heavenly burger with heavenly cheese fries.  The drinks were excellent and reasonable considering the neoghborhood.  The app was good, not great, but after betting on whether we were going to get 3 or 4 shrimp for the $7 price, my date and I were stunned to count about 15 medium sized shrimp.  After that hit the spot, the village burger with thousand island dressing, bleu cheese and carmelized onions ($16) came out, as did the $7 duck fat cheese fries.  The portions were big, and all of it was melt in your mouth good.  The burger meat was of excellent quality and very well ground, something I look for in a burger.  The bun was perfect, toppings just right, and it was cooked perfectly.  The fries were dreamy, probably the best I've had.  All of that excellence was served in a small but upbeat, quirky fun setting.  The menu is limited, but I'm sure everything the they do is done with perfection in mind.  I have a new go to spot in the RIttenhouse area.
