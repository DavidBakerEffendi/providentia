I took my Greek friend here yesterday for a belated birthday brunch.  She had been talking about it for weeks as a place I needed to try, and I always take advice from someone who is a native. We were in heaven.  Rather than ordering from the brunch menu (that looked great) we decided to order a feast of different "stix" and sharing plates.  Everything was fantastic, and a few things stood out.  the veggie crisps,  spicy cheese spread, Greek fries, kataifi, and corsica cocktail were all delicious.  My absolute favorites were the tzatziki, which was so fresh with tiny chunks of cucumber, as well as the feta sauce that came with the sack of potatoes - just amazing.   The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was amazing.  I was quite impressed with the fact that the owner was not only present in the restaurant the entire meal, but he greeted each table many times.  Not just to ask how things were, but as if we were family.   I enjoyed myself so much that I changed the location for my meeting this evening from one of my other favorite places in the city to Stix.  Now if they figure out how to get saganaki on a stick, I'm never leaving!   Thank you for a wonderful time!
