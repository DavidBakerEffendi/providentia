We were a party of ten, which in my experience can mean the service is disjointed, not at Alla Spina, the service was excellent. Advise about ordering was very good and we were happy with the variety of small plates and entrees. The noise was a bit much, especially as it was self inflicted with music. We look forward to returning.
