The prices are quite astronomical. The food here tastes very good and they have a unique spin on the paleo-centric diet craze. Many of the entrees are very tasty as are the sides. The raw vegetable mash is very tasty and the Quinoa is very good as well. The Miso Chicken is great and the Hu Joe (similar to a sloppy joe) is very tasty. However, at around 10-13 dollars a meal, I would have to say I can't recommend this place for regular eating. The quantities are minimal and the desserts are quite expensive as well. I eat here a few times a month and I have to say the food is good, but the prices, quantity and such are not.
