I had always wondered about Market Table. Every time I was in the neighborhood, I peered into the floor to ceiling tiled windows and promised myself to give it a shot! Boyfriend and I decided there was no better day to try this place than on my birthday. Every single part of this meal was perfect: the decor, the staff, the food, the ambiance. We ordered the corn off the cob, the chicken and the pork tenderloin. There was something magical about this corn off the cob. It had an awesome kick and creaminess. I would order three plates of this as a meal if I had the guts to do it. The chicken skin was oh so perfectly seared: it was crispy and full of flavor. It was served over cheesy deliciousness. I could have done with a liiittle less cheese, but still the combination of the fontina and the chicken was decadent and yummy. The pork tenderloin was wrapped in bacon and well you can't really go wrong with pig wrapped in pig. The mushrooms served with the tenderloin seemed just a tad disjointed, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. For dessert we had the ice cream sandwich. The cookies were soft and the ice cream was FRESHLY MADE. God this was good. The other notable aspect of this meal was the service. This may have been the best service I've had in New York in a long time. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable, kind and helpful. The bus boy, too, was attentive, knew plenty about the menu and very friendly. I couldn't have asked for better service. I also just love how they bring out that little book with your check. It's fun to read what others have written and not to feel like you're being rushed out of the restaurant. Market Table was amazing. It may even have bested Little Owl! I will ABSOLUTELY go again.
