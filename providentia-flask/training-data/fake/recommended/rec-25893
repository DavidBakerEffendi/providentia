While very tight on space, and difficult to get seating (I hate just waiting in a huddled group, when we don't have a reservation) it's a phenomenal place, and the food is amazing.    Other reviewers are correct, it's VERY loud, so dispel any notions you have about a "quiet, romantic, dinner".   Come here to be SOCIAL, or stay home.
