Not THE best Italian ever, but delish nonetheless. The bread was warm and crunchy in just the right spots (insert sexual joke here).  My Cesar salad was mediocre, but my gnocchi was heavenly.  I feel like they kind of skimped on the portion size, considering how large the damn plate was.  My tartufo was AMAZING.  When you put chocolate AND ice cream together, I'm pretty much a total sucker (insert additional sexual joke here). The tables are quite small, and I challenge you to eat dinner with 8 other family members, fit 2 bottles of wine, wine and water glasses, appetizer and entree plates without feeling ridiculously cramped.  The service was pretty wonderful- very on top of their shit. It was really crowded on this Wednesday night between 730-830.  I'm unsure if it was because families were indulging on pre-Thanksgiving get-togethers like mine- or if it's like this on every Wednesday.  Either way, it would probably be a more a pleasant experience minus most of the people and the loud conversations. +1 though for their BYOB rule.  And thank god my cousins from California know how to chose their wines....
