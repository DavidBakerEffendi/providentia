Unfortunately, it seems that all of the negative reviews of Hu Kitchen here focus on the price, but what people fail to realize is that healthy ingredients cost more, so of course the customer is going to have to pay a little more as a result. Yes, grass-fed beef is going to cost a little more than that McDonalds cheeseburger, but it's worth it, both in taste and what it does to your body. The truth is that Hu is not expensive, just more expensive than the usual fast food that most people eat for lunch. The bowls will run you $7.95 for a regular, $9.95 for a large (go with the large), and they are fantastic. Good, hearty food that leaves you full and not reaching for the snack drawer an hour later. My recommendation - get half vegetable medley and half quinoa topped with the Hu Joe beef. Breakfast is also delicious, with the grain-free jordi pancakes and the bacon, egg and kale sandwich both solid choices. And no matter what time of day it is, try the Chia seed pudding, which is one of my favorite desserts in the entire city. If you want to spend $4 on a greasy sandwich somewhere, by all means, do that. But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for, and the extra couple of dollars spent here is well worth it in my book.
