My new favorite neighborhood spot! I'm SO glad it opened just a few blocks away! I eat at this place a couple of times a week and I'm always blown away at the perfect proportions/portions of the food and the small and subtly touches. The Cajun Club is my favorite sandwich by far! It's both hardy and filling and yet the fish is cooked delicately and balanced by the cajun spiced aioli! The roasted tomato omelette is out-of-this-world good! It's the perfect degree of fluffy and all the flavors of the ingredients are experiences equally with almost every bite! On top of that Sarah and Donovan (aka Malcolm) are awesome and friendly people that always make you feel at home in their cozy grub hub! Thanks guys for the amazing food!
