Just recently moved back to the NJ area after 13 yrs. Fiancee & I headed out to Forno's to have an early Valentine's Day dinner. The place was crowded as usual ( no change from the last time I was there 13 yrs ago) which I always take as a good sign. After a 2 hour wait and 1 pitcher of Sangria, we were finally seated. Our server was very friendly and apologized for the long wait. Fiancee had the stuffed lobster tail and I had the stuffed pork chops. Both were absolutely delicious. The stuffed lobster tail was so huge, we wound up taking it home & making lobster omelets for brunch the following afternoon. If you don't mind the wait, definitely stop here for dinner. If you're in a hurry, then go to a fast food joint.
