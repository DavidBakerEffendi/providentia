JBs is my favorite place in Philly to see a show! It's a small intimate venue (venue is upstairs, bar / restaurant downstairs). They always have great shows and really promote local music (and beer). The food downstairs is great to grab a bite before the show. It's also cool to hang and play pool. But really, keep an eye out for the bands that come through here, the music is always a good time. I like to drop in, even if I don't know who's playing.
