I dunno, I don't really like the burgers here and I'll tell you why. It wasn't busy because we came on a Sunday right before noon. I had the original and my friend had a special turkey burger. It was our first time so we ordered the fries too. The fries were plain and the umami ketchup didn't really do anything for me. It did have a different taste to it but I'd go with the mayo or just straight up regular ketchup. On to the burger. It is juicy and has flavor I felt it was missing something. I mean I ate the whole thing because it's tiny but for the price and what you get, I'd rather go to Shake Shack which honestly has a better burger. Maybe I'll come back and try a different burger but for now, the hype of this place and the burgers they serve leave much to be desired.
