Every time I go here, I miss the Dark Horse. It's funny, the last year or two of the Dark Horse showed a clear downhill slide, and the Cavanaugh's team has done a pretty good job cleaning up and improving the bars inside, but still, it just feels bro-ier and more generic now. The space hasn't really changed. The ground floor bar is still deceptively small and quiet, with the real activity in the main bar upstairs down a long hallway. There are more TVs than before, filling in some gaps where no TVs could be seen from the bar stools. The tap list isn't really improved either. The dining room and whisky bar seem to be in better shape now. The food is pretty generic sports bar fare now, and on a busy night you're likely to get a plastic cup instead of a proper English pint. It's still a decent place to watch sports, but it's just another face in the crowd, instead of having a real identity.
