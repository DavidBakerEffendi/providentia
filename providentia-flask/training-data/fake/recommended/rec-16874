Farmhouse is good (but way taxed). I was hesitant to write this review for a few reasons, but I'll lay it all out. The first time I went I ordered an entree which was some sort of meatloaf plate. Being a big comfort food fan, I was excited to have an upscale version of the often frightening classic. I was left disappointed and unsatisfied as the meatloaf was dry and bland. So were the sides that came with it. Wuh wuh. After paying $21.00 for meatloaf I felt like a chump. Â Lesson learned. The next time I went I had a burger and it was good. I will never stray from the burger menu again. I like to go for the local beef burger and add a fried egg on top. They know how to properly cook/season a burger (a rare thing in Burlington), so I'll give them props for that. The appetizers/charcuterie are always pretty good. The steak tartar is a shining jewel of Farmhouse. Perfectly seasoned and the house made chips that I use to shovel it down my gullet are delicious. The beers are the real reason to check this place out. They always have the biggest selection of Hill Farmstead beers, and a lot of other unique offerings on draught and in bottles. All in all Farmhouse is a great place. You won't find me ordering an entree there, but as far as apps and beers go this place is quality.
