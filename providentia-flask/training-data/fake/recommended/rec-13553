born and raised in the Bay Area, and after living the last 2 years in London, hearing about this gem of a place was like coming home. literally. fresh, tender, tasty. good... they melt the cheese onto the tortilla.... yum. it was tiny, with hardly any seats, so much more suited to take away, but if you can nab a seat, the people watching it fun. i will make it a point to go there every time im in town.
