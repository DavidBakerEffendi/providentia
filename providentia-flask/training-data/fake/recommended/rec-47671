If only the enthusiasm from staff were on par with what sat on my plate.  To be more direct-Great staff.  Sushi not so much.  Rice was so sticky is mirrored old.  Part of me appreciated the maple infuse/pickled ginger.  The other (greater) part was upset.   If you're thinking I want some great raw sushi- then this is not your place.  If you like California rolls and raw fish scares you a little bit- then this place may be for you. The one thing that I cannot reconcile is the old rice.  Thus the two stars.
