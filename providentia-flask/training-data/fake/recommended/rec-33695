Shithouse.  The only way to describe our experience at Palma tonight. We arrived to a lovely and quaint restaurant, a front room with bar and back farmhouse separated by a covered garden.  That's where the goodness ended. The three of us ordered different things, and before any of them came, we discussed the recent NY Times article written about the 100 things that all restaurants should do.  Needless to say, Palma did very few. 1. Bring the food out at the same time.  Each of our three main courses was separated by a 5 min lag.  One of us would finish before the next person could begin.  Nice. 2. Listen to your customers orders.  One of us ordered linguini with a marinara and basil sauce..."no cheese please".  They brought it out with cheese pre-sprinkled.  When we sent it back, the waiter nosily asked "why, are you allergic to cheese?"  The obvious response..."it doesn't matter, I ordered it without cheese."   3. The aforementioned linguini marinara was horrible.  Sauce was straight out of a can.  And by can, I don't mean Paul Newman or Classico.  I mean Sysco.  Basil nowhere to be found. 4.  The papardelli lamb ragu was horribly salty.  I know we're in a recession and all, but please, we'd appreciate fresh meat. 5.  We ordered desert and coffee.  When he asked if we wanted the coffee with the desert (which took some time to cook), we said yes.  5 mins later the coffee comes out.  10 mins after that, the desert arrives.  Lovely. 6.  I dropped a fork while the waiter stood next to me.  No response. 7.  When the check arrived, we noticed that they charged us $19 for the linguini marinara...more than the lamb ragu or the creamy sage stuffed dumpling pasta.  Of course they did, it was a custom off-menu item. 8.  My friend has horrible gas. Shithouse.
