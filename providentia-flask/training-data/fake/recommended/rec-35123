Home Sweet Harlem is dear to my heart. I remember fondly the original location on 135th. It was my go to spot for feel good food. I loved the old fashioned oven and the warm hospitality. I'm so glad for this second coming. Cheers to you, Donna! Well done, well done... I now live in Texas, but will frequent Home Sweet Harlem when I'm in the city.
