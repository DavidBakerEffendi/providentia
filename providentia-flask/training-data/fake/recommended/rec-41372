best thing to do when you come here is to share everything family style even though they aren't meant to be served that way. I say this because every dish was so delicious it seemed selfish not to share it with everyone else at the table! the night I went we shared... turnip soup, mustard green salad, fried anchovies, duck leg, seafood chowder, and some dessert that was good but seems to have slipped my mind as to what it was. oops. eat on!
