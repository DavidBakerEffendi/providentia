Akamaru Modern & Pork Buns are the only way to go.  This place had such high expectations to live up to and it did!  The Akamaru Modern is warm and delicious, and the pork buns are succulent.  Can't wait to come back! Only complaints are that I would have liked more egg in the ramen, the cocktails were fine but nothing too exciting, and the seats we sat in were super uncomfortable.
