Really cute and quaint place. I was a bit disappointed that they don't do pancakes on the weekends. I had the pumpkin waffles instead, which are pretty tasty - they took me by surprise though as they were more savoury than I thought they would be. Love the apple butter here. Hubby had an egg sandwich, which looked really good. The side of fries were great - really really moreish! I liked this place - it's great for a leisurely brunch or lunch. There were pretty long queues on the weekend, though.
