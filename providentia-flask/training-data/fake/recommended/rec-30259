Came for brunch on a Sunday and made reservations for 1230, didn't have to wait. Got the egg burrito and the aycd brunch special, and your choices were margaritas, mimosas, and bloody Marys. I only had mimosas but my friends said the margaritas were pretty strong as an FYI. The food was pretty good with small/medium sized portions for the brunch food. Like other yelpers said you need to go with the fresh guac, its fresh and 5 stars by itself. I think the drinking limit is 1.5 hours and there's a special if you check in on yelp to get something free. Last time we got a free dessert, now it looks like they're offering a rosalita.
