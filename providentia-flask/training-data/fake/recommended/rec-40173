My wife and I just had one (huge) garden salad and a meatball hoagie to split. We are stuffed and happy and only spent $16 including tip. Meatballs are spicy and salty. I'd recommended ordering it with extra sauce. Blue cheese dressing was bland. I'll be back. Just what you'd want in a neighborhood joint .
