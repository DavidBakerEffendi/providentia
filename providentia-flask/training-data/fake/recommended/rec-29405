We went here for dinner a few weeks ago, and I didn't know what to expect, except that I heard the hummus was good. As it turns out, the food Â - all of it - is outstanding. I wish I remembered what we had, but it was the tasting menu which included the lamb as the entree. Additionally, the waitstaff was great. They explained everything to us, and described the condiments to us. When we had some questions about the wine list, they were able to answer them as well. We will definitely be coming back. The only negative thing I will say is that it was a little bit difficult to find the restaurant. Part of it was because we didn't know *exactly* where it was, though.
