My fiance and I were really excited to get back to NYC and try the famous chicken and rice cart.  We live in DC, and there are a couple of metro halaal food carts here that we really love, so we had extreme expectations for the famouse 53rd and 6th cart. We did wait in line to receive our combos -- which was fine, you expect a line at a famous foodery, right?  The service was also good/prompt -- we were provided our order immediately.  Where I fail to see the 'greatness' was the actual tasting of the food.  We both sauced our meals with the white and red.  I was told prior that the red sauce was so blazingly hot that I wouldn't be able to take it.  Perhaps I picked up the wrong red bottle that evening, because I didn't taste the heat at all. The meat was cooked fine, as well as the rice.  The added bonus of the naan is really great when you're hankering for some bread.  However, we both felt that the dish was lacking in flavor, especially when we've heard so much hype about this place.  Next time, we'll probably just head over to kati roll company instead :)
