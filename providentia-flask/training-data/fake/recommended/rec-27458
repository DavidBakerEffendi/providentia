Evidently there's been a doorman at CB for a couple of years now...and I never knew because he only works from 10 pm on. He was also kind of a jerk, but I'm not taking a star away, since the experience was forgotten as soon as my boy (the aforementioned server) got me a table in the back and brought out the McSorley's...which is $2.75 now!!
