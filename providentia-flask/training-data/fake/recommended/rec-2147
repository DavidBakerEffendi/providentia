This is Very Cute & Adorable spot , just recently opened in the South St.area, right in the 16th block. Found it on Yelp, wanted to try it out as a Brunch spot .Well-First you can't go wrong serving La Columbe Coffee. The Only problem I had was , when you enter, go to counter & order, And they bring it out to you. The Brunch crowd, when we ordering the Coffee, she asked if we wanted small or large(in Paper cups) , we were dining in, so my brunch buddy & I asked can we get mugs, we are dining in, and there was the Refill issue. Girl at the counter said, well its an extra charge if you are doing refills...??!!@@.That kinda deterred us. * Guess just being open under 3 weeks, still working out the bugs.... We did meet the owner/Chef, he was VERY Personable & quite open to suggestions & critiquing his place. .He did say we do need to figure out the refill of coffee , etc , guess first thing is are you dining in or take out , should be 1st question ask patrons..then determine how to navigate the orders. I do understand they are New, learning curve & take out Â vs. Server at tables, but if your dining in, especially on weekends, should be service or refills on coffee, not another Extra charge. The self service coffee desk was all the way in front side, just seemed clunky to me..but I'm sure they will work out their bugs!!!. The Food: They had small chalk board with Daily specials, we got French toast with berries, it was good, & side bacon. All in all good, 1 star less for coffee mishap, but I'm sure it will go up on our next visit. Return Factor: Yes, wanna try other things on menu, like Flat-bread -looked wonderful. Thank you Mike !! For wonderful Brunch & meeting you-Best of luck on this cute & wonderful spot!!!
