I just got back from vacation and had a serious attack of meat... big Gyro meat. I gave them a call and the guy who took my order was uber-friendly but I wish I can say the same for the food they delivered. It looked like someones leftover!! I took three bites and had to flushed it down my toilet. Just the look/smell/taste was gross! If I was on drugs I give it a second chance, but drugs r bad.
