Pros: though I was very hesitant about going, im glad I tried this place out.  It is completely gluten-free, which was great for the two people in our group with celiac.  The food was delicious and tasted fresh and healthy. Cons: the high price and low portion size almost made me miss whatever chemicals allow other restaurants to give me a meal intended for a grown man.  The seating situation was also a bit hectic.
