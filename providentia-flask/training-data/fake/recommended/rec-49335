I lived down the street from Basta for two years and must have gone between five and ten times. I went to Basta for a variety of occasions -- dinner/drinks, drinks and apps, dessert. There are slim pickings for good Italian in downtown New Haven, and I wouldn't call Basta a sufficient solution.   Because of some ill-timed breakups, a good friend of mine and I had a tradition of platonic V-Day dates at Basta, where he'd always already made reservations. Now, Basta is terrifically gaudy in that mediocre-Italian-restaurant way already; the Valentine's decorations definitely edged the restaurant into the realm of the comic.  Given the nature of our platonic V-Day excursions, this was fine, but if I actually had come here with a date, the Barry White soundtrack would have been slightly unnerving. I'm sure for the patrons actually hoping to get it on later those nights were a little unnerved by disparate combination of high prefix prices and the wave of tacky. As for food, Basta is hit-or-miss. My friend, who is vegetarian, was for two years in a row served pasta with meat. Another occasion saw undercooked noodles. I think I've had two pretty decent pastas from Basta, the arrabbiata and the pesto -- and for the prices you're paying, that's not a cheering statistic. Service was always okay, but that didn't make up for the food. While I appreciate supporting sustainable food practices, Basta is grossly overpriced. Though no fault of the restaurant, the last time a friend and I were there we were scolded for sending back wrong dishes by another patron eating alone at the table next to us. Don't think I'll ever go back.
