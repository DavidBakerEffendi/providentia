unnngggh. I moan with pleasure at the thought of Tom's diner. Also a little pain. There has not been one single time that i've gone to Tom's without eating to the point of exhaustion, or nausea. Favorites: lemon ricotta pancakes, danish pancakes, french fries, eggs benedict, nice strong coffee The little assortment of flavored butter is amazing. Usually it's cinnamon, strawberry and lemon so you have a butter to complement any pancake you order. The only con is the customary wait but the line usually goes quickly plus someone comes out bearing gifts of free coffee, cookies, french fries and/or orange slices. Its probably the most charming thing about Tom's. Go there if you can, you wont regret it!
