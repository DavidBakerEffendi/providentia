Osteria was extremely mediocre--if even that. My boyfriend and I went on a Tuesday night and it was unbelievably busy.  I am still trying to figure out how a place that serves bland, overpriced food in a pretentious yet not at all inspiring setting can be so busy--or even staying in business!! We tried the fig/gorgonzola/speck pizza to start.  A delicious idea, but executed very poorly.  The crust took over half of the pizza, there were about 6 figs on the entire thing and it felt like a treasure hunt to actually eat a bite that had something on it---FINE for a free happy hour buffet pizza, not OK for $16. Our next course was the grouper entree ($26) with chanterelle mushrooms and leeks.  Let's just say the grouper must have been very happy in its afterlife because it got to be halfway immersed in water and swimming in a sea of oily fishy dilly juice that managed to overpower the chanterelles and leeks in blandness.  We sent this back because frankly, you can get a better fish for $5 from the frozen section of Trader Joe's and be way more satisfied. We then had the ravioli thinking if this place was Italian, maybe we were just choosing the wrong things--and we should give it a final chance by ordering something fairly simple.  Well of course if you drench anything in cheese, salt and butter it is bound to have a flavor but the "postage stamp ravioli" was soggy, soft and not worth any further commentary. That basically concluded our dining experience there.  Oh, might I add that for their attempts at a fancy shmancy environment (which at first I was excited about since my beloved Fairmount neighborhood doesn't have too many places that warrant putting on a fancy dress) the soap in the bathroom was a friggin' CVS container of DIAL.  Pshh. At least put the Dial in a nice soap dispenser or something if you are going to continue this charade. If you're looking for Italian food you'd be better off at the Olive Garden.  Just kidding.  Kind of.
