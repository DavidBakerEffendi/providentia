I have been to Supper twice already..and each time i have not been disappointed with the quality of the food and their excellent wine list.  The only downfall is that you have to be prepared to wait for a table in a quite chaotic setting.  Word of advice--do not go when it is raining, or you will be forced to be crammed into their small bar.  Luckily their bartender is super empathetic and even bought us a round, and let my dad sample some wine. Such a nice guy!  Once you are seated, the ambiance is great, a bit noisy, but fun, great for a group of people....if you can get a table that is.
