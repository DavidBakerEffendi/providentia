We love this pizza. The sausage and onion is delicious and they do not skimp on the toppings. The owners are always friendly and when they say 15 minutes for a pick up, you might have to wait an additional 2 when you get there. Just great pizza and always consistent. I gave it 4 stars but considered 5. Not sure if it is as good as it gets, but I am definitely a fan. We get a couple of pizzas here a month and always Â enjoy every bite!
