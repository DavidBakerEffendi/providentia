So the food at this establishment is pretty good, however, bad service will always trump good food at a restaurant. The waiter I had was insanely rude and short and not very attentive at all! He made my friend I very uncomfortable while treating others better in front of us! I will never go back to this place even though there food was pretty good and so were the margaritas with the chile rim.
