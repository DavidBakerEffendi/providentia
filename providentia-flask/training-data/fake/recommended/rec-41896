Modo Mio is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Everytime I eat here I am never disappointed and I leave with a full and happy tummy! The mussels are a must, followed by their rabbit ravioli (to die for!). I would highly recommend this byob to anyone and everyone! I recommend calling ahead for a reservation, arriving a little early and heading across the street to the wine and spirits before you enjoy the best meal of your life!
