Neat Place. Was over at Yale Bowl and they suggested it as a place the locals favor. The server told me they are open less than a year and have a strong following. She gave me the background on the tables and wood paneling on the bar and big room dividing doors being handmade out of recycled Connecticut woods, the focus on farm-to-table, wines from sustainable vineyards, etc. We were 6 and were seated in a big roomy booth that looked out through big windows onto the busy avenue. The booth had high backs so you had a sense of privacy but could easily feel and be part of the vibe of the place. There is a vibe. The place was full and loud. People were having a good time. People seemed to know each other and were relaxed and comfortable. Wine list was different with many European selections. Prices were very reasonable so we a little worried about quality. The general manager helped us pick a white from Austria to start and a Spanish red for the meal. Both tasted great and were excellent values. We had a second bottle of the red. I had the Norwalk clams casino appetizer and the Heirloom Poussin or chicken. This was my first poussin and it was something different. It's a single serving whole bird. It is bigger than what I know as a Rock Cornish Hen and just right for a meal for one. They cook it in the brick oven and serve it whole. With the finger towel they provide you can dive in but keep everything tidy. Dessert was a simple but tasty apple crisp. Good dining experience.
