BURGERS - SALADS - PASTAS. EVERYTHING HERE IS AMAZING. Prices are good, staff is friendly and know what they're doing, atmosphere is pretty loud and cramped (which is to be expected from a place that serves AWESOME food). So far I've tried and would recommend: Bronte or whaley burger, and if you're looking to be a bit more healthy try the Blondi! They all come with a small side of fresh mixed greens dressed in balsamic vinaigrette. The roasted pumpkin salad with grilled chicken is bomb-tastic! And their spicy italian sausage rigatoni pasta is also amazing. Looking forward to coming back and trying everything else on the menu!
