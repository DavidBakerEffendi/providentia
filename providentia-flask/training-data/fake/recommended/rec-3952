Okay. These are the things to know: I just came home to Brooklyn with a pocketful of Habañero Mango Mayo. RELAX. It was in soufflé cups. I'm not crazy. Well. Maybe a little. At any rate, the lovely and friendly person whose name I never caught gave me extra because, well, It was so damn good and I wouldn't shut up about it. Seriously...I'd put it on pancakes. Your mileage may vary there, so I'd stick with putting it on a burger at first and then see how you feel. The sliders. Yes. Really that's all there is to say about them. "Yes". Eat them. Eat all of them. The bacon one has the bacon INSIDE the rest of the burger meat. Do you realize how magical this is? You don't. But you will. When you try it. Friendly and beautiful bartender whose name I did not catch (but who, it turns out, used to live a mere block from me) assured me that there was in fact a magical animal from which they harvested this burger-with-bacon-already-inside meat, and that it was totally humane, and that it was more akin to shearing a sheep. I'm inclined to believe her, because life is more fun when you believe in magic. Anyway, we got there just a hair before closing time but they welcomed us in, we talked of the ins and outs of other cities (Detroit good, Philly bad?) with the staff and other patrons, and we ate the living hell out of some of the best fresh-made-in-front-of-your-eyes sliders I've ever had. The atmosphere was great. The staff was friendly and welcoming, they were playing great tunes from someone's iPhone (or iPod touch...who am I, Steve Jobs?) but it was quiet enough for a conversation...suffice it to say it was a blasty blast. Oh yeah, there was beer. Which, you know, isn't bad. Craft beer even. If that's your bag, baby. Point is. Go there. Now. Before I go eat the rest of the burgers and steal the magic bacon animal from their cellar. If I can't have it...you know the rest.
