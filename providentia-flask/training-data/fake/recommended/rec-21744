Beyond! Food was outrageous.  I had the blackened catfish and ordered a side of mashed potatoes with gravy that would normally go on the meatloaf.  Beyond.  So delicious.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the waiter asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and seemed annoyed when I said I wanted a table (I was dining alone).  My cocktail was also delicious - I had the Sippie Wallace.
