Went with a friend recently and we split a pizza and a pasta dish.  Pizza was excellent, with thin crust and thin layer of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese--perfect.  We also shared a vegetarian pasta--whole wheat linguini with pine nuts, raisins, carrots and more--also excellent.  Plenty of food.  In fact we took home about half the pizza.  Cost with soft drinks and coffee was about $35.  Great place. Good service, too.
