Been there twice, the food is great. I got the rabbit stew special the first time and a cheese and hummus platter the second. Both were really good. Also tried the moussaka. The place is BYOB, which is also very nice. Only complaint is that I made a reservation last time and still ended up waiting nearly half an hour for the table, and probably another 10-15 minutes just to get someone to acknowledge that we had been seated and come by to check on us. I'd still go back, though. * Edited about a year later: Been here a few times since and haven't had any issues with the wait since the one time and I've been sans reservation every time I think. They're very accommodating of families and kids, etc, and they food's consistent. It's my favorite local spot and I bring friends from out of town, etc, and the consensus is that it's great.
