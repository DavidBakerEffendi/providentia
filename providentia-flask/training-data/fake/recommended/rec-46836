I came to the restaurant, and I was surprised to see that Bar Cara was gone, but figured, I'm here, I might as well try it! The place is very open and decor is quite pleasant. My friend and I ordered the lobster bolognese and the skirt steak... and both were out of this world! It's nice to be able to find fine food like this outside of the city. And the service was wonderful on top of it! I would definitely try this place out if you haven't yet.
