This place is fantastic. My friend and I came here last night for tapas and left happy (and mildly drunk from the brandy soaked apples we consumed in our $20 sangria pitcher). The service was excellent in that they were very attentive but not hovering over us every 2 minutes. Every dish we had was delicious and made with quality ingredients. I believe they also have live flamenco music on Thursdays and Saturdays. I will definitely return!
