Excellent food and service!!! The girl who served us was nice and attentive. Crepes were perfect. Salty crepes tasted better than their sweet counterparts. We had chicken,mussels and prosciutto...all good!!! For desserts we ordered ice cream cup and banana flambee. I hardly tasted a spoonful of ice cream but cream...and the flambee was too bitter with finished my meal with little disappointment... Overall it's a nice little restaurant that you cannot miss.
