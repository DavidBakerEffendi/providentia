Napolitano style, wood burning, brick oven pizza. Wow. I got a little backstory. The owner spent two years learning how to make napolitano style wood burning, brick oven pizza, in naples, italy. In the process, he imported an oven from one of the foremost brick oven makers in italy. So that big oven is actually imported from naples. And it was worth the effort. The pizza is thin crust, perfectly baked with a soft yet crispy crust. (I would just eat it as bread if i could, its that good). You can taste that it was wood-fired. It had just a little smoky taste that really made the pizza stand out. I had the artichoke and pancetta pizza. All the ingredients were delicious, and I especially liked the fresh cheese they used. Also - the ambiance. Come for a real brooklyn, exposed brick feel. The dining area looks like all the tables were hand made. Beautiful experience. Take a date, your family, bring all your friends. Whoever you want, you won't be disappointed. A great new addition to crown heights that will surely last as a neighborhood staple.
