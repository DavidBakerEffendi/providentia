Hot Diggity serves up a tasty variety of hot dogs and super tasty Belgian fries with your choice of original dipping sauces.  My favorite hot dog is their good old fashioned chili cheese dog.   They also serve up all kinds of interesting soda pops bottled and on tap.  The staff is friendly and what better ambience can you ask for watching the South St. crowd walk by as you chow down your tasty meal.
