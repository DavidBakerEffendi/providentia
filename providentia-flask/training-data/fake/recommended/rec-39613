As most people have said here, it's grilled cheese.  It shouldn't be $8.   BUT, it is VERY good grilled cheese.   Tater tots were not that great....sauce was actually pretty bland as well (ketchup and mayo?).   I go here for lunch every now and then.....I try to switch up what I get.  I haven't had anything bad here at all, but the prices are pretty high for what it is.   PS- Tomato soup was actually pretty watery and not that great when I had it.  Haven't had it since that first time.   Want a good grilled cheese? Go here.  Don't have 8 bucks for it?  Go inside to the food court next door and get something cheaper.
