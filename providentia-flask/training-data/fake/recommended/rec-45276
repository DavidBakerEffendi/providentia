I was in Philly and heard good things about Rustica. After seeing pics, I knew I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they sold slices, as many gourmet pizzerias that I know of have a 'no slices' policy. I had a slice of the steak with onions and truffle oil, as well as a slice of plain cheese and a whole tomato pie for the road. The plain slice was good but i would have liked it a little crispier. Not a big deal because the crust had a good flavor as did the sauce. The steak slice was very good and the crust stood up to the toppings and didn't flop or get mushy. The tomato pie was good even though we ate it cold a few hours later. The sauce has an interesting spice in it that I couldn't put my finger on and seemed a little out of place. I want to say it was caraway seeds and cinnamon. A nice experience and I'm looking forward to trying some of the other creative slices.
