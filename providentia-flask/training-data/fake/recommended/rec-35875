SUPER CUTE! Its just like you disappeared into a little japanese tea house.  I love their sets, everything is delicious and the presentation is so pretty.  Tea comes with each set and you can pick.  They also have different sets for each day of the week so you know what you are ordering is fresh!   The only thing is the menu is limited and its not a lot of food.  I'd say its a good place to go for afternoon tea or when you want something light. Oh and try out the bathroom it has those cool japanese toilets!
