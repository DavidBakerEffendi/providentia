I went here last night for a special occasion. We had a promotion for a prix fixe from Blackboard Eats. I am not much of a bourbon drinker, but I started off with a bourbon-based cocktail that also had iced tea, mint and I think lime. It was delicious. A perfect accompaniment to the wild arugula and roasted beet salad. Then we got the shrimp and grits, which made me wanna slap my mama, they were so divine. Buttery, nutty, and smokey. We also had the mole sausage, which was served over a roasted corn salad with crispy bacon chunks and some sort of mild white cheese. That was paired with a dark beer that picked up the spices of the mole. I was approaching a food coma at that point. But what really put me over the edge was the salted caramel ice cream. Nice and salty-sweet. And to end....a devil's kick Jim Beam. Smokey whiskey that picked up all the lingering caramel flavors in my mouth. A special occasion made special-er...
