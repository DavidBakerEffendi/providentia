Homemade corned beef hash with eggs - my all time favorite diner breakfast. Â When I saw that the hash wasn't some over salted canned stuff (which I gladly eat when there's no other option) - I was pretty excited. That alone makes the Galaxy worthy of a visit. The breakfast menu changed since the last time I was here (four years ago). The next time I come in I'll definitely go with one of the new skillets. The all sounded amazing. My wife and I also split a Belgian waffle - no complaints there either. It was served nice and hot with warmed maple syrup. The service here was fantastic too. For breakfast or even some diner food - without a doubt give it a shot.
