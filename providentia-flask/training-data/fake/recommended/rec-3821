They're steadily evolving...so I held off trying since I don't care too much for Peaches itself. But I'm super happy that I finally did and I've been back twice in one week. The drinks are *thumbs up* good servings and strong. I had the shrimp and crispy grits...interesting, wouldn't order again tho. The hot chicken I'm in love with and its enough food to split between two people, definitely if you throw on an extra side. Mac + cheese is a win and the creamy grits were fantastic. Creamed corn isn't really creamed...it;s just corn with bacon in it. Though bacon does make everything taste better :)
