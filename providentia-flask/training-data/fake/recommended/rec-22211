There is really nothing special about this place.  Its popularity derives mainly from the fact that it's located along a street where there is a constant traffic of bodies, including the flower lady's - and like the flower lady, it can't be avoided.  Plain and simple, there aren't many other options in New Haven, and as a result, we have to eat at establishments with mediocre food, college-town restaurant service, and sport-themed interiors, artificial in its attempt to convey Yale spirit.   The level of nastiness that goes on there when the drunks arrive reached new heights when I discovered on YouTube an account of some girl committing the worse sin engraved on the stone tablet of dining: she went number 2 in one of the booths; that's right, she pooped!  The disturbing part is that no one seems to know in which one.  Yet another Yale mystery...
