You see a sign that reads $2 tacos, $3 beers, $4 micheladas, $5 sangrias, $6 margaritas Monday-Thursday 4:00-7:00. One of your favorite happy hours in the neighborhood. The doors to the beautifully molded corner spot architecture are open and you and your friend saunter through them. The upbeat latin music and seemingly steal on the happy hour prices make you feel like you've just successfully pulled off a bank heist and made it south of the border. The Australian bartender makes you wonder if you drove a little too far south and maybe should've taken that left at Albuquerque. You snap out of it as a lovely hostess offers you a seat immediately, but a couple spots are open on the bar so you saddle up, spin around, and take in the fun decor. Water is brought promptly to satisfy your thirst and you delve into the menu. It all looks so good. You order one of each taco and a couple cold ones from the Aussie who tells tales of Down Under. Half a beer in and the tacos arrive. You and your friend split them down the middle to get a bite of them all. Delicious, one after the other. You peer down the bar and at the line of tables. A mix of pretty faces, young and old, mostly young, all smiling, and you think back on a couple fond memories when you were seated at one of the communal tables and met some cool folks. The place is small, but social, and the vibe is friendly. A twenty and some change later and you and your friend are satiated and on your way. You make a mental note on the way out to sample from their solid list of mezcal next time. Hasta la pr√≥xima vez, Chavela's.
