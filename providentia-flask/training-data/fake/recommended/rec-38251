The menu is unique. Choose your own style of meatballs, choose your sauce and select an interesting side. The restaurant is compact, but worth it. I had a beef meatball with parmesan cheese, risotto with asparagus, & parsley served under the meatballs, and a side of honey roasted carrots with walnuts, mints, and prunes. It was delicious!
