Fantastic Food. Outstanding menu. We have had the tasting menu for the last 5 years on our annual ski trip to VT and have never been disappointed. Almost everything is grown locally and the menu has been different every year. Beautiful, quaint dinning room. Nice, reasonable wine list. I can not recommend this place enough.
