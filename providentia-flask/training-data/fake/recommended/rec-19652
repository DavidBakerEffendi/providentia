SaborUnido is one of the best restaurants in the Ironbound. The secret are fresh ingredients, cooked in a newly renovated kitchen with tons of love plus an outstanding and genuinely friendly service. I go there almost every week with my wife and they consistently surpass my epectations: Â Feijoada on Saturday or the Cocido a Portuguesa or roasted veal on Sundays, Filet a la Francesca o Chicken Marsala: yummy Tip: The Alkaline water :-)
