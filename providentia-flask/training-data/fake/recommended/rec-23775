I prefer Cantina Dos Segundos Went on a Friday night. The wait for 4 was 45 minutes, as expected.  Once we sat, we ordered drinks and food and waited over an hour for our meals to arrive at the table.  I would expect this from a fine dining establishment, but not here (and we dine out very frequently). I actually had to check in with our server (I've done it maybe once or twice before, so I never do it, I don't like to, but we didn't have all night and I was very polite about it).  Our food came out 5 minutes later, but I'm not sure if that was a coincidence or not. Our server was polite and attentive to our situation and even removed two tequila flights from our check, which was appreciated. The food was OK, but not worth waiting 1+ hours for.  We ended up pressed for time because we had to catch the train.  But even so...I allotted 3 hours for dinner (including wait time), so even with an hour wait time, you would think we could get through dinner in two hours...especially since we aren't the "sit and chat for hours" type.   My suggestions: 1. Visit Cantina Dos Segundos instead.  We've always had good food, good service, and never had any issues there (and we've visited on various days and times). You will be in and out of there in a reasonable amount of time and the food is better...even though it is their sister restaurant and the menu is practically the same. 2. Don't go here if you only have a few hours....expect to spend at least 3 hours here, surrounded by sometimes loud, drunk people (at least at night).  I'm just getting old I guess (mid-late twenties)!
