Heard about this place from several reviews and a coworker about how awesome it is and I'll say it lived up to the hype, but not necessarily the OVERhype. Came here with family and they were all impressed with the food - got the scallion pancake, soup dumplings, kung pao chicken, singapore noodles and the chicken fried rice. Food had simple flavors.. spicy dishes weren't very spicy (probably a 3 on a scale of 10)? No reservations and we had a half hour wait around 6:30 on a Thursday! Food came out quickly though. Overall a decent place but there are many good eats in this city so if the wait's long I'd say go somewhere else. If you are going, go with no expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
