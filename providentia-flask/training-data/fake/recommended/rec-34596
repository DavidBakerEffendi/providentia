I loved this place! The manager and staff were super friendly! The manager came over, introduced himself, and explained how and what to order.  Although the restaurant was very busy, he helped make room to accommodate out large group of about 8.  The chicken tikka kati roll was delicious.....perfectly seasoned...just the right amount of heat! Everything was super fresh and made to order.  Definitely affordable... I wish I'd gotten a second roll while I was there. Yummm definitely visit if you're in town.
