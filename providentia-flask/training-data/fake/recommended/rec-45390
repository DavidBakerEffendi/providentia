When somebody is doing something right, you should just say it! And Emily delivers a great dinner experience! The ambiance is cozy and elegant with some tables in the front and a great "chef's" table in the back right next to the pizza action! The food is just awesome: you can't go wrong with fried Brussels sprouts, duck trumpets are a great pasta option, and the Emily pizza is a must to try! Finally a great pizzeria in the area!
