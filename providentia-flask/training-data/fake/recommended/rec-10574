This place is nice and they stick an extensive array of beers. I can't speak for the beers since I tend to stick to scotch  but everyone on my group raved about their beer selection. Their food is also good, I tried the duck jalapeño poppers and truffle fries. The poppers could have been spicier for my liking but they were good nonetheless. My boyfriend had a spiced lamb burger which was to die for! So good though I tried to locate it mon their online menu and it's not there so it could have been a special-I can't remember. Overall a great place to stop for a drink before a show at the bowery ballroom since it's right next door.
