I don't get it. With hundreds of reviews saying this pizza is the greatest thing ever, clearly I'm in the minority. We order this pizza at the office a lot. It's seen as a "reward" for a hard week's work. The other worker bees clamor for a place in line to grab a slice, and I groan inwardly as I join them (bad pizza or not, I'm not going to pass up free lunch). I'm from Chicago and I know that the Chicago/New York pizza rivalry is similar to that between Tupac and Biggie. Pizza pride runs deep. But Grimaldi's is just bad. The crust is thin but not crispy. The cheese tastes like plastic (I peel it off as plastic is indigestible). The sauce is tasteless. It reminds me of the pizza they had in my dorm cafeteria in college. Yuck-o. I get that Grimaldi's is some kind of institution. Everyone else seems to think it's great. Caveat emptor.
