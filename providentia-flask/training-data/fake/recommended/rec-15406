Brought my girlfriend here for our first date ever and went back a year later and it was still just as great as the first time. The restaurant itself is small and cozy with low lighting which makes for a romantic setting. Menu is diverse yet simple and we haven't had anything we didn't love. Outside (back) is just as great as the inside in terms of setting and the bar itself is comfortably accessible as soon as you walk in incase you have to wait. All in all a wonderful and affordable experience especially if you're going with a significant other. Enjoy
