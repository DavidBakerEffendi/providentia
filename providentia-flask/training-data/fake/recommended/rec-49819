Can't beat this place...thin crust, that always looks burnt but never seems to be, a sweet sauce with just the right zest Â and soda that is like no other (one of the few sodas I let my kids drink as it is all natural--we love the White Birch!) Expect to wait but very much worth the wait and they take NO RESERVATIONS and the phone is always off the hook unless you are one of the chosen ones and have the hotline to this mecca! Also, they are only open from Wednesdays to Sundays--call before! If they are closed, there is always Modern or the true Pepes! I lived in New york and had good pizza but this stuff is way beyond great! The service is lacking...very much so--I do agree with that! Also the bathroom is flat out GROSS--proably one of the worse ones Ive ever seen!!!!! I grew up believing that if the bathroom is dirty, so is the kitchen....luckily you can see right into their kitchen. But if a bathroom tells all for you, then this is NOT the place for you.
