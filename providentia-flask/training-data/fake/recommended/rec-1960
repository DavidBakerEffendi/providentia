Located in the Theatre District, this place was packed.  Fortunately they sat us upstairs which was smaller and less chaotic.  I love the Carmine's in Washington, DC.  It beats Buca and Maggiano's.   The service was okay.  Our waitress had the NYC attitude - gotta love that.  We got the Caesar salad with extra anchovies,  linguine with white clam sauce, the rigatoni with sausage and broccoli and finally tried a new dish - the shrimp fra diavolo.   I really enjoyed all our dishes.   Big plus was they have pitchers of beers!  For dessert we had their tiramisu - served in a pie container.
