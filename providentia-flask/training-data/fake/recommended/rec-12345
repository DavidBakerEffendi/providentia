Penelope is a great place for a true "New York Brunch" experience and I would recommend it if you have friends coming visiting from out of town.  Bear in mind though that the NYC brunch is a bit of an enigma and not always for the feint of heart, so if you are hear for a Sunday brunch, go into it with a plan and willingness to wait and enjoy passive time with your friends. Translation: you will wait for a table, and although Penelope will only seat your party once everyone has arrived, send someone along about 15-20 minutes ahead of your party to get your name in. Then grab a spot on the bench outside and enjoy the company of your friends who arrive hopefully midway through your wait.  I have found that the wait time is typically rounded up, and I've never waited the full time that they have ever given me, but yes I have waited.   All that said, the Nutella French Toast is just divine. DIVINE I say! The first bite is tasty, the second is scrumptious, and by the third bite the build up of Nutella towards the center of the toast makes you useless to all conversation happening at the table...in a good way! The coffee is refilled quickly and the tables are cozy in a lets let our knees gentle tickle and kiss sort of way.  The waiters are incredible friendly and chatty and during the summer when the front windows are open wide you can appreciate how a sunny day makes food taste better and company more interesting.
