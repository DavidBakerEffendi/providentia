Pretty solid food.  Pizza is pretty good.  I usually bounce between here and Mama Rosa for pizzas, maybe peppering in some La Guardiola. I go with the NY style at Goodfellas and like it.  I did try a square pie of the old world style one time and the dough was sort of, well, tough.  It just wasn't very good.  Perhaps the square is meant to be a thicker pie, though not as thick as siclian pies usually are, but i just didn't think the crust did it justice.  Perhaps I'll give a large old-world a try one of these days. I like the lasagna here also.  It has beef and sausage in it and is nice and thick.  It's priced pretty high for what it is but tastes good and they (sometimes) throw in some bread to go with it.  I had the chicken park dinner and didn't love it - small portion and the chicken and pasta were both overcooked.  It was serviceable but I haven't reordered it even though that's one of my delivery go-to meals. I've seen couple bad reviews on service but my experience (all delivery or pickup) has been quite good.  Guys on the phones are friendly enough and so are the delivery guys.  I received a delivery not long ago where the pizza was a little jacked up when it got here - the classic cheese sliding scenario.  I called back, which i hate to had to do but it was pretty bad, and they sent me a new pizza right away and were very nice about it.  The new pizza was cooked a little more than the first and was perfect. Overall, I like the place well enough and order every week or two.  At the end of the day, i sort of feel like each place in the area has a couple things they do well and Goodfellas is no exception.
