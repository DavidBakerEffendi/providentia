Yesterday my son and new daughter- in law held their wedding ceremony and wedding dinner at Modo Mio. Â I would like to commend the entire staff for the way they treated our family and guests, most especially Lucy and Gared, handling the front of the house. Nothing was too much trouble for them, including rearranging tables and place settings at the last minute, helping us to remove photos from their walls to replace them with photos of the bride and groom, last minute meal requests, and handling the end of our party and their waiting reservations for the rest of the evening( while we gathered up many centerpieces and gifts scattered about their restaurant). I am totally amazed and so impressed with this service! The food, as always was awesome and overly abundant ! No one left hungry. A wonderful time was had by all. Thank you , thank you , thank you ... You made our son's and new daughter's party something they were very proud of and will never forget!!!
