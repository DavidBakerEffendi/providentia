I am Peruvian and have to say that this feels like home. Not only the chicken (which is what most people have), but the ceviche, anticuchos, lomo saltado, etc are very good. In this restaurant you can have a very good taste of what peruvian food is about at a very decent price. One thing that I would recommend them is to lower the volume a bit during the weekends as it gets difficult to have a conversation during diner.
