There was nothing ordinary about some of the best food I had in New York. Situated on a windy corner in the city, the Halal Cart offers the best in lamb, chicken and rice. For $6.00 I got over a pound of food mixed with lettuce and smothered in yogurt sauce, which btw, makes the dish. Beware of their tasty but dangerous hot sauce, it WILL have you breathing fire for the next 2days. Really!  Chewing habanero-on-a-stick wouldn't be as bad.   We got there at 5:30pm and no wait! =)
