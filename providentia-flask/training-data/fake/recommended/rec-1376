I wish it was the case that the conversation about the best cheesesteaks in Philly came down to Pat's versus Geno's.  The reality is that both places are more hype than substance.  If you are looking for a fun, touristy experience, by all means go to either of these establishments.  Either restaurant is a great way to end a bachelor party or a guys' night out.  However, as a guy who is more interested in a great sandwich than a social scene, I wouldn't waste my time.  If you are swayed by food quality and taste and want to have the best cheesesteak (as opposed to social experience), go to Jim's on South Street, Dellasandro's on Ridge, or Mama's in Bala Cynwyd.
