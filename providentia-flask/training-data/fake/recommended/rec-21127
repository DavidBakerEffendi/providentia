I hate to be the one to give this place 3 stars but I have to be honest...this place is definitely quantity over quality. We came in with high expectations given all the positive reviews, so for my in-laws anniversary and FIL's bday (combined since it's only a day apart) the hubs and I decided to invite them to 15 Fox Place.  Overall it was a pleasant experience but nothing to rave or write home about.  We will not be back because the food was just blah...tasted like they made a tray of catered food and divided it amongst the tables. Decor/ambiance 4 stars.  Cozy and lovely little house, decor is very grandma's traditional Italian home...if I had an Italian grandma. Food 3 stars.  It's solid Italian food, but nothing mind blowing.  There is definitely a large amount of food!  So for about $100 pp, it was worth it and the value was there.  The only standout/memorable dish is the polenta and lemony pasta dish.  Otherwise it really tasted just like any wedding venue or party menu...and it seems like breadcrumbs was the main ingredient for many dishes.  Like I said, it tasted like they did a catering menu, cooked in bulk and the distributed the food amongst the tables based on number of guests. Service 2.5 stars.  While our sever was a nice guy, however no one instructed him on how to be a proper wait staff at a decent restaurant or prix fixe menu institutions.  Since 15 Fox didn't provide a menu, we expected the server to enlighten us with the rounds of food presented.  But he neglected to inform us what course we were on and what dishes were being brought out or highlight any key ingredients.  We ended up having to ask him several times what the dishes were...and we heard another table ask the same questions as well. In summary, it's a cute little joint.  But with an abundance of amazing restaurants in NYC that is just a short PATH ride away I will not be back to 15 Fox Place.
