I am colombian, so I do know about arepas and I love venezuelan arepas. For years I ate those at Caracas Arepas Bar and I don't know if I am allowed here to make a comparison but this place is very genuine, less greasy and you get more for less money. The combinations are unbelievable and I love the waitresses.
