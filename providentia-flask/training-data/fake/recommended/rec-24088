Unfortunately, I cannot say that I had a good experience here. First, let me just just say that you should not come here for Happy Hour or Center City Sips (which is only for a limited time). I came here for the latter with 2 friends. When we arrived, our server told us about the appetizers for the CC Sips menu. She said there was the taquitos, empanadas, and guacamole and chips. We told her we'd take all three. She smiled and walked away. No problem. Several minutes later, one of the male servers brought out a tray of the guacamole, chips, salsa, and a spicy dipping sauce. Without a doubt in our minds thinking we're so hungry and just want to eat, we start munching on them. Later we get the rest of our apps. The Taquitos and Empanadas were both disgusting. Tasteless, dry, and nothing special. Here's the good part... When we got our check, she had charged us separately for the guac, the chips, and the salsa! If you totaled them up it came to $8.75!!! Shut the front door. Are you kidding me? Nobody pays $9 for chips, guac, and salsa even on a regular menu. We were baffled and annoyed by this, so I called our server over to complain about how we didn't know we were being charged for the extras when we DIDN'T ORDER THEM. They brought them out to our table! So she went back and took off the extras and only charged us for the guac. Unbelievable. The way they handled our food and charged us was pretty shady and unethical. I didn't like that one bit. It only takes ONE BAD EXPERIENCE to ruin it. Therefore, I gave it one star, and will not come back again.
