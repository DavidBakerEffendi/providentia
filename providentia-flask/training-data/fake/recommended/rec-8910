If you are a fan of true gourmet pizza then you might like this place. I arrived on a Sat at 7pm and had a 5 minute wait to be seated so that was great. Our waitress was courteous and promptly took our orders. Was feeling adventurous so I ordered the "hellboy" which is one of their more Â popular pie selections. On first chew I was put off by the sweet taste of honey. Oh well, at leastI gave it a try! I also tried the "regina" which was just fresh mozzarella, italian tomatoes, pecorino romano, olive oil and fresh basil. My thinking was that I would revert back to the closest thing they had to a regular cheese pizza. The pizza was okay but again it was nothing to rave about. I chose Paulie Gee's because it had so many great yelp reviews. I think for that area it must be what the people like. Being from CT, I guess I'm spoiled by all the awesome New Haven Pizza in the area like Sally's or Modern Apizza. Glad I tried Paulie Gee's but I won't be coming back again. I will say that the service was very good for a busy sat night.
