I've been here a couple of times and and it really isn't all that bad.  Or I at least never really had problems with them. The only thing would be their price which is pretty high for their small and dainty food and desserts. Desserts: If you've never been there, their chocolate is VERYYYYY rich, and sometimes thick.  It's good and really sweet. But if you don't like extra sweet chocolatey desserts or even really sweet desserts in general, might want to slightly void this place perhaps? Try the hazelnut something-something frozen shake? It's on the page with the Alice Cup on it. That's the drink I seriously enjoy! Warning:  The dessert pizzas are EXTREMELY SWEET. I almost died. So was the bana nutella crepe dessert. Food: The food food was good. Well, I had it only once since I usually go there for rich-tasting desserts.  I had the Brenner Burger which was pretty good if you ask me... They served the burger with waffle fries (they claim to have a hint of cocoa powder or something like that on it, but I didn't taste no cocoa! but still good hahah) and they have their own chipotle-mayo-ish sauce, WHICH is my favorite ever! (I'm a big sauce person). The burger was a nice portion and I was definitely stuffed, since if you go there hungry, you might think you'll still be hungry after seeing the portion. But it was perfect. (Wish I had some more fries though!) Oh, and they also serve with a pickle for all the sandwich-y things. Just a regular pickle. My cousin had the B.A.L.T, which was rather small and just whatever. My other cousin had the Margherita Panini which was just a regular panini.. and $15. Think you can get a huge yummy panini somewhere else for like.. $5. Don't except some fancy shmancy panini, or super fancy food in general. All in all, desserts are reallyyyy sweet. Probably good for the true sweet-tooth's. Food is alright, although nothing really gourmet-ish about them and not worth the price. Seatings: too small and cramped.
