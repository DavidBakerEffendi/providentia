It was very good, I loved the decor; the restaurant was very modern with great service. I came from a evening show of the Phantom of the Opera; it wasn't to far of a walk. The tea was $4, a bit over priced for tea... but on the other hand the tea was served in this cute little cast iron tea pots. The Thai fried rice was good, the Pad Thai was the best my sister ever had and the Pad See Ew was average, and they were a little short on the vegetables. Lastly the Chicken Satay appetizer was good. There also is a full bar which may please some people.
