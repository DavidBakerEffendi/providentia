This place is really good. Per dollar, it's amazing. The mixed dip apps were fun and well made. My lamb was good and well cooked, though not overly innovative. My girlfriends lamb dumplings were unique and very tasty. The bill, even with wine, seems very reasonable. Add in great service and a nice decor and it's certainly a place we'll go back to.
