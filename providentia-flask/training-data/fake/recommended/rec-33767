While the atmosphere and service were satisfactory, the food was absolutely appalling. I ordered the blackened chicken tacos and I cannot describe a more flavorless hunk of meat thrown onto some old lettuce which red peppers coming out of a can. The sauce was laughable, the chicken dry, and in one or my tacos they completely forgot to even put chicken. Don't be fooled by there appearance or ambience, this place sucks
