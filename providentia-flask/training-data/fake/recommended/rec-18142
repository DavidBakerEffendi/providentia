I have really really enjoyed American Sardine Bar every time that I have been there. It's a mere 4 blocks from my sister's house, which is a plus (a sketchy 4 blocks, but I'm tough - it's cool). The neighborhood needs more kick butt places like this. I love the chalkboard menus. I love that the beer is very reasonable and delicious. I love the pickles. The brussel sprouts are freakin amazing. I love the atmosphere inside. Every time I go, every one is more than happy.I tried a bunch of food the first time - falafel, grilled cheese, fried PB & J, pork sandwich. I have been on the healthier side as of late, but the dill tomato soup I had was beyond awesome. Did I say that I like the pickles? Also, last time I went here - I saw not one, but two people that I knew. One yelper and one random other person. Any place that draws such an awesome crowd is top notch in my book. :) Despite the recent yelp hate Â - I really do like this place, and I think that every one else should love it too. PS. get a pickle.
