It's kinda expensive....and the cheesesteak was kinda greecey...but everything else is great! I had the $5 shake and it is soooo worth the $5!!! It was thick and yummy just like the average non-vegan milkshake. And their chicken sandwich.....unreal!! I had to stop and remind myself that it was a vegan food place because the "chicken" tasted like it was really a non-vegan chicken paddy! Incredible! Lastly, their Muffins are so moist and delicious!! not like some that can get dry at times. Deff go here!
