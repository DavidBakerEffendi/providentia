I used to go here a few times per month, the tapas are fresh, delicious, and there are usually new offerings each season. However, I had to stop going because of how horrible the service is. The patron at the table next to mine bumped into my bottle of red wine and spilled it on my lap. The manager came over and began scrubbing my blazer with a sponge (while I was wearing it) and apologized for the mess. Then she walked away and didn't say another word. The bill came and we were charged for the full bottle of wine, and when I brought it to her attention, she couldn't care less. If I had spilled my own bottle, I wouldn't have minded, but she witnessed someone else knock it onto me. There was no point in giving them any further business.
