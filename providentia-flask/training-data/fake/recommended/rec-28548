I don't understand rave reviews about the Cuban Sandwich; maybe I just got a bad one. The bread was stale and tough on the outside and soggy on the inside, just gross. The cheese was processed Â and value store tasting, as well as the pickles. I'd expect a sandwich like this from a sketchy bodega, but not from such a popular restaurant at $9 a pop. The pork and chipotle mayo were really good, ended up scraping them off and eating them on the side. It's too bad they use such poor quality ingredients that ruin the sandwich otherwise. I really wanted to like this place because its Eco-friendly, has good links with the community and is just a nice spot to come and spend an afternoon. Maybe I'll give it a second chance someday. Maybe.
