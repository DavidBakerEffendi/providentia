Had dinner at Ulivo last night.  It was excellent.  We loved Joe's cooking when he owned Sovalo. Nice to have Joe back in a BYOB restaurant.  My wife had the Tuscan bean soup, it was delicious.  I had the grilled shrimp with fregola pasta and capo, a proscuitto type of ham. The flavors blended well, the shrimp was perfectly grilled. We both ordered pasta, wife had the oricchette with guanciale and I had the gnocci.  Both were home made pastas and were very flavorful.  The truffle butter sauce with the gnocchi was terrific.  We both shared the pistachio tart.  A wonderful way to spend time in a rainstorm. Since we have been there only once, I can only give 4 stars.  We plan to go back and explore the menu.  Looks like a keeper. Welcome back Joe.
