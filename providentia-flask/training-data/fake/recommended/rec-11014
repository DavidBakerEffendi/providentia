I ate at this cart once while I lived in NY.  There's always such a long line for this cart (even at 3am!!!!!!?!?!?!?!), that I always walked pass by it.   But then that one time I ate here with my friends.... (after having a couple of martinis, etc etc), it really really tasted awesome.  The sauce is spicy, and my eyes started watering from the heat from the sauce, but the meat is cooked so well and there is no lamb gamey smell to it.  And it's also really cheap!  (Now that I work in DC, and roam around the dupont circle area to find places to eat, I get appalled looking at food cart prices here.  I mean, $20 for special lasagna....? $10 pho...? sigh) Always look for the right cart!  I think these guys wear the shirt saying that they are the original halal cart guys.  There are so many halal carts, and I am sure tourists would get confused, so always check before you go!
