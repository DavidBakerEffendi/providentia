Duchess Diner is essential part of any college students weekly life in the area. We would spend most of our after hours here indulging in food. After graduating and continuing with a job in the area, I am still able to enjoy it on a weekly basis. The waitresses are so genuine nice and always make you feel at home. Over the years, me and my boyfriend have become some of their regulars in the town. No matter what we order, breakfast lunch or dinner, we are always satisfied. Some of our favorites are their waffles, tuna melt, grilled cheese deluxe, gyro platter, BLTs, and waffle fries. My personal favorite are their meatballs, and for just a $1 per meatball, they're truly a hidden treasure! Coming from an Italian family that says a lot! I call and take out meatballs at least once a week maybe more just to fulfill my need for them. They are over sized and moist. This is one of west havens under rated riches. Once I moved out of the area the diner and staff will be missed.
