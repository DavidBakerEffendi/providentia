The food here is terrible (except for the guac).  So the best thing I can say about the food here is that the ingredients are very fresh and of good quality (this is why it gets two stars).  However, aside from that, the food is bland and if I had to guess, put together by a chef who is still learning.  I had some really weird combinations of flavors in my salad, and my husband's chicken burrito was really uninspired.  We were both astonished at strongly we disliked the food, especially because, as I said, they did have good quality ingredients.   At the end of the day I can't recommend this place to anyone, and we will certainly not be going back.
