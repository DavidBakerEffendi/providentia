This has to be one of my favorite places!! I was introduced in 2005 and I haven't stopped going.  Everyone that I've introduced to this place loves it too.  The food is great and the price is great, especially for such great food!  I've gone on intimate dates here, just for a good meal with my girlfriends, and staff party.  The wait staff here are the best.  If your looking for a nice cozy spot with good food and good drinks this is the spot for you.
