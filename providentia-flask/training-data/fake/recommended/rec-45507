The food was superb - truly outstanding as well as creative and with tremendous "plate appeal." All dishes ordered were of the highest quality. The chocolate dessert was heaven on a plate. We had the 15th anniversary 3 course dinner and it was terrific value. The service was excellent - attentive without being oppressive or cloying. Waiters were there when needed - and absent when not. Presentation was, not surprisingly top notch. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!
