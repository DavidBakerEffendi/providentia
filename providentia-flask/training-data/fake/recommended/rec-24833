I like places that feel like someone takes pride in offering something of good quality, that comes from the heart, and is not just about turning over tables and making a buck.  That's Wedge & Fig.  Artisanal sandwiches.  Quality ingredients.  Coffee in a French press.  Good selection of cheeses.  And a great patio that is tucked away like some secret place that someone takes you to who knows more than you do.   And the patio has real ambiance, feeling like a little hidden oasis.  It's a great place to take a little pause from an otherwise hectic day and feel like you are in a courtyard in France, and not Philadelphia.  The service, too, is not "Philadelphia" as there is a graciousness and civility about the whole experience that feels distinctly European. Would give it a fifth star if there was something truly amazing about the food, but I haven't been there enough to find a favorite.  I would say I have enjoyed everything, including the campy names on the menu, but not enough to make it a destination.  More of a "first choice when in the neighborhood" place for me.  Will return, however, for the overall experience.  Maybe I'll fall in love next time.
