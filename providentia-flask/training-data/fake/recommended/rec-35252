Homemade pastrami was beautifully assembled, but it was weak on flavor.  The mustard based condiment had strong flavoring, which made the sandwich edible.  However, the accompanied potato salad was fantastic, though bordering on too sour and salty. Similarly, leek & mushroom appetizer was weak on flavor as well with rather unpleasant damp odor, though it was beautifully presented.  The only appetizer I would order again was salmon tartine.  Freebie bread with shallot butter was delicious as well. Good beer on the top to wash down generally rich-on-fat dishes.  And service at the bar was very attentive and professional.  Great job, bartenders!
