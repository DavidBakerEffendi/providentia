I think once they work out the kinks they'll be a great brunch spot and yes if your a vegee or a vegie you'll be happy.  Give it another month or 2 before you make up your mind. The omlettes are huge and fresh... the chicken and waffles is phenom... but far and away the most original item is the banana bread french toast which of course was a weekly staple at Full Plate and is now off the specials at Cedar Point. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!! On a more personal note... Full Plate was one of my favorite brunch spots... everything was fresh and the portions were huge.  I couldn't wait to Cedar Point finally opened.  The wait staff is very friendly once you get to know them but the owners are very clique and kind of cold (unless they know you). Hipster restaurants are different then normal restaurants. In normal restaurants the owners love getting to know their regulars... they walk the restaurants and small talk with the patrons... if your meal was delayed or not made to order they'll come out and apologize... if your meal was great they'll come out to thank you. Not here. I've been to Fully Plate over 50 times and I've been to Cedar Point since they've opened and the 2 owners have never once...not once said a word to me and I tip very well.  Strange. Very strange.  And a little uncomfortable.
