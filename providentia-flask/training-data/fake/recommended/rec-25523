Come here for the ambience and the drinks. Very cool inside, with a deer head over the fireplace, dim lighting, detailed carvings in the wooden furniture, oriental rug, etc. Nice selection of beers featuring some from microbreweries. Also enjoyed the cocktail menu. Bartender was excellent. Menu is limited but features the famous grilled cheese from Caseus. I am giving 4 stars because my grilled cheese took 45 minutes, late at night on a monday when the restaurant was not crowded... really?? its GRILLED CHEESE. They kept forgetting to place my order even after several reminders, so by the time I got mine, everyone had already eaten. Regardless, I will be coming back here again.
