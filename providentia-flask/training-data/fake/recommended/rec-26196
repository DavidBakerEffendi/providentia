Ridiculous. Love noodles, love this place - not much else to say. I will say I was originally put off because I was thinking they only had knife shaved noodles but they have a variety of noodle types and you can pick the thickness according to your preference and that made this place a noodle heaven! The tofu dish - while simple - is also deeeelish.
