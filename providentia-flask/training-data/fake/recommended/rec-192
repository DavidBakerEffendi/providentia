Quaint, local bar that you'd probably walk past if someone local didn't insist on meeting you there.  Quiet and cozy inside, it's a great place for a date where you want to be able to talk over dinner, or if you're by yourself, a very comfortable place to just sit down and eat (at a table or the bar). Friendly bar service, never crowded.  The menu had a few interesting options, but the dish I kept hearing about was the crawfish pot-pie. Heavy on the meat and seasoning, if you like creole food, you'll love this dish. The burger was good, just not "great", your next time back you'll probably order something else as the other menu options look much more interesting.
