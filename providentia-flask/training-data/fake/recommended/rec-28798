Mie Thai might not look like much from the outside...or inside for that matter, but you don't survive 10+ years in the restaurant biz without doing something right. Mie Thai does a lot of things right - and with almost frightening consistently. You want meat? They got it. You want vegetarian? They got it. You want no spice? No problem. You want enough spice to kill a small elephant? Done. I've eaten in and taken out from them many many times and never *once* thought "Wow, Mie Thai is really off their game today." For unassuming, consistently great Thai food, you need look no further than Mie Thai. Based on the reviews here I think the people of Middlesex county understand this well.
