Great new restaurant in Chelsea. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner Saturday night with a Gilt coupon for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, one dessert, and one bottle of wine. It took a minute to get a server but once we snagged him, the service was impeccable. And the food. Oh my goodness. Perfection. Boyfriend had the boar and I had the smoked salmon. The boar was very good and the salmon was great; huge pieces of absolutely in house smoked salmon. Both came with a deliciously dressed mixed green salad and a bowl of delicious crusty bread. Entrees were the coq au vin beef pasta and the foi gras bagel with cherry jam. The pasta was excellent and the foi gras is the thing dreams are made of. Dessert was iced nougat which I loved but boyfriend wasn't crazy about as he's not a nougat lover. The waitress was able to recommend a bottle that paired perfectly with the meal. Some of the walls are still a little bare, and again, you just have to flag a server to start but all in all a great experience. Would definitely return.
