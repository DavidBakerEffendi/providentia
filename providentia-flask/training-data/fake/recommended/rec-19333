service is impeccable. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. everything you could ask for in a diner. its byo as well which lends to a more affordable meal. I had a Â specialty burger which was insanely filling and even more delicious the server we had was exceptional and she took very good care of my girlfriend and I. We love it here and will go out of our way to return soon.
