I am an expert on cheesesteaks. What makes me an expert? Eating sixty years worth of Philly cheesesteaks (and I'm still a 34 waist). So when I say that Dale's is the best, I mean it's WAY better. Start with the roll. No factory bread roll. A nice piece of roll. The meat is finely-sliced, juicy and no grizzle. Good, fresh, non-pungent onions. The pizza sauce is flavorful. And it's BIG. Finally, there are a zillion different kinds of peppers. Whole cherry, banana, sweet, relish, Granny peppers, jalapena, and "roaches" (dried HOT black chili). And they have lots of different beers. And fresh desserts to go. Try a cheesesteak with sauce and fried onions. You can get different cheeses (American, provolone, or "whiz"), but I stick with the default, American. Try the peppers. Don't be scared off by the roaches. They are delicious, but they ARE hot! The Granny peppers are Italian long hots or jalapenas, fried in oil - Yum!
