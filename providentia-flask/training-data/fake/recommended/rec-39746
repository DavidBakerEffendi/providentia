I've walked past this place many times and am always amazed at how long the line is, no matter what time I walk past it.  Today I bit the bullet and waited.  It moved really quickly (10 minutes) and by the time I got back to the office and opened the bag, the aroma came out and I was in heaven.  Really, really delicious, solid falafel and chicken.  I can't wait to go back again. For $6 you can't beat it.
