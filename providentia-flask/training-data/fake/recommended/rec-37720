just sat down at the bar to grab a coffee and a sandwich.  tar pit cafe has taken on the coffee operation and they serve the same great plowshares coffee as their williamsburg location (woodpoint @ withers).  the egg sandwich with goat cheese, greens, bacon and avocado was perfect!  i believe roberta's make their rolls, which added to the deliciousness.  so happy to have a joint like this in my neighborhood!  check it out for coffee drinks and a quick sandwich/snack.
