I visited Osteria Morini for brunch last weekend and fell in love with the pastas. I ordered the absolutely perfect gnocchi... somehow Michael White has found a way to make a bowl of gnocchi that doesn't make you feel like you have a brick in your stomach after you're finished eating. This man makes gnocchi feel light, and that is a feat in and of itself, especially when said gnocchi is laced with ribbons of speck. You're killing me, White. Killing me softly with your gnocchi. Equally good, and equally rich, is the cappelletti. Mascarpone ravioli, truffle butter, prosciutto... how can you go wrong? The best thing about Osteria Morini is that White truly understands normal serving sizes. Sure, the bowls of pasta are on the small side, and yes, I blew through mine in 5 minutes flat. But these are some decadent pastas and you really shouldn't be eating an abbondanza sized portion anyway unless you want your arteries to come and kill you dead instantly. So eat your small bowl of pasta, savor every second of it, and then rejoice in the fact that you still have enough room in your stomach when you're done to poach off your friends' plates like I did.
