My husband I discovered the White Dog Cafe by accident when we first moved to Philly, but it proved to be a most pleasant surprise.  Be prepared to spend some bucks when you go, but also be prepared to receive excellent service, unique menu choices, and a good time.  I'm also greatly impressed with the social and business ethics that fuel this establishment.  And, yes, do check out the Black Cat store while you're there for some fun and zany goodies.
