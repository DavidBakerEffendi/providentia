This was OK. Service was pleasant but not friendly and the server forgot to enter one of our items. Price is not cheap for what you get. Brunch plates were not the size that is shown in the pictures on here. I arrived very hungry and left hungry, $12 for an appetizer portion. It also did not come with fresh orange like other reviews stated. The sausage gravy was very nice, but the biscuit was dry. If you are looking for an excellent biscuit I would go to Pies and thighs or Brooklyn Star, but in all honesty most places in the area are better than this.
