DELICIOUS Dinner, wonderful wine selection, great service and cozy dining room. Came here for a Saturday night reservation. We were seated right away and brought warm bread and olive oil. We ordered a bottle of Concannon Chardonnay to pair with our seafood dinner choices, and tried the warmed mozzarella to start. I have to say the mozzarella wasn't as good as the dinner; it came with buttered crispy bread and roasted tomatoes, and all together it tasted surprisingly like tomato soup! The dinner was so satisfying, and one that I will remember for a long time. I had the Ahi Tuna which was cooked PERFECTLY (Sushi grade, so not cooked very much at all), with lemon butter sauce, spinach, mushrooms and cauliflower. Every bite was savory, and it was the perfect amount of food so that I was full but not stuffed (thank goodness, because I could have eaten an endless plate of this dish, and then they would have had to roll me out the door--which may or may not have impressed my date.) Speaking of, my date enjoyed the Cod with chorizo and cous cous in a light lobster bisque. From the few bites I tried it was flavorful and also a really good seafood choice. Overall, really really good, and I highly recommend!
