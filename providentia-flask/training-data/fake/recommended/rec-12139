The best part about Talula's Garden is the atmosphere and the décor.  This would be a great spot to have lunch on a nice summer day.  The outside was super cute, but we went on a windy September night, so inside it was.   I split a beet salad with a friend and thought the beets were really tasty, but I am not sure why they put ricotta cheese on it.  It didn't add any taste, only calories.  I also got the petite filet, which tasted amazing and was cooked perfectly, but I thought for $30 I should have gotten more of something, potatoes, vegetables, meat, I don't know, but I was still kind of hungry.  It seems that everywhere I've eaten in the city these days is very cute, has a great ambiance, the food is great, service is good, but I keep walking away hungry and $100 is missing from my wallet.  I am giving this a 4 out of 5 stars b/c the food was good and I liked the atmosphere, but it is definitely pricey so be prepared.
