Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Highly creative dishes.  Strong Korean influences. We were headed for Momofuku noodle bar and got side tracked and stopped here first. This is what we ate: Fuji apple kim chee Fuji apples sliced thin with Kim chee dressing or marinade.  Interesting flavors that worked together. Broccoli salad with smoked bluefish vinaigrette, and sprinkled with crispy duck skin. Loved the smoked bluefish vinaigrette on the fresh broccoli florets and the crispy saltiness of the skin was delicious. Fried duck dumplings - charred ramps, sriracha mayo Generously stuffed dumplings.  Charred ramps were flavorful and delicious. Pulled duck bun - tzatziki, harissa, pickled ramps Buns were nicely steamed and the duck were spiced well.
