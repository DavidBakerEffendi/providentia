Holy. Moly. Meatballs. Never considered myself a meatball person before, but consider me a convert! Food is amazing. You want to order it all.  I recommend the sliders at $3 a pop so you can mix n match, customize, and get to try a lil bit of everything (otherwise, you have to choose 1 of the same meatball and sauce variety for other dishes). My faves with sliders- 1. classic meatball with classic tomato sauce 2. chicken meatball with spicy tomato meat sauce 3. pork with creamy sauce If you can possibly do so, try to save room for dessert at the end.  Ice cream sandwiches are a sure thing.
