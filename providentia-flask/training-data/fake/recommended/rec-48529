Food here is fabulous...definitely fits in with high standard of downtown dining. they've got some great appetizers in the bar area, and the philly spring rolls are to die for! creamed spinach is a great choice for side, and to drink i tried a pineapple infused vodka martini that was absolutely wonderful--the perfect addition of flavor without being sweet
