Went here in the beginning of November -- Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had.My husband, a friend and I actually ate here by mistake. We had thought we had a reservation at the more well know sister restaurant, Traif. When we arrived at Traif, after having made reservations a month in advance, we were told we had reservations at Xixa (a restaurant we didn't even know existed). We were understandably pissed, but since a table at Traif was no longer possible, the maitre 'd gave us a free cocktail and then escorted us over to Xixa. By the end of our meal, we were so happy for the mix up that I wouldn't even fault the reservationist for the mistake. We got the chefs tasting menu -- 12 courses for $45pp. Incredible amount of food and SO GOOD. We all wanted to be rolled out of the restaurant we were so full by the end. We also all got their cocktails -- a very interested concoction that involves a cube of a cocktail with different liqueur of your choosing poured on top. The waitress also treated us all to a complimentary glass of champagne after finding out my husband and I were recently married. So sweet! After our first time there, we already have a second reservation to go back with 2 different friends. Very much looking forward to it!
