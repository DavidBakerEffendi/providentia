I have found a new spot! :-) The food was great!!! I had the crab omelette and garlic fries with the crab guacamole on the side.....MY GOSH WAS IT GOOD! Pros 1. online reservations so I was seated immediately although it was lunch time. 2. Great waiter! 3. FOOD FOOD FOOD! Our dishes were so delish! 4. Atmosphere Cons 1. The soda was a little flat, honestly that's the only thing I can complain about.
