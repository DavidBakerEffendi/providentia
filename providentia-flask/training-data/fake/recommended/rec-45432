Had a fabulous night out last week to celebrate a birthday,  Four of us ordered the mixto cheese plate (manchego with lavender honey is a favorite), the mushroom and shrimp flatbreads, bacon wrapped dates, an eggplant dish that I wish I remembered the name of, and a paella Valencia.   Food was exquisite, and our server Heather was fantastic.  The wine list is well curated -it's not overwhelming and it's thoughtfully put together for the menu.  It's also consistent. I've been here many times over the years and the food and service are always excellent.
