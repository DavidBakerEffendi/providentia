Found this place on yelp. Food was fantastic! We had spinach & ricotta ravioli, and the gnocchi (both handmade pastas in house).  It was top 3 ravioli experience for me based on freshness of spinach flavor and richness of the cheese. The red sauce was perfect! My husband raved about the gnocchi. Service and atmosphere were great.  PT will definitely become a regular spot for us!
