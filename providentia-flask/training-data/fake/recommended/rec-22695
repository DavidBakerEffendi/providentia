A classic Irish pub style bar. It's a perfect place to watch a soccer game and grab a beer. Lots of soccer flags hung on the walls to show you you're in the right place. Good tv's and they break out the projector for some games. Unfortunately, Christy's is a known Arsenal bar, but it doesn't stop me from catching a Liverpool game there every once in a while, hah. Also they have $4 Guinness on NFL Sunday.
