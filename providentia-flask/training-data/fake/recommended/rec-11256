Hey, so there's more than just food that makes a place worthy right? That's how I feel about The Wishing Well. While the food is just okay (tasty, but nothing to write home about) it's the atmosphere here that I really prefer. The service I've gotten has always been extremely friendly, and the crowd is very relaxed and chill. I recommend this place for people who aren't so much looking for great food but more so a good place to kick back, hang with friends. Cozy is definitely the correct word to describe the space in here. Sunday brunch you really can't beat, unlimited bloody Mary's and mimosas. What I appreciate is that (even during brunch) I've never been rushed for our table even if there is a crowd. If it's just you and someone else and it's nice out I enjoy the outside seating as well. The waitresses never forget you're out there and frequently make rounds. If I lived closer to the area I could see myself frequenting this spot when I'm looking for a quick place to chill or meet up with friends.
