It's too bad that they are rarely open when they say they are because their food is good. They just have either bad workers or managers. They say they open at 9am all week but I have called many times on the weekend at 10, 11am, and even 12 and no answer. They also claim to deliver but when you actually get someone in the phone, they say we don't deliver today. Do they just decide on a day to day basis if they are delivering or not? Lastly, they are rude on the phone.
