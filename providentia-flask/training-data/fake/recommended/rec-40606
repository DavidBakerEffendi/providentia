Spice 28 atmosphere is like become intertwined into a piece of art.  Beautiful.  The food can be described has transcedent and beautiful at the same time.  It was delicious. To have an experience like this with my mother is a lifetime memory. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable of the menu and what would particularly make my pallette swoon.  I am in love.  This is a must come back.  If you are ever in the area trust it will be worth the experience.  Oh and the Crispy Thai Red Snapper is AMAZING.
