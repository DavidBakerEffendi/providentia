One word: Delicious! My husband and I decided to do a take out order of the recommended lamb pilaf, cottage cheese cookies, Uzbek samosa, and lagman. We enjoyed the flavor in each dish. The lamb pilaf is our recommended choice! We would definitely go back to try out more. And the cottage cheese cookies are out-of-this- world amazing. And we tried the sea salt cookies a few months ago too. They were pretty good. We cannot wait to try out more :)
