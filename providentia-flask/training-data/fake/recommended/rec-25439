Excellent service from the time we walked in until check out. Service would get a 5, however the food was a 4.  My wife had the Mediterranean Sea Bass which was really good, nicely cooked fish, not oily, just perfectly tender.  I had the Paella Valenciana which had half a lobster, the presentation was great until i started eating it.  I found it rather salty but edible, perhaps the seafood made it salty, but overall it was too much salt for me.  For appetizer we had the seafood salad (non-fried) with calamari, octopus and other sea animals, and chopped marinated tomatoes which was excellent.  Fresh crispy bread was plentiful in a basket on the table, there was no need to ask the waiter for more bread.  The dinners came with Minestron soup, which was one of the best soups i have ever tasted. We had two pitchers of sangria, one white and one red, it was decent as far as the wine content but it was a bit too sweet, the chunks of fruit were large and fresh.  For dessert we had Crema Gallega which looks like Creme Brulee but not as good, and we also had Flan, my favorite which was perfect.  We also had Spanish Coffee, its liquor content was strong which was great compliment to our two pitchers of Sangria.  Overall it was a great experience, lots of food and drink to end the week.  I definitely will go back.
