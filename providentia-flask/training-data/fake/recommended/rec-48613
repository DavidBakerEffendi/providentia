I havnt tried the food here, so that doesn't factor in. The Good: -Excellent beer selection -Good environment, there is fire pit seating outside -The waitresses are nice, the bartenders on the other hand... The bad: - Beers are horribly overpriced - The bartenders were curt at best. I understand when it's busy that they just want your order to get through as many people as possible. But, I was there on a monday night and the bartenders were still kinda lame to me. Ultimately, there are soooo many places in Philly to get a beer. If your going on a date or you want to impress someone, you might go here (again, havnt tried the food). But if you just want t a beer, then go somewhere else, for sure.
