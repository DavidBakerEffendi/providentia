If you go here and do not try the plain pie, you are foolish. The sauce, great. Cheese, great. Crust, great. Put them all together and you have one good damn pizza. I have tried their pizza with toppings Â and wasn't that impressed, but maybe that's because I am not a big toppings fan. The other items on the menu I have had are are good too. Great wings and good calamari. They're cash only so bring some money, and be prepared to drink out of the world's smallest glasses and straws..
