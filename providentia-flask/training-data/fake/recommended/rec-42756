I hosted a birthday party here (for myself) with 12-friends and while we had a slight bumpy start, the staff and food was fantastic. The tables are small, garden type tables, which isn't a big deal - just be prepared to sit close. The staff was very attentive to us when we came in and were concerned about the seating. Once we got organized, we loved every minute. So much so that we sat, ate and drank for three hours. The staff never pushed us to leave and helped us out with ordering and more. This was a big plus in my book. I hate being rushed out. I would definitely recommend this place for a group (make reservations) or a romantic dinner (make reservations!). Insider tip - the pizzas are big enough to share with another person!
