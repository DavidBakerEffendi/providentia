I went to the bar here for drinks + dessert and had a great experience . The restaurant is intimate (small) and charming, lovely atmosphere.  The bartender on duty was great - he was charming, patiently recommended drinks when asked for suggestions, and then proceeded to mix up some amazing cocktails (espresso martini made with hot chocolate from the kitchen = amazing!)  The tarte tatin for dessert was solid.  I noticed that they had brunch on the menu all day, would love to go back to sample.
