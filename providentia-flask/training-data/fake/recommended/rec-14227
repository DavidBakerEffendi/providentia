Given all the top notch reviews, I expected a lot the first time I went here (last night with my co-worker).  Yep, there was the long ass line; the robotic conveyor set-up.  The food was good, but I didn't find it noteworthy by any means.  The place also lack the warmth found from many street food vendors around the city.  I think I will go to another halal food cart where I'm greeted with a warm, "Hi Miss, what can I get you?"
