This is tucked away on a little corner so you don't get hundreds of people walking passed in the West Village. I had to wait for a table, but not too long. They can take a number and give you a call when one is free. I was by myself so sat at the bar. The service was great. I was in the mood to linger a while and didn't feel rushed at all, despite how busy it was. It has a nice atmosphere and a lot of character: fresh flowers etc. I loved the kid's photos on the wall which are photos of all the staff.
