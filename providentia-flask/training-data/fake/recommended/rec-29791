Not just my favorite iced coffee in NYC, but "My favorite Iced Coffee in the World!" You can quote me on that. It's true, I feel like a coffee snob now, and I can't drink bodega coffee anymore. That being said, it's all about "cold brewed iced coffee", and this place does it in Spades! Keep up the good work everyone at House of Small Wonders. (ps. I'm the guy who usually comes in at 8am sharp ; )
