This is the best Italian deli I have been to .. walking in and seeing all the meats cheeses stuffed and fresh pastas and specialty items makes you feel like your back in Italy.. The smells and tastes of the food makes you think your in back in your mom or grandmas kitchen..Everything was homemade... the holiday cookies cakes and pies out of the world ..Its so hard to say what my favorite thing there is...I have never had anything but pleasant Â service for Nonna Katerina who is always there with a smile and a sample of something yummy
