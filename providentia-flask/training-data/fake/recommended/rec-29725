What can I say about this place.....  The food is amazing, especially the pasta carbonara!  It's one of the best tasting Italian foods I've came across as a New Yorker! The staff is super friendly and attentive, the restaurant is warm and cozy. And the portions and prices are great, considereing the prices in local nearby places.
