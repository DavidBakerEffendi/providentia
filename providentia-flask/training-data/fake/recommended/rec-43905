Alice's "wonderland" is a culinary mind massage. Normally a fast eater, the fragrance and flavor, served with a savory grove, slow me down to a much needed crawl.   The candlelit atmosphere is beyond romantic. And on fish and chips night, the garlic tinged vapors smell like God's armpits.  Take a date and tune in. Go by yourself and tune out.  Don't stop until you try everything.
