the best part of this restaurant was the valet parking  which in a small lot right in front of the front door  seemed like such a waste  the interior is well designed  but the SERVICE AND FOOD WAS TERRIBLE  even the presentation was wannabe hip  won't last long  unless they figure it out  Good luck  and good night
