Yum!  I had never heard of Japanese curry, be prepared, it is not like Indian or Thai curry really at all.  But it's pretty yummy.  Quick and friendly service, lot's of Japanese people were eating there when I went, which is usually a good sign.  I feel like $7.50 isn't that great a price for such low brow fare/atmosphere, especially in this neighborhood where there are a lot of great really cheap options.  But this is good stuff, I'll definitely be back. I got the chicken curry, it's rice with some curry sauce on top, topped with a large piece of breaded fried chicken.  They also have hot sauce at the table that is a nice addition.  Next time I will try one of the "toppings".   Warning, there are no vegetarian options here because the curry sauce has pork in it.
