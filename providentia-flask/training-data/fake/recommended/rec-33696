Great pizza. Great beer. Friendly, unpretentious staff. Great atmosphere. I've been meaning to try this place since the opened and finally visited a week ago. My wife and I had a really nice meal. If this place was in any other city, it would easily get 5 stars, but it's not. It's here. Expectations were high as I've read vets of Paulie Gs have something to do it, and I'm a big fan of Paulie Gs.  With franny's a few blocks away I  can't give these guys 5 stars. Definitely going back though as I end up spending 2x as much at Franny's and B's it's a lot closer to me than PG's.
