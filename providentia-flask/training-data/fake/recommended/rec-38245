We went on Saturday night with a group of six. We had reservations and were seated right away. While this made me happy, I agree with eveyrone else that this place was not busy by any means for a Saturday night. Also agree that wine list was lackluster. We ordered the special appetizer, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and prosciutto. It was HUGE and really, really delicious. It was $16 and probably would not have ordered it if I saw it and the price on the menu, but it was absolutely worth it. Just make sure you share. The cheese and prosciutto were very high quality. My boyfriend got the pasta e fagioli. I had some and it was very good. A tad much black pepper, but hearty, hot and yummy nontheless. I ordered chicken parmigiana (boring I know, but I love tomato sauce). It was good. I asked for more sauce and it came out immediately. For dessert I got a lemon tart that was lovely. My boyfriend got red velvet cake that he did not like which was a disappointing way to end the night. But overall I enjoyed myself and the food and so did everyone else.
