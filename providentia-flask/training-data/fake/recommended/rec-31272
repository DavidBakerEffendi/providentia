All in all - the corn was amazing. The only reason it didn't get more stars was because of the service. We came in expecting to have to wait, but we waited 45 min and then got bumped once for someone that arrived 40 min after us and knew one of the waitresses. A little maddening when your sitting outside starving at 10pm. Overall food was ok. The corn is definitely worth trying trying though, so would highly recommend it
