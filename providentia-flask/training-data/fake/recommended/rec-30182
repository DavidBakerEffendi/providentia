There were two sandwich shops adjacent to each other. One is a chain and the other is an independently owned one. I personally prefer small businesses as they tend to provide authenticity and originality in the  way they prepare their food.   Case in point, this place offers authentic Italian food. The cheese and the bread were made to perfection. The owners are from Napoli, it helps to know how this place came about. I am not against chain restaurants as they mostly provide consistent taste but I believe it lacks the personal touch of not telling a story.
