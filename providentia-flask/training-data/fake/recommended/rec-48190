Great food and great beer selection sums up this place very well. They have the best fried pickles I've ever had.  A visit is not complete without them. Mostly recently we had the chili-Mac. Which is macaroni and cheese topped with chili. It was amazing. The buffalo wings are good as well. I love the large selection of beers. The bartenders are always knowledgeable about the beers on tap. The beer garden they have is also pretty cool. On weekends they show movies in the beer garden.  My only complaint is that the beer garden is a separate entity from the bar. The food truck in the beer garden only takes cash. And you can't order from the bar menu in the beer garden. However the food truck in the beer garden has some tasty gourmet all beef got dogs. This is probably one of my favorite gastro pubs in the city.
