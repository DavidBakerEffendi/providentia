Lovely spot.  Great for a light lunch as you can order small plates.  We were told that 4 or 5 would be a light meal.  We ended up with only 3 and even then we didn't finish them.  I think people with a proper appetite will find 5 dishes far too much.  However, the server was very good and fun and every staff member we dealt with was pleasant.  I will return on my next visit.
