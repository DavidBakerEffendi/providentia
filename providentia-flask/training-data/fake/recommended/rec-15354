Great place. Incredible steak and eggs. Also had the boar shank, which was equally good. Extremely tender, and the baby pots served with it were perfect. Ambience is perfect for a date. Their back garden is great. Only minor suggestion I'd have is regarding their draft beers. They have two on tap. One is quite hoppy, and the other is super hoppy. I'd prefer a not-so-hoppy alternative. Maybe have one great hoppy beer on tap, and another flavorful ale or lager.
