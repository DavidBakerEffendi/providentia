My sister, who lives out of town, wanted to go to Little Italy to a great Italian restaurant. Well, I typically dont go that far downtown & had heard that Little Italy, what's left of it, is full of tourists & not really worth the trek. Man, was I wrong! So thanks to Yelp reviews, we chose this place which did not disappoint! We were there on a Sunday around 7pm and were seated immediately. Wow! Talk about feeling like a star!! Everybody is very, very friendly! The staff is all men dressed in suits who were the sweetest, most kind, most attentive servers! The service alone is worth the trip! I had a great fish dish which was perfectly prepared that came with the tastiest asparagus. My sister had the home made ravioli with spicy sauce and she ate every bit of it.  We ended the dinner with chocolate cake.  Dinner, desert, and a bottle of wine was about $70 with tip. It's kind of pricey but the service impeccable and well worth the money. This is a great place to take mom and dad or family members.
