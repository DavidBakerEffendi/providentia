So I decided to wait a few months prior to visiting the Writing Room to allow for any opening kinks to be worked out. My first experience was on a Saturday night and  there are both good and bad. Front of House Although our reservation was later in the evening we decided to chance it as we were starving. Caroline at the hostess desk gets high marks for being professional and accommodating when I explained my specific table needs and she went way above and beyond. Kudos. The Food My green salad was quite good- greens, apples, celery root with a citrus vinaigrette that was spot on. My husband's spaghetti & meat balls were very good, moist meatballs in a terrific  sauce as were the roasted veg we ordered. My scallop dish would have been perfect if it were just a tad less salty. We did the Warm Apple for Two - could have eaten it all by myself :) The Bad News The music. I get they want to have some energy, but is this a restaurant or a club? Interestingly, same issue with Parlor Steakhouse (same owners) and I just don't get it. Do they think playing loud music makes their restaurant more hip? Good restaurants don't need loud music to create a great vibe -  that can be created  by great food and service.
