When I moved to the East Coast, one of the first road trips I had planned was to drive to Philly just for cheese steaks. Â Last weekend, I did just that. First, we sampled Pat's. Word to the wise: Pat's and Geno's are literally right across the street from each other. So you might as well try both if you're in the area. I prefer Pat's cheese steak to Geno's, and here's why: - The beef is thinly chopped. Not particular flavorful, but that's okay b/c the cheese whiz is where the real flavor is. - The onions are finely sliced, and you can barely tell they're in the sandwich. This gives the cheese steak a very subtle onion flavor, and quite the opposite of the "in y0 face" onion taste you'll find at Geno's. - Cheese Whiz is very cheesy. It's almost too sharp and over-powering. And, I almost wish that I had sampled the provolone instead. - The hoagie bread is longer and toastier on the outside, and softer on the inside than Geno's. - Less about marketing. Look at Geno's, and that flashing billboard makes you at first wonder if it's a strip club that actually belongs in Reno, NV. There are photos of celebrities everywhere posing with Joey Vento (RIP) and even the sandwich wrappers say Geno's "the best" All in all, it was a fun experience. The cheesesteak was good, but not something I would crave. I could definitely tell that Pat's and Geno's are targeted towards tourists and have been thriving on reputation for a long time. The cheesesteak was good, but nothing mind-blowing. And, compared to cheesesteaks I've had in California (yes-- I just did go there), there wasn't any distinction as to why one should come to Philly for the cheesesteak.
