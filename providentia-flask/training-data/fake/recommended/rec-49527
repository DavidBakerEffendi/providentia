I had the nutty buddy wrap, which was excellent.  I'm a huge peanut butter fan, and really enjoyed the flavor and texture combinations (pb-covered buckwheat noodles, peanuts, cilantro, avocado,  carrots, tofu and lettuce in a rice paper wrap).  I also had the kimchi, which was both a delicious and generous portion. My only complaints are that I wish I knew spicier options were available and that there was more seating.  I don't like feeling rushed to eat and move on while other patrons stand around and wait.
