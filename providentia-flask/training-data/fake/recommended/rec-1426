I got to admit we were drawn by the long lines. The wait was not that bad since there were almost no options. Service aside, which was below average, the food itself was also sub par. We had one provolone and one American both with onions. The cheesesteak was plain and the bread was dry. The cheese fries was wet and undercooked. This place does not deserve the hype and long lines. You can get better cheesesteak from places with no line. Don't let all the celebrity pictures fool you!!
