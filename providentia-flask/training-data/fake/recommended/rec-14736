The service wa awful. Medium- more rare skirt steak was well done. The well done portuguese steak was medium-rare. The waiter was rude. At the end we paid the bill waiter took the bill and came back thmissinghe bill was short. Â we counted again found that a $100 bill was missing. We told the waiter that $100 bill was missing. We asked to speak to the manager but he never showed. We the added some more money to cover the bill. No tip since they already received a good one with the missing $100.
