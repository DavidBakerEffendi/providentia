Absolutely love this place my cousin and I had a great time!!!! Food was awesome. My cousin and I had the Steamed clams to start which was in a nice broth with good flavors. I had the Shrimp Provencal which had a very good combination of flavors and the texture of sauce and the cheese ravioli was delightful. My cousin had either the Hanger steak or New York Strip Steak, the steak was juicy and tasty. The mashed potatoes were delicious!!!! Our drinks were very good especially mine, which was a Kamikaze. The staff is on there game here and very friendly.
