I was very excited to check this place out because, despite my frequent visits to the city and all the great things I heard about this place, I never got to try it. So finally, at 12 AM one night, my friend and I headed over to halal cart to get the oh-so-famous chicken over rice. It definitely lives up to the hype! (and I think it will be 1029 times better as drunchies) FOOD: Great! And oh god, that white sauce...I drenched my food with that. So much food just for $6! The line was long, but it went by very quickly and was definitely worth the ~5 min wait. The hot sauce is actually really spicy but complements it very well. I don't really have another way of describing the food here except by saying it's amazing and everyone must try it! SERVICE: Despite the crowd and the drunk people, the workers were very friendly! Overall, totally worth it!
