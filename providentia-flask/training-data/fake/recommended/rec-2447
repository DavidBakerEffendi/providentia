And if this place could be farther away from my house, it'd be in Camden.... Oh, the Vomitorium, everytime i grace the hipster-stained insides of your walls with my presence, me or someone im with shouts screaming vomit during the course of the nite... Without fail or hesitation blackouts always ensue, hipsters grumpley get offended,  and someones puke hits the floor or street. Undeniably classless, i know.... And maybe a man not as morally bankrupt as myself would be crippled with shame and self-resentment over these tortuously drunken tendencies of ours.... But, sweet apathy prevails yet again, making me warm with the always full functioning inability to regret my actions.   And even though this place has the same horrible beer as its ugly, ragamuffin sibling..."the tap", it makes me happy.  The food is better, the staff is less pretentious, and the atmospehere is much more gritt-tastic.  i always seem to stick with the whiskey, eat the octopus and i always end up enjoying what i remember of the nite. Johnny Brendas, a $20 cab ride there, a $45 cab ride home. perfect.
