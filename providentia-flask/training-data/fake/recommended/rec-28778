I used to eat at Shake Shack probably once every two weeks but because I'm trying to get my dream body, I came back here for the first time in 5 months. I was very disappointed how they changed their fries and the burger tasted like any other McDonald's burger - flat and ordinary. Everything I always ordered changed and I hated it.
