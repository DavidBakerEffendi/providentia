The first time I came to Beco it was terrible. I left before ordering because of the female server with long dark hair that is the most disrespectful person I've ever met in my life. Months later a DJ friend was playing there so I decided to try again and see if I change my mind. The same thing happened but with other waitress. Is weird to see this ladies being so rude without a reason. I'm brazilian and this is definitely not the way we are. AGAIN the service was awful: it would take them forever to even bother coming to our table, even if the place was empty. It felt as if they were making us a huge favor by serving us. I never feel like this in any restaurant in New York. Food selection was OK, nothing special. I was expecting a REAL coxinha, but they use a lot of bell pepper and other spices that we don't use in Brazil. And the caipirinha didn't have half the amount of lemon I've come to expect from the drink. I'm really bummed.
