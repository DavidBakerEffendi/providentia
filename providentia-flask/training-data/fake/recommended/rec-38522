Mmmmmm...Pimento cheese.... I love this restaurant, although they could stand to bulk out their vegetarian options a little (rice and beans hardly a meal makes). People freak out over the sweet-tea brined chicken, and the burger is a solid 5 stars especially with a fried egg on top! The chef, Justin Swain, is a visionary, and the bartender, Sweet Lou, is just as talented. Definitely a must-go!
