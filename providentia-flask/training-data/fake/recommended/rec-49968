My wife and I had our reception here July 19th. Wow- it's hard to put in to words how amazing this place and the people here are. The venue is beyond beautiful (especially in the summer) and the food is absolutely delicious. Our guests felt like they were at a five-star fine dining restaurant or resort. On top of all of that, you won't find better people to work with. Jacques, Carol, and Veronica in particular personally went out of their way and made our wedding day unforgettable; for us and our guests. Everything went smoothly as promised. If you don't have your event here, you're settling for less than spectacular.
