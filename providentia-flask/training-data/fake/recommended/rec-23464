I first went for brunch, which had a crazy long line, and was not so thrilled like everyone said I'd be. It wasn't bad, just not so great. Then I went for dinner, and got it. We ordered 4 sides and the soup of the day. So good. I was surprised to see the sides were so massive, two would have been plenty for the two of us, but I'm glad we got to try almost all of them. They're were DELICIOUS, and the next best thing was the price. Only $6! You'd spend more than that at a deli or market for less food and of course, not any good. All sides were great. Warning, the truffle fries are massive. So good though. The staff was not especially friendly, but efficient and they were certainly busy. I recommend it for dinner, and will be back.
