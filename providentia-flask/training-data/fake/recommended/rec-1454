I have had several opportunities to visit a friend during his fellowship at CHOP in Philly a few years ago. I took full advantage of his generous (free) hospitality to explore the city, and some of what it has to offer. I still love to come back every opportunity I have, Philadelphia is just a great place to visit. Pietro's became a staple for my visits that year, and I have never been disappointed. Although their clams to fame is their brick oven pizza, I must admit I have never tried it. I had every intention to, but with each visit I always became distracted by another delicious menu item. I am no stranger to Italian food, but Pietro's always amazed me. The portions are plentiful, and the atmosphere was casual and friendly. It was the perfect opportunity to indulge in some great tasting and expertly prepared dinner! I know I should be expanding to discover everything Phillly has to offer...but I can't seem to pass this place up!
