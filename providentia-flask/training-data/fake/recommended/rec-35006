This was one of the most amazing food experiences, I've had in a long time. I wasn't bothered that the restaurant was packed, which is usual for this top rated restaurant. Not only was the food amazing, at the end of our meal, mama came by to ask how we were doing. I loved her energy!!! Great spot!!! Local and friendly!!!
