Bacon, Bacon, Bacon!! For those who don't know Traif literally translates to not kosher and they ain't lying even my drink had bacon salt on it. I went here for my birthday as a group of 4 people and it was perfect. As a group we ordered half the menu and each dish was the perfect size to share. Honestly it was one of the best meals of my life. They timed the entire meal so that each dish came out just as we were finishing the previous dish and so that each flavor rolled into the next dish
