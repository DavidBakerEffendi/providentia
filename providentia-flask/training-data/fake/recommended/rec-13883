After seeing a throw down episode with Bobby Flay I decided to make the trek for blueberry pancakes. I arrived first thing in the morning and was quite surprised at how small the place was and lucky I came early. It was nearly empty. By the time I left at 9am all tables were full and mostly with people like me from out of town. So not anything to write home about, 20 bucks for 4 pancakes and a coffee, over-rated.
