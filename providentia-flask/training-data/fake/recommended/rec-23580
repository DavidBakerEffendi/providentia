We dined @ the Bluebird tavern while visiting friends - and can I just say that I'm bummed I don't live closer? The menu is limited in scope and scale (ex: only four options on the "Big Plate" section) but you can easily make an enjoyable meal by ordering two of the "Small Plate" section. Â The Head Lettuce Salad (served w-pickled radish, macadamia nuts and farm cheese) was a hit, as was the Hand-cut Macaroni & Cheese (with peas, morels and braised snails). Service was great: efficient, yet totally unobtrusive and the ambience (well-spaced tables, candlelight, funky music mix) made this a memorable dining experience.
