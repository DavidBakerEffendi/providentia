We we popped in during a rain storm for the Beer Week menu. I know it's bad form to judge a place by a special menu, but I think our experience merits some commentary. I think our meal was exemplary simply for how polarized it was. My dining partner and I chose completely different dishes off the prix fix menu. My dinner was delicious and well-executed, his was pretty sub-par. I had: the empanadas, the mahi and the cheesecake He had: mussels, filet tips and the brownie. I'm not sure what it says about a BBQ place that overlooks beef, but his filet tips were so tough he could barely make it though them -- almost as if they had been sitting u der a lamp for a while ... The other courses for him weren't nearly as indelible, just disappointing. The broth in the muss,es and the bread they were served with were delicious, but the mussels themselves were chewy (more than usual) and rather bland -- as if they hadn't been cooked in the broth. The brownie was dry and the s pop of ice cream it came with was already mostly melted by the time it got to us. My meal on the other had was awesome. The empanadas were well-flavored and and a great meat to dough ratio (heavy on the meat). The BBQ sauce accompanying them was a little sweet, a little spicy -- delicious. My mahi was cooked perfectly as was the tangy sweet risotto it was laying on. And the cheesecake was perfectly fluffy and creamy at the same time. Night and day Our service was very peasant. It's a loud restaurant, but not overwhelmingly so. My one complaint was that there was a leak in the ceiling (it was torrentially raining for or whole meal) and were seated next to the little silver bucket meant to catch the water. Like, I had to awkwardly step over the bucket to get into my chair. Not a huge deduction, but it was sort of tacky. Overall the rating comes from the completely polarized experience we had with this special menu. I plan to go back to give their regular menu a try, but I go anxiously.
