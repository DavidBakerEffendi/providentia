Though clearly a meat-centric menu, as a vegan I am always able to find some satisfying dish when dining out with non-vegetarian friends. The atmosphere is pleasant and the service is good and attentive. I hesitate to share but I do have to say that on my most recent visit here I tried the falafel for the first time and was disappointed because of its dryness. There are also some dishes that are outrageously priced and I have NO problem spending generously on great food. Overall, I give it 4 stars because of the quality of the food and service.
