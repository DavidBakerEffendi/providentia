Outstanding! My husband is Thai and he LOVES this place. Nuff said.   The formula is simple: it is sexy cool, good food, and good prices.   We have been here many times, and keep returning.  In a town where there are thousands of places to try, I rarely return to a place since  I love trying new places.  When I first convinced him to try RS, he went unwillingly.  He was reluctant because he took one look at the place and thought the food would take second place to the decor.  He was also reluctant because he thought it would be another trendy Thai joint where the internet buzzes about their "amazing pad thai" (LOL).   There is no doubt, that is the first thing that will strike you when you walk in.  The amazing decor.   A chandelier!  In the middle of the room!  Mirrors!  In frames!  On the ceiling!  A swing in the front window!  Everywhere you look, there are interesting things to see.  We have been to both the Chelsea and Hell Kitchen ones, and both are super cool.   But guess what?  The food is good! We crave the black fettucine with Thai basil and seafood.  Now THAT is fusion.  We have a Thai friend who DREAMS of the tuna tartare and talks about it...all...the...time.... Everything we have had there is delicious.   Is it authentic like Pam Thai?  If you have been to Bangkok in the past few years, I would say "yes!".  In a different way, but yes, it has authentic flavors.   I love that they offer dishes that stray from the same exact menu every single Thai restaurant in NY seems to offer. Pad Thai.  Fried rice.  Curry.  Blah blah blah.  I've had it already.  I cook Thai, and I've made it myself...usually better!   I want something different.  RS delivers.   In a city where good Thai food usually means divey, cheesy atmosphere, or lack of atmosphere, RS stands out.   But wait!  There's more!  It is reasonably priced!  Fantastic!
