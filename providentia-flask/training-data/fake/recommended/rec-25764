I love Anthi's!!  I've been begging the owner to move to the UWS and he finally did it!  They have the best yogurt with all kinds of fruit, nuts, etc. Fage move over!! t This is authentic, wonderful Greek yogurt. He also has great baked carrot bread, apple/nut bread, chocolate bread... there's a lot more than what I've named and they're all fresh and delicious. I love his various Greek salads too. Wonderful take out treasure as Jennifer says!!
