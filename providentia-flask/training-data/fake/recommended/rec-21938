Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast. Good coffee with Baltimore Benedict ( that's porch eggs over homemade, yes freshly made here, crab cakes with Hollandaise sauce). The best. My fav for my b- day every year. Other wise just enjoy a delicious omelet made your way with homemade home fries and buttered grainy toast. Yum... All is good here, especially the servers and the owner behind the register. Come and enjoy a good way to start your day. GO THERE!
