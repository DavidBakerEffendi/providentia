My husband and I Ioved this place!!! We  decided to checked this spot out after a review I saw on it a few weeks ago. We were looking for a fun, low key Saturday night out and wanted to be in LIC so we could take a walk near the water after dinner. We were glad we decided to visit Casa Enrique. When we walked in we saw that it was a small but trendy little restaurant. Loved the white tables, chairs, and gosh the flowers were just lovely! They had a small outside area that we really want to check out next time. We started with margaritas. I decided to shack things up and try a peach one, the server said it was really good. She was right it was a nice treat. My husband had a classic one and that was very good too. The down side is that they are supper small, like good for about 4 sips and well drink service is slow. I have a feeling if they put them in a larger glass that the bar would not get backed up. Since people go through the drinks so quickly you need to keep ordering more and then the bar gets bogged down.  The guacamole was delish! I loved the selection of the 3 salsa. The tacos were so good, and I really liked that they were not overly seasoned one because they were gluten free, and two because I could add the different salsas to them. We tried the chorizo, chicken and brisket, along with a side of black beans and rice.  They were very gluten free friendly. They didn't have any info on gluten free via reviews/website etc. However we had them check on certain items. I was good to go. Drinks and Dinner was very good. Service is not all that. I mean sitting with dirty plates, no drinks and our server decided to ignore us and take drink orders for a party of 8 and food order for a party of 4 and a little walk around before we could wave her down for the check. Then we waited some more.... Hate Bad Service! Overall we would go back for the food, drinks, atmosphere and pray we get better service.
