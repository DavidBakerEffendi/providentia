i have to say, when we first arrived there was a mishap that isnt worth the time explaining since they MORE than made up for the event that occurred. they were super over the top about making up for the mistake, we had a round of drinks and free apps with our meal.. they were so remorseful for the mistake that was made and really took care of the situation super profressionally. this is how you treat patrons when you make a mistake and they still stick around!!! truly refreshing, as most restaurants in NYC act like they are doing YOU a favor by LETTING you eat in their restaurant. bravo for the service and the remedying of the situation.
