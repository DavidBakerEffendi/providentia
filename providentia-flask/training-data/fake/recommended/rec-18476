I went for dinner with a friend recently and was pleasantly surprised.  I hadn't heard anything about this place, so I went in with an open mind.   The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing.  It has ample seating and a great vibe.  We started out with some drinks.  I had the Manhattan on tap and my friend had the Honeydew Collins.  Both were tasty, and the Manhattan had a nice presentation.  The cocktail menu featured decent variety and a fair bit of creativity.  We had a few appetizers; the tuna tartare, the roasted tomato soup, and a burrata with truffles special.  All were pretty stellar, and presentation was very nice. Next, we got the Strawberry Cobbler and the Gin and Tonic.  We also shared the branzino.  The Strawberry Cobbler was fine, not really my style of drink.  I was underwhelmed by the Gin and Tonic.  A Gin and Tonic is my drink of choice, and homemade tonic syrup can go a long way, but this iteration wasn't spectacular.  The branzino was fine.  Everything was of high quality, but the preparation didn't blow either of us away.   For dessert, I had the Dulce de Leche Old Fashioned.  It tasted like dulce de leche shaken with whiskey.  It was exactly what I'd hoped it would be.   Overall, the food was solid.  The appetizers definitely shined brightest.  The service was also a highlight.  Food came quickly and our waiter was charming.  It was a nice looking place too.  I'd definitely recommend checking Saxon + Parole out!
