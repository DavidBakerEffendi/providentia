Everything about this place makes it 5 star worthy. The service, the ambiance, and the food. My husband and I had the clams casino as our appetizer which were out of this world. For our main course we had the paella for two, but it easily could have fed 4 or more. It was packed full of lobster, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, chorizo and chicken...DELICIOUS! This place is a must go.
