Stayed in New York for three days and this was by far the best meal of my visit. Ate breakfast here the very first morning, and it was wonderful. Ordered the blueberry pancakes and sugar cured bacon. The pancakes were amazing and the syrup it came with was buttery and delicious. I thought the sugar cured bacon was also pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. Cash-only is a little inconvenient, but I knew that it was cash-only before coming in, so I made sure to bring cash. But overall, one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.
