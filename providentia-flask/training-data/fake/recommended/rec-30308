This place has gone downhill. The ramen used to be so good. Now the miso ramen was full of onions and all kinds of veggies I have never had there before. The spicy ramen was also full of veggies and too much meat. It lost its delicacy. When we complained the waitress said there is nothing she can do and charged us anyway despite the fact we left full dishes. Ippudo all the way so much better.
