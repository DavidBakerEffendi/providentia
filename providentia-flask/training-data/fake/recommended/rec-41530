What a perfect place for a late night bite!  I had the vegetarian smash with pesto and provolone cheese.  It came with a delicious side salad all for $9.  The meatballs exceeded my expectations. Everything tasted fresh, which was a nice change from the usual greasy late night food stops.  The servers were very friendly and offered their recommendations.  The place was clean and cozy feeling. We were a group of 8 an found seats between the bar and a nearby table.  Even though we came at 2:30AM the place had the energy of early evening.  Just writing this review is making me crave going back again!
