Solid Spanish taperia!  My wife found it either on yelp or some other website and she picked a good one!  Los camarones al ajillo en aceite oliva was as good as i've had them, bread was good, and even the fried fideitos was good and I thought it was strange at first.  I also enjoyed the olives and my wife really loved the embutidos... but she likes embutidos everywhere we go (cured meats).  I'm still looking for a good jersey taperia.
