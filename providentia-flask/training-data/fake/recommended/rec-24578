G and my nightmare came true last night.  Claustrophobic environment and middle of the road food.  Not a true 2, but definitely not a 3 as we left the place saying "meh".   Met friends for a double date, and we arrived about 15 minutes before them and wanted to bail.  We sat on small, nursery school seats while folks bumped into us all night.   She drank the "Y Not" specialty drink and was not impressed, I had a Peroni.   What we ate - Pappadelle - wild boar ragu - 7/10 Gnocchi - 5/10 Apple cake dessert - 4/10 Wine - 7/10 All in all this place just was not worth it.  My still go to place for really good Italian is Saggio, uptown on Calbini.  I understand you make the best out of the space you have, but if I am trying to unwind and drink some wine I don't need to feel like I am in a tiny cage. And the kicker, all the eager folks crowded at the door waiting for you to finish your food.  Waiter asked us (very politely) if we would mind hurrying on up as a pregnant lady was waiting for the table. This was a one and done in my opinion for me.
