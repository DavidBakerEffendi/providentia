After living in Boerum Hill for nearly three years, I can honestly say I've never been so impressed with an opening of a new bar (and soon to be restaurant, yay!). Bijan's has everything I'm looking for in a bar, including original and chic decor, great music (ranging from down tempo to house and even some retro), normal priced drinks and an awesome staff who are so cool you want to be their friend. My favorite part of Bijan's is the white leather couch / bench / bed that stands on an elevated platform near the back. It's so comfortable and fun to lie on. You feel like you're about to get a psychotherapy session. I'm so glad Bijan's is only a few blocks away from me. I'm afraid it won't be long until this hidden gem becomes a popular place for locals and Brooklynites from all over.
