Modo Mio is small, loud and reminds me of being at the best family parties.  The service here is wonderful.  I had no problem calling (around 6pm during the week) and scoring a Friday night reservation.  When they called to confirm the reservation the woman on the phone was so firendly and even ended with "We're looking forward to seeing you and showing you a fantastic time!" We arrived 5 mins before our 9pm rez and just had to wait a few minutes while they turned the table.  Our server was friendly, helpful and laughed at our jokes.  We brought a mixed 6 pack from The Foodery and he brought us an ice bucket and promptly opened our beers as we needed them.  We both did the Turista menu and couldn't have been happier.  The rabbit ravoli was divine as was the veal was just as phenom.  Can't beat the food and atmosphere for a measly $70 for two people.  We will definitely return and try new things on the menu.
