We recently tried this restaurant for dinner at 6:30 PM on a Thursday night without a reservation. We were seated right away and the service was perfectly friendly and fast. My wife and I ordered the bulgogi appetizer and two of the stone pot bibimbops. The bulgogi was a bit dry and monotonous - needed lettuce and sauce. The bibimbop was excellent! We will come back just for this dish, since it is the only place we know of in the area for real Korean food.
