My wife and I drove from Maryland to Manhattan just to try Marc Forgione's establishment and it was the biggest disappointment at a restaurant. We were wondering how we dropped more than a $100 on this below average food and how he became the next iron chef. I went in with stupid high expectations and we ordered the tuna tartare, prime rib eye, and the halibut collar. We didn't like any of them. They were either too salty or tangy. The halibut was grilled perfectly but the sauce was mad salty and overpowering. My rib eye was medium well but it tasted weird. I think I can cook a rib eye better. The presentation did not have that wow factor. Iron chef quality food? Negative. Will we be going back? Hell no. Also, a waiter dropped a fork on my wife, whoops.
