(When I was there, they had a Yelp coupon for $5 off every $20 that was no longer accepted by the manager... Just goes to show the quality of their customer service. Our waiter was very apologetic about the decision though. Sweet boy.) Decor is super weird; very reflective of the restaurants name. Interior is mostly dim. I had their Shrimp and Grits, which was awesome. My friend, Pat P., had the Ribs. Both were amazing-- really great! Their special hot sauce is pretty yummy too. Located in a nice area near the newly-developed seaport area. Good amount of seating and they have a bar with 2 TVs inside. Wait staff was nice and efficient. The food itself seemed to be an odd mashup between seafood and Texan barbecue.
