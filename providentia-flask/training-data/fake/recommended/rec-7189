Tried the Maple Bacon on a Stick at the Landhaus stand @ Smorgasburg. Didn't disappoint! 3 sticks for 8 bucks i believe and my friends and I were sold. It's not a meal but a great snack and a quite tasty one. Before they serve it to you, i believe they add some mild spices and spread some maple sauce. They somehow cooked it to perfection where you cannot tell the difference from the layer of fat from the meat. Definitely one of the better things to try at Smorgasburg.
