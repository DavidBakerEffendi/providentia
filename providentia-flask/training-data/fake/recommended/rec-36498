service was so impressive, esp at late night. came here after seeing a show; there are two areas- the back is more dim-lit and has a bar area, and the front of the house is brighter and more formal. definitely loved the back area, it was more casual and intimate. the bread basket is ginormous, and has everything from foccacia to crusty slices to breadsticks. we each got the pasta sampler that came with a choice of caesar salad or antipasti. everything is done tableside. caesar was standard, anchovy'd up in all the right places. the pastas were okay, i wish they had been warmer. if i had to choose, the best was the ravioli. it's unlimited pasta btw, too bad we didn't have room for seconds. or good, since i would have had to be rolled out of the restaurant. however we couldn't say no to dessert, which was a great move because they have the BEST panna cotta. it was so creamy and delicious, there's definitely magic in there. probably will be back.
