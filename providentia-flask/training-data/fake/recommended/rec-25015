What a disappointment! Last night, for the first time, I arrived @ Pho Thanh Huong for dinner with 3 friends. We had high expectations. The waiter told us that he was classically trained, and that everything was made from scratch. We started with Spring Rolls which didn't have a lot of flavor. we then ordered Pho, which was supposed to come next, and didn't arrive until after the main dishes. The Chicken with Lemongrass & Chilies had no flavor. They use jarred lemongrass, & there were no chilies that I was able to discern. In addition, they used cornstarch to thicken the sauce, which is not typical of the Vietnamese at all. It's more Chinese. Added to the fact that they do not offer Green Papaya Salad, which has been on the menu of every other Vietnamese restaurant that I have visited, I have to conclude that these people are from the large ethnic community of Chinese people that were once in abundance in Vietnam before all the wars. In conclusion, I have to say, don't waste your time. there are far better Vietnamese restaurants elsewhere.
