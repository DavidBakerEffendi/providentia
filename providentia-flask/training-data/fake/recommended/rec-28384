Really good with a short menu so it shldnt be hard to pick, ud think!!! I loved the fried pickles. My co-workers had the yummy grilled cheese and a burger which was said to be ok-like any other burger. I had the spicy cherry margaritas-SPICY!! don't get it if u think u can't handle it! I Also had the Mac n cheese bowl but it was big. I cldnt finish it! Cool atmosphere. Feels like ure in breckenridge Colorado!
