Why I am here? Why I am reviewing this place? I am not a burger person hmmm, but the vanilla custard ice cream called me, Rita Ice is far and I did not like my experience with their neighbor Ice Cream Specialist Capogiro Gelato really disappointed me. I liked the big detailed menu, the server was smiling and their system is smart they gave you a shaking device which shake shack when your order is ready! I loved my vanilla custard, well prepared and tasty, the price is a bit higher than Rita but it is ok. If I had to choose between Shake Shack and the ice cream specialized Capogiro Gelato, definitely Â shake shack win. Note my review is ice cream related only, read other reviews for burger :)
