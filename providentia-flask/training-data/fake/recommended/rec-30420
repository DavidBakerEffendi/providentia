ACK!!!  why can't i live in this place?!?!?!  i could and did walk through this place for hours.  we tried getting into the beer garden but the wait was over an hour (and it was raining!) so we found a spot to order a bottle of proseco and eat humongous balls of fresh mozzarella and prosciutto with olive oil.  oh, i'm in heaven!  i need to spend more time in this place, too bad i live in la!
