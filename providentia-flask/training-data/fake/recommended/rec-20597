While Koch's stil serves up the best, jaw-busting deli sandwiches in the City of Philadelphia, it's not quite what it was in it's prime.  It used to be that student and neighborhood residents would fill the shop with a line that worked all the way to the rear of the store, then double back and out the door. An hour wait to place an order was common place, and worth every minute -- besides the owners served up free samples and bad jokes while you waited.  Those days, when brother's Lou and Bobby Koch manned the counter have transitioned to an internet driven delivery approach more in concert with today's student expectations.  The line, the knishes (and the baked goods that sat atop the counter) are gone, but the sandwiches are still piled high and made with love!
