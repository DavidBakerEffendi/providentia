This is the best mexican/latin restaurant I've ever visited.  They have good bar and variety of drinks, but I decided not to have alcohol during my meal.  I've never had mexican food that was so tasty where all the ingredient were so fresh and succulent.  How did even the fish come out soo soo juicy and wonderful??  I was really surprised with everything.  Mexican food is on the lower end of my food preferences, but not so with Barrio Chino.  The food comes in small plate portions so the bill comes out a bit expensive.   The decor is nice and quirky, using chinese art and chinese touches.  Don't confuse the name of the restuarant and think the food is going to mirror it.  It is named because the area use to be part of chinatown and if you look closely at nearby storefronts across the street (if they haven't been redone by now with new hip places sprouting up in their place) you'll see that there are still various remnants of old chinese businesses there.
