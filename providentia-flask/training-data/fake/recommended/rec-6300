I came here for a Thursday dinner. The food was exchellend, but our Eastern European waitress was very rude to us! We ordered 5 appetizers and 2 main courses and she brought out all at once!! We thought that in a restaurant when you dine in a table you get better service but didn't seemed in this place! More over our waitress every time she was coughing she wouldn't put her hand infrond of her mouth! She made me really upset, although I enjoyed the food very much and the rest of the staff seemed very friendly ( even the bussers were smiling ). I hope the next time I come to Pylos I want be serve by her cause I really liked the food!!
