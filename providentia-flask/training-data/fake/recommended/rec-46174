VERY hard to give only 1 star, BUT....food was great, waiter was great...HOWEVER, the little short guy that seems to run/own the place, is NASTY & RUDE!!!I  Had had my dinner wrapped to take home...we walked out without it, but realized by the time we got to the car (about 5 minutes later).  Got into the car and drove right back down the street (from the two blocks away we had to park) to find out they had already thrown the bag out!!  It was close to closing, so I understand the urgency to cleanup.  However, it was ONLY a matter of FIVE minutes.  Out waiter was very sympathetic and checked the kitchen a few times to see if it was put on the side somewhere, but no luck!!  The manager (the little bald-headed, rude guy with glasses), didn't give a flying $&&@" that my $30 partially eaten meal was thrown away in a matter of 5 minutes, and it's his condescending attitude that will never bring us back to this restaurant!!!  It's a shame, because it was a very good meal.
