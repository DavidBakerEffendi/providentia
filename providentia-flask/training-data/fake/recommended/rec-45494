Great spot. So refreshing to have a unique spot instead of all the other mediocre places in the area. We had cheeses meats and olives that we're great. A nice arugula salad, meatballs were just ok. The best was the doughnuts dessert, do not skip it! Atmosphere is nice and relaxed. I'll definitely return.
