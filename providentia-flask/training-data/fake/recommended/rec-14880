The best pulled pork barbecue in the city, and the service is even better. My husband and I are here almost every Sunday for brunch (goes until 4), and every time we try another barbecue place we inevitably wonder why we would go anywhere else but Khyber Pass ever again. The meat is smokey and perfect and good enough to make up for the vinegar based version of the house trio of sauces. The tomato based and mustard based sauces are more than sufficient, you really don't even need sauce in meat this sublime. Also spectacular: the nachos with green tomato salsa, shrimp and grits (before 2PM, after that they get a little gluey but that's the nature of grits), muffuletta, macaroni and cheese, collards which seem to be cooked in pure crystal hot sauce, the biscuit which really is as big as they say it is...I've never had anything I didn't like. The beer selection is great, and the bourbon based Lightning in a Jar (ask them to add fresh mint) is refreshing Â and will knock you out until Monday.
