My wife and I had our wedding here in 2010 (we had problems with the wedding coordinator at the time, we only went back on our anniversary because we had a gift certificate). The menu they list online is no longer the menu they use, the beer they brought me was warm, our salads were wrong (we were told that the menu is "confusing"). They were out of the prime rib that my wife had her heart set on (I don't eat beef, so she only gets it at restaurants), and for whatever reason they did not include the rice with my mahi mahi. The entire time, the music from the wedding below us was loud enough to make the floor vibrate. We're pretty sure they ran out of a dessert item, as we saw others with chocolate cake, but wasn't offered to us.
