Maybe it's because the boyfriend and I didn't order the fried chicken and waffles, but we didn't find this place particularly AMAZING, but it wasn't bad either. It was good, but not GREAT. If I lived around the area, I definitely would stop by here again to eat on occasion, but if just visiting, I'd rather go to other places to try out now that I've crossed this one off my list. The two of us arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch right as it opened, and there were around 7-8 people already waiting for the place to open! First off: the atmosphere is really nice--laid back, and has a pristine, Southern farmhouse feel to it, and the staff is also very friendly. Now what you're all really here for is to get the scoop about the food...so I'll get to it! WHAT WE GOT: 1. Side of Cheddar Waffles: Mmmm the cheddar is subtle but definitely there--perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. 2. Eggs Huntington: I thought it was good, but not great. Boyfriend wasn't a fan, as he thought it was barely warm. 3. Heirloom Grains (I'm not sure if this is still on the menu anymore): This was soooo good. I loved this--perfectly soft boiled egg with the grains seasoned perfectly, wonderful taste of the mushrooms (not overcooked/mushy), with the asparagus, pea shoots, and green chickpeas--everything went well together. I dream about this dish. 4. Side of hashbrowns: Yum! Crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked potato on the inside. Overall, we enjoyed eating here for a very laid back morning, but nothing really wow'd us (except for the heirloom grains on my end..but seeing as it's not on the online menu anymore...who knows.. :( ) I think if I were to go back here, I'd try the chicken and waffles, but now I don't really have a reason to go back.
