I am a big fan of Extra Virgin.  I've been there for dinners with friends and family and have never been disappointed by my meal.  Their fish dishes are great - particularly the sea bass with salsa verde.  And the butternut squash ravioli is to die for.  I don't eat meat, but two of my dinner companions have ordered the Lamb Three Ways and loved it.  Dessert is not as strong as their entrees - both times I've ordered dessert there its been kind of meh (apple tart and berry cobbler).  If you happen to be there so early that it's not packed, opt for a seat on the right hand side of the restaurant - the left hand side is so dark its impossible to read your menu.  Also, if you're a party of two and its a nice day outside, the tables out front are great for people watching.  The host is a little brusque, and the waitstaff aren't particularly memorable, but generally the service is not too bad.  Overall, it is a good standby with really memorable dishes!
