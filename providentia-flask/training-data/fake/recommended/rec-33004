Reliably good - Food is consistently tasty. Service is usually quick (I had 1 slow service meal out of 6) and always friendly. The beef salad is very flavorful. Â Chilean Sea Bass is awesome, and the Grilled Beef is terrific too! ... and close it out with the Chocolate Lava Cake for dessert (place the order at the beginning of the meal). Can't go wrong.
