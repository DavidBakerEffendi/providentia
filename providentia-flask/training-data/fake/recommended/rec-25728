This place has a cool Southern vibe, fantastic BBQ, and great rhythm & blues. It's definitely unlike any other place in Philly. But if you go on a Friday or Saturday night around dinnertime, don't arrive starving. The first time we went it was a Friday night, and we waited in line for 1 hour to get our food! We usually go on a weeknight, or weekend afternoon, and there is no line. Â The chicken, pork ribs, and coleslaw were my favorites.
