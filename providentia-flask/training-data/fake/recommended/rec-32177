Kumo, I want very badly to like you considering the proximity to my house but it is just not happening. Last time I was there they told me their broth was vegetarian and served it to me and it was NOT vegetarian. The salmon skin salad was a complete disappointment. It is also so hard to get a roll here thats not fried or drenched in "special sauce" aka mayonnaise. The service is never good and they refuse to do separate checks.
