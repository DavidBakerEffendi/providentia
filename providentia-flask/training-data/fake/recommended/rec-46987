What can I say about Sabrina's that has not been already said hundreds of times? This place is simply amazing. The portions are big and the food is delicious. A committee I serve on always goes there for brunch in the spring, and I must say it is the highlight of my semester. They have great service even when it is a group of 16. Best tip is to get some extra plates and get friendly! You WILL want to try everything they have to offer. Also, the pick-up lines based menu? Hilarious.
