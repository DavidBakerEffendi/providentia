Four of us ate here on a Monday night.   The service was terrible! It was not crowded. We ate outside and It took 1/2 hour to get drinks.   There was a series of errors and my husband went inside twice to get someone's attention.  My son, a vegetarian for almost ten years, ordered the mushroom sliders.  After taking a bite he realized they were the bison sliders!   After all that, they didn't even try to make good by taking that off the bill.  They did nothing!  And the waitress would not admit to making any mistakes at all, even after spilling the water on the table!  The food, though very good, is WAY OVERPRICED!   We will never go back.
