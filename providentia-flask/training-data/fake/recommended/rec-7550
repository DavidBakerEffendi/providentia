So...this is the restaurant we always end up going to when we decide to eat in Princeton. Mainly because it is one of the few restaurants with a bar, great scene, a decent menu (with items on it that you would always be in the mood for). BUT the service is so hit or miss. We either go and we are happy that we got "good" never great service. Or we leave so angry that went here again to just get par to bad service. If you are a fine dining/steak house - you need to have that type of service. It is always crowded and I think that is mainly due to what I listed above. Get the service right and this would be a 5 star all the way. I hope you get a good server - otherwise, it is tough to drink there, the timing of courses is always off and your server is just never around. FRUSTRATING!
