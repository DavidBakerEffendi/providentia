Driving home from NJ I decided to take a restroom break and grab some lunch. I really wanted to try Cheeseboy but alas, it is only at the rest stop on 95S so I figured I'd give this organic place a try. I had the breaded chicken wrap with lettuce, cheese, and honey mustard and it was a nice healthy alternative to McDonald's. I'd probably try their hot dogs the next time as they sound pretty delicious. OK, I am going to admit something here. On my walk out of the rest stop I was drawn to McDonald's and I bought a medium fry to complement my healthy organic meal. Sorry folks, but I needed those fries!
