Speechless. Every piece of food that we tasted, smelled or saw was absolutely phenomenal. My only regret is that my stomach wasn't bigger. We arrived ravenously hungry and started with coffee and pear bellinis. At least they told us that it was coffee. That magical brown liquid could not be in the same food group as what you find at most coffee shops. We ordered the parmesan truffle fries and a side of brussel sprouts. My wife thought if I ate all of these starters, I would be too full to eat my main dish. She was so wrong. I had the stuffed french toast (stuffed with apple butter cream cheese and topped with Â diced apples and cranberries with a creme anglaise) and my wife had the Lancaster omelette (minus the goat cheese). We picked off of each others plates and everything was mind blowing. We wish we knew the people sitting next to us so we could eat their food too, but that's rude so we didn't do it. Til next time WDC. We will return.
