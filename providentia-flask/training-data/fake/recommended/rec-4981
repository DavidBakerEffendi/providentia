washington avenue has changed dramatically in the past few years.  i've been living in the area since 2003 and still remember the days when cab drivers in manhattan would reluctantly agree to drop me off in park slope but NOT washington avenue.  weird, right?  especially now that prospect heights is the burgeoning williamsburg/5th ave park slope hipster gathering place. part and parcel w/gentrification in New York, is the establishment of fancy restaurants.  bar corvo arrived first with a stronger pedigree but sunshine co is offering its version of competition.  with its ideal corner location, cozy outdoor seating and extensive wine list, it is a much more comfortable place to enjoy a meal.  i had the gnocchi and my husband had the duck.  both dishes were quite lovely.  the gnocchi was surprisingly light and tasty, and the duck was perfectly cooked and balanced in flavor.  for dessert we shared a serving of donuts which we both agreed tasted more like beignets (delicious!).  The cocktails were divine. the service was friendly and helpful, the prices were a bit on the high side, but that seems like typical nyc practice.  high prices imply better food, but it does not guarantee it.  caveat emptor.   i will be going back, even in the winter.  the large picture windows will make for perfect viewing of the neighboring condo construction projects racing their way upwards.
