I've been here several times but had my best dinner there last night. I always appreciate decent wine recommendations to match the dish and the lady looking after me did a fabulous job. The Avocado Crevettes I had as a starter were delicious by themselves but even better with the Sauvignon Blanc she served me with it balancing the ripe avocado and amplifying the slight sweetness of the crabs. It always comes with a little bit of bread - a very special and tasty baguette. As I read in other reviews the tartar is relatively chunky and not mined but chopped meat. I liked it a lot and after I got told from one of the waiters that I can't eat it without french fries I ordered some to go with it. The fries are homemade by cutting potatoes and soaking them in water for 2 days until they get fried and served. Nice. I like when waiters are passionate about the food and wine they serve. The wine recommendation I got for the steak tartar was a good match again with a Merlot/Cab blend complementing the raw meat and vinegar flavours very nicely. The owner is drinking wine all night walking from table to table and chatting with the guests (specifically the ladies) and is a nice pal. The place and food has a lot of character.
