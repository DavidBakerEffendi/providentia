Went here to check out the Ridgewood Market when it was there back in December. We enjoyed our food and beer more than the market!! The potato pancakes were crisp and delicious. The three cheese spatzelle was surprisingly good but one order is probably enough for two people if your sharing an appetizer before hand. The bar is small but you have a great selection of beer, german beer on draft! Prices are also very good. Definitely a spot I'll be going to again!
