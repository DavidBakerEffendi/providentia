Wow. I've never had Thai food and this was a great first experience. I came here for lunch with 2 coworkers and I truly loved every bite. They have $6.90 lunch specials and for the three of us the bill was just over $20! The place is decorated... Different, but classy. It has a very swanky vibe. The chairs aren't the most comfortable in my opinion, especially since if you leave back you might fall over. Be wary of that. Our waitress was prompt and attentive and the food, as I said, was delicious. I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch in the future.
