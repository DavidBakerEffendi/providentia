Vegan Sush herei is soooooooooo much better Regular Sushi. I cannot look the same way at normal sushi with fish ever again. When i took my 1st bite, i was speechless for 5 mins. I was so surprised that it was not a boring bland, nutty taste. The sauces put on top of the sushi were on point and went well with the sushi. They look as good as the pictures. I ordered the Haricat and my friend ordered the Sweet Tree. Both were absolutely amazing. I cant wait to go back! There are 3 tables to sit at in the Union Square location. i was worried that it would be really busy around 6:30 but there were surprisingly room for us. The atmosphere is very fresh and clean and the men who work there were very kind and prepared our order quickly on plates. Takeout boxes are available as well.
