Just like other reviewers mentioned, this place is off the charts good. So much so that I am afraid my daily visits to the restaurant cannot be that healthy (sushi is good... but too much of everything and...). Excellent food, cozy place, nice staff... you name it. The chefs are so inventive, and you just must try one of the house special roles. I would recommend either "Brooklyn Bridge" (comes with a special eel sauce) or "Fashion" (shrimp tempura predominately + a few special sauces on top). You want to have a great sushi experience --- nothing to think about, Iron Chef is your place. The only con is that the place is relatively small, so it can fill up rather quickly. That can translate into a 20 min wait on a busy dinner night... but when I come to think of it, if it were any bigger the restaurant would not probably be as good or intriguing as it is now.
