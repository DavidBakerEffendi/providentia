Amazing food, impeccable service, and truly authentic french "brasserie" ambience (so, I am told ). I had the goat cheese and caramelized onion tartlet, which just melts in your mouth.  The profiterole were incredible, and the molten chocolate sauce is brought to your table separately and poured over the puff pastries right in front of you.  The chocolate pot de creme was good too, although not as extraordinary as the profiterole. Would go back in a heartbeat !
