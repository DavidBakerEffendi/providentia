Rex is a fantastic little spot in Philly.  All of the dishes were well composed and felt like they were WAY more expensive than the $16 per entree that they were (I guess I have gotten so used to DC's inflated prices.... blehhh!).  Its very hard to find a place that BOTH of my parents like, and Rex hit that spot exactly right!  I went against one of my ultimate pet peeves, and got the chicken. You should do the same, and thank me later.
