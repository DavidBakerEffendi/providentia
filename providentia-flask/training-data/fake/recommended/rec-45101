We've visited this place on the recommendation of a friend and have been back a few times since... so i guess we are fans. Here is what you get. There are 3 options for the buffet. All salad bar, All meat bar or a mix. Personally, I like to get the mixed plate. The meats that we are aware of include - Flank steak, sirlon, chicken (i think it's usually dark meat), pork loin, chicken sausage, pork sausage, short rib, chicken heart, bacon wrapped turkey. I also feel like they have lamb, but i could be mistaken on that. I have to be honest that it is a bit of a hit or miss with everything for a number of reasons including, the time of day you go and the way the dish/meat was seasoned. But overall, for the price you pay, it's good and consistent enough. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by and try a little of everything then go back from more.
