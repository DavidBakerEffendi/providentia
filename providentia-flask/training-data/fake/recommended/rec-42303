I've been to all the top rated restaurants in the Slope and Smith street and Rose Water's my favorite.  I think for me what gives it the edge over some of the others in the neighborhood (Al di la, Applewood, Grocery) is that they use more butter and cream  (although I loved al di la and applewood too).  I could be wrong about that, but regardless, the food just tasted a bit more luxurious to me.   My only knock against it is when I've gone they tend to seat us close to others, even when the restaurant is empty, and you feel like your sitting on top of others and it seems a bit strange and uncomfortable being clustered in a corner with others while the rest of the restaurant is empty....  So while the food has been great, the ambiance felt a bit claustrophobic.
