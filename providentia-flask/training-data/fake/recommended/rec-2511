after watching what seemed like a thousand pat's vs. geno's stories on the food network, i had to put my moral principles of not eating meat aside and get in on some of this cheesesteak action. while in philly, do what the philly-ians do. philly-pinos? philly-ites? anyway, yes, the food network made me do it. what a waste of giving up moral principles! i mean, i have to admit, Â it was all kind of fun - a huge line and me hoping that pat and geno themselves would throw down in the middle of the intersection. alas, no throwing down was had. le sigh. the sandwich itself wasn't anything spectacular. you've got meat and cheese on bread. whoo-wee. (also, to assuage my moral guilt, i took out most of the meat, only keeping two thin slices. hmm. in hindsight, i guess i should have just bitten the bullet and eaten all the meat). the fries, however, were delicious. super super good fries. also, we chose geno's because the line seemed shorter - but frankly, i kind of liked the flashy las vegas feel to it, too. i was so easily tricked! i gave away $10 of my hard-earned money to support xenophobia and cops (i don't have anything against cops, per se - i am just a critical and aware citizen. rampart scandal/rodney king/sean bell anybody?) all these moral principles, down the drain. but thanks for the flash, geno. it was entertaining.
