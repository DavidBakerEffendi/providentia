Ok first I'm going to say this * The food is high quality * The decor is very nice * The people are very friendly and the service is fast As far as a restaurant goes it's a good place, however, it's food that's meant for the American palate. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; people should just know before going in. My wife is from Bangkok so I end up eating a lot of Thai food, and we have a few favorite restaurants in Boston where we live. My personal favorite food is Larb with pork and sticky rice and I order it every time I try a new restaurant. I like to see how they compare with each other.   They brought out the Larb, it looked beautiful and had good color. I tried it and though certainly tasty, it was missing the usual heat from the thai chili and I didn't pick up any of the texture from the ground rice. It may have been in there but I just couldn't taste it. When they brought out the sticky rice it wasn't the white, glutinous rice  that I was expecting, instead it was a black rice mixed with black bean in a banana leaf and was mildly sweet. When I asked about it the nice waitress said they did not serve white sticky rice. I was surprised by this, I had grown to expect it as a staple in Thai restaurants. I need to reiterate, the food was good. It's just been catered to American customers. So if you're looking for a pleasant restaurant with  tasty food that's comfortable then I give this place 4/5. However, if you're looking for a place that's authentic then I would give it a 2/5 and recommend somewhere else. Probably in one of the Asian neighborhoods. That's why my final score is 3/5.
