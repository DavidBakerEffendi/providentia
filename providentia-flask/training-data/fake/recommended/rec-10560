I would love to be able to write a review commenting on the food at Plum on Park, but unfortunately my experience makes that impossible. I walked in on the Saturday before Christmas with a friend.  It was not packed, but there were no tables available.  We were told we could wait at the counter for a table to become available.  Ok, I said (foolishly), let's have a coffee at the counter and wait for a table.  The not-very-friendly waitress behind the counter informed us that if we ordered a coffee at the counter, we would then have to stay only at the counter.  Charming and unwelcoming, but ok, we decided to wait at the counter for a table.  About 15 minutes later we noticed a table opening up...fine.  But wait, there go two people from the counter with their coffee mugs in hand moving to the table - with the help of the waiter!  Obviously the waiter had a different idea of the rules than the waitress did. We decided to skip the pretentious, ridiculous bs and move on to someplace with fewer rules and regulations, and also some fairness. I would skip this joint.  Even if the food is fabulous, it's just too much work to get to it.
