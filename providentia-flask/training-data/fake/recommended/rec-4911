Disclaimer: This review may be unfair. But I am emotionally compromised right now. This is not directly a ricky's thai montgomery review. My FAVORITE thai food spot thai kitchen III in hillsborough was bought by a ricky's thai. Now I gave it a shot because hell how much could it change? But based on my regular orders the thai curries things have gone to COMPLETE SH*T. The rice is now hard almost like it's really old. The vegetables were the texture of baby food all mushy. Even the broccoli. (How is that even possible?) Don't even get me started on the taste of the coconut curry sauce. Before it was complex had spicy, salty, savory, and a tiny bit of sweetness. Now it's just spicy and lacking flavor. If I could ask the owners of the previous thai kitchen III to come back I would. Because ricky's thai in hillsborough is just plain Turrible (Hopefully there are a few basketball fans who get the reference)
