Very trendy, pretty restaurant.  We ordered an assortment of different foods and shared them between the 5 of us.  Lamb burgers, hummus, falafel, garlic & lemon chicken, "phoenician fries," rice, and I can't remember what else.......but it was all really good.  The waitress was very helpful in recommending to us what we should try.  I loved the mediterranean flavors.  We were too full for dessert, but we certainly were interested in them.  Perhaps, next time.
