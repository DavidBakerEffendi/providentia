This was an incredibly disappointing experience. Yelp completely failed me. Service was all but not existent. After sticking us in the back room they forgot about us. We watched another table leave without ever getting served. Wish we had done the same. Â None of the spicy dishes even had flavor, much less spice. When. My wife asked about the lack of spice in her soup, she was told it wasn't supposed to be spicy. Yet the dish is called " Spicy lemongrass soup.". My sister-in-ordered a plate of plain noodles for her 4 year old. They came covered and fully dressed. When we sent a dish back, we weren't asked if we wanted something else or offered an apology. The appetizers were the one saving grace, but not enough to make this worthwhile. And then they made us sit around and wait for a bill. Stay away.
