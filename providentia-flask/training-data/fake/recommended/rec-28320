Had brunch today at Rye and it was delicious. We had the biscuits, stuffed French toast and meatball sandwich. I would order it all again. The coffee was great too, enough to ask what kind it was. I also have to say the decor was nice. The bar was awesome and it appears that they restored antique furniture to it's prior beauty. They serve the food on all mismatched serveware which is cool. I can't wait to go back for dinner.
