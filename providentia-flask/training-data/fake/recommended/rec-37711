I've been watching them get this place ready to open, and have been wondering what it's like inside. Finally went for lunch yesterday with my boyfriend, and was not disappointed. The interior is adorable! I couldn't believe how perfect and put together it looked for being so new. Really homey vibe, clean, pretty, with a touch of old world. Service was great at lunch - quick and easy. Was pretty quiet and cozy inside, not sure if they have wifi, but it would be a great spot to sit for an hour or so on your computer with a sandwich. We tried items off the lunch special menu, which has a $5 category / $10 category. The $5 items are more appetizer size, but it was nice to be able to choose a variety of items. We tried the soup special (Sunchoke cream with truffle oil), Falafel, and Hero Sub with home fries. All items were extremely tasty, with a variety of lovely flavors and textures. The only thing was that some items were a little heavy on the mayo, which I could do without. Definitely worth checking out!
