Came here for a birthday dinner back in August. The popovers they give you to start with are amazing. Had the fried chicken and cheddar waffle which was really tasty. The chicken was a bit peppery but tolerable. The only thing that turned me off about this place was the hostess. We got there a bit early and asked if they had happy hour specials. She looked at us like we asked the dumbest question and just told us that they NEVER do happy hour. Also when we left and came back for or reservation time, it took another 25 minutes top be seated. What's the point of a reservation? Overall, good was ok, pretentious hostess ruined it though.
