Loved it! Paleo and healthy all the way! Even my daughter didn't complain about her meatloaf that she had. I love the cafeteria/grab and go set up. It is very trendy and fancy. I was sooooo thrilled to visit while we were in town and will definitely return on my next trip. We need more locations and establishments like Hu's .... San Diego would gladly welcome you :)
