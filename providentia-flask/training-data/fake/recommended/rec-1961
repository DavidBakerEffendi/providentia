Went here with wifey and a few friends, and the food is okay. We went there on a friday night and there was a 40 minute wiat which I expected. We ordered the chicken satay and tuna tartare. I also ordered soup            ( Tom Yum). The chicken satay was great, I didnt enjoy the tuna, and soup was okay. We also ordered drinks, there mojito are good. we then placed dinner order. I was disappointed in the fish in miso sauce, and my wife ordered the chicekn satay salad which was oaky. My friends got pad thai and basil chicken which were all okay. We went on to get flan for desert which wasnt good. The flan was steaming hot and did not taste good. Overall the palce is okay, good ambience and the price are good. I would of rated higher but I am not a big fan of Thai food.
