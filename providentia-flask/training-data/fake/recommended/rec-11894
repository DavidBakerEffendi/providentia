Consider this a 2.5+ review--during my first visit I was astonished by the beauty of the space itself and enjoyed drinks at the enormous bar that spans the length of the room.  Friendly bartender and solid drinks.  Great social place for after-work or welcome-to-the-theater-district imbibing. HOWEVER, visit #2, I ate dinner here with 3 friends last night and have to say the food was wretched.  Things did not start off promisingly when we ordered--they were "out of mussels" (a standard on their menu) and when a pal ordered the Bittenburg beer (from their draught list) he was told "we're never gonna have that beer" (and it's on the menu because why?)   I wasn't in a burger mood, so shifted from mussels to the quiche/salad combo.  Terrible choice.  I give props to our waitress who credited me back for the awful quiche--completely pre-frozen, sub-catering level piece of cardboard: flavorless, ugly.  Awful.  The "rosemary flatbread" was phenomenally uninspired and downright weird: served cold, on crisp flat bread sticks, smeared with black olive tapenade, roasted red peppers, arugula, goat cheese and figs?  The burgers were rated "not spectacular" though certainly a step up from my missteps.  Fries were OK. I'd go back to drink and show off the incredible room, but wouldn't eat here again if my life depended on it.
