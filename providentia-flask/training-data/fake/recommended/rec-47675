One of the crappiest bars/clubs/pizza restaurants I've ever been to! For a mere $6 cover charge, you too can be yelled at by a 'tough guy' bouncer for standing next to a bar exit because you thought the guy having a beer at the end of the bar was an actual patron, not an employee.   Make no mistake, this is a crummy club with crappy music, a 'so-so' bar, and a bunch of greasy-haired wallflowers and a-rhymithic, preppy-collared spazzes, spazzing out with their pudgy, mouthy, lady-friends who would much rather just get plastered. And I don't care how good their potato pizza is, the co-owner is a skeevy, rotund douchebag in his late 50's who likes to waddle around the club taking up precious space whilst conversing with other like-minded douchebags. As I write this, I am wondering how to get this tasteful yet original, peace-sign tatoo off my hand without laser surgery if it can be avoided. So original yet so forgettable, kind of like the name of this place. Only in Connecticut. A note to the so-called 'management': People who pay money to go out and have a good time, do not deserve to get crap from a bouncer who works two days a week and wants to  unload his racial tensions on someone who is a mere bystander because that very management is too incompetent to realize that employees should not be taking breaks by the bar anyway, let alone at the only exit point of said bar. They should also not be hiring fat, wacked-out sociopaths as bouncers. What a pathetic waste of time. Moving on...
