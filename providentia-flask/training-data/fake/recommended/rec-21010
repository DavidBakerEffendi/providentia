Do yourself a HUGE favor and go through the trouble to make a reservation, it will be worth it. We had a superb Sunday brunch here. Fresh, creative ingredients and "service with a smile." If there is a negative, the place is so jam packed it's a bit claustrophobic. This place could rest on its laurels and just kick back and rake in the cash but they've decided to keep the bar very high, a rarity these days...
