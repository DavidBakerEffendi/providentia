Mezcal is a great spot for casual dinner out...the staff is very friendly (they always welcome our baby and make funny faces at her), the decor is cheerful if a little bit shabby, and the food is consistently great.  Nothing fancy, but this place never disappoints.  And if it's nice out, it's fun to sit outside.
