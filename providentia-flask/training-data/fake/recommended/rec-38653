Best veg food in the city hands down! Recommendations: - Chicken Cheese Steak with Soy Cheese on a wheat wrap - Chicken Salad Sub on a Wheat Roll - Chimichanga with soy cheese on a tomato wrap Also, their desserts are great. They are a little pricey but if you are looking to treat yourself to some vegan cake or ice cream, totally worth it. I recommend the Peanut Butter Cheese Cake and the Cookies & Cream ice cream. Their brownies are really good too :)
