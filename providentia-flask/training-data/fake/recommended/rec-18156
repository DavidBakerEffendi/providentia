The boyf and I went here for University City's Dining Days tonight ($15/person for an appetizer, entree, and a dessert?! STFU!). I'd been before, but my first experience was kinda... ok? But I like second chances. And I freaking love cilantro. So, Vietnam Cafe was our choice for dinner! A few days ago, I left a question on Vietnam Cafe's facebook wall asking if any desserts were vegan (I'm one of THOSE people), and I was informed that they all contain dairy. Oh well. No dessert for me, but I could at least still have a cheap dinner! Upon arriving, our waiter informed me that the 3 pudding desserts were, in fact, vegan. I took the risk! But first, let's start with appetizers. I got the fried tofu (ask for vegan dipping sauce!), and it was pretty good. I mean, the tofu was fried perfectly and the sauce was great, but the tofu tasted like... just that. Tofu. For my entree, I got the vermicilli rice noodle dish topped with fried spring rolls and crushed peanuts. It was a LOT of food. The spring rolls were pretty good... but still, some flavour was missing. Some umph! Some salt! Some peppers! Some soy sauce! Something... I'd eat it again, sure. I have the left overs downstairs. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't AWESOME. Of course, since our waiter told us there are vegan dessert options, I go the taro pudding (taro + rice + coconut milk, served hot). So simple, SO GOOD. SOOOO GOOD. I didn't think the service was slow at all, but we went at a 4 o'clock on a Sunday. Our waiter was super nice! And 100+ bonus points for the prettyfullness of the restaurant.
