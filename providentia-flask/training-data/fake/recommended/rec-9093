ABSOLUTELY DIVINE! Went to NY for vacay & got a tip from a friend to go to this joint... THANK YOU, CHIQUI. This was definitely the best restaurant we went to during our NY trip. We went at 230 am and it was still crowded! Talk about a late night snack.. this tops them all. We ordered oysters - yum! Of course we HAD to get the oxtail bone marrow marmalade. That was a party in my mouth for sure. I haven't stopped drooling over this place since we left. I would go back to NY in a HEARTBEAT just to revisit this place!!
