So delish! I heart this place. Small little spot but big on flavor. I want them to bottle their green sauce and sell it cause I would definitely buy. I've been trying to get something different but I'm addicted to the Mami arepa. It's the perfect combo pork, avocado and cheese. I've also had the mixed seafood as well which was pretty darn good and my friend had the stewed chicken with cheddar which she seemed to love since we barely talked once the arepas came to the table.
