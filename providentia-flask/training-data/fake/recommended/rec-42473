This is a hidden gem if you're looking for fresh ingredients, well crafted rolls, and a easy, relaxed atmosphere. May I recommend the miso soup (yes, it comes with the meal) and the salmon sushimi. Only a few tables in the joint - but the quality and top grade sushi and sushimi level the playing field compared to the schmancy spots on Bloomfield Ave. They will often throw in a free roll for the table.
