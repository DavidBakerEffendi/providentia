The ambiance is cute (your generic dried flowers and wood tables), but it was so dark I could barely see. I ordered the bruschetta which was really just tomato paste on sandwich bread. The $9 arugula salad was tiny with a few meager sunflower seeds. The arancini--flavorless. The kale salad was good, they serve nice portions of wine. The waiter was trying to serve all of the tables but it took me 15 mins to get his attention. I will not go back, unless I am craving vegan wine.
