I am a huge fan of pj's so I have been wanting to go to the new location for a while. We finally decided to go and I have to say it was not what I expected at all. The food was spot on. We both got pancakes and they were really good. It was the decor that I didn't understand. Â It is nothing like the one in Princeton. Not that I think they should have replicated it but if they didn't have the same name I wouldn't know they were both pj's. This location is much fancier. It almost feels like it doesn't fit with the menu. They had a cork board near the front desk for people to carve on to pay homage to the original but that's where the similarities end. I will definitely go back for the food but I'm not a fan of the decor.
