So Char No. 4 has an enormous amount of press, with the name I was expecting a woodsy whiskey filled dark space with lots of coziness in general. Sadly, Char No. 4 is the opposite, it feels somewhat like an upscale hotel bar and the selection of whiskeys/bourbons is definitely grand in scale but I personally didn't find the bartender of the day that I went to be helpful at all in choosing something spectacular. He also was a bit catty saying snarky remarks about most people who ordered anything, could be chalked up to a bad day for anyone but really wasn't an overall great experience because of his attitude. The food is probably really great, lots of bacon and smokey items. I think I had smokey peanuts or something similar which were delicious. Being veggie there weren't many choices, I just wish there was maybe a larger and more interesting cocktail list and it was just overall disappointing.
