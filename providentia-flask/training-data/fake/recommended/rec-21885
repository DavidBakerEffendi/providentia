I'm not sure what happened, but over the course of a year, their portions have been cut in half. For example, we used to be able to get a large container of beef stew or chicken soup for $6 - $8.  Now, a small container (that is not even filled to the rim) of chicken soup is $7 - 8.  The food is tasty, but lately the portions leave us still hungry.  It's just not enough for the price.   Also, we used to love the hearty/HOME-STYLE organic cooking that they used to offer - short-ribs, beef stew, meat loaf, roasted veggies, mac n' cheese, etc...  It really used to taste like food that was made by someone's grandma.   Now that it has turned into a gourmet restaurant without the take-home aspect, it's lost a lot of appeal for this local stay-at-home mom.   I think all of this is a result of a new owner. We haven't seen the old owner since the renovation. Unfortunately, it looks like she took the local charm and sweet staff with her.   I'm still giving at least 3 stars because if gourmet is what you're looking for, it still has something interesting to offer.  I can still appreciate that they focus on locally grown and raised products.
