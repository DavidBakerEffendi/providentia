The best hand drawn noodles! So fresh and delicious. The restaurant is very busy but turns table quickly. I think it was worth the wait. They only accept cash. They give very good portions for the noodle soups. I felt the noodle soup was simple yet flavorful. You didn't need to add any sauces and could just enjoy it as it came. Price is very reasonable. Only $7-$8 for a bowl.
