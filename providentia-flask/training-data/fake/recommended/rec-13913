NYC has oodles of quality sushi joints that serve quality fish, some domestically sourced, some flown in from afar. What sets Sushi Yasuda apart is the complexity and the art of the rice preparation. Check out this excerpt from their website: "Perhaps the most complex and difficult part of making sushi is perfecting the rice. Yasuda uses a domestically grown mix of Japanese short and medium grain rice, combined with Japanese red and white rice vinegars, Japanese sea salt and small amount of sugar. The water has been purified with bincho-tan (Japanese charcoal). He cooks the rice in precise proportions at calculated temperatures for a specific time. Like a scientist in a lab, he has revised his method after years of research and experiment. Using his hands as an instrument, he evaluates how moist the rice is before cooking it. He adjusts the amount of water accordingly. The rice is cooked evenly, is subtly sweet and is the ideal "stickiness" to conform to the shape of the inside of Yasuda's hand. He applies six swift strokes and a delicate pressure to the rice to control the amount of space between the grains and to achieve the particular density, size and shape he deems suitable for the kind of fish or vegetable to be placed upon it." I would recommend calling ahead to secure seats with Yasuda-san at the bar for omakase. Having the additional philosophical sushi-talk from the master made the experience that much more memorable. Seating at a table makes it just another trip to any good sushi joint.
