The guy at Salumeria helped me find a great, semi-soft sheep cheese similar to one I'd had in NYC.  I'd tried to get something similar from Downtown, where I usually go, but they didn't have it and didn't offer a substitute.  It's sad...I have divided loyalties now (with DiBruno's thrown in), but I'm interested in customer service, selection and having Idiazabal when I want it.
