Nice restaurant - a little loud and difficult to hold conversations with the person directly across from you. Ordered the skate, which I thought was really delicious. Bf had the pork which was not good in my opinion. The tempura green beans were a tad soggy, and to be honest, nothing special - felt like I could have gotten that at TGIFs or something. The polenta was also strange - tasted more like lasagna and was very strange as a side dish. Wouldn't make the trip back.
