The first time I ate there I had the Corned Beef Reuben and it was very good.  Today I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap and it was terrible.  The menu said romaine lettuce and it came with shredded iceberg lettuce.  The dressing had no flavor and there was no Parmesan cheese that I could taste.  I ended up just eating the chicken.  I would not recommend it!
