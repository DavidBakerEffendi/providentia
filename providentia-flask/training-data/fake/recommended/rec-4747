We biked up to this restaurant from South Philly for brunch last Saturday, after having read the amazing reviews. It wasn't busy (10.30 AM) and we were seated right away in the first room. THE ATMOSPHERE: I liked the decor, but we definitely felt like we were underdressed for the occasion. We were a little sweaty from having biked there, and I definitely felt the stares for that. THE SERVICE: We felt blown off by our waitress. She didn't offer any help on the menu, whereas the table next to us got a whole "Oh, is this your first time? Let me tell you what's good..." spiel from another server. We also asked if she had recommendations for a place to hang out after brunch, and she said "Oh, just walk to 2nd and there's plenty of stuff." Way to be helpful. THE FOOD: This was AMAZING. I am a vegetarian and I got the amazing Croque Vert. My wife got Eggs Benedict and both dishes looked fabulous and tasted like heaven. I had a macaron for dessert. Having lived in France, I had high hopes for the macaron, but it was very dry and chewy. I would not recommend these. We would go there again for the food and the price (out for under $30), but hopefully we'd get a different waitress.
