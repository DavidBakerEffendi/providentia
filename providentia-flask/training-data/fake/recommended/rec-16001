A good place for a late night bite and beer. We were visiting Philly for the 2013 NCAA Lax championships, and needed a place to eat after the last post-game tailgate closed down. We picked this spot based on the beer/menu selection plus the hour (one the few places open) and it's closeness to the bus station. We did arrive only a 1/2 hour before closing, so maybe some of these comments as due to this. Overall, the menu and beer selection were great. Five of our six meals were very well done. We had the Tapburger with avocado (perfectly done), the Turkey Burger (reminding me of the Margo Lay burger invented by Donald Trump), the beet salad (with golden beets, very flavorful), and Chicken BLT (an excellent version of the traditional BLT) and the Ham/Cheese calzone (this one was inedible.) Our service was a bit slow, but I think this was due to how close we were to closing time. I would go back, and probably rate the TapHouse a bit higher.
