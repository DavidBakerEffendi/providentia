My girlfriend took me to Illili for my birthday dinner, and we might just have to return for Christmas. We ordered two appetizers and called it a meal. In fact, we were so full we had to take the complimentary pita to-go. Following our server's advice, we split the rice topped with melted haloumi and the yogurt Brussels sprouts and figs. Both were delicious and filling, but the sweet Brussels sprouts were life-changing. I recommend sitting in the bar area, where the atmosphere is candlelit yet after-work casual. Also, while you're there, do find an excuse to use the bathroom. The superfluous spread of hair gel and cologne they have set out for customers is worth a laugh.
