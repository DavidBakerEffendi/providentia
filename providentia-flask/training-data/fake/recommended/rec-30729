My goodness, forget the 40 minute wait somebody referenced earlier.  I stopped by last Thursday night and it was estimated to be an hour 15 minute wait!  An hour for even the bar upfront. Thankfully, the previous time I went, we had the back large table reserved.  I got to taste a variety of the tapas and the consensus was that the patatas fritas were RIDICULOUSLY good.  The croquettes were also quite good.  Don't get the periwinkles unless you have endless patience to suck and stab at the suckers.  The rest of the tapas were good, but not memorably so.  We enjoyed several pitchers of tasty sangria to wash it all down.   I had a good time that night and enjoyed the food, but I can't fathom waiting over an hour to try it again.  It wasn't THAT good.  I guess I'll wait for the hype to die down or go back on a less busy night.
