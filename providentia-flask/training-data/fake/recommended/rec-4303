When I was apartment hunting in Philadelphia in 2010, I stumbled upon B2 for the first time. I walked in and was instantly intimidated. With that being said, I've been going to B2 since 2010 and it seems like a lot of things have changed. The baristas go out of their way to get to the customers in line as fast as they can. Maybe they're not as chatty as you'd like them to be, but come on. Would you really want to see the person you're waiting for to serve you laughing it up with someone four people ahead of you? I don't think so! I really like their iced coffee, I always feel happily caffeinated. In terms of food, I'm into the tomato, mozzarella and basil sandwich on a baguette. Only on a baguette! I can't get behind the bagels. I usually can tolerate any bagels, but there's just something about theirs that feels wrong to me. Depending on the time of day, it's kind of hard to sit. Every table is usually filled by someone camped out, glued to their ipad screen. Personally, I'm more offended with the people that go to B2 than the people that work there.
