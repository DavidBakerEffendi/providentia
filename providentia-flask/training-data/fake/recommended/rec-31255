I ordered the chicken gyro plate and it is just what I needed.  A healthy balance of fresh vegetables, freshly baked bread, and nicely seasoned chicken.  The sauces were a bit runny, but the whole plate was very good.  The whole thing was very tasty and I left very satisfied.  And the price is very reasonable too.  Highly recommended.
