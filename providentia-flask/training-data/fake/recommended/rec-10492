IF you want a oldschool place with a local vibe this place rocks. We came in at around 1:30am We asked if they were still serving food the bartender said that they were. We ordered a bunch of the yummiest burgers you will find. the burgers came with salad, and some wicked good potatoes. The waitress even though a little sauced up and wanting to go home was super nice, and fun to deal with. the crowd was cool and it was a great vibe.
