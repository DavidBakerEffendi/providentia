After a couple of days of meat, bread and potatoes, my taste buds were SCREAMING for something Asian. Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading me to this incredible pho find! Now keep in mind that I have pho almost once a week so I am fussy as hell when it comes to pho. After flatly telling them that I would rather eat my shoe than have another "western" meal, my friends and I piled into a taxi and made our way to Pho Ha. On a random note, we were surprised to see a strip mall with like six or seven other Vietnamese restaurants. The best thing about this place? The customization of your pho. Holy crap! Move over Burger King, this place does "Have it your way" right! You can choose how fatty you want your broth, the herbs, the garnishes and more. Like I thought pho was pretty customizable (yes, it is a word...) to begin with, but I have never seen it done like this! I got the large pho tai with a side order of meat and the fatty broth, and you can imagine my surprise when they brought me a small bowl of rendered beef fat on the side to go with my pho. When you ask for fatty broth, that is what you get. The broth was great, the meat was fresh and tender (I eat it basically raw so when I say it is tender, it is), and the broth was heavenly. No MSG headache at the end of the meal and they service was STUPIDLY quick. Two bowls of Pho and two pork chop dishes came out in what seemed like two minutes (O_O) If I ever get back to Philly, I will be sure to come here again ^_^
