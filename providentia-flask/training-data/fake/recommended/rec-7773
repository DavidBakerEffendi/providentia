My first time here... I'm still waiting to pay the bill, but I have to say wow! Easily the best spatzle I have ever had, though I have not yet been to Germany. The goulash melts in your mouth, the dessert is divine and the waiters are very nice. I only had to wait about 15 minutes to get my food once I ordered. I was also seated quickly. Only con was that I had to ask for a water refill myself, as the waiters, once you had your food and drink, left you to enjoy it in peace. Which, is fine except they didn't just bring new water either. So, 4 stars.
