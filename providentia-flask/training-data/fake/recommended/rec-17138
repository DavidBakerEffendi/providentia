Not a typical chinatown restaurant. High ceilings, modern, great staff, & great food. Everything that was recommended to us was delicious from the Dan Dan noodles to the scallion pancakes, but what was the least favorite was the duck. However, our server did mention it was a lot of work b/c it's boney. Which was true, but aside from that...the taste was not great either. Other than that dish everything else we had was great!
