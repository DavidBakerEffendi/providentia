Came to Tequila's on a RAINY Saturday night. Loved to atmosphere, and energy. We started with their traditional Margs, and guac...both were near perfect. The salsa verde and pico de gallo that came with the chips was a nice touch. I got The Pescado al Mango; which was a grilled fish of the day, butterflied, with guacamole on the inside and a ginger mango sauce over the top. It also came with a sweet potato puree and arroz verde. Beautiful presentation, and everything was AMAZING. My new favorite mexican restaurant in Philly.
