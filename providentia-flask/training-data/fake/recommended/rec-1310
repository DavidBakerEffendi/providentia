I think something is seriously wrong with anyone that gave this place more than 1 or 2 stars.  The men behind the counter are very nice and the bread was nice, soft and chewy, just the way I like it.  That's really the only good things I can say.  I wanted to like Pats, I really did.  I came down from NYC with a friend for a quick getaway to Philly and couldn't wait to go Pats to try the original and boy was I disappointed.  Both cheesesteaks (my friend's and mine) were fatty, and dry to the point that no amount of cheese whiz could save.  This is what everyone's ranting and raving about!!! Dry meat in good bread!!!  I make a better cheesesteak at home!!!  Total waste of time and money!!
