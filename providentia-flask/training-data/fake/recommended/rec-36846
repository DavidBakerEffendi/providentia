I must have ordered the wrong thing, because I found the bolognese to be totally bland and tasteless.  I must have salted my pasta 5 times, and even still, I barely tasted tomato. My friends had the orrechiete salsiccia and the gorgonzola gnocchi--the former was good, the latter was great.  I guess I should have gone for the gnocchi. Really cute spot on the corner, and very cozy and warm.  I'll probably be back to try the gnocchi.
