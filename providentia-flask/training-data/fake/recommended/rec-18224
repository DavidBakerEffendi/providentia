Very friendly and attentive owners and staff.  I didn't eat in, but the restaurant is very nice. The bbq pork and string beans were delicious, even though I ran some errands with them and ate them cold.  I have to go back and eat in.   For anyone interested the bathroom was large and clean.  (Always a good sign to me)  I think it is wheelchair accessible.
