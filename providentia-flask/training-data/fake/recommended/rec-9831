Love this place! Its great for groups and everything is good to share family style. The atmosphere is modern mediterranean and the place is hopping on a Saturday night. I highly recommend the octopus and hummus and the Iili Candy Bar was TO DIE FOR - one of the best desserts I've had in NYC to date.
