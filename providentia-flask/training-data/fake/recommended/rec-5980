Mercato is always PACKED, but there is usually little more than a 20 minute wait for a table.  And if you can't bear standing out on the street to get your table, you can go across the street to Valanni for a drink while you wait. When you do get to your table, you are greeted by fun, spunky servers, who deliver some of the best Italian food in town.  A broad selection of appetizers, entrees (including creative, delicious specials), even a full olive oil list is available to suit just about every palate. While the main courses are always outstanding, I must instruct every person to order the Marscapone Cheese Cake.  I don't even really have a sweet tooth, and this is one of the most heavenly things I have ever eaten!
