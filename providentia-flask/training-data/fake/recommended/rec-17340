Here's the deal...I've been here about 6 times... The seafood is always fresh and well prepared. The staff always seems to be very well informed about the selectiions on the menu (or specials).  Kudos to a place that tells a customer " sorry we're out of this for the day... but I can recommend.... " BYOB are always great to frequent and this one has never disappointed me yet! The Guacamole w/ lump crab meat app is a must!!!!  All Oysters are fresh...Could be difficult to get parking near by (but that's typical for the whole area)
