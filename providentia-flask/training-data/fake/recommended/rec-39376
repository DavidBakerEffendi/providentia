Very delicious home-style food!   We had shrimp with string beans and noodles with roast pork.  Taste is spot on, and the service is incredibly fast!  We were surprised at how quickly the food came (within 5 minutes!).  Friendly service too. I would actually like to give the food 5 stars but my one critique is that the bathroom was not clean.  There was also no toilet paper in the stall, and when you go to a restaurant, you want a clean restroom.  However, the food is delicious enough for me to go back, and I will! Good sized portions for cheap prices too!  Shrimp with string beans was $5.50 and the noodles dish was around $7. Note: Cash only!
