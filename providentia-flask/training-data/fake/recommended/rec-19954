I am wracking my brain trying to figure out what all the hype is about here. As the small number of bad reviews have mentioned, the meat is completely bland and the "white sauce" is just ranch dressing. Also, I got some of the hot sauce on my hands, and now every part of my face I touch is burning, even after washing my hands. I wanted to love this place so much, but seriously, I don't get it.
