The price is right. The food is fantastic and made fresh. We had the bahn mi burger, the regular burger, and the kale salad with a side of fries and a cup of each of their homemade sauces. As a BBQ sauce fanatic, I can say the sauce was right on the money. I also hate when places charge you for homemade sauce, these guys did not which is a thumbs up in my book. Also the burgers were huge and cooked perfectly. We got to speak with the owners a bit and they were wonderful people, willing to help us in our apartment search and just generally being cool to talk to. Jeannie (sorry I don't know how to spell it but pronounced like genie) gave us a slice of her homemade peach cheesecake on the house. It was one of the best I've ever tasted, nice and light with a great crust. I can't recommend this place enough and will definitely be back to support them.
