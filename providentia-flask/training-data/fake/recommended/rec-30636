so i have been craving for Falafel since i came back from Paris. this is the first and only Falafel place i have tried in the us over all it is pretty good. people who work there are really nice and fun (yes we dined in even though its a small cafe with only 8 stools) we got the Falafel sandwich one with green and the other with red. honestly they were good but not amazing. i think my Falafel was not hot enough and there was not enough veggie in my sandwich. the eggplant was also just ordinary. but we got the lemon mint and pear smoothie, it was amazing and it was really refreshing.
