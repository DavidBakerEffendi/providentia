We always have, we always will LOVE this place but WHY! WHHHYYY are you not doing garlic on margherita anymore? I've never thought I'd say this about pepe's but it was so bland!  And when we went about 2 weeks ago ( 2 hour trip to pepe's) our large margherita pie was SO THICK. It could have been that it was a mistake or a bad pie. But It was as thick as regular pizzas you could get from anywhere. I was so sad. We have been living out of state (CT) so we have been talking, dreaming, drooling and just getting way too excited about pepe's. So after our 2 hour drive, 30 minute long wait, when we tried to order, the the waiter told us we couldn't add garlic and then the large margherita we got was so dissapointing. One of the many reasons why we love pepe's is because of their absolutely perfect pizza crust, and this time, we didn't even eat any of the crust. We both didn't want to say we disliked it because that's how much we love this place but come on!!!!! Our small pies were still good, ( White clam &  Red, no cheese with anchovies) but please, whatever you're doing, stop with the changes. You guys were perfect the way you were. STOP WITH THE CHANGES PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
