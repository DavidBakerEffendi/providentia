Brunch here is slammin. It's puts a lot of brunch here in San Francisco to shame. We didn't know any better and went on the weekend. Bad idea. We came starving and waited close to an hour and a half for our table. The food was so good. I still dream about the biscuits. Next time, I either wake up earlier on Sunday or I just skip the weekend all together and come during the week.
