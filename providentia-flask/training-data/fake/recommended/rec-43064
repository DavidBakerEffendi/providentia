david and i went here for his birthday and were so very impressed. (yes, perhaps it was the finding myself deeply and hopelessly in love that made the food so wonderful but i really think it Was as good as it seemed.) we started off with this incredible autumn soup that had butternut squash (that i don't like) and maple syrup and was pure buttery  heavenly delight. i don't normally like most soups and i seriously coveted his.  the frisee salad with goat cheese wasn't As wonderful but it was fine. the entre however was simply divine. we both had a filet mignon special that had some maple sauce (yes. there is a theme. it Is vermont afterall) and could be cut with a butter knife. the roasted potatos were small, tender and flavorful and the brussel sprouts steamed to perfection. did i mention the steak? (i am starting to salivate just thinking about it) our dessert was yummy and they had a great selection of port for winding the evening down. the dinner was quite expensive for upstate VT but was worth it (i think it was $280 for the two of us. we did have a bottle of wine as well tho.)  This is the kind of place that would be great for a fall drive to do some leaf peeping or such and stopping in here to dine. you will Not regret it.
