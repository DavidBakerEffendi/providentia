I went to Puerto Viejo over the summer with a former client and I enjoyed the food, the Â people and atmosphere! I ordered the codfish fritters as an appetizer , half chicken with yellow rice and black beans and some sweet plantains on the side. It was wonderful . The waiter was very nice and jovial. The atmosphere is so friendly that we were even having conversations with the other table next to us. Definitely will be coming back here again .
