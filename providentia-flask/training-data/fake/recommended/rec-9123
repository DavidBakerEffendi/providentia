The vegetarian sandwich options here have a long, long way to go to catch up to the A game on the street (I'm looking at you Taim). Hummus and falafel sandwiches are watered down and very messy. All of their pita are of uniform size and obviously made for kabob centric sandwiches so all the excess salad and cabbage juice (that should be not so wet in the first place) ends up sliding out if you get it to go... My bag literally had a few tablespoons of juice in the plastic bag by the time I got home. I will say that the falafel consistency is good but the rest of the sandwich contents were seriously lacking. Also, the fact that the falafel sandwich doesn't come with any hummus boggles my mind. I suggest sticking to the meat centric sandwiches here which are pretty good. Great fries, small size is plenty big.
