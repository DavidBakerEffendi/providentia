Been coming here for years for great Chinese food (back when it looked totally different and had large fish tanks lining the walls - which always disturbed me.) But ever since the makeover (due to a fire) they have installed a full sushi bar so don't let the "china" in Chinatown fool you! Quite a few Japanese inspired dishes can be found on the menu! Whenever I can walk to get sushi it's going to get stars just for proximity. Luckily, their sushi is pretty damn good and the stars are strictly for that. Bring your own (fill in the blank with your favorite poison - mine happens to be plum wine or a bottle of red), loosen the belt (you'll eat too much or maybe it's just me) and enjoy the comfy seats, great service and yummy food!
