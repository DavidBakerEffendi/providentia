I like FSS because it's an escape from the ostentatiousness common to many center city destinations. I won't tell you this is the best food I've ever had, but it's always consistently tasty, comforting fare. The staff seems to genuinely care about your experience and is very attentive. Great spot for a date or group of 4. Get the cream of mushroom soup and the Horseradish-Panko Crusted Tilapia and you will not be disappointed. I'm serious, you guys! I never order fish, but the server mentioned the tilapia was his favorite dish on the menu so I gave it a try. I used to be an Eggplant Roulade guy, but the tilapia is my new jam.
