Beer was good- go the smuttynose porter ($7) Cocktails are small and pricey. I got the July burger: all the toppings tasted great, but I ordered a medium rare, and the burger came out closer to medium well? There was no pink at all! So... Don't know what I would've thought of the quality of the burger if it was actually medium rare, but it tasted pretty plain. Too bad, because it was probably good meat. So blah. And definitely not worth $22. Also, I really like my egg ($1.5 Â extra) on my burgers overeasy- I should've specified... The egg yolk was mostly cooked. I had a pretty unimpressive meal at Village Whiskey. Had hoped for more since everybody is raving about their burgers. Judy, not so impressed. If you're looking for a good burger, try a medium rare Kobe beef patty at 500 degrees for half the price! However, their SHORT RIB cheddar fries were AMAZINGGG. I don't know if I'd give their burger another try, especially with the price so high... But I might be back for their amazingggg short rib cheddar fries :]
