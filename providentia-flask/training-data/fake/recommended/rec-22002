The service, location, and atmosphere were good. Unfortunately the food was underwhelming. I had clam strips that were basically tasteless, and my husband had stuffed haddock that he said was "good because it's covered in cheese", but not actually good for the fish. Not a horrible option but after a week of eating fantastic food in Burlington, I wish we'd skipped over this place.
