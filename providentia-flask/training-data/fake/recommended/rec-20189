Food was very good.  The Manager and Hostess were working hard and very pleasant.  Our waitress however really put a cloud over what could have been a great night out with friends.  She was full of attitude and acted as if she would have rather been at the dentist.  She even said, and I quote "if your not happy there are plenty of others waiting for the seats".
