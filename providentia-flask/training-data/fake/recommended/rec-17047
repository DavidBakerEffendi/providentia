Love this place. Only took off a star because the clerk was on his cell phone and made me wait.  He didn't hang up - just put his call on hold and went back to it.  I left and came back. Still on phone. The food is great! Met the owners once - Stephanie? Really nice, knowledgeable. Hospitable. Welcoming. Food, again, great. I don't think the guy in front was expediting dishes as the restaurant was almost empty and I still had to wait 30 mins for a gyro platter with lemon potatoes and salad. Gyro is mostly cooked. There was only two patrons at tables. Mad at wait time, but always like the food.
