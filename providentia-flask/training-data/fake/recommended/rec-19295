They said 20 minutes when we walked in on Sunday afternoon, but then sat us 3 minutes later. Score. Our burgers only took around 10 minutes and came out perfectly cooked medium wells which is how we order them. Score. We got the truffle burger and the manly burger and I was impressed with the flavors and quality of beef. GOALLLLLL! Their service was excellent and quick, and we had some tasty burgers. I for one will return and try more. Perhaps I'd say their stuff was a bit saltier than necessary (and this is burgers we're talking about so the threshold for saltiness is high), but the flavors were good and perhaps this is just umami I was experiencing for the first time. Good times had by all (meaning me and my girlfriend). I was glad we went.
