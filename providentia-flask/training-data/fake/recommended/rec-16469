I stopped in this afternoon with a friend to grab a late lunch and a beer while in the neighborhood and I'm an instant addict. I ordered the sashimi roll and the soft shell crab bun and both were a delicious explosion of flavors. Being a big dipper, I especially loved the spicy mayo and wasabi mayo dipping sauces with my meal. I also used them with my friend's sweet potato fries which I think I ate half of (half being an understatement, sorry)... they're a must. The ingredients are very fresh and everything is put together in a way that feels cared-for. Â  Friendly service, a pretty interior and cool music add to the experience. My only complaint is that I don't work nearby, because I know I'm going to wake up wanting that soft shell crab bun. Definitely looking forward to trying out more of the menu next time I'm in the area.
