After ALL the talk about fried chicken in the reviews... it was... how do I put it... just fried chicken. Nothing more, much less. It's the kind of fried chicken that is dry, and worth no more than $5. The grits that accompanied the fried chicken was beyond subpar, and honestly I could have just gone for KFC. At least KFC is much cheaper than $19 for TWO, that's right, only TWO pieces of chicken. The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the service was good. I look for memorable food to eat and enjoy though, and this was far from memorable. I will probably forget about writing this review upon publishing it.
