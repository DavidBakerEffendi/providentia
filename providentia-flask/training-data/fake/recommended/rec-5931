Years ago as a tourist to Philly, I was disappointed with the usual cheesesteak lineups I tried during my visits. I saw this place recommended in a Frommer's review and navigated my way back into S. Philly to find it. Â Unlike other places mass-scale prep, I actually ordered it and waited while it was made. In my mind this is the only cheesesteak I've had that's got all the right areas covered...meat not gristly or greasy...cheese in perfect proportion and incorporated with meat...bread crusty outside with a soft yielding inside without any spillage or grease-drips. I've been living in Philly for almost 2 months now and I haven't had a cheesesteak yet, but this will be the place I get back on the habit.
