Way too much hype. This 'eatery' was pretty decent back in the days when it first opened and used to serve 'duck duck chicken' in their brunch menu. But ever since that was gone, a lot of thing just went downhill, I seriously doubt they had a change in their staff in the kitchen but it's pure speculation. I went back for brunch once and had their bagel with salmon, completely subpar, I could have got better bagel and fresher salmon at the little Bagel Street in Plainsboro. Went back for dinner at my company's holiday event, the only highlight was the cheesecake, besides that? The stewed beef was tasteless and must have been from a high pressure cooker (you know, the machine that cooks things really fast when you don't have enough time to prepare dinner), the fish was bland, and the veggies simply taste, well, raw. Bottom line, this place used to be solid when it first opened, not anymore.
