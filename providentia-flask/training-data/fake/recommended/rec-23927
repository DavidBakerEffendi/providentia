This was our first visit to the restaurant. We went on a Thursday night at 6:30. It wasn't crowded at all. We're vegetarians, so that colors our perception.  They had several vegetarian options on the menu. We ordered the beet salad and the roasted leeks to start, and the BBQ seitan and the wild mushroom cakes for entrees. In a word, underwhelming. We really wanted to like the place, but there were just a lot of missteps with the food. They have to be a little more assertive with the seasoning, because everything came out bland. They also didn't seem to understand how to make the seitan tasty. Specifically, the polenta was flavorless, like cream of wheat. The BBQ seitan should have been grilled or at least fried to give it some texture. Some elements were very good. We really liked the white bean hummus with crostini that they served as an amuse bouche. The mushroom dish came with an excellent savory carrot cake and edamame hummus. The service was friendly but mediocre. The host was a bored young person who seemed like a family member dragooned into working. Our server was friendly but not especially professional. it's not a very expensive place but for a $14 entree I think you can get better service. The decor was just weird. For a place that positions itself as a natural food restaurant, the inside was like a Kubrick movie. There is a tree motif on the wall, but the trees are gray, and the light fixtures all stark white, while there is a 70s-era crimson rug on the floor, with faux-wood tables. The dessert options sounded uninspiring and seemed to revolve around a surplus of coconut, so we passed.  There were a few other interesting menu options that  that would make us want to return at some point. But not anytime soon.
