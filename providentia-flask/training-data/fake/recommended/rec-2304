I like this place better than Geno's, but that doesn't mean it's great. I tried their Whiz Wit and cheesesteak with mushrooms and provolone. The cheese whiz is the way to go (and I don't even like cheese whiz). I prefer their chopped steak to Geno's, and their bread and onions are better. I'll never go back to either places though--these cheeseteaks are mediocre at best. At least I can say I tried it!
