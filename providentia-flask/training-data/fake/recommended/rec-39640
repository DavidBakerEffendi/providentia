*this review is for dancing only, not food! A friend invited me here for the first time on a Friday night.  Didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised on all levels. The bouncer clearly saw it was my first time since I had parked at the lot right across the street and came walking in.  FYI, you're not supposed to park in the lot across the street unless you want to get ticketed/towed lol.  He felt bad for me and asked the valet guy to park my car one lot down (allowed).  In fact, he even said he'd waive the $10 cover charge for me.  Nice bouncer man, check.  Nice valet man, check.  So in I went to Euro Lounge... The front area is more lounge-y with a bar, hi-tops and low seating alike.  The room in the back is where the magic happens.  Euro has a lower ceiling so it gives off an intimate vibe.  The floors aren't bad; dance shoes worked just fine.  And that's what I loved the most.  People actually brought dance shoes!  Love.  There are a bunch of scattered ottomans and some benched cushioned seating on the left side.  There are also two curtained private sections.  Either way, reserved seating or not, there are plenty of options of where to drop your shoes/belongings. Music is good, crowd is good.  They dance on 1 and on 2 here.  I'd say the only cons are: 1) The cover charge. 2) They don't serve tap water and charge $4 for a bottle of water. I loved it so much, I came back again the following Friday.  Luckily, a friend was having a party so I had a reduced cover for $5 (vs. the regular $10). TIPS: 1) Free cover before 10p 2) Free dance lesson (salsa/bachata) 9p-10p 3) Check their FB page for events going on for a reduced cover charge at the door. 4) If you're there to drink, better to order beer or straight liquor.  Bartenders are gorgeous (!), but drinks are very watered down and not made properly.
