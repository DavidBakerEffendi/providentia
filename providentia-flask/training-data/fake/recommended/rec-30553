Tiny little place with great tapas and wonderful service.  Got here right before it got super crowded so we were able to get a table without a reservation.  Lamb skewers are amazing and the paquetitos de jamón con alcachofa are absolutely delectable.  We also got a cheese plate and the pan con tamate which comes with a trio of spreads.  I think in total we had four to five tapas which was plenty.  The wine list is pretty decent too.  And let's not forget the dessert--the poached pear and leche frita are amazing!  A great neighborhood gem!  I can't wait to go back.
