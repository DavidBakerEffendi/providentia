Overall, this place is great. Delicious (meat) burgers, a nice selection of beers on tap, etc. However, the first - and last - time I tried Prime 16's house-made veggie burger, I could not finish it. It was incredibly bulky and bland. I had expected more from such an otherwise 4.5/5-star-worthy establishment. This was about a year ago, so the recipe might have changed. No matter, there are certainly other vegetarian options at Prime 16 to choose from. In summary: weary herbivores, sample a righteous stout (or lPA, or porter, etc., etc.) and steer clear of the veggie burger. Oh yeah, and don't forget to order the sweet potato fries.
