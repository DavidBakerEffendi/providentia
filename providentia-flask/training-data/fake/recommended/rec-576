Nai's Tapas is an experience that you share with family and dear friends. The food is delicious, but the sangria and the hospitable atmosphere is what really makes this east side eatery a great experience. I have been here about 10+ times and I am treated wonderfully each time. The crew is very warm and they make sure your cup is full of sangria all the time! You have to treat yourself.
