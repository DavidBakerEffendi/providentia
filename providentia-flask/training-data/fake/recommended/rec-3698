Tom's diner was my best dining experience in New York bar none! When visiting New York from Vancouver last summer our local BK friend told us we absolutely had to try Tom's Diner. She's never been more right! Wow, we positively loved it here, the food, the ambiance, the crowed and the history of the venue make it an absolutely necessary stop if you're ever in Brooklyn. Maybe not the best place to count calories but definitely the best spot to go if you're looking for stick to the ribs amazing breakfast or lunch. The Eggs Benedict, the Pancakes, I don't even know where to start - all were absolutely amazing. I especially loved all the different sauces and butters as well, there was a caramel one that went so perfectly with the pancakes yummmmm! The Black & White milkshake really topped off my meal. I don't know how but I finished my entire plate and then tackled some of my girl's. Seriously, if you are ever in the neighborhood and hungry, do yourself a favor and head to Tom's.
