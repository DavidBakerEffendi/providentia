Creative menu with Asian inspirations all throughout, even where you don't expect it. Not normally a fan of Asian flare in upscale dining, but Perilla is subtle and unforced enough that it works to create some unexpectedly delicious and flavorful dishes. The cocktails are nicely designed, although could have some stronger options, and the staff can help you sort through their wine list to match any pairing you desire. Ordering 4 appetizers for 2 people, our waitress was able to perfectly course out the meal. The scallops, maybe the most overtly Asian inspired dish on the menu, we simple and superb. The combination of the fried rice balls complemented the dish perfectly. My personal favorite was the country egg, the perfect comfort food (onions made it). The beet salad served as a lovely palate cleanser, light and crisp, before the spicy duck meatballs, which did indeed live up to the hype (you really can't go and not order them). The donuts as a dessert are indeed ridiculous, as previously noted, many times. p.s. dont wear a sweater! Gets very warm inside!
