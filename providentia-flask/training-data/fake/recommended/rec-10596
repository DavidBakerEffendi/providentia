This is my favorite Brazilian restaurant in the Ironbound section. I usually opt for the special that is offered.  For $16.99, you get an all you can eat buffet (with a large selection of food), 1 drink, and choice of dessert. The food is always fresh and being replenished by the cook(s). Some of my favorite selections are the salpicao, picanha, and the fejao tropeiro.  For dessert I recommend the passion fruit mousse with white chocolate. Don't forget to order the guarana (Brazilian soda)!
