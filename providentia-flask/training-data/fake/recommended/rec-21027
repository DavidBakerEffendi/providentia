Awesome discovery ! Tried this new spot last week - was expecting a typical wine bar with its usual fare and was really surprised by the exceptional food and the wines. Â Think high end bistro with some french regional specialties I never had before. The wines were a surprise too, didn't know the organic wine had so much to depth. In summary, the Trader joes of wine bar.
