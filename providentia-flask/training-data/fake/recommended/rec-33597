I just can't jump on the bandwagon here. The food was OK but the service and the attitude just left us wanting to spend our money elsewhere...and we gave it two chances just to be sure. Two different servers both with unacceptable attitudes. But the last straw was the manager who could have cared less when we expressed some concern about the uncalled-for attitude. That's when we realized it was hopeless and Â from where the attitude was originating. Thank goodness there are so many other great restaurants in the area that value customers. We feel no loss.
