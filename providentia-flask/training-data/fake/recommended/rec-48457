We landed by mistake at this place as we were heading to Cranbury . We are vegetarians and ordered mac and cheese, spaghetti Arabians , mushroom risotto , fries and  bruschetta . We were 5 of us and wanted an express meal which Ryan more than willingly obliged he was  great and very friendly . All the dishes were good and warm. Only thing was that the bruschetta was heavy on the garlic.
