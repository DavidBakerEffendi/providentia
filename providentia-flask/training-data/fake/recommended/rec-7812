Good Lord, this stuff is DELICIOUS.  I find myself in one of those situations where I want to eat everything slowly so it lasts longer, but it's so good that I can't help myself and suddenly, it's all gone.  And I just want more and more. I highly recommend the shoyu, which is the darker soy sauce.  I opt for no meat (pork belly) and instead substitute a soft-boiled egg.  It's not for everyone, of course, but I have always been a huge proponent of soft-boiled eggs on noodle bowls. It's a no-frills little spot, as trendy as its name.  Cash only.  Bring your appetite.
