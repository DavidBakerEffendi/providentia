How could one not love truffle fries? I came here for lunch. The place is small (capacity indoor: 15?) so either be prepared to eat outside in the blistering cold (it was a chilly sunday) or give it a 30minute wait. My friend ordered a normal burger and I ordered the Five Leaves Burger with truffles fries on the side along with the devils on horseback Devils on horseback: quite eccentric. date wrapped in bacon complemented with dijon mustard. If you never tried this. its a must but just for the experience. Five Leaves Burger - where do i START? I must say - what differentiates a quality burger from McDonalds is the quality of the ingredients and Five Leaves does not sell themselves short. The burger had a ciabatta like bread, with a LARGE juicy and cooked perfectly grass-fed beef, fried pineapple slice, another half an inch slice of beet and a sunny-side up egg to complete the burger. did that sound like a lot to you? YOU BETCHA! after you put another thick slide of tomato and lettuce in your burger and you have yourself a 5" handful. and the truffle fries? just that extra heaven on top. ask for a side of harissa mayo to dip. YUMS! the only knock I have with them is that bc they are so busy - their service tends to be a bit slow...and.... dirty? The water cups on our tables looked a bit unclean which didn't really bother us. but when my five leaves burger came with mold spots on my beet... THAT was a BIT alarming. but the waitress was kind enough to address it. she claims it was sage that fell on the burger and got it replaced for me. so if you don't mind the longer wait or the possible dirtier service - come for the coffee and food because Five Leaves will turn you into a believer.
