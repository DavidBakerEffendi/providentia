On Main Street, just over the West Orange border in Orange NJ,  this local neighborhood gem has a huge and varied menu. The service is always great, as is the food.  It is a fun place for families or couples on date night.  Been coming here for years.                                                                                                                                        I love their chicken enchiladas and chile rellenos on their combo plates. I've had good veggie combo plates too!  They have a lot of fresh seafood as well. Their margaritas are decent and they have a good choice of Mexican cervezas. There is live music on the weekends, a nice Mariachi duo will serenade you, as you try the complimentary cheese enchilida app and delish  fried banana chimichanga with vanilla ice cream for dessert that I always make room for.  Have never had a bad meal here yet and I've been here dozens of times. The restaurant has ample parking in its back lot. As you enter through the back door of the restaurant for a minute you feel as if you are in in the Southwest, as the outside stucco is colorful. Ask to sit in the little room for four that has bright murals of Mexican history  painted on its walls. You won't be disappointed.
