This place has delicious sandwiches, but be prepared to wait -- and wait and wait. They have a variety of different types of sandwiches.  All of which sound delicious. And there were lots of vegetarian options. I don't suggest trying to change or substitute ingredients on the sandwich - I get the feeling they don't like that too much.  Most of the sandwiches are warmed which is part of the time it takes so long, and it just seems like it takes a long time to assemble them, for whatever reason. It is a really small space, which is kind of difficult to find,  and it's cash only. Check it out at least once if you need lunch and are in the area...then decided whether or not its worth it to go back.
