Ladurée was at the top of my list of places to visit as soon as I moved to New York, but I just couldn't bring myself to go to the Upper East Side just to buy macarons. When I had the opportunity to visit the Met just a few streets away, I saw my chance to finally try these delicacies that everyone seems to rave about. A gift box with 6 macarons cost $21. Yes, I could have saved money by just opting for the bag, but I figured I'd go all out and keep the box to commemorate my first Ladurée experience. I got 2 each of pistachio, rose petal, and salted caramel. I love pistachio-flavored anything, especially macarons, so I was expecting it to be my favorite of the bunch. But to my surprise, rose petal was by far the most delicious and worthy of the Ladurée price tag. The floral flavor was sweet yet not overwhelming, and the buttercream filling was just the right touch. There was nothing wrong with the pistachio and salted caramel, but they weren't anything I couldn't find elsewhere for a friendlier price. I understand that these macarons are flown in from Paris, but Ladurée's prices persuade me to find other options to satisfy my cravings for less. I probably won't come here again unless it's for a special occasion or I want to buy some for a friend's birthday. The gift boxes are absolutely gorgeous and will certainly make anyone happy!
