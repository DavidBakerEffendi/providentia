Would give it even higher if I could. So good I had to go back for dinner for another helping! Â Huge serving for a a great low price. The food is outstanding; chicken was well-seasoned and fell right off of the bone, ribs were lean and tender, the chorizo was some of the best I have ever had. The owners are also some of the nicest people around.
