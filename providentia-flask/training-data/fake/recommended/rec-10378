Cozy and full of character, Minetta Tavern seemed to make it on everyone`s list of where to eat in NYC. And seeing it in Mad Men as Peggy's date restaurant...sealed the deal. Opened in Greenwich Village in 1937, Minetta Tavern is a Parisian steakhouse meets classic New York City tavern. Over the course of its long history, the Tavern was frequented by various writers and poets like Ernest Hemingway, E. E. Cummings and Dylan Thomas. The restaurant feels very old school New York with its checkered floor, white crisp table cloths and hand painted murals. But its the $26 Black Label Burger that makes this place a hot ticket and tough to get a reservation....so book in advance!
