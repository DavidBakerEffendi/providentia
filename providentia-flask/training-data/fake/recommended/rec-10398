i concur with alot of Yelpers - great food and warm atmosphere.  The owner, Martin knows how to run a real pub.  The bartenders and waitresses are solid and never tire of serving food and drink.  If you are ready to relax and put in a 'session' of imbibing and nibbling - this in the place!  Slainte!
