Whether it is your first visit to the Big Apple or you are a regular city dweller, Carmine's is a top notch restaurant with top notch service. Carmine's puts the family in Family Style. I have adventured into Carmine's many times, and every time I feel like I am at a large family gathering with everyone talking to each other everywhere. Not one time have I not had a quick convo with someone I never knew when I have gone to Carmine's. The wait staff is wonderful. They are friendly and like to have conversation with you. They are also open to giving suggestions which are usually right on. Now to the food. It is family style, so the portions are large. Two people can definitely still eat there, as long as you can agree on a meal and don't mind taking alittle extra home. I am not even going to try to tell you about their whole menu, but I will clue you in on some of the dishes I have tried: Appetizers: Buffalo Milk Mozzarella Caprice Salad-- This appetizer dish is amazing. Their mozzarella is fresh imported from Italy and is the best I have ever had. Their tomatoes are wonderful and the dish is put together perfect. It is a great start to any Italian meal. Entree: Lamp Chop--This lamp chop is HUGE and stuffed with everything from mozzarella to tomatoes and mushrooms. The taste is amazing and the meat is grilled to perfection. You are definitely not finishing this meal alone so plan on sharing. Chicken Parm-- The only chicken parm better than this, is the one I cook myself. The chicken is so tender and breaded just right. The sauce is amazing and they put enough cheese to keep you happy for the meal, well if you are a cheese person. Desert: Titanic-- The Titanic is beyond crazy. It literally is a titanic of a sundae. It is HUGE and looks like the boat it self. Be sure to eat it quick though, because like its name sake, it sinks (melts) pretty quick in front of you.
