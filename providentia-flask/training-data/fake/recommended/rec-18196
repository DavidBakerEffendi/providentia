I haven't been to the bar. But this place is possibly the best venue for small shows. I saw Langhorne Slim here and the sound was perfect. Because of the layout, it seemed like a very intimate show but high energy at the same time. And you could still navigate to the bar for a drink. One of the best venues in Philly.
