I have always had a good experience here so I am surprised by some of the bad reviews. Maybe they were having an off day? Anyway, I don't go here too often for lunch mainly because they are a bit on the pricier side, but once in awhile, its a nice treat. What really makes these sandwiches is the bread. I think it's August First bread since they are the same owners. Anyway, some of my personal favorites are the Chipotle BLT, Turkey BLT and the occasional special The Fourth Grader, which is a turkey sandwich with potato chips, super yum. Check it out for some high quality meats and breads.
