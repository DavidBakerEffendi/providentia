This place is great. I was brought here by a friend who is friends with the owner. After a Happy hour we were hungry and wanted something quick. He suggested Banh Mi and I am always down for a Banh Mi sandwhich. I ordered the classic and the Lychee green tea. Bread is crispy and has all the right ingredients a classic Banh Mi should. It is a little bit more pricey compared to brooklyn or chinatown, But its expected since it is in the city. Â There use to be another spot closer to St. Marks area that sold Banh Mi but they were not as good, Maybe thats why its no longer there anymore? If you are craving a Banh Mi and don't want to travel into chinatown this place is a great alternative.
