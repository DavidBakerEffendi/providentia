2.5 stars. It was ok. We came on a Sunday for lunch and lots of food items there were old and cold. Everything tasted ok but not the freshest like it's been sitting out for a while. And the place kind of smell a bit funky as well. Overall, not the best buffet but if you are hungry for Chinese in the area and like different options, Â this will do
