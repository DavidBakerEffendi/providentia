Delicious meal. Definitely order the lamb, if it's available. I got the lobster and my man got the lamb. The lamb totally won. We also got the spinach salads and glasses of wine. It was all quite tasty! Service was excellent, and the butter for the bread is rave-worthy (random, but good butter deserves some praise!)
