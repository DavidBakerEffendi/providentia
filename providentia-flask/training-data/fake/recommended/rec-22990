Went last night with some friends and was generally disappointed. The service was very slow with nearly an hour between our appetizers and main course. I made the mistake of ordering a kobe steak that the waitress said had just come in the previous day. The steak was very disappointing. I have had kobe steak before and this was nothing like it. It was thin and didn't have the trademark integrated fat that kobe is famous for. Frankly, I have had better steak from Hannafords. It was a very expensive mistake on my part. The sushi was OK but not any better than you can get at Koto. If you want Japanese there are better options in Burlington.
