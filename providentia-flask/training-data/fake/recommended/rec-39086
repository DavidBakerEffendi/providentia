I try to stop in here for dinner at the bar on quarterly trips to NYC. The interior is simple, chic and inviting. It's always busy, but never overly loud. I called as I was walking in the village two Thursdays ago around 7:15 in the evening to see if there was a place at the bar, was assured there was and was greeted warmly when I arrived. The bartender was kind, attractive and professional. My meal was beautifully prepared and presented without being fussy - sweet pea soup to start, poached lobster over potato ravioli for a main course and a rhubarb and lichee trifle for dessert. I've been here now about a half a dozen times and always leave delighted. Worth every penny and more.
