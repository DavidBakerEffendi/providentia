Went there with some girlfriends after I heard how good it was.  I was not disappointed and will most likely go again.  There is much to choose from on their menu for many different tastes out there.  I knew what I was getting into when I went, knowing that the portions are tapas (appetizer sized).  I actually like that concept because you can try a few different things, instead of gorging on one entrée.  Careful when ordering, though, because the dishes add up and it can become somewhat pricey. The atmosphere was very nice and the service was very attentive.  My favorite was probably the Truffle Funghi Risotto, the Patata pizza and the Arancini. I would go back.
