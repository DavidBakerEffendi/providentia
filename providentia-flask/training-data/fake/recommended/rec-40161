Amazing.  The service is impeccable, you'll feel like royalty.  The food is unbelievably good, I've had excellent lamb and goat before (having lived on a farm most of my life) and this was the best I've ever tasted.  The decor is fancy and completely appropriate to the mood of a really special date.  Although you can wear jeans and t-shirts I'd suggest dressing up, sport coat, suit, at least a nice dress shirt and pants.  The first week they were opened I showed up in a hoodie and felt like a heel.  Incredible deal for what they are providing $25 for lunch and $50 for dinner for all you can eat porterhouse, sirloin, lamb ribs... you just can't get a better deal.  Watch your budget on drinks though, they can be a tad pricey, even simple beer like Yuengling Lager is jacked up to silly prices.  Definetly making their money on drinks.
