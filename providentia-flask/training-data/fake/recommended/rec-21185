Before Iron Chef House I had stopped eating Sushi for over 5 years.  This place got me back on the Sushi Boat, its that good.  The ambiance is very romantic and the service is top notch.  Now, lets get to the food.  The food is amazing.  They put a lot of concentration on food presentation, food taste, and food love.  This is my wife's and I fave sushi place in Brooklyn.  We are big sushi roll eater's and this is what we get: -BBQ Squid -Spicy crabmeat salad -Kirin Roll -Hard Rock Roll - Pheonix Roll -2008 Roll YUMMMMMMY in my big fat TUUUUMMMY!
