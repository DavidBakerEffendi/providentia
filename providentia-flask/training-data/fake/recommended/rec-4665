I walk by Rudy's every day on the way to classes/work and no matter what time of day, I always want Rudy's frites and a good old bottle of raspberry Lambic! My friends and I find Rudy's an every-occasion sort of hangout, from celebrating Obama's election to birthdays and weekends-- even better on weekday evenings. Don't miss the frites and dipping sauces (honey mustard and samurai are my favorites)! 1.2009: I'm updating this with a 5-star rating because after some other bar hang-outs, I love Rudy's more and more. Seriously. I'm not even a huge drinker, but the atmosphere is terrific. $8 for two chili dogs and an order of frites? Belgian beer? Crazy nice people ?I'm there!! I've been here three times in the past week. Love it.
