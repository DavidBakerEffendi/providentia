I cannot say enough good things about Barrio Chino. When I lived in NYC, it was my go-to spot every Sunday for brunch. Now when I visit NYC it is the first place I go. Highlights are the margaritas and enchiladas verde. They play great music, the food is well priced and oh so good, and the staff is awesome. Joe and Amy are the best!
