I usually love Popeyes.  But this partcular location is really ran badly. The Chicken consistently comes out greasier and saltier than I ever had down south. The biscuits are dry. Oh and the worst thing ever is they dont offer onion rings.  If you dont know about Popeyes onion rings you are missing something great!! The manager said he would get them if he saw a demand. So... ASK FOR THEM!!!! Atleast the beans and rice are the same. Service is pretty bad also. The truth is you really dont have many options for Awesome fried chicken around here. Not all chains are created equally.
