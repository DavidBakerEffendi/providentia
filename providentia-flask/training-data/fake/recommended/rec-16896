Just went to this place this past Saturday for my birthday and I can't say enough good things about it :) First of all, they flawlessly accommodated a party of 13 people for a birthday dinner and held our reservation even though we ran roughly 45 minutes late (due to traffic!). Can't thank them enough for it! Onto the food- I had the Kale Gnocchi in a Tomato and Garlic Sauce which was absolutely great! I'm a huge fan of gnocchi and I'd never tried kale gnocchi before but it was cooked to the perfect level. I heard (from others in our party) that the spaghetti in pomodoro was great as well. One of my friends tried the duck and enjoyed it a lot as well and thought it was delicious :) The tiramisu (as a birthday surprise dessert) was just the right amounts of lady fingers, espresso, cream, and mascarpone cheese. The ONLY drawback is that this place is cash only which poses a problem when you have a large party of 10+ people. However, everyone in our party knew in advance that the establishment was cash-only and made arrangements accordingly. All in all, a wonderful night with wonderful food, drinks, and atmosphere at Supper!
