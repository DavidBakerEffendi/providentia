I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. The paninis are so inventive and creative, and are so gosh darn tasty. We went on a double date here on Saturday, had to wait about 20 minutes for 4 people - not too bad. The alcohol is reasonably priced--they have several bottles of wine for less than $30 and Monday is half price wine night. My bf and I split the special panini, which we termed "Thanksgiving in my mouth." Super yummy. Although I think I liked the sweet sausage one more. We also had the crostini with spicy queso, salsa, and cilantro cream sauce. I could have skipped that one as it reminded me too much of college in a bad way but my boyfriend loved it. We were too full for dessert but everything sounded great. My friend got the peanut butter hot chocolate and that smelled delicious. Also, random note, there's a super cool old map of Astoria/Long Island City in the bathroom that I would highly recommend checking out. I'll definitely be back!
