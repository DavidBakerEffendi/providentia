Who needs room service when all you want is a quickie? Okay, I jest. But their service was QUICK. I was starving, as was my friend. We ordered the Pad See Euw Noodle dish, the green dumplings with black bean sauce, and some cocktail my friend wanted (she's Russian, I have no alcohol tolerance). And after I caught my breath, I said "just bring them out as quick as possible. And they did. We ate and loved all of it. I recommend everything. The waitstaff came by a good ratio and asked how things were, if we enjoyed our food. We sure did. Asked for the check, had a few laughs and basked in food drunkenness. It was so good that I can't even remember what it felt like. Next time I will.
