After reading all of the great reviews, we decided to try this place for lunch while visiting Burlington. It was awesome! The whole place smelled amazing as soon as we walked in the door, and the food was excellent. We split the salad special which was mixed greens, butternut squash, goat cheese and walnuts in a vinaigrette. So delicious and fresh. Then we had a large flatbread with half Revolution and half Power of the People. (Mushroom and caramelized onion on one side, and buffalo chicken on the other). It was excellent! My boyfriend also had a yummy squash beer which had notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall a fantastic lunch!
