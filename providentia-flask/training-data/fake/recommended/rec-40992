Lunch is a steal here. Food was yummy, satisfying and filling, but I've got to knock a point off for service. The 23-year old (she was VERY busy chatting) hostess practically ignored me and barely acknowledged me when I intimated I didn't want to sit at the bar. I had to repeat myself two or three times before I got some kind of verbal or facial confirmation (it wasn't that busy). I'm just not sure that's the first impression I'd like to have of any place. The best, most authentic Mexican in NYC? It has a hint of authenticity but does lean toward some slight Americanization: nevertheless, I was at least happy to see some version of queso fundido, and flor de la calabaza / huitlacoche quesadillas, stuff I haven't seen on a menu since I lived in Mexico. I mean this is NYC, which isn't exactly known for it. Got the milanesa torta and though the bread didn't seem fresh, it did remind me of a good torta. It was, though, missing a lot of the raw, dirty explosion of flavor that comes from an amazing out-of-this-world torta. (This version is healthier, I suppose.) Flor de la calabaza quesadilla was good though the "shell" seemed a bit overly crunchy / overcooked, and almost seemed more empanada like. Oh and the sangrias are f*cking AWESOME. For the best Mexican food in NYC, try Tortilleria Nixtamal in Corona, Queens. It's a bit of a trek, though Chavela's is a fine substitute when you don't feel like traveling for an hour and a half to just eat.
