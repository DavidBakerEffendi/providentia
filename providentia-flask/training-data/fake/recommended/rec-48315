I am so thrilled to have a restaurant like the Castello Plan in walking distance of my apartment. Atmosphere-wise: it is casual enough that I'm never worried about what I'm wearing but upscale enough that I feel like I'm treating myself just by being there. I wouldn't say this place is great for large groups because it's small inside, but it's perfect for date night or dinner with your visiting parents. The food is really, really great (albeit pricey, but you know you are paying for super-fresh ingredients) and even the simplest sounding things, like the ricotta and Brussels sprout crostini, are supremely delicious and hard to replicate in your own kitchen. I also never feel stupid asking about ingredients I've never heard of before, which is a testament to how friendly their pretty stylish staff is. They have a great wine list and I hope to try more of it this summer.
