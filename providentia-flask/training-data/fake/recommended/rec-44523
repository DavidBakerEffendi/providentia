Writing about the shaved ice--both ABC and the other (can't remember name.)  Fairly accurate, very refreshing Malaysian shaved ice.  For those unacquainted, it can be a bit odd--there are red beans and other "non-traditional" sweet ornaments.  But very good.   Only issue is, fairly small portions, and highly variable preparation means you can get a great dessert one time and a chunk of ice another.
