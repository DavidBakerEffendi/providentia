Many thanks to Tom Colicchio for opening Riverpark on the East side. The ambiance is great - very similar to Tom's West side restaurant. Lovely views along the East River. Outside seating even for just casual drinks, for big groups. The best thing about this place is that it has its own garden - and most of the vegetables served there are grown locally right outside the restaurant. That just stole my heart. Cant get fresher than that! My cocktail - The Marascha Frizz was amazing!! Its Prosecco with a marachino cherry liqueur - yum and refreshing and takes the sweetness away from the Prosecco - just right! We had the grilled fresh mackerel, and grilled octopus appetizers! I have never tasted anything so yummy as the grilled mackerel before. I have rarely seen it even served at most restaurants. We took the sea bass, and the scallops for entrees and both those were amazing too :). The sea bass had a special tapenade and asparagus puree - yummy as it can get. The Panna Cotta desert and the fresh basil ice cream were AMAZING!!!! I am a Colicchio fan - for the way his restaurants are managed; and the amazing ambiance, and the delicious and creative dishes served!
