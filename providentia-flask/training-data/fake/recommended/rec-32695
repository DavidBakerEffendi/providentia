I have lived above Salute for 3 years, going on 4, and I cannot say enough about it! They are willing to make you anything (on and off the menu) and they treat all of their customers like family!  Not the mention the food is amazing and just what you need when you are in the mood for italian.  Jimmy and the gang are fantastic, I can't imagine NOT living so close to them!
