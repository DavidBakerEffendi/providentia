I love this place and here is why: 1- its BYOB (awesome!) 2- food is AMAZING 3-cool atmosphere 4-quick service 5-great west village spot that tourists don't really know about 6-easy to find my way back to (just tell the cab driver "its where the two number streets meet on the w. side") I'm giving it four stars only because they don't take reservations, so sometimes you are stuck waiting for a table (never a long wait though). Also, its small (and I mean super-duper small) but I kind of think its what makes this place charming.
