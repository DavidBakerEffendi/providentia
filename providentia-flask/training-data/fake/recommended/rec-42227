We loved this place, there's no dress code, its very rustic and down to earth. Our waiter was extremely accomodating and friendly. The manager stopped by several times to make sure we were taken care of. The food is delicious. They have a very eclectic menu from oysters, sushi, steak, grilled fish and bone marrow to matzo ball soup. We had fresh oysters, steak tartare, sunomono, shrimp in salt, grilled branzini, duck confit and bone marrow. Everything was superb. They have a full bar and a big sake selection. We even got dessert on the house. Overall a great experience. Definitely will be back. I gave it 4 stars cause the bar does not make martinis.
