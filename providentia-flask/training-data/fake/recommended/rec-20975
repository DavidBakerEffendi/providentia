On a cold Saturday in Williamsburg, decided to try this new Michelin crowned spot for brunch and it was a wonderful experience. We order the green salad with smoked Blue fish and it made me fall in love with greens. the crab cake egg Benedict were cooked to perfection. Sage sausage are so tasty and the funnel cake with maple syrup a new twist to an old classic. But the ultimate is the homemade jam served with the biscuit and scones, all this with a cool crisp bottle of Picpul Â white made for a very nice brunch across the river.
