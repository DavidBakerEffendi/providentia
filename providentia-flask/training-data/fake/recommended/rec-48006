I have been to PT twice thus far, both of which was an amazing experience. I had the grilled-sliced rib eye stake both times, it was the most tastiest, tenderest stake I've ever had. The service and ambiance was wonderful, the waiters are very friendly. They gave me a complimentary shot of liquor on the house. All in all, I would highly recommend this place, and I would go back as many times as I could afford it.
