I was really looking forward to a taste of Tashan and was disappointed.  I didn't need a fine dining experience, just a satisfying meal.  The food was ok  Went for lunch.  $15 for a three course meal. Great. But, though we were the *only* people in the restaurant, the food was slow to the table, and even for chi-chi dining the main course I had was ridiculously small and unsatisfying.  The drink was great; I forget what cocktail it was I had but it was good.  Still, overall, the place felt pretentious and not quite worth the cost.
