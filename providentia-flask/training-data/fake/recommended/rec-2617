I don;t think the problem with Momofuku Ssam Bar is that they are calling this traditional korean style 'ssam' a burrito because it is in fact their twist of a burrito. The Original Momofuku Ssam = A triple oily, poorly put together and not so tasty one. You can definitely taste that sweet fish sauce. All the ingredients were sort of stuffed in different sections so it was hard to get a taste of everything in one bite. Do they always do that? They should put all that shredded goodness, mix it in a pot and for chrissake's please hold all the massive grease! By the end.. I used a fork to pick at it. Although I did agree that the $10 price is great for the huge size of that one burrito at this place. You may look like a cheapo at dinnertime ordering their pre-made ssam as your entree but if you were dying to try it like I was.. who cares. Hitachino Red and White Ale available. Too dark in there. Waiters who obviously favor the big spenders. Ridiculous bar (it was a square block table) waiting area near the kitchen. Sitting at the long bar looked cool though. Table service was not worth it.. the only good point was that they had plenty of loose napkins on the table to wipe your GREASY ass hands. The steamed pork buns as apps were quite delicious. I would go back for those babies. That is all.
