First off, it's BYOB.  Which is a great money saver.   This place has the best vibe.  It's very small, quaint, and has nautical decorations. Our entrees came with a serving of 4 different types of vegetables.  2 of which were in puree form, that was really yummy. I shared the chocolate profiteroles (sp?) and that was completely delicious.  Also the mussels are a must!!!
