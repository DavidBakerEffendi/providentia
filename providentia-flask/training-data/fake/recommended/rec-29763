This review is waaaay overdue. My husband and I had a wonderful, simple and intimate wedding ceremony at City Hall back in September 2012. We then celebrated and had a Â fun and funky reception at The Counting Room that night. We decided to plan our wedding in four weeks (no hassle, no crazy expenses) and with two weeks to go we still didn't have a place. Thankfully, Ruth, the manager, was so helpful and easy going when we organized to have the reception there. She gave us menus for finger food options and drink options. We had a small budget but they made it worth our while and everyone had an incredible time. I know this is going to sound cheesy but it really was a magical day and The Counting Room helped make it so. We had about 80 of our dearest friends and family and we celebrated for almost 8 hours! We were also fortunate enough to have one of the best funk DJ duo, Brooklyn Boogie, performing the same night. It was serendipitous! Best night ever, thank you Counting Room!
