I have been here only twice but I absolutely love it! I've come here with friends on a busy Saturday night and with my boyfriend for a quiet dinner. Both times were absolutely amazing! The decor is nice; fairly dark with candlelight but cozy. The food is fantastic!! I've had the chicken sandwich with coleslaw (which I usually don't like but was VERY good), the Mac and cheese, french fries, and of course the fried pickles!! The drinks are also very good and fairly priced. The time i went with friends we split two bottles of wine and the second time I had the Avery Ellie's beer. The food is what brought me back the second time and it will certainly bring me back again and again!!
