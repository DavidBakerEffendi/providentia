Yummy Yummy Yummy Meatballs in my tummy. That is how I felt after eating here. Automatic 2 hour wait at least. Well worth it. Best part is, you can stop by and put your name on the list. They will call your cell phone when the spot opens up. So go to a nearby bar and hang out until then. Ice Cream Sandwich was delicious! I would definitely come back here again.
