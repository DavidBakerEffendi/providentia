The prices and portions here are ridiculous. Now, hear me out. I know this is a tapas restaurant and typically the portions are very small and expensive but c'mon... $12 for literally four gnocchis?? And everything else was comparably absurd. POCO (my favorite tapas restaurant), I will never cheat on you again! I don't care... you can call me 'cheap'. You can even call me 'poor'. But don't call me 'stupid'. Alta is for the sheep New Yorkers! The only thing saving this atrocity of a place from a one-star rating is its great service, somewhat interesting atmosphere, and delicious brussel sprout dish. Everything else was for the birds...
