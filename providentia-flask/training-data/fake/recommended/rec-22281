The sushi here is pretty good compared to other sushi experiences I've had. I really liked their miso soup - it was simple and very flavorful. Their chicken-rice-vegetable special was decent, but they gave you so little of everything. I don't think it was worth $11. The interior of Kumo Hibachi is very well designed. It was a very comfy place to eat. The service was great. At the time, we were the only people in the restaurant, so the owner would occasionally come by the table to ask if we were enjoying our food.
