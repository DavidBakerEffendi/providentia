I LOVE Witherspoon Grill and I am a pescatarian. The service at Witherspoon Grill is always spot on. The menu has lots of options for non-meat eaters. The crab cakes (ALL CRAB) are TO DIE FOR. The Lobster roll is INCREDIBLE. The wait staff is attentive to tweaking the menu to address the varied dietary issues of the guests. Whenever I am in Princeton, Witherspoon Grill is a must.
