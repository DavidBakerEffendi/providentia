FINALLY GREAT SPANISH TAKEOUT IN WOODBRIDGE!!! Food was scrumptious albeit a wee bit slow servicewise but I'll forgive them as they work out the kinks as I want them to succeed. Reasonably priced with a nice depth of menu. Had the canoas rellenas (sweet plaintains filled with meat and cheese) and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Kid friendly food as well and some classic American dishes as well. Great addition.
