Myself and four other starved, hungover human beings showed up at B4 on a frigid Sunday morning and instantly got seated in the back, at the round table with comfy leather seats. We started off with the B4 baked goods basket that came with the most excellent whipped cinnamon butter. I highly recommend the sticky cinna buns - those are to die for! I went with the Harvest Omelette (those don't come with hashbrowns or toast, just a side salad - which is surprising; I like to carboload in the mornings). It was delicious but absurdly small. Eggs are cheap, add a couple more to the omelet. The Boy had chicken and waffle. YUM! The gravy is meat-packed and super delicious. The chicken is well seasoned and extremely tender. The waffle is made of sweet potatoes, so very delicious and on the healthy sides. The rest of the crew seemed to have enjoyed their options as well. Our meal was accompanied by a female pop star playlist (Fergie, PCD, Britney, Ciara, etc...), so it made for an entertaining brunch. Overall, decent food but small portions, decent location, decent service, strange music selection. Solid 3.5 starts.
