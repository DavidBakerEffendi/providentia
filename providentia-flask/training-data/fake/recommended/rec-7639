While the food is amazing, the service is really horrible. My family and I were seated basically on top of a vent and it was really cold. We knew it was busy so we thought we would stick it out, but after we put in our order, we saw about 4 or 5 free tables and no one waiting for them outside. We asked the hostess if she would move us, she thought it would be okay but when she asked our waiter, he said no since it would be too much of a hassle to change our order to a new table. They did turn down the AC, but it only helped until it kicked back on. In general, our waiter was horrible. He barely came over to us. We waited over 20 minutes for him to come back to take our dessert order after we finished our main course. I might chose something a little less expensive and with better service next time.
