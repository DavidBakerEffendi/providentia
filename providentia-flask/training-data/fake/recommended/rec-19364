This place always seems so busy but I never had to wait for a table. The service was great - perfect for an in/out lunch. They have excellent vegan and vegetarian options; the tofu scramble was my favorite. They lost a star because one of the salads was pretty weak. I think it was their asian salad that was supposed to have all of this extra stuff in it (edamame, avocado - which I may have requested, and some more), but it turned out to be a big bowl of lettuce with the add-ons spread very, very sparingly throughout. I usually don't even use dressing on my salads, so I'm ok with my food being a little bland but this was disappointing. It was just one salad, so it could have been a bad day. I still highly recommend this restaurant!!
