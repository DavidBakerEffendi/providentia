The pizza (parma) and pasta (pork rib lasagnette) we had were amazing.  However, ordered the lamb for main course, on suggestion of waitress since nothing else really appealed to me.  For $30, we got a few slices of undercooked (rare), underseasoned leg of lamb.  If you're going to sell a small plate of leg of lamb for that much money, it had better be phenomenal . . . which it wasn't.   I would recommend this restaurant, but stick to antipasta, pizza, and pasta, which based on my experience and other reviews is what they do best.  They are also reasonably priced for the quality.
