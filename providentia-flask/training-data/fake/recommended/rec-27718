The place is really nice and looks fancy but that's about it... The service has plenty of room for improvement. After being there with a group for over an hour, we weren't asked once about refilling our drinks. The food itself was nothing to rave about. I had a burger that wasn't anything special. I'd have been better off going across the street to Cheeseburger in Paradise.
