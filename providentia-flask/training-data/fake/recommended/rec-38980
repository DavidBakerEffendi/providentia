Stopped for late evening dinner with a date for her birthday - very nice decor and atmosphere.  We both enjoyed ourselves and found the food to be good - I had cucumber martini (nice), salad and trout, she had onion soup (do I have to say French?), Brussels sprouts and mussels.  She was very happy, so I'm happy.
