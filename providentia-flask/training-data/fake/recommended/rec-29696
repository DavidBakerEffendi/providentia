The atmosphere was great and wait staff was very friendly but we ordered two house specialities (the stuffed artichoke and the gnocchi) and the food was quite bland. Â Moreover, the mozzarella on the Caprese salad had almost no flavor at all and the tomatoes didn't seem quite ripe. As a general rule of thumb, I would not return to this establishment unless they invested some $$$ into quality ingredients.
