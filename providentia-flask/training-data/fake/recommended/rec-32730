I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars because our server, Laura, was clearly working her butt off and the food was great. This place has way too many seats and not enough servers. Besides the fact that the management over works their staff, the Cobb salad was refreshing and had great flavor. Great dark and stormy, and really enjoyed my seat outside. If you've got time to kill and you don't mid slow service, this is a great spot!
