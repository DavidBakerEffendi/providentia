Ended up at Anella pretty much by accident. It was my friend's birthday and the restaurant we planned to go to originally was packed, too noisy, ambiguous wait, etc. So... there we were thinking "Hmm...?". The four of us staggered out into the chilly eve and stumbled upon Anella. We were seated pretty quickly - about a 20 minute wait on a Saturday night. Bartender was seriously multitasking while chatting with patrons - I can't blame him for that but his first priority should be filling orders. But again - it's a busy night. At least our drinks order wasn't forgotten. And he delivered them with a friendly cool attitude. DINNER - A mix of apps and entrees. The homemade cheese is amazingly beautiful. The calamari is great but not great for sharing. On its own its wonderful but you need to hog it for yourself to really appreciate it (not saucy). The whole bronzino (my entree) was standard for New York Â (which means damn good i guess). My girlfriend's gnocci - i think pumpin - was --- I guess I'm supposed to use the word "sublime"... Last point - the service. The somewhat stiff waitress at first (it was late) - compt'd us on a round of drinks and the birthday dessert. super cool!
