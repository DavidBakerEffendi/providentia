First: I'm Italian. Second: This place is really good. The service was -o.k, am I famous?? kinda service. The food was overwhelming. I mean, I coulda made a meal just outta da appetizer. Then the soup and salad and then the main course. Momma Mia. Yep. I'm sittin' at the kitchen table and momma is makin' sure I'm eatin' enough. Yeah...I ate enough. Enough to feel like a little stuffed piglet. And it's ALL GOOD.  An on-the-house after dinner liquor to top it off. Yeah baby.....stick a fork in me...I'm done!   You want to eat like a King (or Queen) and NOT break the bank AND bring home food for tomorrow???? Yeah? Well, whattayawaitinfor? Go to Brazi's.
