I ate dinner at the bar and had a fantastic time. Repeat: I ate dinner, at the bar, and had a fantastic time. Becco, unlike the other restaurants on 46th St. has two nondescript doors and no greeter, so I almost passed right by it. Awfully glad I didn't. I was seated at the bar for dinner since I lacked a reservation. The bartender was very attentive and incredibly knowledgeable not only about drinks but also about the dinner specials. I was very appreciative of the fact that she asked if I had a show to catch (I did, and the food came noticeably faster). The food itself was fantastic. I had a Pollo al Limone, which came with a very solid Caesar Salad. The chicken was incredibly tender, and the sauce was just the right amount of flavourful. I topped off my meal with a lemon shaved ice dessert, which was also fantastic. A delicious meal and fantastic service, price be damned. I'm definitely coming back, but next time, I'm going to get me a table.
