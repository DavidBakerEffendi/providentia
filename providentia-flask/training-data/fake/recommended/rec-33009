I came here for a networking event so I paid a different price than usual and had a set choice for breakfast. The food is is terrific.  The bacon and sausage was nice and crispy.  The pancakes and eggs were also prepared well.  The people are are well equipped to handle large crowds; everyone's dishes came out quickly and nothing was left sitting around to get cold.  They served an apple dessert (well as much as you can have dessert for breakfast) that was also great.  Basically, you will like anything you order here.
