Love love love this place. Six of my friends and I came here for "Ladies Night," and left two hours later with our tummies & margarita cravings very satisfied. TIP #1: MAKE A RESERVATION. This place gets crazy. I've tried to come here on two or three separate occasions, and there was always a minimum of an hour and a half wait. TIP #2: SHARE. The food is so good that you will definitely want to try more than 1 or 2 plates. TIP #3: The margaritas & mojitos are awesome. I'm not a big margarita fan, or a big drinker in general, but these were made really well. For an appetizer, almost everyone at our table got the Elote Corn, which I don't actually recommend. You can get a more delicious, and cheaper, version of this at the Red Hook Vendors. For an entree, I shared the Lobster/Cheese Quesadilla and the Catfish Tacos with a friend. The Quesadilla was excellent, and by the end of the meal, everyone was jealous of our tacos, which come with a very generous portion. Â They are basically two mini burritos, versus two standard sized tacos. Bogota is a great place for anyone who wants to have fun -- whether with a friend, significant other or big group. Highly recommended.
