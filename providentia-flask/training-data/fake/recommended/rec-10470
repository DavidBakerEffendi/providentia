AMAZING. I'm allergic to gluten and dairy and this place is heavenly. Had the juicy salmon burger on the buttery gluten free bun, with the avocado and vegan mayo. Fantastic. One of the better gluten free buns around, doesn't fall apart, great "normal" breadiness. Had the side of garlic kale -- delicious. Perfectly salty and flavorful for my liking in sautéed greens. And lastly -- shared the gluten free/vegan brownie à la mode with Coconut Bliss vegan ice cream on top. Daamnnnn.... The menu offers a delightful plethora of almond milk smoothies and vegan salads and gluten free cookies and coffee and a tasty brunch on weekends. Siggy's is not just "doable" as in merely allergen-friendly -- the food is excellent!
