Wha? Brunch on a Tuesday?  Most definitely!  And there was still a wait...  This is the third trip that this place has been on my agenda, and the first time I made it there.  This place may be a priority from now on... I had the Brioche French Toast and it was amazing.  Caramelized bananas, toasted nuts, and some kind of maple/sugary/all around delicious sauce for drizzling.  My friend had the farmers breakfast which she really seemed to enjoy.  Watching the food come out around me, I wish I had more money to spend there so I could sample it all! Worth the wait? yes.  Worth the trek from where ever you happen to be? Yes.  Worth the cash only policy? yes.  I can't stress how much this place is worth it for breakfast!
