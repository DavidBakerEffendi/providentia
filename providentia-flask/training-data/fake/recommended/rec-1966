Nestled in brownstone on park slope block between 2 residential building this semi secret restaurant boasts a wonderful $25 prix fixe menu. Palo Santo is a cool a restaurant, from a stylistic steel cut sign above the front door to the exposed kitchen as you step in to the renovated brownstone. In the back you will find a south American tropical experience. The food is always amazing, especially if you are a meat eater. I love the chicken liver app and steak for dinner! There chimichurri is excellent as well. This is a great restaurant for date or friends, especially friends from out of town! I am sure the popularity of this place is truly based on great food, good atmosphere, and a unpretentious environment! Plus being sort of off the usual park slope beaten path helps.
