I was so surprised this place wasn't packed! My girlfriends and I came here Saturday for brunch. My one gf who lives in Philly recommended Gaslight and I will definitely be coming back on my next trip! The decor was neat and rustic but again kind of empty. Our server was very nice and attentive so we were never waiting long for anything. We started off with a round of mimosas and the daily cheese plate. We were also served complimentary sticky bread. I ordered the Waffamul which was ridiculously large but very tasty. One friend got the fried chicken biscuit and the other got the crab benny. Everyone's portions were large and we all cleaned our plates! The chipotle sauce on the breakfast potatoes was delicious.
