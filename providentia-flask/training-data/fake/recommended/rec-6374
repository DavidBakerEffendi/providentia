As stop number three for a lovely Brooklyn adventure, this was a lucky find. And thanks to yelpers for pointing me to it! Walking through Cobble hill and then crossing Atlantic, we stumble upon Bijan's after a nice twenty minute stroll through the hills.  This block of Hoyt Street is interesting.  Lots of commuters walking home from a long day of work, some bicyclists as there's a bike lane that runs this way too. We step into the space, and the first thing we both notice is all the wood.  There's a wood wreath behind the bar, and a large circular wooden wreath mounted on the ceiling.  Not a xmas type of wreath, but a huge pagan one that seems to be made out of driftwood.  An interesting vibe.  The space is sooo calming and chill.  A bunch of people are relaxing at the bar, and we find ourselves a table to relax at. I order a Bijan and my Brooklyn loving hipster from bside goes for the Persian Kiss.  Prosecco being a hit with her, I'm not surprised she loves it.  The cocktail in my hands has a leaf of mint in it, to remind me that it's a healthy concoction of vodka - we all know it's medicinal qualities, pineapple, immune building elderflower and ball-busting cayenne.  Amen to the healing properties.  A doctor friend of mine would approve I'm sure!
