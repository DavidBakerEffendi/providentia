So. Much. Fun! The bartender - Eli was a great dude. He was super friendly, smart. and a great talker - things that make a bartender great. I had a cider and my friend had a draft beer but I don't recall which - but she liked it. They have a really interested mixed drinks menu that I would love to try sometime. As a snack we got the warm bag of croutons - which is exactly as it sounds but they add spices to the bag and they are so good - who knew croutons could taste so good. The ambience was much more to my liking then the brewery from which we had just come from. It was early in the day so the place wasn't all that full but was beginning to fill up as we were leaving. I will be back!
