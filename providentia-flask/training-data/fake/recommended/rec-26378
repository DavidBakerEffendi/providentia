Been to Ippudo Westside twice in the last month and both times the experience was excellent! The servers were courteous and extremely helpful when it comes to answering questions regarding the menu. They also don't hover, which is wonderful. Order whichever ramen you want, and always always order an addition topping of Kakuni - so yum!
