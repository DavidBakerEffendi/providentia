Hmmm. Food 3.5/5 and Service 5/5. I was expecting a bit too much after the 80 minute wait. The servers run around yelling japanese phrases giving the place an authentic feel to the fusion atmosphere. The food was definitely good. We enjoyed the Pork Buns, Tako Wasabi, and Miso Ramen: try it with bamboo shoots! Complimentary green tea at the end of your meal to help you digest a little easier. We were a bit too full from appetisers and ramen to even try dessert.
