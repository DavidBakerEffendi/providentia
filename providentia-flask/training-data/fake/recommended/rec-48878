Even the 5-star reviews for this place acknowledge the long, cold waits outside, the horrific service, and the cheapskate owners that don't even offer free refills on drinks. Considering you'll be waiting AT LEAST an hour for pizza after ordering, that last policy is especially insulting. The pizza is great. Â But it's not uniquely great. There are many other places in town with equally good pizza that don't treat their customers like shit. The rave reviews of this place are all about "loyalty" and a willingness to forgive atrocious service in the name of some higher good. I don't forgive DELIBERATELY atrocious service, so I don't eat at Sally's. Take my advice and look elsewhere. If you must eat here, show up with a full stomach. Trust me, you'll be hungry by the time your food comes.
