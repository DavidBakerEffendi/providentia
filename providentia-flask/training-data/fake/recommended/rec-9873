Lovely, classy place with amazing service. A bit pricey but definitely worth it. I suggest going for lunch because you can sit in the front dining area where no reservations are needed. They do fill up rather quickly for lunch therefore I would suggest arriving closer to opening around noon. Try their sandwich specials.
