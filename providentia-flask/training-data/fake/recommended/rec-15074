I had a wonderful lunch experience there today! It was my first time eating at Pingala, or any Vegan restaurant, but I promised to eat healthier in new year, and this restaurant will help me keep that promise! The food was outstanding! I can't wait to visit again. I had the taco and the taquitos. Both were excellent! Wonderful, fresh, and tasty.
