I had a really mixed experience at the Red Owl Tavern. Some of the ladies from my office and I went there for happy hour and 2-for-1 appetizers. We tried the sausage, the hummus plate, the pickled vegetables, the BBQ fries, and ordered a side of onion rings. The hummus was tasty. The fries were pretty good, but the real star was the sauce that came with them (which we could have done with more of). The sausage was generally average, and served on toasted bread that had gotten super soggy and unappetizing. Definitely wouldn't order it again. The onion rings were okay, but not $7 price tag good. For dessert, we tried the pumpkin whoopee pies (delicious), the chocolate brown butter tart (also good), and a mocha-in-a-jar thing (which was good but really rich). The mocha was actually passed around the table and it took three of us to finish it, it was so heavy. We also ordered several drinks. The Red Barn was not great, but The Spaniard was good. We all had some Tequila which was excellent. I had them make me a chocolate martini, which was just not mixed well. It was super strong, and between the girls and I none of us could manage to finish it. That and it had no chocolate taste to speak of. The service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive, and provided solid food and beverage recommendations to us. Overall, considering what the bill was (even with the 2-for-1 apps), I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to go there again. Considering the price tag, I could have a much better meal (and drinks) at the Walnut Street Supper Club or Max Brenner. Glad I went once. I did have fun. But not good enough in the food and drink department to warrant the prices.
