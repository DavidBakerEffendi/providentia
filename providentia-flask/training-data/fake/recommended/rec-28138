One of my favorite place in WB. Good drink selection, small but very tasty menu (the truffle grilled cheese is the best) and casual/hip crowd. This place has a nice ambience for day drinking. They roll up the garage door-esque windows when the weather is nice. Because it faces west so you get good late day/sunset light. Need slightly faster service (for food and drink) but otherwise its a great BK spot!
