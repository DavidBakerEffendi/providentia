I live in Graduate Hospital and have been on the search for good Chinese take-out. I'm not even looking for excellent Chinese because I know that's rare. I read the reviews on this place and gave it a try. A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. Â For several reasons: Their phone manner is pleasant, professional and friendly Their food is very good, their crab Rangoon is just awesome Delivery is fast and friendly Previously we had asked friends in the area where they order Chinese takeout from and no one had found "their spot" yet. Well, spot found! We haven't explored their other regional options yet, but I would not hesitate. This place is a gem.
