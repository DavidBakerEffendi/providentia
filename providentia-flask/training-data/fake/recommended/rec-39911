Regarding brunch: Are the mind-bogglingly delicous cornmeal things under the poached eggs laced with plutonium? Is there raw sewerage in the chipotle hollandaise sauce? Or, god no, are the chorizo sausages made out of people? Gee, I hope not, but this place sure seems too good to be true. The Sunday brunch deal is $12 for a big breakfast, a bloody mary, and coffee. Good service and atmosphere too. But it was all too good to be true, so I'm expecting to die from delayed food poisinging. Goodbye?
