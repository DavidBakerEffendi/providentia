Upon arrival - I knew it was going to be kick-ass because of the decoration and friendly staff! The Ramen is bomb dot com! I loved it - I'm always one to order something peculiar, and that I did! We ordered the pork buns for an app and they are BANANAS! I cannot wait to scarf one of those down my tummy again! Overall - great ambiance, attentive service and sensational Japanese food - truly a wonderful dining experience.
