I have been craving haggis, tatties, and neeps ever since my inaugural dinner a few weeks ago! The Belhaven on tap was delightful. Friendly service. The setting was wonderfully warm and welcoming - very VT rustic, but decorated memorably with Scottish swords, quotes, maps, etc. Impressive holiday spirit. Tried the chicken and bacon nachos to start - heaping with cheese, and not just on the top!  Split an order of stew and haggis and taddies. LOVED IT! Took some home only to make the experience last longer reheated for brunch.  My fam has a cabin nearby and we try to keep up on local openings - been meaning to try MacLaomainn's for a while and so glad we did!  Will definitely return. But by all means try the Scottish food!
