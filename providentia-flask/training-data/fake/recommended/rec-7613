Great food: especially try the leek salad, escargot and the carrot salad. Service is efficient. There is an adequate number of staff so table service is fast. The garden in the back is great for spring/summer, but the layout makes it hard for reservations above 10 people. Sitting at the bar outside might be a good option. The prices are OK too considering the ambience and the taste. The inner seating area might be too narrow/small, but will have to come back in colder weather to verify that. Overall, decoration is interesting and tasteful. One thing, the entrance is too small for casual hangout or grabbing a drink pre-meal.
