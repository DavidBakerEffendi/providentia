The Greek Town Plate for 2 is a STEAL of a deal.  $17 (including tax) for a big Greek salad, what must be like 2-3 lbs. of delicious meat (I have only ever gotten the gyro meat), potato or rice, pita and tzatziki sauce.   I give this place 4 stars because sometimes, the salad isn't super fresh, and I'm not really a fan of the rice or potato options, but I recently asked if I could just have double salad instead of the rice/potato, and they have always accommodated me without charging extra, which is nice.  Service is quick when you call your order in to pick up, and the food is always delicious.  Sometimes I'll just take out the Greek Town Plate for myself and it's enough food for 3 meals!
