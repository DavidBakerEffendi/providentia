Greetings.. First off, I am an unapologetic carnivore (as well as a lover of fish based sushi). Each summer I spend waaay too much time with my BBQ grill or my smoker thinking up ways to make incredible tasting ribs / chicken / steak and such..  In fact, it is a borderline obsession.. So while as a meat-eater, I walked in here expecting the worst, as a foodie, I was willing to give the place a chance. But sushi without fish?? No way I thought.. It's going to taste like a health food experiment at best, or at worst, something truly foul.. Man, was I so very very wrong.. By the end of my meal, I was shocked BEYOND belief at how delicious everything was and if I wasn't so full, I would have tackled even more rolls. So I went for the sampler and a couple of assorted pieces. I would love to tell you everything I tried, but in reality, it doesn't matter. It is all delicious. With each bite my pessimistic foodie mind kept looking for flavors I didn't like, or textures that seemed weird, or didn't work.. It was almost as if I was sub-consciously looking for a reason to -not- enjoy it.   It never happened... Instead, each unique flavor lit up on my tongue and kind of just sat there before melding into something awesome with all the other stuff going on with the ingredients..  After I left, I was pleasantly surprised and confused at how they pulled it  off. Personally I think it is due to the freshness of the ingredients and the spot-on balance and pairing of flavors going on. You don't miss the fish.. I really mean that and it sounds ridiculous to hear me say (type?) it even now. But it is the absolute truth.. Even the presentation is ridiculously attractive. Anyway, I don't know what else to say other than to go here and just try something.. anything.. I suggest the Mighty Mushroom. It is awesome...  The watermelon lemonade rocks as well. Just avoid using the soy sauce.... it is most definitely not needed.. (even a little bit)
