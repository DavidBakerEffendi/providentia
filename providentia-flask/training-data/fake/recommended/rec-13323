Dropped in for dinner last night around 8:30 and I could not believe how crowded it was for a Monday night! Place was pumping! But we were seated right away in this great little mini enclosed table area just past the giant chandelier. Almost felt like a VIP table! Ordered the vegetable spring rolls, the chicken pad thai (which I love here!) and the pineapple fried rice w/chicken. All were delicious. Staff is friendly and our waitress was very attentive. Plus, the prices here are terrific - you just can't go wrong. Fun place to eat and would recommend it to anyone.
