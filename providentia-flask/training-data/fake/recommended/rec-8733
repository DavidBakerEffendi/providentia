Everytime I think of BBQ, I always think Phil's BBQ in San Diego, but Dinosaur BBQ is just as good. Not sure if they have baby back ribs or if I just missed it, but they're pulled pork, brisket, st. louis ribs, mac & cheese, and cole slaw (I had the Tres Ninos) are delicious. I went on a Saturday afternoon, maybe around 3pm, and there was no wait at all. Just thinking about it makes me want more BBQ...
