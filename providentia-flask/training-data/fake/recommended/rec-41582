My partner and I eagerly awaited the opening of this establishment and she and I were both extremely impressed with our experience. It is always a bold move to introduce a very niche style of establishment to this city, especially with a concept as ubiquitous as "pizza." Â I hope your plans for becoming Neapolitan certified succeed - this pizza is truly exceptional and well on its way to making this restaurant one of our favorite neighborhood spots.
