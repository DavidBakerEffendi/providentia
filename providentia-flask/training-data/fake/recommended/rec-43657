I don't want to be a signal-rater reviewer, but my last two meals in NYC have been memorable.  Little did I realize that my body was remembering Waxman's food from my years in CA, then following him to Jams...and now Barbuto.  Jonathan was actually in the restuarant when I got there on Wednesday.  And I had no idea why he was so familar.  After being seated, I asked the waiter who he was.  He refereneced his book, some tv, etc.  None of that really clicked.  I went on to enjoy the most fabulous Pollo Al Forno I have had.  My judge for that?  I have told everyone since I have eaten it, about it!  We started with the beet and faro salad and can still taste the combination of ingredients.  Outstanding. I was so interested in why Jonathan Waxman was familiar, I looked him up on Wikipedia.  Then I laughed.  He went to UNR, so did I..but it was his food history that I have been a part of for almost as long as he has been cooking. The only negative about the restaurant is not the food, service, or great bartender.  It is all the hard surfaces making it difficult to hear even though there were only two of us dining together.
