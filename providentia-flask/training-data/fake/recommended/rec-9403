First time at Pio Pio based on reviews here. I have to say that we were not disappointed. We ordered the Matador Combo and although we were only 3 people, this would have easily fed 4 people. The most amazing part of the meal was Juanita's chicken!!!  A-MAZING!!! The rice and beans, the avocado and tomato salad and tostones were great!  The fries and hot dog chunks were a strange accompaniment, but ok. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the loud music and, since they sat us near the door, it was quite cool and I actually had to wear my coat during the meal. I would strongly recommend going to Pio Pio. We will be back for sure.
