We apparently got there right before the lunch rush.. place went from half empty to packed in the 10 min just before noon. It's super charming, all Nice this and francais accent that. That said, the space is pretty tight, so I definitely had to put my butt in the next table's faces to squeeze into the booth. We got the crepe orientale and omellette spinach.. both quite delicious. It wasn't exactly filling though, and we weren't given the lunch menu so we didn't realize we could order apps. We had really wanted to try the pate, and I would have preferred a real lunch. Good thing the waffles & dinges truck was right down the street to supplement our meal!
