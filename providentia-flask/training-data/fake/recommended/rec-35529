Terrible service. We had reserved a table of ten for 8, ultimately did not sit down till 9. Then the ma√Ætre de kept coming over and clasping his hands together in a self shake, as if that made the wait ok. And, he bought us a bottle of 10 year old port as dessert, which was hardly an apology. Our waiter did not seem to speak a lick of English. We were convinced it was an act. Yet combined with the jet roar noise level, we could not hear a word he was saying. He knew it too and kept tapping me (the host) on the shoulder to get my attention. Don't touch the customer! Most seemed to enjoy their food. I had a scallop with short rib risotto app that was exceptional. The broiled lobster however, was run of the mill. It would have been nice to provide something to clean up with - a hot towel, a wet wipe, something other than rubbing my hands on the napkin.
