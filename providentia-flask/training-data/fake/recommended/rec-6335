So I finally had the time to stop by after teaching at nearby Washington Irving high school on my way back to my office by Bryant Park.  I had high hopes for this restaurant as I've heard good things about them. I had tapas at many places around the city including Tertulia, Alta, Pipa, Boqueria, Scuba and I'm sure I forgot names of a few others.   My MD and I ordered the roast pork dish, razor clams and squid ink rice.  The roast pork dish was ok.  It came with 3 tiny pieces of pork and what looked like 1 artichoke.  It was good but for $15+ dish, I expected a bit more.  We had the razor clams that were grilled with lemon.  I thought it was good, nothing to blow me away. The disappointment came with the squid ink rice with the scallops.  I really love squid ink and I had it in many variations.  It was SALTY!  I had about 2 bites of it and proceed to down 2 glasses of water.    I mentioned this to the manager and waitress and they said it may be salty due to the scallops being cooked with it.  That's crap.  I had seafood squid ink paella and squid ink pasta with scallops and clams before and it was nowhere near as salty.  After discussing this with both the waitress and manager, they proceed to charge us for $16 plate of salty rice that we didn't eat. I've been to many restaurants and have only return food when it wasn't really edible.  Management have usually been very accommodating and taken the plate off the bill.  Usually this makes the diners happy and likely to come back and try other dishes or to give it another chance.  Not at Casa Mono. Even after we brought up the issue that the dish was not really edible beside the 3 scallops that came with it! What could have been an average lunch turn out to be a negative experience.  It's not like you're eating at a diner so you don't expect service.  But at around $70 lunch, you would expect them to treat you better.
