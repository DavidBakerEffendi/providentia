Best burger in town!  There's not a lot of dining options in Montgomery Township but these folks grill a darn good burger.  Quality beef, juicy and perfectly seasoned. Nice charbroiled flavor.  And if you ask for rare or medium rare, that's how you get it. To the cheap clown whining about the coupon, you ALWAYS get the equal or lesser meal comp'd when you have a buy one, get one free coupon.  Seriously dude, you expected to pay for a 8.00 meal and get the 15.99 one free?  I guess the joke's on you!
