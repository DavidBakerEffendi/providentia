Visited here on a very nice Friday early evening where weather was perfect and coffee was good.  Didnt really notice the menu as the place is inassuming but a very nice place to hang out with someone.  The pond is nice with some fishes in it too. It is located inside of Third Ward Park and if you take a walk or run around and return to the boathouse to relax, it works quite well.
