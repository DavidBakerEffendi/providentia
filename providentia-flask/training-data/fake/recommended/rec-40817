Went for lunch on Monday February 24. The salad was bland and for $7, there wasn't much there, but the worst part is that when i got to the bottom of my bowl a pile of slimy rotten lettuce was congealed together.   I stopped eating, left the remaining 1/3 of the salad in the bowl, brought the bowl to the counter and told them.  I got a weak apology and that's it.  Not 30 seconds later, I saw a large bag of lettuce being smelled, poked and sifted through...and then it was put into the trash.
