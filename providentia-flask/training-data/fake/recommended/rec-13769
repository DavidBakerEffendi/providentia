The burger is always rated as one of the best in NYC and it has been a while since I ate here. Came on a Friday afternoon and the place was full of European tourists. Guess the inclusion into travel books makes Corner B a must eat at place for Euros but they should just read Yelp instead to find out the best burger places to eat at. Got the Bistro burger and it was $6.75 and the burger itself is much bigger than the bun. The bun was thin and fell apart while eating the burger but the cheese and bacon along with tomato, lettuce and onion make the flavor of the burger something you want to eat. I ordered it medium and it was more or less medium. The meat itself was good but didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. The fries ($2.50) were good and crunchy but lacked salt, which was easily fixed by me adding it. McSorley's ale for $2.75 a pint was a deal. Overall I remember that the burger used to be better or maybe my tastes have changed. Good burger but not the best in NYC. Cash only.
