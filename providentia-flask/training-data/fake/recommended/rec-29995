After years of driving past this place I finally stopped in for supper.  The service was the local high school and they did OK.  A little slow, but definitely not something to keep me from returning.  The meal was good.  The fries were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy, golden brown slight sprinkle of salt.  I had a chicken wrap and it was everything I expected.   The ice cream was high quality and the line of folks for take-out ice cream kept growing.         I'm taking away 2 stars for this cake I asked to go.   The red velvet was a huge slice, but it was gritty.  Ended up tossing it out.  Maybe the batter was completely mixed, or one ingredients were old or didn't dissolve correctly .   I was very disappointed with it.   The other problem is the portion differences between cake slices.   The red velvet was huge, at least twice as big as the coconut.  Sadly the coconut was very dense inside and it may have been undercooked. Overall a great place for diner type food - its fresh, and prepared nicely. The ice cream is great and next time  I'll stay clear of the cake.
