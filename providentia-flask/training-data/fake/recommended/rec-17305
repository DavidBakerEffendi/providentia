This ridiculous restaurant leaves a stack of menus in my building's lobby that say delivery but won't deliver!! I've made several attempts to place an order that meets more than their $15 minimum. The first time was a Friday and they flat out refused no delivery too busy and today a Wednesday night they tell us they are too busy because they are expecting a rush in an hour!!! Are you kidding me? Why were the menus placed in our lobby then? Get your act together ppl hire some drivers or don't offer delivery!!!
