Delicious food, generous portions, friendly service. Gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream waas memorable.   A good choice for theater goers - walking distance to the 'Avenue of the Arts'  venues (Academy of Music, Kimmel Center,  etc) and prices not as stratospheric as most of the restaurants on the Avenue of the Arts.
