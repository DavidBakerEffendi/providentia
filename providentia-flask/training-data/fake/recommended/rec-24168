Twas an impromptu pizza night a Thursday night ago. My husband and I drove by 10th and Fitzwater and noticed a pretty red pizza truck. We where both intrigued so we parked right behind the red beauty and got out to see what she had to offer our hungry taste buds. The aroma of their wood fired oven was tantalizing! Spicy garlic, margherita, eggplant, sausage, soppressata, and radicchio where our choices. We went with the margherita which consisted of tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella and basil. 3 simple ingredients but so much flavor! The crust was amazing! The wood fire oven definitely makes it unique. Our pizza was kind of small so if you are really hungry you can totally eat a whole one by yourself. They are pretty small and cut into 4 slices. Since we loved it so much we decided to try another one. (I know. How greedy of us! lol) This time we went with the sausage pizza and OMG! The sauce was a bechamel sauce (white sauce) with caramelized onions, roasted mushrooms, pecorino cheese and sausage! It was a hit! Go try one right now!!! All in all I really loved the service, the truck and of course, the amazing pizza!
