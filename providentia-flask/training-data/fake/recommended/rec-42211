The seafood special soup was fantastic.  Other than that, I was not overly impressed by anything else we ate.  The place is tiny and service is pretty good.  I'm guessing there's a shortage of sushi joints in the area....lack of comparison is the only reason I could muster giving this place a 4 star rating.
