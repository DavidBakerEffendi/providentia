Went for dinner Wednesday night, good as ever! I like that a lot of the sandwhiches are served with greens/ salad rather than even tempting you with fries. I had a really wonderful white wine with dinner as well. The music was just the right level that it wasn't too hard to talk over it as well. Â I know it's a great brunch place but going for dinner = no 2 hour wait!
