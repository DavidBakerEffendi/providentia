Went to Box 63 through a recommendation and really glad we did.  It was for a Saturday morning brunch (around 11:30) -- the food was outstanding.  The gringo burrito was really good and the service (Jamie) was extremely helpful.  We had to catch a train after we ate and Jamie called a cab company for us, and even stood outside to watch for the taxi while we finished paying, etc.  Extra level of great service that we aren't entirely used to. Definitely check this spot out for brunch. (For what it's worth, the pancakes looked amazing too.)
