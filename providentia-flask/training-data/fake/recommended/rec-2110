After viewing the Liberty Bell, Congress Hall, etc.----- Very good tasting  Philly cheese steak sandwich. I ordered mine with American cheese and sweet  grilled peppers, comes with grilled onions in the sandwich. $9. A bit on the thin side, but tasty. Short line, it just began to rain , and it was about 5pm. Tables outside only; we ate in the car. Will go to Pat's, across the street, next time.
