We were able to get a reservation last minute on a Friday night. The food is presented in a fun and approachable way and makes you want to go back for the rest of the menu. The bar has a great scene and is a great place to grab a drink and an appetizer. I am a total Food Network junkie and loved eating here. You walk in and feel like you are in someone's home with an open kitchen and easy flow. There is a reason Marc Forgione won the title of Iron Chef. The wine list is amazing and if you don't know where to start, just ask your server. Everything was amazing from the soup to the prime rib burger to the scallops. Â This is a place to go to over and over again.
