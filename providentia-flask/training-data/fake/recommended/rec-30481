Love the ambiance. Sat at the bar area because the place was so packed on a Friday night. It was great though because I got to see the whole tea-making process! Only came here for tea, but would love to try its food/dessert in the future. This place is SO Authentic. Had the Mocha Latte. It was delicious! Lovely color, wonderful taste. Would definitely come back again!!
