I used to consider Cafe Orlin the consolation prize if I wasn't patient enough to wait for a table at Cafe Mogador...but I am appreciating the nuances that Cafe Orlin has to offer that differentiate it from its sibling restaurant down the street: * better pita bread: they use thicker, doughy pita bread here that goes perfect with their baba gounoush and hummus dips. flickr.com/photos/efabil… * great breakfast specials: can't beat the diana's breakfast or the orlin breakfast special: 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes (well seasoned with thyme, oregano and parsley).  Served with fresh squeezed OJ and a cappuccino (note: they do not serve American coffee). * wonderful pumpkin pancakes: these are dense, heavier pancakes --  if you are a fluffy pancake lover a la Clinton Street Baking, these might  *not* be up your alley, but for variety -- these hit the spot. * open 24 hours on the weekends: if you have a jonesing for tea, cappuccino or chow at 3am on a Sunday -- skip the flouresent lights &  diner atmosphere at nearby Veselka and come here for candlight and  warm mood lighting. *crispier fries:  the last few times I've had fries at Mogador, they came out a bit flat and lacked the essential balance of crunch & crisp.  I've never encountered that problem at Cafe Orlin.  flickr.com/photos/efabil… * more space: with almost four dining areas (including outdoor seating), Cafe Orlin is almost never full to capacity except during weekend brunch. So in my book, it's no longer the ugly sister of Cafe Mogador -- Cafe Orlin is a worthy, stand alone choice from breakfast to late night noshing...
