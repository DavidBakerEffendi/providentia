I wanted to try this place since I didn't know any other hand pull noodle restaurants in the city. I got take out for lunch but when I came, I became a bit skeptical.. ALL the customers were tourists.. and you know what that means, haha. Still I ordered anyways with hopes crossed it won't be as bad as it looks. I got the hand pull noodles with lamb meat as a topping. I peeked into the kitchen to watch the chef doing what he does best. Making noodles from scratch. It was somewhat fascinating to see a huge pound of dough being pulled into thin strands and it didn't break either. Any who, on to the food the soup base was a bit salty for my taste (msg?!?) the noodles come with veggies as well. Overall this place isn't bad, but word has it that there's another hand pull noodle place near East Broadway and this one's got rankings and reviews from chefs.
