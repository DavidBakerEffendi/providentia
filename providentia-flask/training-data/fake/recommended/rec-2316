Had dinner here with the family. The sashimi was all very fresh, the kitchen entrees were above average for a predominately sushi restaurant, and the rolls were a bit on the small and not so tasty side. Overall nothing was terrible, but definitely over priced for the quality and portion, service was a bit slow and unattentive. If you are in old city and have a craving for sushi and have money burning through your wallet hit it up, otherwise keep moving.
