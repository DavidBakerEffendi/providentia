Best pizza in NJ. (so far). It can get a little crowded in there and they seem overwhelmed but the quality of the pizza easily makes up for it. Â The crust is perfect. Whenever I see people walking with a Papa Johns or Dominos box I want to slap it out of their hands. There is no reason to eat that garbage with so many great local pizza places.
