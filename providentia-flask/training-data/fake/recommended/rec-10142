I've literally have had everything on the menu. That should be indicative of how often I eat here and how tasty the food is. The place is adorable and the food is always good. My friends all can't wait to eat in my neighborhood so we can go here. The only problem is they don't take reservations and the wait is sometimes upward of 90 minutes.
