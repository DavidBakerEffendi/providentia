My experience at this allegedly fine dining restaurant was everything, but fine. My guests and I went to this establishment 1/24/2014 to enjoy an evening of food, drinks and laughter, little did we know we had a rude awakening. The ambience was relaxing and pleasant as of the majority of restaurants we dine at, but the service was HORRIBLE!!!! Our waiter Kevin was rude, unpleasant, & hardly ever came to check on us to see if we needed anything. Not only that, but one of my guest was eating a salad & I noticed her pull something out her mouth & examine it, so I was intrigued to know what it was & come to my dismay it appeared to be a staple of some sort. Of course we were hesitant to tell our lovely waiter because of his attitude, but we had no choice and he was a bit obnoxious about the situation. The manager came over and confirmed, yes in fact it was a staple and said that whatever packaging the lettuce comes in have staples that the cooks "try" and remove. He apologized and asked if he could replace the salad, but come on buddy let's be realistic who would want another salad after that!! After our meal which was not all that great either, they attempted to appease us with a slice of chocolate cake for us to share. All I could think of was Marie Antoinette "Let Them Eat Cake". After I told fellow colleagues of this atrocious experience they said either they have had bad experiences at this establishment or knew someone that has. I am not returning and will not recommend any of my friends, colleagues or even enemies to this establishment!!! I will definitely make it known to others about my experience.
