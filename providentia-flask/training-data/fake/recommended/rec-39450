I can't stress how delicious our dishes were when we came here for brunch. We were seated right away and the restaurant is very charming. I had the host cheese salad and I LOVED it. He had the shrimp curry crepe and our was really good. Or dishes were great and we finished every bit of food on our plates. Will definitely come back!
