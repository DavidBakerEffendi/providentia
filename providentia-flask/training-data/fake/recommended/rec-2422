When in South Philadelphia you must go for a cheese steak at Gino's, with onions and Whiz. Line was about 100 people deep and we waited for about 40 min. while looking at the hundreds of photos that tile the facade. Cheese steak was good, not great, fresh bread, decent cuts of beef, the Cheese Whiz sealed the deal. And, for the record, I shot some b-ball outside of Gino's. Cross this off the list.
