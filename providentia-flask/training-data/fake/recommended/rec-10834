What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. I'm very surprised by some of the negative reviews--they certainly don't represent our recent experience here. The fried shrimp basket and fish sandwich were particularly good and reasonably priced. The service was also good. We're looking forward to returning. Highly recommended.
