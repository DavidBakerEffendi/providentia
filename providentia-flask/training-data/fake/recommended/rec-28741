Hu Kitchen has made all of my restaurant dreams come true! I have long dreamed of a place where I could get an amazing selection of veggies, pastured/organic meats, grass-fed dairy products, coconut sugar as a sweetener option, incredible dark chocolate and gluten-free/grain-free baked goods, and a great shot of espresso...with coconut milk in it. And did I mention you can also grab a glass of wine there? In a hip, inviting environment?? I have died and gone to restaurant heaven! Thank you for existing, Hu kitchen. You are worth every penny and I feel blessed to have you in the 'hood.
