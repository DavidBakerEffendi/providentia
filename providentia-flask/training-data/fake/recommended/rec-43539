Recently, I had an opportunity to eat at La Cabane one late afternoon. I ordered a spicy tilapia, rice, beans and spinach. I kid you not. The meal was so deliciously plentiful I skipped dinner altogether because I was still savoring my earlier meal. If you pass up La Cabane you are passing up the chance to satisfy ever fiber in your soul.
