WORTH THE WAIT (at least once) I have dined here twice for lunch and both times the wait was over an hour; however don't be intimidated by that (especially if it's your first time).  Be patient, see if you can find a spot at the bar where you can order a small appetizer (hirata buns), a drink, and check out the ramen decorating the top of the bar. Once you are seated the service is pretty quick, and they get your food out quickly as well.  They have a wide variety of ramen, with different things you can add (such as an egg, extra meat, etc.). The food is a bit pricey but I recommend trying this place at least one time and decide for yourself if it's worth waiting a second time!
