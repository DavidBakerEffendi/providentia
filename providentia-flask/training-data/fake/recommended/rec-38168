I've been eating ay Geramino for years.  I always get the same thing, quinoa stuffed chili rellano.  It's excellent and plenty for a light meal.  I went 2 wks ago and a little more than half way through my meal I but down on a half inch long screw. The waitress was very apologetic.  She reassured me that they do not buy their chilis already stuffed, rather someone in the kitchen put it into my food.
