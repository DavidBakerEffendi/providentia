The Kale salad was delicious.  It reminded me of the episode of Modern Family where Mitchell says something like kale is still a garnish and not ready to anchor a meal yet.  Well, this is no longer true.  Cause that salad was delicious! I don't think this place is meant to cater to kids, but they do have a kids menu.  I have to say their menu was ok but the food was not.  We got green beans as the side and they came out dry and overcooked.  Too tough and not tasty at all.  We also got some chicken tenders which were also way too tough.  The ice cream was good though.   I got the fish stew special and the $1 oysters.  The fish stew was above average.  Not great, but not bad either.  The oysters were tasty.  The mussels appetizer was pretty good as well.  I wanted to sop up all the juice. It had a nice chill vibe.  I've heard the brunch is good and I'd like to try it sometime.  It seemed more like a brewpub type of atmosphere altho the menu seemed more like a restaurant atmosphere.
