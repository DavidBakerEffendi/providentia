My constant favorites are the Lychee Mojitos and Fried Calamari.  The decor looks like a Forever 21 store.  I went there for dinner a few times and noticed that the entire restaurant was filled with women.  Then I went there for lunch, and it was filled entirely with men.  So weird.  Either way it's really good Thai food for a great price.  The giant chandelier decor is free.
