OMG!!!!!!!!!!! Are you for real? This place is so OVERRATED. If you think this place has the best chicken and rice then you probably: A. Too drunk, you stand in line for such a long time that when you finally hold the chicken and rice plate in your hand, you are more excited than a chimpanzee holding a banana. B. Thinking that long line = good food. NO, so OVERRATED C. Have never tried any other Halal carts in NYC or tried other Halal carts and they failed your expectations. D. You have taste buds of a sea lion which means something has seriously gone wrong with your taste buds. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars because I used to go here a lot and of course I took everyone who was from out of town here too. The chicken and rice here is just BAD, it's so so DRY. The only way to overcome the dryness of the chicken is to put in a lot of white sauce. The lamb and rice is much better than the chicken and rice. I still go here for the lamb and rice just because I know for sure that this place is always opened at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning. Ok, now you may ask: if this place is so bad, where is the place that has good/better/best chicken and rice? My friends and I have tried many Halal carts and we all agreed that the one place that has better/best chicken and rice is located in UNION SQUARE - 14th Street. This Halal cart is right next to Forever21, DSW, Strawberry, opposite with Bank of America. The chicken and rice costs $5, and they give you so much chicken, juicy, moist, big pieces of chicken. Chicken gyro is super delicious too. So there you go, please do yourself a big favor and go to that Halal cart to check out the better/best chicken and rice. The only problem is that this place might not be opened late at night. We often go to this place during the day. Last time we came here at 11pm but I'm nor really sure about after that.
