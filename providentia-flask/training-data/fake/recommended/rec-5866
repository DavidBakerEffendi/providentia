Ciao La Viola, I have to say that you know your Italian cuisine. Yes, your service is a bit contrived and although I don't really mind, I think it will be for the best if you knew. And yes, you most certainly have delicious food. We went with a group of 5 and most of the party ordered pasta related dishes but I went for the steak. Everything about your steak was perfect except for the truffle oil that went on top. I despise Â truffle oil and was upset how you never mentioned it on the menu. As for the small bites of pasta, I did get to taste, you have outdone yourself. So, bravo, four bright stars for you. Hopefully, I can come see you again, that is, when I have some cash to spare.
