Some of the best Mexican we have had on the east coast.  The salsas were excellent.  Pico de gallo and the thick salsa verde with avocado mixed in.  I wish they had the deep red chili based salsa. They had lots of authentic items on the menu, like nopales, carnitas, moles, ceviche, cocktail de mariscos, fish tacos, etc.  I tried something I had never heard of before (so I am not sure whether it is authentic) enchiladas camarones, and it was soooooo good!  My Mexican husband had a pork adobo, which he said tasted just the way it is supposed to.  He claims it was often on the menu in CA, but was never executed properly, so they get lots of credit from him for doing this dish properly.  I have a feeling this place will now become a staple to my diet, since my husband liked it so much and it is just around the corner. The waitress was very attentive and pleasant. We didn't try the drinks but they had a really good selection of tequilas, margaritas, beers and latin american wines. Update:  Hmmm, I wish I could give them yet another star.  Tonight they had a chili based salsa.  They seem to have different salsas every time, indicating that they make them fresh.  They also had aguas frescas tonight, including tamarindo! Update again: The carnitas here are very good!  the tostadas de tinga are great  and the chicken dish that says it is made the way mother makes it is terrific.  Rumor has it that their mole is shipped by the owners mother from Mexico. On crowded nights their staff seems a bit overwhelmed, but try it on a less crowded night and you will love it! Not sure I am a fan of their fish tacos, but everything else on the menu makes up for it.
