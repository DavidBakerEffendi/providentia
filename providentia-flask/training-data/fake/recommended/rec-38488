Decided to stop in here after remembering some falafel sample sent from god a couple weeks ago, no regrets at all this place is fantastic I'm surprised they weren't more crowded. I got possibly the biggest sandwich in the world "falafel laffa". I am a human being with immense appetite and I couldn't finish it. Service was nice and helpful though it's hard to hear over the glass, and while the falafel took a bit to cook it came out beautifully. Possibly the best value of anywhere in New York, whole thing was under $8 with the toppings works. Also toppings, two kinds of rice, two kinds of EGGPLANT, roasted veggies, cous cous, what a selection! As a vegan I'm always deciding between like two relevant things but this sure was a treat. Will return.
