if it weren't for the DENTAL FLOSS in my calamari dish, then perhaps i would have given bufad more stars.  that's right!  floss found in my first bite, in my mouth, a 10-12" piece of floss.  incredibly disgusting.  WTFFF  how i didn't notice it on my fork is beyond me... i should have left immediately, but my girlfriend and i were incredibly hungry so we ate the pizza anyways - only ok and overpriced - especially compared to some of the other new, delicious pizza places in the city. also if it weren't for the fact that we were barely apologized to and were still obliged to pay for the rest of our meal (only a single pizza for $14, mind you) OH YEAH and they forgot to take the calamari off the bill as well so we had to remind them to do so... then perhaps they would have gotten more stars.  this could have been salvaged if the manager came out to apologize, maybe give us the pizza for free or really did anything... but nope, none of that happened. did i mention that there was DENTAL FLOSS IN MY FOOD? never going back and telling others not to go.  sorry bufad.
