Great pizza. I had the "Anise and Anephew" pie and the "Hellboy", both are not to be missed. Each pie seems to be the right portion for one male adult.  As we had three guys, the owner, recommended a pizza from their secret (not listed on the menu) pie selection. Be sure to ask about these pies. There might be one that you can't resist.  There is a bewildering variety of pies, and it will probably take me many visits to work out my favorites.  Be forewarned, the waits can me long, but they are worth it. But we got there before 6pm on a Saturday and where seated in minutes. So if you are anti-waiting, get there early.  As noted in other reviews, the owner roams around talking to customers and he is very friendly. They also have a nice beer selection.
