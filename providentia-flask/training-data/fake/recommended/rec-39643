OK, once again my friends and I rolled to Yuca bar this past saturday and it was a blast. I had the platano wich has become my favorite and lots of coconut mojitos. I went with 3 friends and we all had a good time. For a saturday night I thought I wasnt be able to get a table but the host who end up been the manager was great and was able to accomodate us in 15 min. The place was loud and fun as usual, didnt feel the same slow service I got last time, hope they are taken this reviews seriously. GREAT again, so 4 starts for you guys.
