This place really is a hidden gem. It's AUTHENTIC Korean food at inexpensive prices. I like how it's hidden though, not too many people know about it and that makes me happy. They have a HUGE menu, and they will take the time to explain every bit of it to you, which is really nice. Everything is prepared fresh and in the authentic Korean way. They even bring the dishes out to you in the hotpot steaming and still cooking. I order the #8 which I believe was a hot cooked Be-Bim-Bop, hope I'm spelling that right. My girlfriend got the Kimchi and rice dish. Both were amazing. Every dish comes with an extra side of Kimchi and soup, both of which are so tasty. The hotpots are HUGE. Rice on the bottom (which gets nice and crispy towards the end), whatever meat you order, tofu, egg, oh my god, just incredible. They also have this spicy sauce to mix in with the pot which kicks everything up another notch. They provide some cool authentic asian snacks and drinks for you to choose from if you want, but we just stuck with water. We were both really full after our dishes too, and they were only like $16 or so together. Not bad at all. The place is really big inside too. They have two separate dining rooms, both with pretty comfy chairs and a decent setup. The main one is kind of squeezed together but it's doable. Will definitly be going back, on more than one occasion.
