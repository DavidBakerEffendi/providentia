I went here with my wife on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The place was packed at a late-lunch hour, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  The server was friendly and helpful, suggesting vegetarian options for me from a more meat-heavy menu.  The stuffed poblano pepper brunch entree was excellent, and the habanero and grapefruit infused margarita was far hotter than I expected (hot enough to make me cough, but still totally amazing).  I can't say that I wasn't warned, the server gave me a heads up, but I ordered it anyway.  The guacamole was great, and I loved the multiple salsas brought to the table.  Even the guys at the table next to us seemed like good meal-neighbors (not that it says very much about the restaurant specifically, but if a place has good people, I tend to see it as a good sign).
