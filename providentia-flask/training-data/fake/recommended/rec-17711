I am not a fan of hamburgers.  My husband, who is from San Diego, CA loves them.  Thank God for Imo Burgers!!  The hamburgers and fries we ordered were delicious,  even after delivery from Hillside all the way to Ironbound Newark.  I made a mistake and ordered online.  After noting another reviewer recommending not to place online orders, I assumed this glitch would have been fixed already.  After about an hour of waiting, I called and the apologetic gentlemen stated they had just found the order and were now preparing it.  Within 15 minutes the food was at our door.  The delivery driver did forget our milkshakes.  But, no worries, we are looking forward to ordering again and trying everything on the menu.  Super-delicious food all around, made up for the online ordering mishap.  Worth a try!!
