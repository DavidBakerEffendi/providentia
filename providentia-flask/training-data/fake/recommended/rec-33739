Pat's: I refuse to eat anywhere where I am going to be treated like a redheaded stepchile because I can't speak their stupid lingo-I don't work there, I am not a waitress, so why do I have to be trained to comply and submit to this? Stupid. (This is not to say anything against waitresses anywhere.) Geno's: To post a sign requiring English would make me boycott Â anyplace. Yeah, this IS America-the only way you are not an immigrant YOURSELF is if you are American Indian. I'll try Jim's next time I'm in town, always heard good things.
