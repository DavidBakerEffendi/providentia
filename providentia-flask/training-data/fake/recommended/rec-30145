A tourist, I made early dinner reservations upon a local chum's urging. My parents and I continue to discuss how much we loved our meals. Food: The bread is tasty, abundant, and free (!). Pumpkin gnocchi was a nice starter - just enough for three of us to have a taste. I devoured the bombolotti pasta dish. Mom adored the Amish chicken, and Dad - not the most open eater - was very happy with the meatloaf. Drink: The apple margarita is divine!!! Mom didn't care for her glass of wine, and the waiter kindly worked with her to identify another. Nice beer selection, as well. Service: Very pleasant and attentive. Ambience: We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely fall evening. Some street noise, of course, but it wasn't disruptive. The interior features lovely harvest decor. Price: Cookshop struck me as a reasonable value. An indulgent evening for us, but worth it.
