Went here with my colleague after a seminar for lunch. Honey chipotle wings were decent, good not great. My colleague enjoyed his firehouse burger, said it was spicy and juicy My steak and cheese was a nightmare, veggies were overcooked and pasty, and the oil and cheese mixture inside had a foul smegma consistency. Also, their were mushrooms, after I asked 2 times very nicely to not have them inside the sandwich. Cranberry juice had a soapy aftertaste, wundergun lines probably need cleaning, I had experienced dirty lines here before during a previous lunch when I had consumed some Sam Adams. The worst thing was the flies...over a dozen flies were swarming us in the corner of the bar near the doors to El Gato, Coming out of the heat vent, It made me want to puke. Only positive was the waitress. Friendly, attentive and cute. I didn't have the heart to tell her the food was an abomination. Buyer beware.
