the hostess is very nice! the service staff is good! and the food is delicious - loaded potatoes were so flavorful! the only con is the music way too LOUD! i was shouting to be heard and by the end of dinner, my voice was so hoarse. I will definitely return but for breakfast because I am hoping that the music will be background noise.
