The Halal Cart makes for an awkward morning: a spectacular evening with the best of companies, a Herculean wait in a line that snakes around the world followed by the most satisfying food ever created by man. And in the morning, an undeniable sense of regret but no real effort to change anything the next time around. Words of advice: be aggressive with the white sauce: Hell is a plateful of chicken and rice and not enough white sauce; go easy on the red sauce: Hell is also an overwhelming amount of red sauce, especially in the morning; making friends with the people on line makes the wait so much easier; and don't be the douche that tries to buy his way to the front of the line.
