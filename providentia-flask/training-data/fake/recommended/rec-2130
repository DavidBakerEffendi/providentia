This was my fourth time visiting the venerable and brightly lit Geno's in South Philly. For those visiting Philadelphia, having the ubiquitous cheese-steak is a mandatory experience. Such was the case with the group I was with last night. The people in my group weren't really a cheese-steak type of crowd, I on the other hand, love them and have at least one anytime I am in Philly. Many people have their favorite places and favorite sandwich styles. I like mine the traditional way, a "wiz wit". It's simple and works for me. I like Geno's alot. The food is great. The prices are reasonable. It's flashy and fun with its sparkly neon lights. It's main rival, Pat's is located against the street. Pat's decor is simple and doesn't call attention to the building. Some people prefer Pat's, some like Geno's. I like Geno's a little more, mostly because of the shiny lights. But both have great cheese-steaks. No doubt on that. Another personal favorite in town is Jim's Steak's on South Street. I like Jim's because it has indoor seating and is close to the action and excitement that is on South Street. So truthfully, I don't have a personal favorite. I like each place for different reasons. As for Geno's, I am definitely a fan.
