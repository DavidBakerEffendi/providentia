Aside from the fact that an episode of "How I Met Your Mother" (quite possibly one of my favorite shows of all time)  mentioned this place, I had heard from a few friends that this is the best burger in town. Oh, and they have beer for $2.75. So it seems like a win, win. I have been a few times. The wait staff have a no nonsense approach.  Enter, stand, wait for a table, don't get in the way, and drink a beer.  Once you check in with the host, they will seat you and your group as quickly as possible. Ordering is fast, service is super efficient, and yes, the burgers are really that good. You should go.
