I've never been disappointed!!!  I normally order pork or chicken tacos, but today I got a Mayan Pork Torta.  The bread was light - even after being heated on the grill!  My pork was perfectly seasoned and I loved the jalapeno on the sandwich.  Make sure you get it with everything (jalapeno, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, crema and a slice of ham).  When I really want to treat myself I'll get the picaditas (little boats of masa filled with your choice of meat - I get cravings for them because they are so different than anything else I've had.  I can also stop in to buy corn tortillas, chorizo or crema when I feel like cooking at home!!  It can be a little challenging to communicate if the owner isn't there, but my High School spanish is finally paying off!  If you are a true Mexican food lover you will appreciate La Costenita.
