I've been here three times and just don't get what the big deal is about this place. The good: - The food, if you enjoy beer-battered fried pickles or the like. - The drink selection is top notch for a neighborhood bar in the city. - For most of Fishtown it's walkable. ^^ Those facts represent the three stars above. Detractors: - If you go at a peak hour, expect to wait for at least a 20-30 minutes before getting a seat. Even for a party as small as two. - The service, in my experience, was really slow. - It's very loud, thanks to tiny spaces and crowded tables. - If you're in the front on a cold night; dress warm. That door is open more often than not. Maybe the Memphis Taproom was better before the rest of the city, Diner's Drive In's and Dives and I found out about it. Maybe if I was one of those people that knew what was cool before it was cool I'd have a different opinion. But the cat is long out of the bag... when with local friends discussing where to go out for an evening, we'd prefer to drive somewhere rather than wait an hour for a table in a crowded, noisy dining room and lukewarm service.
