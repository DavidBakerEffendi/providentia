This place was amazing.  The menu was so creative and they really had something for everyone.  I saw the Diner's Drive In's and Dives episode and I was dying to try the smoked coconut.  The Smoked Coconut Club was amazing.  I didn't miss the bacon at all.  The Chicken Fried Cauliflower with Cauliflower tart tar with lemon hot sauce will blow your mind.  My friends loved the deep fried pickles.   This place is a great place to check out.  Nice beer selection and great atmosphere.
