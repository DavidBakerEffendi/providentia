Fogo de Chao is the McDonald's of the Churrascaria craze going on across the US these days. They prove that at a certain point a chain, no matter how good or how pricey, is not nimble enough to compete with independent dining establishments. I have dined at easily two dozen different Brazilian places and firmly put Fogo as the most uninspiring of them all. Their service and quality is consistent across establishments. The meal you have in Philadelphia is the same as you have in Houston. There is little that really sets the Fogo chain apart from the crowd of independent competitors. The only place Fogo can really compete is in the service and the Philadelphia location does have some of the best ambiance I've encountered in a Churrascaria. The salad bar is small, and boring. Nelore Churrascaria in Houston crams twice as many options into the same amount of space. Amazon Brazillian Grill in Seattle blows both of them away in quantity and quality. They couldn't make a Strawberry Caipirinha, which is my standard go to drink at every Churrascaria I've ever been too. The meats floating around on the Rodizio were not as numerous in choices as many other locations, and pretty much uninspiring in flavor. Usually I find two or three cuts that I love and ask for repeatedly. At Fogo I had no problem flipping the card over to keep my stomach from bursting due to over eating. In addition the overall lower quality of meats was readily apparent, either that or their preparation processes need to be finely tuned. Perhaps Fogo de Chao holds it's own against other dining establishments in Philadelphia, but on the National stage, compared against similar Churrascarias, Â it's failures are readily apparent.
