The Harefield Road brunch model: serve simple entrees and force a combined bottomless coffee with a single cocktail and charge $14. I guess that's fine, but I usually just do coffee with brunch, so since the food was just good, nothing special, so I'm not going to run back. I don't know that I need coffee AND a drink? I guess that's sacrilegious brunch talk. The inside is real cute, service quite friendly, but I make my own shakshuka and I know it costs about two dollars to make and eggs with cheese on a bun (granted "brioche") with mayo is also a budget no-brainer on the restaurant end. I'm not getting anything I couldn't do at home, made with ingredients that aren't anything special. However I did get practically a whole clamshell of greens, so salad-eaters rejoice!
