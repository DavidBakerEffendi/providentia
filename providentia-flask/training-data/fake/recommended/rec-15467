A hole in the wall place with solid bahn mi's. I had the hog and the pork was grilled to perfection. I would have preferred the pickles vegs to be more pickled. It would be such a nice contrast with the grilled meat. This is a good place to go but if there's a num pang near by I would suggest to go num pang instead.
