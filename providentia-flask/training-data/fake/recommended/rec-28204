If you like strollers, 5 year olds, and bad parenting, this beer hall is for you. Went at 3pm on a Saturday. I think there was a week old baby being carried around in a papoose. A toddler was running around stealing all the Jenga games. The noise level was too loud to talk over, and I bet that's what all the kids were crying about. Drinks are great, though. Try a week night.
