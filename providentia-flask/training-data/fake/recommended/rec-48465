One of THE Worst restaurants I've ever been in.  I ordered a turkey burger and fries and a bowl of  gaspatcho ..the soup was awful.   It was carrot and ginger and it was horrible but not as horrible as my entree.  I thought My turkey burger was actually a beef hamburger so I sent it back. It was greasy and mealy and disgusting.  The waitress came back and told me it was a turkey burger.  If that was a turkey burger it was fatty (who ever heard of fatty turkey?) and slimy and downright disgusting.   My next try was chicken parmigiana that supposed to be a plate of chicken and parmigiana cheese.  I got an overlooked sandwich with the chicken cut in bite sized pieces and  very little sauce or cheese.  I sent it back and asked to see the manager.  She told me I ordered a sandwich which I had not.  The waitress was asked and she agreed with me (I hope she didn't get in trouble) and told the manager I wanted the platter.  Then the manager should have said she was sorry but she kept going with her now ridiculous story.  It was horrible and to make it worse it was a business luncheon and I suggested this restaurant.  I ended up eating part of my host's lunch because I was starving but I couldn't face ordering anything else from this menu. DON'T EVEN TRY THIS PLACE.  I've never written a bad review before but the food was God awful and the management was worse!   I wish I could give it no stars or a negative stars rating.
