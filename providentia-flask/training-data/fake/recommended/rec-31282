I love when the hype surrounding a food is worth it! Finally tried The halal guys and was not disappointed. My friend was visiting new york and this was one of the spots we had to go to before his trip was over. We went at 11:30 on a Monday. There were still 4 carts on the corner and a line a every one of them. But they were quick and gave us plenty of sauce. Lordddd is that red sauce intense! Whew. Ended up mixing a couple drips of red sauce into the white to give the white a lil kick. Got the chicken and gyro. I personally liked the gyro better.
