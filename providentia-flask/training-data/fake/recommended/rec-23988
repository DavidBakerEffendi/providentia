I'm not sure why I keep going back here. I started going when I moved to South Philly about 2 years ago. It used to be a decent place to go but it's been going downhill everytime. So why do I keep going back? I wish I knew. I guess it must be the rude staff, the vegan beef that always tastes like vegan sloppy joes, or the fact that they can't ever seem to put the guacamole I order on the side like I always ask. Instead, it gets lumped all together in the burrito at the bottom. That must be why I keep going back. Most people will complain about the hipster swarm that seems to be drawn to faux-authentic restaurants like these. At least most of the portions are large.
