The best part of the calamari was the crisp part around it. It was chewy and not so appetizing to eat. Eggplant was the winner of this meal. But considering we had sea bass, calamari & 4 different mezes, only one appetizer being good is not a good sign. Service was meh nothing special! Many better Greek food places are available in this wonderful city.
