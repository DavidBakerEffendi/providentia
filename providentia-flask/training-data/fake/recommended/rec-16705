My meal was pretty much perfect. Service were great, drinks were delicious and strong (I had the fig side car), and the food was delicious. I had the soup of the day (something seafoody) and the heirloom tomato salad. My friend had the short rib burger and my boyfriend had the grilled steak and everything was great. Eat in the backyard if the weather is nice.
