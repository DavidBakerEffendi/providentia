When I hear the words "Greek food",  my taste buds do a dance.  Sadly, they were not dancing last night at Think Grill.  We eat regularly at Pithari and Taverna Ouzo and are serious lovers of real Greek food. I was hoping for the best but they did not meet our standards. My husband wanted to order one of their delectable sounding sandwiches until he learned that fries are on the sandwich. He didn't  want  fries and asked to have the sandwich without them.  The answer was no.  NO?  I was afraid to ask why. Were the sandwiches made hours ago? At any rate, he ordered  white meat chicken on a skewer accompanied by the special string beans.   The chicken was fine but the string beans were not seasoned quite right and we were expecting Athenian String Beans,as they serve them at Ya Ya's Kitchen. I had pastitsio with lemon potatoes on the side. The pastitsio needed much more cinnamon, and the lemon potatoes were lacking in lemon! Perhaps this restaurant is an attempt to cater to folks who want something interesting to eat but are not familiar with Greek food.  It's somewhat of  an introduction to the cuisine, but it doesn't make it. I wonder if we will  return....
