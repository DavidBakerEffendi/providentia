We were in New York during restaurant week, and thought they had one of the more interesting menus. Between the two of us, we shared the deep fried cauliflower, fattoush salad, moussaka, and kibbe as appetizers... and lamb chops and bass as entrees. All outstanding dishes. The sauce on the moussaka was our favorite! The bass came in an amazing warm and savory broth with a hint of spiciness. The lamb chops had a good sear--it was flavorful and juicy, but it isn't as 'lamby' as others we've had. Some might like that mildness, depending preference. Â The one negative was that the plate for the lamb shank was too small and made it rather awkward to eat... the sprouts kept falling off the plate. Anyways, we paid around $100 for two of us. That's way expensive for our usual Mediterranean food, but it was a great dining experience and worth it!
