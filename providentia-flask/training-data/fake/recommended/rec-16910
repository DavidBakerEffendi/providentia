I have been there twice. Once it was a breakfast on Saturday morning when the waitress didn't know the menu at all. That time the portions seemed tiny and the food was not good at all ( I don't even remember what I had). A month ago we went with the family for creeps and everybody got the different one. All 6 people liked their food and gelato. Definitely will give them another chance.
