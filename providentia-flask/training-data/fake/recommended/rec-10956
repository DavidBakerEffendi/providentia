A summer squall, an hour wait, self-service water and underwhelming Key Lime Tart did nothing to spoil a delicious evening on the deck at Brooklyn Crab. We four cosmopolitan diners of variegated age enjoyed a first course of crisp iceberg wedge salad with blue cheese dressing, comfortingly creamy clam chowder and ample shrimp cocktail. We took the plunge and did the Crab Royale experience - lobster, snow and king crab legs, Jonah and blue crabs, all dissected at our leisure. We recommend adding side orders of red potatoes with lemon parsley butter in which to dip all your sweet crab meat. Even the corn was sweet! But truly, as fine as the food offerings were the deep pleasure of Brooklyn Crab for us was the elemental atmosphere - sun, wind, clouds, blue sky, rainbows, sunset and the feeling that we were on holiday, yet so close to big bad Gotham. Our server, Kevin, (jersey number 33 1/3) however, was amazing. He was attentive, engaging, polite, knowledgeable, gracious and full of energy and fun. If you go, be sure to ask for him. We certainly will. If they only offered coffee we would give them a fifth star.
