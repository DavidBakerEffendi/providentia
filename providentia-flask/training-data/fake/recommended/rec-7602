Great tasting food. It busy every day 11am-11pm Especially Friday thru Sunday night. My favourites is with chicken and rice as well as sesame seed chicken with shrimp fried rice . Its very delicious! It's best to call ahead of time because the food is made when you order it so it's always fresh . Many other days you can get out in 5-10 minutes. Thursday night about 930 the best time to go because lets people are out. They have nice lunch specials as well!
