I love this place! Â The service, while a bit slow (they only have one cook), is otherwise excellent: the waitress is friendly, funny, and attentive. They make the best veggie burger I've ever had in my life! Their empanadas, particularly any that have homini or guava, are to die for. And they make a rose-flavored milkshake that is heavenly. I'm only taking a star off for the slow device and their desserts (the desserts are just alright). Otherwise, I love, love, love this place!
