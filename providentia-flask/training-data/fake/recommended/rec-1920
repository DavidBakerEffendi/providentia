THE WHITE SAUCE AND HOT SAUCE! thats all i gotta say. the hot sauce will burn your mouth and turn it numb if you put more than a few droplets.  no idea what the white sauce is but you need it! its like yogurt based deliciousness.  squirt white sauce all over my platter! haha.  its huge for only $6.  feel like its a steal.  no wonder there is always a line for this cart and no other.  wait at least 10 minutes each time and at max an hour.  always get the combo of lamb and chicken with rice and a little tiny salad to change the flavor up a little when getting tired of the meat and rice.  its probably the most generous portion out of all the carts too.  always super full after it, can barely even finish.  good for two people.  the pita bread is so soft too!  don't know what they do to it to make it so soft.  love it!   only problem and why its not a five star?.....it just can't be digested! it runs straight through me! like instant cleanser.  worth it though!
