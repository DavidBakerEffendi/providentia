Do I even have to give a star? I'm surprised this place is still open and in upper Montclair? I expected way more. Me and a friend of mine took our daughters here for their first hibachi experience. This place should be condemned! Only 2 cooks for the night. People were lined up waiting for tables and we had reservations. The garbage can at reception desk was over flowing. The bathrooms weren't fit for rat. Needless to say my poor 5 year old had to hold it in. Our cook had a cold, he kept wiping his nose on his sleeve (which you could see the dried up snot) ugh. dude! Take a sick day! Still disgusted that we didn't leave but we didn't want to make a scene. Should be shut down for sure. Don't go here!
