My go to breakfast spot in the east village. This is a must and usually last stop before guests leave the city. Forget the boozie brunch places downtown and treat yourself to the grey dog breakfast. You can't beat the amount of food or the atmosphere you get for your money. Sure there's always a line at peak breakfast hours but it moves quick and their bandana table process works great. Top notch and hasn't been beat in my book.
