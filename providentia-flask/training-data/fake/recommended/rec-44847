I cannot say enough good things about this lovely, cosy, romantic restaurant.  The restaurant was accommodating of our late request to slightly change the time of our reservation; when we got there, and our table wasn't ready, the hostess could not have been more apologetic about it, making room for us in the "perch" above the diners and making sure we were taken care of so we wound up not minding a bit.  The atmosphere is relaxing and romantic, with floor to ceiling windows looking out on a quiet, elegant West Village corner and the kitchen visible (at least from the perch) through high windows.  Most importantly, the food and the wine were incredible - we had the whole fish and the crispy chicken, both of which were perfectly prepared and a delight to eat.  It was truly a memorable meal - couldn't recommend it more highly.
