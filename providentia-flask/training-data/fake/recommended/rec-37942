I love this place. The salsa verde is excellent. It has a nice sour bite to it that goes really well with any of the food you get. The first time I went here I ordered the goat tacos with pretty much everything on them, and I've done the same every time I've been back. If you haven't tried goat with Mexican food you really need to. There is just something about the flavor that makes it taste so so so good with Mexican. I've had a few margaritas here, they're good, not great. But you know what is great? $4 for a Tecate and shot of Tequila and I'm pretty sure that's a standard not just for happy hour. They also have great taste in music. I was here last night and whoever put on the tunes I want to give two big high fives.
