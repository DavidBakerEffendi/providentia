Really loved this place! Was an unexpected gem during my visit. The owners were very helpful, if you have any questions about food in the city. The food is very fresh and quite flavorful. The roasted chicken was good enough it didn't even need the super tasty dipping sauce that came with it (so I ate some with, some without ha). Really great value. You can't beat the quality of the food for the price. Stop by and give them a try, you won't be disappointed!
