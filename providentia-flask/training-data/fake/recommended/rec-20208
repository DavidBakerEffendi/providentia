I figured it out!!! I've been here several times for both dinner and bunch and realized that I am somewhat addicted. The chicken and waffles are always perfect. They work well together and the sauce is delightful. The most amazing thing is that the chicken will still be crispy the next day. It is rare to find a place where even your leftovers are delicious. AS for brunch, the pecan pie french toast has the tendency to be a bit dense but the pecans provide a wonderful balance. However, the eggs huntington are a sight and taste to behold. Going way beyond the ordinary benedict, the flavor is rich but not overwhelming, filling due to the hearty biscuit used. As for their wait time, I have figured a small way around it. Add the names to the list, then simply hang around and jump in at the bar. The food is so good, it won't diminish the romance of the afternoon or evening Â one iota.
