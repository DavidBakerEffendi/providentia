I was a huge fan of Goat Town, so I didn't completely embrace the transformation into GG's. After finally visiting, however, I can say that GG's does not disappoint. The pizza is great - the small plates are even better. The price is right - drinks are well priced and wine is a steal for Manhattan. Definitely returning here - great wait staff and fun atmosphere. One negative - I miss Goat Town's bathrooms! But oh well.
