Great, authentic Indian food. The buffet is small, but usually has their most popular dishes and are tasty and satisfying at just $9/person. Their naan, chicken tikka masala, curries, tandoori chicken and rice are excellent. I usually leave happier and more satisfied here than the pricier and more well-known, Coromandel across the street.
