This might be my favorite Vetri spot. It's a close call between this and Amis. Yes, the eponymous Vetri is what made him a star, but to be honest, I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get (sorry). At Osteria, you can splash out and spend a lot on a big meal, or you can eat relatively cheaply by ordering something like pizza and a starter. Their vegetable antipasti is always a winner, and the Lombarda pizza is so, so good. And the polenta budino is just flat out ridiculous. Yum.
