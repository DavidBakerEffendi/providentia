This place serves standard thai fare, in a decent portion, with a decent price (esp for mid-town manhattan), in a GREAT atmosphere (mirrors and interesting light fixtures everywhere!). That is what bumps it up to a 4 star from a 3 star. Came here with a couple friends and got the pineapple fried rice, basil noodles, and pad thai. No complaints with any of the food, and we only spent about $13 each for dinner on a Friday night. :) tip: on weekends they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more.
