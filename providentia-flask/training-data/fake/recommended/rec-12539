Food was delicious, ambience was quaint and service was friendly and prompt. Pretty reasonable pricing. I brought my parents here for brunch. My mum had the Texas French toast, my dad had the steak and eggs and I had the eggs Benedict. Of the three dishes, I found the Texas French toast to be the most delicious. I highly recommend this place.
