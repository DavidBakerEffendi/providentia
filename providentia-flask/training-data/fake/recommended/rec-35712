While I'm partial to this place because I went here on my first date with my boyfriend, it's just okay.  They have a staggering selection of beers and if you don't know what to look for it makes it nearly impossible to order.  They have a great salad with sliced duck, but the last time I went I had the "special" which was squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese...my boyfriend and I both got it and were very excited and also very let down when we were served a plate of 3 cherry tomatoes, 5 leafy greens, 2 wilted flowers stuffed with a tablespoon of ricotta cheese....and 2 pieces of toast.  I am a small person and have a small appetite and I was literally starving afterwards.  The waitress had a hard time telling us if it was an entree or an appetizer when I asked, so if this actually was an entree that's absurd.  A salad from there is usually 5 times the size.  It was just very disappointing.  Plus there were flies all over the restaurant that day, probably because the doors were open, but still.  Doesn't make for an enjoyable dining experience.  We did have an amazing peach cobbler dessert...I was about to order my own when the waitress just assumed we only wanted one to share.  It was good, but I left feeling very unsatisfied.  I'll give it another chance, but one disappointing experience can sometimes ruin all the good experiences you've had somewhere!  I want to love this place so bad.  Oh well.
