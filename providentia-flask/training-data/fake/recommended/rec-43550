Kids are welcome-- we've dined with our daughter in her carseat and later in a high chair at the table. I highly recommend the lunchtime tasting menu as a way to sample the offerings of this delicious restaurant. You'll be treated to an eight-course lunch for $15, smaller portions and still quite filling. (They've started a wintertime dinner tasting menu for $23.) Best to call for a reservation, even if an hour in advance, as the kitchen cooks every order as it's placed. (Reviewer Bill C. should have paid attention to the server's explanation that food will arrive as it is ready; appetizers are not appetizers but "small dishes," which may not be the first out of the kitchen if they take longer to cook.) Spicy Three River is one of my favorite soups: creamy, savory, and perfect on a rainy or sunny day. Lo Mein Hong Kong Style and Ants Climbing A Tree are among my frequent noodle choices. Buddha Beef is tasty and will surprise you if you're expecting beef-- it's actually seitan. I first had the Sweet and Pungent Walnuts during a tasting menu and immediately became a fan-- it wouldn't have been one of my first choices on the menu, but what a treat. A favorite place to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and out-of-town visitors. Water Snob says: Thumbs down for marginal water; order a soda instead.
