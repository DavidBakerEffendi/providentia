One of my favorite neighborhood haunts. Fantastic rotating beer menu. Excellent, informed, attentive service every time I go. Tasty, well-prepared food. Try their head cheese, it's exquisite (when's the last time you saw head cheese on a menu?). And while I rarely get out to see shows, JB's upstairs is a great venue as well.
