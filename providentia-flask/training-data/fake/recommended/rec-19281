Pumpkin and champagne. How is that a cocktail??!!! Actually, it doesn't even matter because the fact is that it's real and amazing and all I will ever drink for the rest of my life.  SERIOUSLY, guys. This is legit.  I was pretty apprehensive about meeting up with some old friends here because A. the location tends to be douche central and B. it's relatively new and things take time to work themselves out.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised at the fact that both of my premonitions were wrong.  Zero douches and the service was pretty outstanding!  We also got a nice spot right up on the bar and were able to hold out for awhile.  Luckily, it wasn't too overly packed.  All of the specialty cocktails are pretty phenomenal, but obviously I had a favorite.  The crowd was decent--not too young or old and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  The place is actually pretty large--definitely two stories, maybe a third?  It was also not too loud that I couldn't carry on a decent conversation with the people I was with, so that's another plus. I'd be interested in coming back here during meal hours to see how that side holds up, but it is absolutely winning on the nightlife aspect!
