oh dear god this place is awesome with a total of 7 tables, the not quite too-close-for-comfort atmosphere of this exciting little restaurant is not unlike the attitude of the surrounding Bella Vista neighborhood. as the other reviews have pointed out, the carefully crafted menu usually consists of no more than say 7 entrees and a handful of appetizers prepared fresh each day.  Some constants include salmon and one sea bass or another.  But what's really amazing is the care and dedication put into the menu and each subsequent dish.   The chef - who you can see sweating over your entree over the bar that separates his work station from your table- does a great job of complimenting the natural flavors of the fish without over-seasoning or complicating it. My GF and I have been a handful of times, and never disappointed...as she eloquently stated, "every bite we had were like 'oohhh man this is good' and it lasted the entire meal." Def call for reservations...oh and it's a BYOB
