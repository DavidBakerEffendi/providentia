The vegan chik'n cheesesteak makes it a five-star place (but stay away from the french fries, they're soggy and gross) and the Vegan Treats desserts are literally icing on the cake (try the peanut butter bomb - so good!)  I like the chik'n cheesesteak in a wrap best but it's also good in the regular roll.  Since I go to Govinda's when I'm craving the chik'n cheesesteak, I haven't tried many of their other items, but friends dining with me have told me the Kofta Ball sub is really good.
