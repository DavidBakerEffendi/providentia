finally made it down to corner bistro after hearing about it a couple of years ago...we were down in the village and craving a burger and i remembered a co-worker told me how amazing the burgers are...i expected this place to be a posh lil joint in the west vill but it looks like a dive bar in the east village.  the burger was good - definitely worth the price and you cannot beat $2 beers.  anytime i am down in the west vill, i will def stop in and grab another bistro burger and beer.
