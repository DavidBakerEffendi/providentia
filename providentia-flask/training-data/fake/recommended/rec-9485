Wow! What a great place! Much better than I anticipated. Went for a friends birthday for brunch. Amazing selections. I ordered the shrimp and bacon with poached eggs and manchego cheese over grits. Best. Dish. Ever. And let's not forget the unlimited sangria! Overall amazing brunch. Even the brand new waiter we were assigned who was a bit slow and made a few mistakes couldn't cause me to rate them 4 stars instead of 5. Word of advise: if you're looking to go with a big group of people, reservations are a must and it's best to call it in at least a month in advance
