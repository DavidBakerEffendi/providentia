everytime i visit my bf in brooklyn i always ask him to take me here for lunch. we usually get the grilled pork spicy sandwich and either the taro bubble tea (although they were out of it last time) or the avocado shake. for about $4 a sandwich u cant beat it. the bread is always perfectly crispy on the outside n the pork/veggies are always fresh and delicious. service is quick and they also have several tables inside so you can sit and eat. i would definitely recommend this. Also, its cash only
