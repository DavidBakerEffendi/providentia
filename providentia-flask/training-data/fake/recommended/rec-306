I wanted to try Ilili for some time, so when my birthday came around I chose this as the restaurant to celebrate at with my parents and my brother.  For a Tuesday evening it was really busy.  The place is huge with a very trendy crowd, but I think other than that and having a name...this place doesn't have much else going for it. The dinner we had was mediocre at best.  I have had better hummus at numerous other restaurants at half the price.  I don't understand why everyone raves about the brussels sprouts, they taste like sprouts with some sauce, my mother makes better ones at home.  I had the tuna dish, it was good, not spectacular.  My mother ordered the marrow, also decent but nothing special. However, the fries are really good.  Whatever seasoning they use is delicious.  The candy bar is a great dessert for chocolate lovers. The one thing that annoyed me the most was when the waiter checked in with us and asked how our meal was going he literally said "are you having the most perfect dinner?"...HOW ARROGANT IS THAT?!  After we nodded I remember everyone looking at each other being all..."WTF, perfect dinner?  Who says that?!" I'm not trying to bash Ilili in any way, but if you want to feel all fancypants and eat at a Middle Eastern restaurant that has a popular name, here's your place.  If you want authentic food, I can name several other places you can go.
