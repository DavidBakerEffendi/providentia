We used to go when they just opened (fresh table) but hardly went back because of the crowd after it got really famous. We tried to go back few times but always saw a lot of people waiting outside. The host/owner was not friendly and refused to take the name from us or tell us how long is the wait. He said he would remember me and asked my name when it's time Â I highly doubt it since there were at least 10 ppl waiting. It is just not nice to treat customers like that, I don't feel respected at all. There are so many friendly and nice restaurants in the slope. I don't think it is worth it for this kind of attitude.
