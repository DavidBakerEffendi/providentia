First admission: I am a "Top Chef" whore - I love that show!!  I was meeting a good friend for dinner (who doesn't even have cable) who was game for anything.  Greeted with a smile, seated promptly, lovely server.  Wines well priced and delicious (had an Oregonian Pinot Noir).  Skipped apps and went to entrees.  I had hanger steak, my friend, the fluke special.  I ordered mine medium rare, it was definitely more on the rare side, but delicious.  Spinach and mushrooms were a nice, earthy accompaniment.  We had the dessert special, with chocolate and hazelnuts ad pomegranate - fantastic!   The staff was concerned that it took a while for our entrees, which it did, but we were busy yapping and didn't really notice.  If you are starving, order apps or you may wait.   Great decor - cool neighborhood and a fantastic dining experience  - bravo Harold, in the real world, you are "Top Chef"!!
