One of my favorites in all of NYC. It's truly a comfort spot--the food, service and the atmosphere. I have family in south Bensonhurst and it's tough to get around except for staying in the "neighborhood". I took my aunt here and we had such a great time. She loved getting out of her routine and seeing how much Brooklyn has changed. Pancakes and mimosas at BC is now our tradition whenever I come to visit. Not only is the food amazing but it's created awesome new memories.
