So apparently, the Black Label Burger is phenomenal according to various reviews, that said, I'm so disappointed not to have chosen this decadence off of the menu!!! REGARDLESS, I had a 5-star experience at Minetta Tavern, a composite of exuberant, classic New York City atmosphere, impeccable service, and cuisine crafted to perfection. I came here for the first time, entering a archetypal low-key NYC looking place from the outside, into a world of 20's speakeasy reminiscence, filled with people standing at the bar, shoulder to shoulder, and cannot deny that I loved the energy of it all! We had a reservation and did not have to wait too long, about 15 min., to be seated. Had a lovely, corky waitress with a raw personality, which made our experience all the more enjoyable. Remember ordering ravioli off the specials menu which was delicious. Nevertheless, the Black Label Burger still remains in my conscience, next visit!!! All in all, enjoyed every aspect of this place, especially the fact that it had a low level of senseless pretense and a high dose of NYC authenticity unlike most restaurants of this generation. Try it!!!!!
