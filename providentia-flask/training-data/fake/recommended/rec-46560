I'm glad to say I went here because of all the hype, but I believe that it's a little overblown.  The pizza was really good, but I don't think the wait is usually worth it.  The prices, though, were great.  Overall, if you see that there is no line, or just a short one, then go to Grimaldi's; otherwise go back another time.
