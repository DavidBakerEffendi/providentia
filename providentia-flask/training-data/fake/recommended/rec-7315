WOWzaaa. I have walked by this truck so many times and never tried it. I wish someone told me how tasty this place was earlier. The chicken and rice platter here is definitely different from the other carts in the area. I could taste the ethnic authenticity in each bite! The spices, the tender chicken, the chickpeas, yummmmmmy. Their chicken cous cous is also delicious. Definitely try this truck out. They've been featured on a bunch of tv shows too.
