I have eaten here twice and have the same opinion with both experiences.  We ended up here because the other restaurants were closed during the big snowstorm on 12/19/09.   The steamed veggie dumplings were good, but the sauce really didnt have any flavor. The garlic chicken was good, but needed a little more spice. The general tso's was really good. This is a good, clean chinese restaurant and I would go there again if nothing else was open.
