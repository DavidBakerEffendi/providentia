I'd like a burrito that originates from an authentic Mexican kitchen, not a over-staffed Bay Area hipster kitchen. While there was nothing wrong with the burrito, there was also nothing remarkable. I passed on the hot sauce, and was left with a very bland burrito. The salsa wasn't enough flavor, and they charge an extra buck (!!) for guac. Next time, heading over to Chipotle. I don't understand why people rave about this place - unless a hipster donning a scooper does it for you.
