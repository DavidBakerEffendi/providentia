I LOVE this place! It is a small cafe with an awesome staff. One of the owners used to own another favorite, Tipico, where they served traditional yerba mate, one of the only places in the area that I know that does this. I was stoked to see that he is a partner here. The food is great! I had the steak and eggs, WOW!
