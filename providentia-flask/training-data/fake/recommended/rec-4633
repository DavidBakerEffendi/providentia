It's true that the new Rudy's is missing the atmosphere the old joint created throughout the years (and that it's colorful matinee crowd), but the new Rudy's is excellent. It's slowly building up its new cred. Beer selection is very good and the waiters really know their stuff, so they can help you decide or simply get acquainted with it. Food menu is far better than it was at the old place. Fries are still there (although they charge now for their sauces -I don't remember it being that way before-). Bucket of mussels is huge and delicious. Wings, burgers and the roasted beet salad are always my top choices.
