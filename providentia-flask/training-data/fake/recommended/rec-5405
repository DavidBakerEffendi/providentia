The menu item ideas seem delicious and innovative, but execution is average. Lobster mac and cheese had weird, stale tasting lobster Philly cheesesteak spring rolls were good, but onion ring toppings need to be crispier French onion soup dumplings need a bit more flavor, but were pretty tasty Overall, the food should taste better for the price. Atmosphere is really cool and trendy-good for dates. Staff is attentive and nice.
