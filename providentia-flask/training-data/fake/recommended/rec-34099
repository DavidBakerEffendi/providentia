Best late night meal I've ever had. When I came here with my friend, I was too drunk to know what was going on. I gave money to someone, I got food in my hands, next thing I knew I was in heaven. I ate way more than I should have, but I was helpless. Their white sauce really is like liquid crack. Cheap and highly, highly effective.
