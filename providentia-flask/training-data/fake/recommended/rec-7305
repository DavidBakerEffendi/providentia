I went there with my bf. We got two small dishes. He ordered the sizzling sissig, and I ordered the pork belly. We also got chicharrones, and coconut rice. I love the coconut rice - I think that was my favorite dish of the whole experience lol! It was really flavorful, oh man I could eat that whole bowl of rice without other side dishes. I didn't dare to try the sissig in the first place because it was pork face and I, as self defined, am a "traditional meat eater". But it was actually very good. The texture was soft, and different from other parts of a pig I think. I like the pork belly a lot. The skin was very chewy and the sauce tasted really good. The only not very nice experience was the waiter. As we were ordering, he suggested us get one big dish and two small dishes. But we ordered only two small ones as we thought we weren't that hungry - and to be fair, two small dishes looked like a lot of food already. As we told him that if we wanted more after finishing we would order another one, he "friendly" responded, "Ok but I just want to remind you that all dishes are prepared family style, and it takes a lot of work for the kitchen to prepare dishes that way so I don't suggest you order separately if you were to order more." ...What???...That was weird.
