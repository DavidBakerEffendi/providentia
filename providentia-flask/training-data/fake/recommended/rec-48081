I've heard nothing but good things about this place so I don't know if this was just an off night for them or what. I went with a friend and we split the cheese plate which was excellent. My friend ordered the roasted pork and I ordered the linguine with seafood. The portions were skimpy and the prices were relatively high. Her dish was ok but mine was absolutely horrible. The white wine sauce the linguine came in was completely flavorless and the pasta was super al dente bordering on uncooked. Not to mention the squid was akin to chewing on a pencil eraser. There was no salt or pepper on the tables which exacerbated the feeling of being culinarily tortured. Additionally, this sinking dish was without a parmesan life raft which made the whole situation really unpleasant. You can tell that this place is owned by the DOC wine bar folks. Same great ambiance but small, crappy portions at high prices. Never setting foot in PT or DOC again. Learned my lesson.
