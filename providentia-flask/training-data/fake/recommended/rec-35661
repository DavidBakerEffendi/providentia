Had an excellent dinner here. The food was was fantastic and the service was excellent. We did the Chefs tasting menu and enjoyed every dish. Â I would definitely not miss this restaurant and would go when I am in Philly next. I guess the only complaint would be the slight feeling of being upcharged if you want higher end dishes or wine. They should have it stated on the menu so it takes pressure off of the dinner party I decide as u order from the waiter.
