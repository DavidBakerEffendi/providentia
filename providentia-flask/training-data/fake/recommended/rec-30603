Came here for my birthday with 6 of my closest pork-loving friends. Ordered the bo ssam and wasn't disappointed. One whole pork butt of yummy goodness. I also recommend their pork buns if you're not having an entire pork butt (or in our case, in addition to). I don't know that I'd want to wait an hour and a half to eat here (they don't take reservations), so pre-ordered bo ssam is your surefire way to score a (reserved) seat. The other option is to come for lunch on the weekends when I've had better luck with getting a table quickly as well. Go pork butt!
