I went here for brunch and it wasn't too rowdy for unlimited drinking (2 hours) and not being limited to mimosas, but you could mix in bloody mary's or bellinis too! The bloody mary's were alright, not spicy enough but had some horseradish. The mimosas were decent and so were the bellinis. Regardless, I love that you could switch it up. The brunch special was $20, including your entree and 2-hour drinking. I got the baked truffle eggs which were AWESOME. Polenta was cooked well and so were the eggs. My room mate got the Buon Giorno pizza and they forgot the fried egg, so she had to get that added. Her dish was alright and mine was definitely better and more flavorful. Good environment for groups or catching up with friends. I came in a big party but our waitress definitely handled us very well! I'd come back because the location, food and good brunch deal.
