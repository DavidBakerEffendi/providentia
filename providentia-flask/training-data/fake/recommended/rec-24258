I just love it when you go somewhere thinking *I just need to eat. I sorta don't care if it's good or not,* and then the place is really good. That's exactly what happened when we grabbed a late lunch here. It's a deli setup, but there's a large table to sit and eat. The employees were all super nice, and the food was so tasty. I got their tasso ham sandwich with Cajun mayo. I'm used to my heritage namesake being spuriously added to almost anything, but this mayo was h-o-t! My friends all loved their sandwiches and soups. The food is fresh, the cooks clearly care about their ingredients & customers, and the prices aren't that bad!
