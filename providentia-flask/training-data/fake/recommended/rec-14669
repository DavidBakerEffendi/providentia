I absolutely adore going to the dosa stand as often as possible. The food obviously is superb. It's actually the service and the love that Thiru puts into his food and the people he touches every day that draws me over and over again to his stand. His energy & food is always remarkable whatever the weather may be. His stand is outside and looks like a hotdog stand but he definitely doesn't serve meat!! it is funny when people come by and ask for "a dog". I recommend the dosa, a vegan drumstick and a samosa with all of the sauces on the side. Though, anything you order will be tasty and affordable.
