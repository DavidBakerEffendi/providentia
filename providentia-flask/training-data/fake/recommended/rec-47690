Fine. You win, Butcher Bar. I admit that I like you. What else do you want from me? You knew I would like you too. You knew from the moment you were a concept in some restaurateur's head, that I would end up liking you. You knew I'd like how you embody a gentrifying Astoria, how I'd like your fabulous-tasting meats, your rare sodas, your free apple pie... You win. What do you want from me? A criticism? A compliment? What can I give you that you haven't already taken? You have the neighborhood buzz, you have over 360 Yelp reviews, and now you have me. You and Smokehouse and--and--all the others. You all have consumed me as I consumed you. I'm yours.
