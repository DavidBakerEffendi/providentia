YUM. this place rocks. as obscure of a location as they could find, i'm sure. and it totally works for the vibe. i love the decor...a little kitschy and hipstery and retro all at the same time. and small also. not a big crowd the night that i went, which was perfect. i went with a friend who tricked me because she didn't tell me she'd become a pescatarian. not my steez, but it didn't matter. everything we got was totally delicious. we got the flash fried peppers (crapshoot peppers, as i like to call them) to start. i felt like a mad scientist and the peppers were my litmus paper. five...count em, FIVE!...curious and unexpected powdery goodnesses to dip them in. oohh that hickory smoked salt! and the ground wasabi!! titillating! as this particular friend and i wouldn't think to dine any other way, we split everything in fact, in our circle of friends, the adopted term for "splitting" a dish is her last name with an -ing at the end. thus, we ended up with the fish and chips and do or dine's version of elote. sounds elementary enough but good grief. the flavors! the textures! the fish was so perfectly cooked and sitting on a bed of yuzu fries. and they got all juicy and delicious from the fish! and the roe mohawk on his head!! the elote was also exceptional - off the cob and as impressive as i've had this side of the mexican border. i wouldn't have traded a single bite for anything else (though i will try the foie gras doughnut next time i go). the service was great, the ambiance was great, the music was great. a plus, bed stuy!
