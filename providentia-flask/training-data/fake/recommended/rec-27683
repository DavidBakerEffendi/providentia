People in the diner "know" in New Jersey seem to love this place, but to me, it was just like every other diner I've been to. Food was good (standard), and the place wasn't too crowded. But overall, it was nothing spectacular, if anything I was disappointed. I got French Toast, which was pretty equal to any I could have made at home... Food wasn't hot enough for my liking, but overall, wasn't bad enough to complain about. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.
