Ordered a quesadilla in Spanish from the chef, Edgar, and the boys working were so rude to me and my friends after that. They were busy so we just wanted to get our order in. The boys working even asked us if we were stupid because the Edgar doesn't even speak or know Spanish (surprise to them, he does). If it weren't for the Edgar making the best food I've ever seen and eaten I'd never go back.
