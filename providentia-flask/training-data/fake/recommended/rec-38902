Al's is a true institution in Burlington. I felt like I'd gone back in time to a 50's burger joint! Fast, efficient service, lots of activity to see in the open kitchen, delicious, generous portions. We enjoyed the burgers and fries, hot off the grill- YUM!! Leave room for ice cream- outside the main building. Made on site, not Ben & Jerry's, but worth every calorie!
