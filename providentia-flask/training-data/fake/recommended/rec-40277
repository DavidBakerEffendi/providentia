Overrated. Everything on the menu is fried. They are known for the crab fries, which is nothing more than french fries with old bay on them. The portions are average. The BF ordered an extra marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks when we got the bill there was a $1.00 charge  when questioned about it the  waiter said if I could take off the $1.00 I would. (the  waiter didn't tell us there was an additional charge nor was it posted on the menu) No problem the $1.00 gets deducted  from your tip.
