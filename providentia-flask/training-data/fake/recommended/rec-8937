Blue ribbon has a great menu with lots of raw seafood and cooked entree's. I ended up ordering 3 apps and having cocktails as opposed to having an entree. I ordered a dozen raw oysters.. they were very fresh and tasty... although were tinny. I think they were over priced for how small they were. They has an amazing unique house salsa fresca for the oysters. The salsa had lemon juice, cucumbers and some other veggies.. quite a good combo with the oysters. Second I ordered the escargot.. the waiter warned me that it was "unique".. although I was feeling adventurous.. this decision did not pay off. I didn't like the dish at all. It was like a stew with a very thick balsamic reduction sauce, and some veggies. The snails were grainy and the sauce was overwhelming. Last I had the sauteed calamari.. this dish was ok and kind of underwhelming. There was not much flavor at all to the dish. It was small baby squid sliced up into small curly q's. Nice sized portion but needed more flavor. The cocktails were very interesting and I enjoyed the "Ginza" quite a bit. I was looking around and saw some amazing looking plates and feel like there were some great dishes that I missed out on. I think I just ordered the wrong stuff here. I get the feeling that this place is more of a 4 star restaurant but I had at best a 3 star experience.
