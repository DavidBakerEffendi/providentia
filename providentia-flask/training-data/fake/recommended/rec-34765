Writing this review wayyyyy too late. Went there for the summer  Restaurant Week and loved it. Can't completely remember what I order but I'll rack my brain and do the best I can )whoa..that last line rhymed ;)) For appetizers we had 4 small sized plates of mouhamara, lebanese thyme salad, falafel and something with corn. They were all good. Mouhamara won hands down..the walnuts and pomegranate combination was so appetizing. Their portions were pretty good sized  and by the tme the main course arrived, I was full. The falafel was good too. Pita was fresh but went cold quickly and felt like rubber in the mouth later. We had the risotto and chicken shish taouk for mains. I didnt really like the risotto but the chicken was flavorful. Dessert was def a winner. ilili candy bar was yummmmmmmmm, totally my taste. Nothing too sweet and OTT. Drk chocolate sauce had my heart the moment I tasted it. The lebanese chocolate ice cream was creamy but nothing too special. The place where we sat was noisy and there was a group of extremely annoying girlfriends sitting next to us talking about their scandalous lives. Uggghh..yap yap yap. Overall good food, fast service.
