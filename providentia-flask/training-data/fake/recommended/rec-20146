After visiting Belgium and having the best beers and the best mussels with frites, I was pretty excited to try this place. Â  pros -good location to my office (midtown east) -great beer selection -great feel inside and is cozy and non-pubish (which is a plus in my book) -great service -good weekend specials (all the mussels and beer you can eat/drink for $20) cons -french fries were bland (no flavor) -mayonnaise was also flavorless -my friend's mashed potatoes were served cold -mussels were good, but not as good as I was hoping for. I'd go back, but not in a rush.
