I really like coming to The Three Monkeys. So much, in fact, that I've become a regular here. This is another Yelp find that I ended up really enjoying. It only took two visits here for the staff to remember my face/drink combo, and another two afterwards for them to greet me by name once I walked through the door. The vibe is very relaxed and laid back. Lots of barstools available, along with several tables in the back and upstairs for those looking for a meal. There's ample standing room along the side wall as well. Plenty of TVs showing various games, and I've found if you ask nicely, the bartenders are more than happy to change to a different game to make you happy. Aside from a great selection of beers and cocktails, the food here is pretty good too. I enjoy the variety of sliders and other options to pair with my drink. The best part about this place, though, is the staff. I've been treated wonderfully by both Jane and Jerry, and they really make you feel welcome - which is pretty hard to come by in the Midtown/Times Square area. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free shot, or check in on FourSquare to see if they're running a promotion, too!
