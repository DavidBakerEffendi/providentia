Had been saving pics on my phone for when Balvadera was finally on Yelp. I went maybe the first week it opened as my friend had featured the chef in her publication to advertise the new business. Some places are still working out the kinks when they just open but not this place, they were on point from day 1 and from the sounds of the more recent reviews they have not let up since! We went when it was still warm so the place was all opened up to the street giving it a nice ambiance. The decor was also beautiful. Also, it's pretty dark in there. Good for a date. Everything we had was delish. The burrata with grilled peaches - WOW - just wow. The octopus? Stellar. The meats were are expertly cooked as well and the fries, nicely seasoned. Oh and the empanadas! Yes!
