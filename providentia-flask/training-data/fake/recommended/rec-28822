Soup dumplings have changed my life! The broth and pork inside are so flavorful with a good dumpling:pork:broth ratio. Perfect with some dumpling sauce and chili oil. Scallion pancakes are done right - crispy outside and chewy inside and the red bean bun was a delicious way to end the meal. I also recommend the chicken on a stick. Yes, the line is long but it is long for a reason! Definitely worth the wait and service is super fast so the line moves quickly. This location is larger than it looks from outside and is nicely decorated inside
