people seem to love Sanford's and wait an hour+ to eat there, not my household... we ordered a lot of food and most of it was not good.    sweet potato fries - soggy and tasted of old dirty oil, barely resembled a fry. more like a steamed potato with dirty oil  bbq chicken sandwich - bbq auce was not good and tasted quite similar to something i bought from kraft in the grocery store, came with fried tortilla strips that also tasted of old dirty oil and were inedible  dessert - they gave us the wrong dessert  ravioli /salad - good, not great all of that for about $50. total waste
