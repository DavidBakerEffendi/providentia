"I really wanted to like this place" seems to be a recurring theme on Yelp for Heirloom.  It certainly describes my experience. So do the following, come to think of it: (i) salt, and (ii) lukewarm food.  Oh, and, (iii) stomach trouble the next day.  Possibly related to (i) and (ii), above. We started with cocktails and the octopus appetizer, which was actually quite good -- heavy with garlic and herbs, and shockingly hot (for lukewarm, see below).  In fact, too hot -- burned the roof of my mouth on it.  But it certainly was tasty. The trouble started, I suspect, with the main course.  I ordered the hanger steak, rare, served with beets over chard, haloumi and roasted mushrooms, and a beet reduction steak sauce.  The beet sauce was truly excellent, but there were two very serious problems with the steak.  One, it had clearly been sitting a while waiting to be delivered.  Rare steak is supposed to be cold/cool inside, not outside, and while this thing had a really nice sear on it, the whole thing was served to me at room temperature.  Two, the haloumi and roasted mushrooms were seriously over-salted -- as in, salt was all I could taste, and it threw off the whole dish. Side of house fries with a vinegar aioli also came lukewarm.  The aioli was really good, but the fries, well, fries need to be served hot, and there really is no excuse for that.  I did send the fries back for a hot batch, which in retrospect I should have done with the steak as well. Which brings me to thought #3 above.  As soon as I post this, I'll be calling the restaurant to inform them of the mild case of food poisoning they gave me.  It's taking me a little longer than usual to write the review, having been interrupted twice by a highly urgent need to visit the bathroom.
