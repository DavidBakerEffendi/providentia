Burgers, something where you can't go wrong in. In this case, Umami has surpassed the typical burgers. Every bite was equally delicious and I was done with it in 5 seconds. The burger is small when I first saw it, but it actually filled me up. Got the Truffle Burger and IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The sauces that came with the fries were also yummy, my favorite was the garlic aioli. I will definitely be coming back to try the other burgers.
