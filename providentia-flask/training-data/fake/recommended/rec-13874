This place is packed on a Sunday morning! My friends and I arrived around 12pm and was told the wait would be 45 min-1 hr. We put our name down and proceeded to the Starbucks right across the street. Came back to check on time and continued to wait like a can of sardines with the other hungry customers. It took about 1.5 hours total until we were seated. I ordered the Vanilla Bean French Toast while my friend ordered the Johnny Benedict plate, which came out after about 5 minutes of ordering. There wasn't anything special about the french toast except the bread. The brioche was nice and fluffy, but the middle was still pretty soggy - I've had better. The Johnny was tasty and original. It's good if you like the sweet/salty combo because the cornbread cakes and the sausage compliment each other well. A brunch item comes with a complimentary beverage, which I thought was cool. I ordered the Peach Bellini and it was decent. Overall, the food at Jane's was good, just not great. The food is affordable, but I think Norma's is still my favorite brunch place. If I were to come back, I'd make a reservation ahead of time to avoid the 1.5 hour wait on a nice Sunday morning.
