Late in the evening, after drinks and snacks at Noble, very hungry. My friend and I wandered past VW and noticed they were still open -- great! I'd heard great things about their burgers and fries. OK: I will say this. I am a vegetarian, and maybe something special happens to those fries when they are done in duck fat not regular. But I love fries, I eat them all to often, and these were just ok-good. Not great. Good. The beer cheese sauce, same. Deep fried shrimp were great, and the tater tots were pretty good but the sauce was bleh in my opinion. I would try it again, but not high on my list.
