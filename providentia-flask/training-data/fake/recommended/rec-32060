I love this place.  The staff is friendly and the service is great. My food was excellent.  It was just chicken parm, but my fiancée got the chicken with artichoke, and I stole some, and it was exceptional.  I'd get that next time.  The house chianti was very good.  No room for dessert, as the servings are generous.  I'll plan better next time :-)
