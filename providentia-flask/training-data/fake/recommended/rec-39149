Brunch review. The Bloody Mary here is strong but about 1/3 half the size vs Le Barricou on the other side of the burg. I prefer the bloody mary's there because it has more texture and this (though very strong.. had a straight watery consistency). Ordered the famed Meatball Sandwich-- a bit disappointed that it was $2 higher ($16 vs $14) than what they listed on their website. I don't think customers like surprises so they should at least stay updated. It was good (I don't know if it's meatball shop good, but it's good) and filling, and the breaded onion rings on the top were delicious. That dish is missing one fatal thing though - a salad. It's so much brown and denseness, I think they could have parted with the extra 25 cents to throw on a few small greens to accompany the dish. + Another WINTER note - it's COLD in this restaurant! Our table all noted that it would've been more enjoyable if we didn't all have to keep sweaters and jackets on while eating. + Bathrooms are very cute, but beware of the one with the Alaska map in it- there's a hole somewhere in the wall/window and it's the same temperature as outdoors. The other bathroom is toasty.
