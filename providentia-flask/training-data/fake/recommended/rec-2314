Taking the I-91E toward Hartford to transfer to the I-84E, I ask my Girlfriend... "Do you wanna stop in Hartford?" "Why would we stop in Hartford?" "I dunno... So I can try to Yelp something?" "Sure, I guess I'm hungry." "Score." Yes, I make unnecessary pit stops just to find places to Yelp. No, really, I wanted to see Hartford anyway! Tucked in a far back corner between some of Hartford's larger buildings you'll find this sweet little Mexican joint. Agave Grill is as small as your local deli, but serves an extensive menu. They start by asking if you'd like guacamole, which they make fresh with ingredients from right off the table in front of you. I usually don't order wraps, but I saw a server bring one to another table and thought it looked really good. I ordered that while my GF ordered a taco and enchilada. Both items tasted pretty good, nothing amazing but definitely tasty. It reminded me much like the flavor you'd find at a Chevy's. For under $20 the meal was worth it. An A-OK Mexican restaurant nowhere near Mexico! Go check it out Hartford!
