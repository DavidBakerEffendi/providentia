I love this place!  The garden is amazingly serene despite being in the middle of the city.  I've been here 4 times in the last 2 months, for drinks and light dinner at the bar. The drinks here are fantastic - I don't think I have had a bad cocktail yet.  The food is also excellent, although heavy on the salt (this seems to be a problem lately at many restaurants). The rabbit is delicious - I have had it on 2 occasions.  The desserts are also incredible.  The Dark Chocolate Creameaux is a deconstructed s'mores with bacon crumbles.  I know it might sound weird, but it's to die for.   On my most recent visit, I tried the Millefeuille of Banana and Toffee, and that was also amazing. I think this will be my favorite hang-out this summer.
