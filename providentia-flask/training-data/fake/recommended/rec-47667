We stayed in our friends apartment for a fun weekend in the city and this spot was right across from where we stayed. Of note I am actually surprised to see how the orangside employee responded pretty rudely to a couple people who wrote bad reviews and that he said customer experience would be improved. These reviews were written months ago, yet I would say nothing has improved. We decided to check it out. This app offered a coupon deal. I wasn't sure how it worked so I showed our waitress who said they didn't do it anymore. Then she came back and said they did do it. But then there was some confusion over the deal so we decided not to do it. How terrible to offer something and then your staff isn't properly trained on it!! Or even know you participate in it!! The service was mediocre. We just wanted some quick sandwiches and walked in and waited for a small amount of time but has picked the food we wanted out already. I got the Oscar which was scrambled eggs, meat, cheese and hashbrowns in a tortilla. My boyfriend got an egg and cheese and bacon on a hard roll. He said his was ok, missing some seasoning. Mine wasn't horrible, but it wasn't terrific. It was missing something from it. I wish I got to try the French toast or pancakes instead. Would want to try it again, but I just don't think it would be worth it.
