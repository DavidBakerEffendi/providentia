I have enjoyed the 3 or 4 times that I have gone to Portofino's for dinner. Since it isn't recognized as one of New Haven's Big favorites for Italian dining it can often be less crowded and easier to get into without reservations. The wine list isn't anything special but the food is consistently delicious, and the ingredients are always fresh and of good quality. The penne ala vodka is my favorite variation of this dish- with just enough balance between creaminess and tomato for the sauce with some kind of pancetta or bacon stirred in- highly recommend it! I have gone for family dinners as well as date nights and it has always been a solid experience. The twinkle lights in the dining room are nice and the bar always seems like a great place to grab a drink and a meal
