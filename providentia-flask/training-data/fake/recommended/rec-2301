Ok...when In Philly a drive out to Genos & Pats at least once is mandatory (if you haven't been there before). I'm not sure if it was the lack of "service" or how in 3 seconds flat you philly cheesesteak is ready, but Neither Geno's or Pats were anything special...i've had better in Florida!! Only reason I came here was just to come for the sake of coming so I can say "yeah, i've been there.". There is absolutely no reason for me to come back. Any philly cheesesteak spot in Philly can set you up with a great philly cheesesteak...
