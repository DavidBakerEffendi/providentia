!!! BEST COMIDA BORICUA I'VE HAD !!! Well, other than my grandmother's or Titi's (aunt's)! I'm from L.A. and was BLOWN AWAY with how DELICIOUS Adelita's food was...she is a sweet old lady, reminded me of my grandmother too! The prices are great, but I get carried away everytime I go, so I end up spending more than most would. They treated my friends and I like family! (Coo' tip: BYOB...just don't get carried away!)
