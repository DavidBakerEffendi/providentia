Just discovered this restaurant recently and I'm really glad I did. It's a small place and the service is pretty good. Staff is welcoming and attentive. The food is delicious! The smoked salmon with goat cheese, avocado, and red onions is to die for! I also had the delicious creamy tomato soup. The only downside is that they only accept cash but they have an ATM so that makes up for it.
