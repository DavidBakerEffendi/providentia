i am definitely one of the people who is sold on them.. This burger is to die for.. Â And the shoe string fries.. yum! Get the bistro burger complete with the works - cheese.. bacon.. let yer mouth water and finish it off with a wheat beer. mmmmm the service is a bit slow sometimes and you can stand in line forever on a weekend night but the food is well worth it. also i wish they didnt serve on paper plates.
