I came here for the first time last week and can't wait to go again. The space is actually pretty big and open which is nice, but the decor confused me a bit (wallpaper mixed with brick and framed posters of boxers on the wall)- didn't really get an Italian feel. The food however, was definitely italian and delicious at that! They make all their sauces in house and they're fantastic. One thing I feel that might be underrated here is the soup. You get a huge bowl of hearty and flavorful soup for only $6! The rice balls that everyone mentions definitely live up to the hype and the branzino filet I had literally melted in my mouth! They were out of the panna cotta when I went, so I ordered the brownie instead and it was so rich and decadent (in a good way). What a great way to end a great meal! The service was nice and professional, however my server never came back during any part of the meal for a "2 bite/2 minute" check, which as a server is a pet peeve of mine. Thankfully, everything was so good, I never needed anything else. Definitely will come back again, can't wait to try more!
