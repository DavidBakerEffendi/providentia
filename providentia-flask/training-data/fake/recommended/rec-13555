I discovered my love of Jolie on Atlantic Avenue a few weeks before they closed :( They mentioned they were going to reopen as French - Mexican !?!? Who knew French - Mexican could be so delicious :) :) :) I will return when they have their full liquor license (beer & wine only right now).  I really could have used a spicy margarita with my merguez tacos. Overall its a great space with a very eclectic menu, everything we had was very tasty.  It was also nice to see our old waiter from Jolie. Cash & Amex only! My BF wanted to mention his Top Chef review "The black bean soup had a delicious lobster taste but was too pureed and too thin.  While the King Crab Tinga Chilaquiles was very good the salsa verde over empowered the crab, which unfortunately wasn't as strong of a presence as I wanted".  (something like that....)
