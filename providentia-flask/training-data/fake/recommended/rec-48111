I try something new each time I stop in and am pleasantly surprised each and every time!  Their fabulous coffee is what keeps bringing me back.  I've never been a huge fan of baked goods, but I can't resist here!  I also love that it's a local business owned by local people who enjoy playing their role in the community by holding events and attending the farmer's market.   I'd encourage you to stop in for some of their daily baked breads (my favorites are the chipotle cheddar and olive foccacia).
