We were keen to trying this place bc of the reviews. Food was 3.5 and service was 2. There apparently was a system failure and they lost al their orders. It still took 45+ for our food. And another 25 min for our bill. Several diners walked out bc of frustration. The chicken was good but slightly dry. The ceviche was spot on with the grilled shrimp and roasted corn nuts. Sad about the service bc we would've stayed for dessert.
