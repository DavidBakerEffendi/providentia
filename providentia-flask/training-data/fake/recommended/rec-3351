What a misfortune! I came here expecting an authentic Italian experience with great food , attentive service and a reason to come back. From what started to be a five star rating , it quickly turned into two star. Given the fact that I have eaten at other Italian restaurants this place was pretty authentic. Traditionally , chicken parm is served with rigatoni pasta in Italy ..... I didn't know that. It was a very good dish in terms of flavor. The breaded chicken was not dry and well seasoned. Loved the herbs on the melted cheese. I also had the chance to try linguine carbonara. It was good , however , I felt It was "the day after carbonara" because of the amount of grease the pasta sat on. My few Italian friends ( who claim they are authentic ) says it's normal. Â I have never seen it this way. Nevertheless, it did taste good but not amazing. The fried Calamari app was ok- Personally I prefer crispier. The beet salad was also ok- refreshing. What wasn't ok was how one of the waiters offered himself a full glass of OUR wine, (under 5 minutes ) after leaving the restaurant! Not cool, not ethical and not funny. Do you think he apologized? Offered a new bottle? No. Hope this doesn't happen to you.
