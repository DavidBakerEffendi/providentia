I love the fact that I finally found a traditional Dominican restaurant, where the food taste just like home. We had chicken and beef empanadas, which were seasoned perfectly. My fiancé had the Mofongo and all I have to say is that she refused to share; excellent. I had the oxtails and I must say I was surprised at how tasty they were.  I might just go back this weekend for some more. They don't have a full bar, but don't worry about it since their sangria is more then enough; you'll be stumbling home by the end of the evening. We left already planning our next visit.  I gave this place 5 stars because of the awesome food, the great sangria, and the excellent service.
