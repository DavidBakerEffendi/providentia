Great UES date spot. Good food, wine and atmosphere. They take a limited # of reservations and also welcome walk-ins. Waits usually aren't too bad. I recommend the crostini with ricotta and honey and the whole wheat pasta. Check out the back outdoor patio - super cute. I've been many times over the years and always go back.
