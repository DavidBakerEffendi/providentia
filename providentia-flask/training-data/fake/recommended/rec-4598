Definitely an extensive beer list, no doubt about that. But you can easily find that at Rudy's, Prime 16, Delaney's... What sets Cask Republic apart from its competition is their utterly horrible service. The first time I went it was quite bad, but I wanted to give them another shot because I always like new restaurants opening in the area. However, when I went back recently with a friend to have a drink at the bar we literally sat for twenty minutes while the three bartenders walked by us multiple times without stopping to take our order or help us in any way - and that was after making eye contact, waving, shouting... Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place to anyone.
