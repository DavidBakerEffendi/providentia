Are you kidding me. The food is over spiced and the ambiance is bland. When the check came for six people the 20 year old waitress added 20% tip plus 20% tip on the tax. When I questioned her she politely replied "It is customary in all the restaurants I have Â worked in to add a total of 21.75% tip on the bill" Why not 50%. You have to be nuts to go to this place with a policy like that(of course it is not mentioned anywhere on the menu)
