how can i be first to review this place??!?!?! another family favorite -- used to come here with the grandparents, who also converted my dad into a fan (even after my parents divorced, my dad and stepmom would go there, run into my grandparents and wind up having dinner altogether. dysfunctional families, unite!) Their fried chicken is AWESOME -- they bill it as "honey dipped", but it doesn't taste sweet -- i think the honey just makes the batter crispier. The Prime rib is also great -- always cooked perfectly, not overly salty or tough. Another little thing is the cinnamon apples they serve as a side -- i can't explain it, but they are maybe baked and SO TASTY!! i've had almost everything on the menu at this point, and I can't think of one thing that wasn't good. Freddie's is also great for larger groups -- a few years back my dad decided to take the whole family there for Christmas -- a total of 12 people -- and the staff was so accomodating and nice, even though we felt like a big group of loud noisy jerks (cause we are, i guess).
