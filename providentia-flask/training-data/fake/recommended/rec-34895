The Corner Bistro.  It had been years since I last visited, and now that I was putting down my thoughts on what I considered to be the best burgers in the area (see my lists), I had come back here to see if it was still worthy of being what the majority opinion hails as the best burger in New York City.  And thus it was selected to be the nightcap on a day where I tried 4 NYC burgers. First off, the Corner Bistro is a bar, and divey style bar at that.  The beer seems cheap, but don't be too fooled, because the glasses are half size.  If you can endure the crowds, you'll eventually find yourself a table.  There aren't any menus here except what's posted in the corner.  But don't bother memorizing anything- just order the Bistro Burger.   The Bistro Burger is a plump piece of beef, smothered in cheese, topped with 2-3 strips of the most delicious curled up bacon you'll ever taste and of course, lettuce and tomato.  I top mine with ketchup and a bit of mustard, and its glorious.  The bun is toasted on the ends for an extra crisp taste.  When together, the burger is close to as good as any you'll try.  But alas, it comes apart- and it comes apart rather quickly.  Burger's are not meant to be eaten with forks.  You can't have the beef seperately from the bacon and bread!   And alas, the Bistro slots in behind the Burger Joint, who's simple tasty creations are about as perfect as it gets, and Rare, who's burger innovation and taste monsters of beef keep me coming back. But do visit the place.  It can be a pretty fun bar, and how much better of a meal are you gonna get for $6 and change?
