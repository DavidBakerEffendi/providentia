Cons: No air conditioning.  This was why we ended up leaving earlier than closing - time We were all shiny and sweating. Karaoke hostess, allows gaps of time in between singers. She could have happy- bar music play in those moments. Not as professionals as karaoke done by FM Productions ( they do karaoke at Butterfly's) The karaoke song book was not professional looking. Someone had ripped out " M" through "R". Also, I think they had one song book for the whole bar.... Pros: excellent drink prices during " happy hour" $2 on all draft beers, $4 glasses of wine and $5 cocktails.  Where can you get prices like that in West Hartford? You can grab American-Sushi off of the conveyor belt until 11:30 pm. The sushi is adequate but not white linen quality.  I like that that they have noodle dishes on the regular food menu.  I'd like to come back and try them somwday. Service: Our server brought the birthday girl mochi-ice-cream on the house. Amiable bartenders and servers. Decent sound system for karaoke: you can hear yourself.
