This place really is "5-stars" in all shapes and forms... FOOD: The noodles here are fresh, made in house, and made to order.  It is truly an art form, as they have their kitchen visible to the dining room.  In many places, the noodles get forgotten in Asian Cuisine-not so with Nan Zhou.  The freshness of the noodles really come out with the first bite and until the last mouthful. I order two dishes from this place regularly: the beef soup and the soy sauce noodles with pork.  It's a simple choice really. If you're craving for hot comforting soup, then go for the beef soup.  If you're after a yummy pork induced food coma, then try the soy sauce noodles with pork (I recommend eating this dish with the hot pepper seeds).  Both are excellent dishes! Unlike pho, the soup is great as is, and there is no need to add condiments (unless spice is your thing then go for the pepper seeds or if you're an egg fiend like me add the fried egg). SERVICE & VALUE: Lastly the greatest thing about is place is the combination of price and service.  Although, eloquence of the English language is not the servers' forte, attention to their customers is.  Water refills are always timely, and the place is clean (always a plus)!   Next is the value, this place CANNOT be beat!  You can spend $6 on either dish mentioned above, and you get huge portions big enough to share. These are large dishes that are sure to fill your stomachs with wonderful gastronomical goodness!
