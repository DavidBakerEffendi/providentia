Just finished a lunch here, the place was pretty dead, like 4 tables seated through out.  Ordered short rib tacos (fantastic), chicken sandwich (very good), lasagna (also very good) so my issue is certainly not with the food, all around, very good food and decently if only a bit over-priced. The service was abysmal. 4 tables, 4 room staff (2 waitresses, 1 bar tender, 1 bus boy). Our water was empty twice to the point of having to go over to the bar to ask for more.  After paying for the check we waited 18 minutes to have the waitress come back and again had to go to the bar to finish paying.  This would have been OK had we been mulling over coffee, or the place was busy or something, but the wait staff seems too intrigued by making new drinks at the bar to try among themselves and the bar tender and not interested in serving customers. This is a shame because the menu looks really good and I like all the food we tried, but will not be going back.
