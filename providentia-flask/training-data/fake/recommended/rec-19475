I'm a student at CCP and I go to Sabrina's after every major exam that I take.  It's my treat to myself for doing well or the way that I console myself if I did poorly.  It's not the cheapest spot, I don't usually leave there for under $20.00 for lunch, but like I said it's a treat so I don't mind splurging.  I like the southwestern salad the best, my friends always get big beautiful sandwiches with parmesan fries.  The waitstaff has always been great and it's a comfy little place to hang.  Big thumbs up Sabrina's, see you in a few weeks!!
