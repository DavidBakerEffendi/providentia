Although the ambiance is mediocre (a bit cheesy and impersonal) and the prices are not cheap, the pizza is perfect. I recently visited Italy this spring and can honestly say that I find Osteria's pizza to have a more flavorful, interesting, and refined taste than pizza in Italy. The tomato sauce has a complex sweet, salty, and tangy taste and you will find an unusual array of toppings such as octopus, red chili flakes, and smoked mozzarella... but the combinations are delectable. The pasta is not quite up to par with their pizza. The sauce is just good, but the pasta has a great texture: cooked al dente with just the right amount of doughiness. The grilled vegetables on their special menu are delicious, and make for a perfect appetizer with the pizza. I have never been much of a pizza fan, but Osteria gives pizza a different name, and it is definitely worth the trip to try it.
