Had a great first time experience there last night. Went with fiends and we split the large tray and a carafe of mojitos. The food was excellent along with the drinks Our server was very attentive. He refilled our water every time he came back to our table. The food can out correct and in a timely manner. The only negative thing I can say is that the chairs were a little uncomfortable.
