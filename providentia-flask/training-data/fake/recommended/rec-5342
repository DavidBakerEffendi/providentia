My friend and I came here for some late drinks on a Monday night. Not only did they let us and a bunch of other tables stay way past their 11pm closing time, but the manager came to our table and bought us a round of drinks because a bug on the rooftop kept bothering us. Great service and A+ drinks! We had a FABULOUS time! Highly recommend.
