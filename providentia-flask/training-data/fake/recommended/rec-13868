So we are from San Jose, Ca. and after watching the Food Networks Throw down with Bobby Flay, we decided since we are gonna go on a vacation to NYC, to make sure we stop at this place to try their famous pancakes. After watching the show the owners and overall everything seemed very friendly and a comfortable place to go to. Well we went, it was five of us. Getting there we noticed there wasn't a line so that was even better. They asked us for how many, we said 5, and in 10 got seated. Alright this is was really bothered me, Tell me why we get seated in a booth that just fits 4 and didn't the lady see that a few of my friends were large people. It was so embarrassing trying to fit in the booth or even sitting, I felt so bad for my friends. I asked the lady discretely if we could wait for another space to open and then she rolled her eyes and she started to walk the other way. 15 minutes later we get seated and next to us was this older mean lady that kept on getting bothered because for some reason she didn't want to be sitting next to anybody. I know that's not the restaurants fault but that was not cool. The food was good, I actually expected the pancakes to be better but they were good. In the end I realized that my hype was so much larger then what we really experienced. I recommend this place, I just hope this time everything overall is better.
