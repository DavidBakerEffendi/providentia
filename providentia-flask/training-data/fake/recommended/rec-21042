I'd say the food was 4 stars and service 3 1/2. We came during restaurant week. The food portions were generous, dessert (chocolate cake) delicious, and the entrees better than average. I had the Pork Osso Bocco which was huge and super tender. The subtle whisper of radish in the sauce was lovely. The flavor notes were done properly in all the dishes. My friend had the trout which she thoroughly enjoyed. Presentation was fabulous & service was mainly attentive. My friend and I both said we'd go back. Solid food experience. To improve, I'd suggest training the wait staff to know the dishes a bit better and to ask guests about food allergies. My friend can't eat gluten and therefore couldn't eat the chocolate cake. When the waitress boxed the untouched cake for her husband, she didn't ask why...providing an alternative would've raised the service star up.
