Enjoyed a wonderful dinner on Christmas Eve in this cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of little Italy. They offer classic, delicious southern Italian comfort food served in generous portions (enough to share an entree) and moderately priced. We were delighted to be able to order a nice bottle of Italian red wine (Chianti) for $23.00 a bottle in New York! The wait staff is. friendly, helpful and gregarious.We ordered the  calamari for an appetizer which was lightly battered and fried perfectly,and served with the tastiest marinara I ever had!  For our main we had the veal marsala and they were willing to substitute pasta as a side instead of the usual veggie and potatoes as I  couldn't get enough of that delicious marinara sauce! I only wish we had room left for dessert because the cannolis looked divine!
