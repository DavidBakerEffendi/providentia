Ok, ive had pho from every Pho place in the Hartford area. This place falls somewhere in the middle. Positives are: lots of meat in pho, wonderful staff; fast and kind. Negatives: soup could be hotter, meat was not rare steak it was over cooked, the noodles were a bit soft and the broth could have been more flavorful. Overall I would gove Pho 501 65/100.
