ohhhhh WOW, whats up w/ all the with the good reviews?!?!?!?!! I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED w/ dinner last night!!! I made reservations for 6:30pm which was the easy part. Our party of 4 was there on time but trying to even get into the restaurant was horrible. I felt like I was trying to get onto the train during rush hour. After we checked in, the hostess directed us to the bar which was completely packed. There literally nowhere to go and everyone was blocking the whole walkway because the bar area is so small. The hostess finally called our name and then we got seated. The waiter was very pushy about drinks and kept asking over and over again if we were going to order any.  I finally  ordered a spritzer which I thought was a very simple drink to make but no, I was wrong. The drink was too tangy and strong, it was disgusting.  I ordered salmon while my other friends ordered the pasta special. The salmon was so dry that I couldnt even eat it. The pasta was also very bland and I felt that I could even make better tasting pasta with my microwave. So in the end, i dont know what the hype is about. Save your money and get out of that tourist area to a real Italian restaurant.
