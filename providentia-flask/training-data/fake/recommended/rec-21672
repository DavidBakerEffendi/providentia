Had a great meal here back in December. Happened to be passing by in the rain last night, and stopped in spontaneously. Big disappointment. Ordered the chicken. Came out so dry it was impossible to eat. Rest of plate had unattractive blackened veggies thrown around. Not appealing at all. Sent it back. The server was gracious and took it back no questions asked. Asked to put in order of the scallops. Scallops came out quickly. At first they seemed fine, but I soon began to realize that that they were full of sand. Each bite had a big *crunch crunch*. Too much. Sent them back. Decided two tries was enough. However the server argued with me and wanted to charge me for the scallops even though they were full of sand! She gave me a card and said I was entitled to a free entr√©e another night but I had to pay for the scallops. Really, 'cause I'm dying to go back... Shame, I had really likes this place first time around.
