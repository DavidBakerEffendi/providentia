Just your average Bahamas breeze in terms of food/drink but the customer service I experienced on my last visit is what will keep me returning. My husband and I had lunch here today.  I had the lunch special fish tacos which came with two fish tacos and a choice of soup or salad. I had the seafood chowder which I enjoyed.  The fish tacos were a little bland and too watery from the tomatoes and lettuce.  Regardless, I scarfed my first one down since I was starving.  When I went to go bite into my second one I saw a little curly hair on my fish and immediately or grossed out.  When I told our waiter he was very apologetic and said he would get me a new taco.  This was fine with me and we ordered coffees to drink in the meantime.  About 5 minute later, a gentleman who I assumed was the manager came over go introduce himself and let us know they were preparing me a new meal on them and would be comping the meal I ordered.  Awesome!  When the check came our waiter told me that not only did they comp my meal but the coffees were on the house as well. Many restaurants seem to have forgotten this very simple concept over the years.  A happy and VALUED customer is a return customer.  Treat the customer like you need their business and you will have a loyal customer.  I will be back to this Bahama breeze for that reason alone.
