Fabulous! Great atmosphere. Great decor. Good staff. Amaze balls food! Delicious apps, we had the botay (?) and the signature  French onion dumplings. The lobster Mac an cheese was melt in your mouth good.  The short ribs were more than passable. But the star for me of the evening, and I'm a fat guy, was the salad!!! I'm going back just for the "Tabolleh" (spelled wrong and not real Tabolleh). The texture, dressing, and flavor were enough to write home about. So good!
