We drove all the way from Virginia just to get a cheesesteak fix.  Personally, I preferred Pat's but decided to go here because it had a bunch of bright lights.  The line was long but it went by fast.  I got the wiz without which means wiz cheese and without onions or peppers.  I also got an order of fries with wiz.  The fries were great at first but became soggy because of the cheese.  I would recommend getting them plain because they taste good by themselves. Overall, this was better than your average and I do think it's worth one trip in a lifetime to try the Geno and Pat challenge.  Other than that I wouldn't be coming up here anytime soon.
