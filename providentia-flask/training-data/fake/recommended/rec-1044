This place has gone down hill over the past few years.  The meat quality seems to go down every time I eat here.  The person handling the money was the one cutting the rolls last time I was here.  If you are a tourist I'm sure you will enjoy it and it would be worth the experience but for those of us who live in or near Philly there are much better options.  Check my other reviews for those places.
