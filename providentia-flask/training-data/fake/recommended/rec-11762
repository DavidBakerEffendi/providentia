I'm gonna do it, it's getting 5 stars.  Very accomodating waitstaff found seated us at an awesome corner table, the cocktails were strong and delicious and the raw food bar was tasty and fresh. The shrimp cocktail is very good - should definitely get that if you're in the mood for fresh healthy shrimp and the cocktail sauce was great!  I had the trout with the brown butter capers on the side = OMG, what a treat. This is an older building, but modern decoration, and eventhough I imagine it gets quite full quite often, they have a nice big bar (and outdoor seating i heard).  Can't wait to come back again, maybe for a lazy sunday brunch.
