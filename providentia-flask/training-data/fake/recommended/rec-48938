My wife and I recently ate at Lot 2. Which I now call Not A Lot 2. First- the good news- the food is very tasty and we both enjoyed the arugula salad and the buttered noodles and for dessert the cheesecake. Now the bad - the portions here are more on the tasting menu side and the cheesecake could fit in the palm of my hand. Size 7. Â So, unless the the portions become more generous I won't be back for the second coming of the now defunct Little Dishes.
