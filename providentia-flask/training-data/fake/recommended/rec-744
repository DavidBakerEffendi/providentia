I don't get it.  Great drunk food, or a quick sandwich on your way out of town.  Philly is starved for good restaurants if this place is as good as it gets for sandwiches.  WAY too overpriced for a lot of bread too.  The cheese whiz version is way to greasy and hard to eat without making a mess. Only option is onions.   Yes, tourist trap.
