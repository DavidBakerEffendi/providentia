Okay, Brunch time and Honey's has already secured the number 1 spot in Philly. Let's get the bad stuff over with, yeah, you'll have to wait (even for a party of 2) and yes, it's crowded.  Server wasn't exceptionally friendly either. Good stuff: I figured that I might as well eat two dishes again and who says you cant have french toast two days in a row.  You're right, read all the reviews, this stuffed French Toast cannot be beat.  It's unreal. I also had half a grilled cheese, gazpacho, and sweet potato fries, YUM! All winners.  How did I eat all this food? I really really don't know.  I amaze myself. Cute factor: different vintage, funky, coffee mugs. I dig!
