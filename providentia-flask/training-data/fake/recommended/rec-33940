My friend and I went this afternoon for brunch. Found via Yelp, this quaint space is tres chic! We shared the french toast which was divine and loaded down w/ fruit: strawberries, cantaloupe, grapes and melon. We also ordered separate dishes that were equally delicious. The bloody Marys were BEYOND!!!!!! My second time having the drink and it was to die for. Infused w/ a hint of fresh pepper I made sure to devour it completely before I walked out the door! The service was great and we were encouraged to come back again and enjoy some wine by the fireplace in the back! Great experience and service!
