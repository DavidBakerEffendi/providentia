Hostess was super nice, service was wonderful and the food was really good. My wife and I were recommended this place through a friend (and long time New Yorker) and it lived up to the hype. Glad we had a reservation though, it was packed. And if you love peanut butter... you have to get the peanut butter ice cream. It barely tastes like ice cream and instead tastes like 3 giant helpings of incredible homemade peanut butter!
