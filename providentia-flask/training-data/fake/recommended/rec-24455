I went to Penelope for Sunday brunch. We (table of 2) didn't have to wait, at 1pm, which was awesome aka un-heard-of. I had the crab cakes benedict. I didn't think the crab cakes were cooked enough, so I didn't really eat anything on my plate. I used to be in the service industry, so I am afraid to send anything back. My issue, I know. My boyfriend had the french toast, and it was awesome. I had total food envy. If you go here.. don't question it, just get the french toast.
