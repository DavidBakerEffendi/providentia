Let me begin by saying that my first experience at Soco was solid.  Although it was packed the host was great and was able to get me and my friend seated relatively quickly.  The fried chicken was on point though not as good as Blue Ribbon or Sidecar, only the red velvet waffle was something special. Okay, on to this evening's visit.. I wanted to introduce my bf to the red velvet waffle.   He has worked in the restaurant business for 15+ years and is well experienced with customer service in general.  I like to consider myself well versed in good dining experiences. We decided to sit at the bar when we arrived.  We typically like to sit at bars because of the more social atmosphere and, in our experience at good restaurants, the good service.  This evening we had perhaps the worst experience at a bar due to nothing other than the bartender and her appalling customer service.   We sat down at the bar and were greeted by menus but nothing else.  We were two of four customers at the bar and during the time that we spent there she barely said a word to us.  We asked for drinks, we asked to order, we asked for water.  She neither approached us first for any of these things nor did she once ask how everything was or if there was anything we needed. Oh yeah, she did ask if I wanted pepper.  Other than serving drinks she served us no better than a vending machine. When people come to a restaurant they should feel like guests not an inconvenience.   FYI.. The bartender is pretty, light skinned, slim with short hair.  Don't let her cute exterior fool you and do one better than us and call her rudeness out.
