My husband and I went here last Wednesday and were super impressed by the decor, service, and quality of food. To start off, we tried the beef saté and it was excellent. The saté sauce tasted so fresh and delicious. As entrees, we had the Pad Basil and Panang curry. The Panang sauce was unbelievable and the vegetables and spiciness were perfect. The portion size was generous and service was extremely attentive. Hopefully, this place will stay in business because it is so nice to finally have authentic, quality Thai food so close to home.
