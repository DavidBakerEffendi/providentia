Extremely slow kitchen. I went with an hour to eat before my shift and told the server that information as well. I got canned fruit and an omelette over 45 minutes later. I boxed it and left. About 2 weeks later I was waiting for quick hem and asked for the fastest thing they could make, bagel and cream cheese was the answer. That took over 15 minutes. Don't come here with any time constraints.
