Perhaps the most delicious sandwich I've ever had. Full of flavors, sweet and salty (in a fabulous way), extremely filling, soft toasted bread, all characteristics of an outstanding bahn mi. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was so juicy and delicious. The pulled pork layer is very generous and thus, very filling. Looked like a small sandwich at first, but was taking back that thought when half the sandwich was gone. My friend got the grilled portebello mushroom, only because she misread the beet sauce as beef, so she was expecting beef and mushrooms in her sandwich, and was quite unpleasantly surprised when her sandwich had nothing but mushrooms. She said it was very weird because eating mushrooms in giant chunks like that is just strange. So she asked me to dock one star down on yelp for that, hehe. But that's not the only reason I'm docking one star. They handed me the sandwich and said order 6, 7, and i looked at mine which said 7, so i assumed it was my two sandwiches and went back. When I got back, I realized they had only given me one sandwich! I rushed back (because I live fairly close) and they gave me my actual two sandwiches, so they basically gave me the order of the guy who came after me (?) What if I lived further or didn't have time to go back? Anyways, turned out the guy behind me ordered the pork belly, so my friend and i split that since we got a free sandwich, (yay!) and it was AMAZING!! ORDER THIS!! Also very juicy and flavorful, and the crunch pear pickles complement the soft pork quite well!
