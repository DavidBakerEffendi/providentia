Went with my family to Osteria to celebrate my 21st birthday. Although this was six months ago, I'm still certain I couldn't have spent it better. Cool taverny, brick-walled space (except for the wall facing you when you walk in, made from old wine crates!). Beautifully lit, with perfectly buzzy energy on a weekend night. Pizza oven is open for all in the main dining room to see, and the cooks (would they prefer "chefs"? Let me know, boys...)...wow. They're incredibly cute. Ladies, take a group of girlfriends and enjoy the view. The menu that night offered about a dozen tantalizing options, but none could fairly compete with the 7-month cave-aged beef steak (forgive me, I forget the cut!) with roasted chanterelles. 'Twas a $50 plate, shared most satisfyingly between my mom and I. Also on our table: braised rabbit, veal, all not-too-rich but powerfully flavorful. Portion sizes were on the generous side. The waiter overheard my accidentally external internal dialogue as I furiously spat behind the menu, and sneakily put an order in for the pizza I gave up when I settled on the steak. Sweet corn, fresh mozzarella di bufala and lardons made for an amazing pie. He brought it to the table, winked, and didn't add it to the bill! Â My family and I were full-bellied and blissful as we indulged in several unnecessary but fantastic desserts that I cannot quite recall. The next time I go to Osteria, it will be to chain myself to something inside so I may appropriate all my waking hours to beg for a job. Written July, 2011 GREAT pizza. And I am not easily impressed (Frank Pepe's of New Haven, CT: still reigns no.1 in my heart). Full menu, but this pizza is not to be passed up. Osteria offers both traditional thin-crust pizza and a napoletana option (a somewhat heftier crust with more chew than crisp). Deep-fried artichoke appetizer, divine.
