Today I went in to try the veggie pho and was infinitely pleased with my experience. The guy behind the counter was very friendly, accommodating, and happy to answer all of my annoying questions about the ingredients. I got it to go and it was packaged well in three containers, with little cups of various sauces on the side. This soup was inexpensive but you can tell that no corners are cut with the ingredients- the broth was super flavorful, and all of the vegetables crisp and fresh. I will definitely be back for more.
