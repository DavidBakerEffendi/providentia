Just okay. My pan roasted chicken was very moist and yummy, yet the veggies were very bland and the pan sauce they drizzled on the plate tasted like it came from a meat loaf. It just didn't work with the chicken. Our party ordered several apps.... Calamari was rubbery, coconut shrimp was good, drunken shrimp were delicious yet there were only 3, and the nachos were great, Â the best app out of the 4 we received. Overall most in our party were satisfied with their meals. Most of the complaints were that their food was bland. For a Saturday night, the restaurant was dead. Makes you wonder if Yelp is making an impact in the restaurant business.
