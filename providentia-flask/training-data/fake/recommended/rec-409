Waited for 1.5 hours on a Friday night when you get there before 6:30pm. Not bad compared to 3 hours later on in the night. They opened the 2nd floor so it's not that long compared to when they first opened. I don't know what the fuss is. But I had to try it because people are willing to wait for this burger place. The waitress was nice and introduced the menu but the menu itself wasn't that tasty. I do not know why they have a secret menu. We got the Cheesy tots, smushed potatoes, the original burger and the pastrami burger, pastrami and tots wasn't on the menu. Food came out quickly. But needed to ask the waiters for water refill. Beef tasted bland. If it wasn't for the help of ketchup, the beef wouldn't have no taste. Bun was soft and Crunchy. Tots -- not enough cheese Smushed potatoes-- like its name, boiled potatoes that are squashed and then fried with mayo on the side. Dessert: got the Goodwich which was premade. I guess they took it out from fridge. Oatmeal cookie was vanilla ice cream. Cookie tasted too hard. Overall, if I have to wait 3 hours, it's not worth the wait.
