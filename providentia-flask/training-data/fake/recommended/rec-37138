I loved it. Went there for a corporate dinner and was impressed. The atmosphere is cozy and trendy, laid-back, but on a classy side. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable without being too reserved or too chatty. Big plus. What I remember the most is the kangaroo meat appetizer. I'm pretty conservative in my food tastes, but this was so flavorful and unique and I'd probably try it again. The other dish I tried (raviolli) was good too, but Â I wish the portion was just a tad big bigger. The selection of wine was huge and the dinner made a great impression. A definite recommend.
