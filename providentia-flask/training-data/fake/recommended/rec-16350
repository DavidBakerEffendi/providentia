Coppelia is a great option for those with a spontanous craving for Latin Food because it is open 24/7, catering to your desired cravings for huevos rancheros, arepas, pork fat, lomo saltado, nachos, guac..n' more fried pork fat. Mac & Chicharron was delicious.  Pretty sure that the macaroni was poured straight from a Kraft's box - at least that's what it looked like.  Whatever, not picky.  Also not enough pieces of pork belly in it (only like 6 pieces!).  The cheese sauce, on the other hand, was out of this world.  Not ashamed that I scraped that bowl clean, if I were home I would've licked it clean. Arepas ($9) were cute but were literally 3 inches in diameter - definitely not enough food for a grown man.  Luckily I fared fine because I have a small stomach - I wasn't stuffed at the end of that meal, which I suppose is a good thing.  The corn cake (reina pepiada) was super crispy and was thin enough that it wasn't soft on the inside like those at Caracas.  The inside had a nice dollop of guac and a spoonful size of tasty chipotle-like barbacoa chicken.   BF got the Cubano burger which was dripping with and in a puddle of oil.... Nothing to make me come back, but I would love to try lots of other stuff on the menu.  Maybe next time! Other pros: ++STRONG Sangria Peruana ($10), $3 Tecate Beer M-F 4-7PM ++Friendly, attentive service ++Cute environment - booth, table, or bar style ++Clean bathrooms
