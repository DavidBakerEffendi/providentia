Great food, great service. Felt at home as soon as I walked in! Food was fresh and delicious. They even had homemade hot sauce! The empanadas were great! We ate in. Simple basic decor that focused on great food and great people! We were stuffed and we still bought empanadas to take home! Prices were a steal! Definitely coming back!
