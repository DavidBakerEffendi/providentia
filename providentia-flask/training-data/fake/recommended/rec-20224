I went to this restaurant just to try it out, it was very nice. the steak was great with the home-fries underneath it. the setting was a little noisy but we ask our server to switch us to another quiet area and he did an awesome job placing us by the windows with candle light. the service was great as well as the food and we will definitely return again for a lovely night with great food.
