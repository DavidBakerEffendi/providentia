Creative Health conscious Vegan friendly Cuisine From a former White House Chef who once crafted custom presidential dishes. You can taste these amazing creations in this Bayonne hidden gem unassuming restaurant. Well worth the trip or visit, especially if you are vegetarian or Vegan! For the carnivores there are many meaty dishes as well.
