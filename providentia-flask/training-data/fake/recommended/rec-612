After almost a year of living in the neighborhood, I've finally found a go-to brunch spot. Despite my preconceptions about French servers, people here are always charming, the music is comforting, and it always feels intimate. If you're looking for an escape from the myriad of undifferentiated Murray Hill brunch establishments (and don't want to wait in the ridic line at Penelope), look no further. Ponty has a $20 menu that includes classics as well as more elegant dishes, alongside a cocktail and coffee. Servers here are SO accommodating too - I requested extra bacon and shrimp in my bloody mary, and they were quick to oblige (for a modest fee, however). The lobster benedict is my favorite choice, followed closely by the duck confit omelet (not a huge fan of the swiss cheese inside though). The homefries they come with are adorned with rosemary, and even specks of bacon, and are cooked exactly to perfection. I could eat these all day. I confess I haven't been to dinner here yet, but friends have raved about the hangar steak. Soon this will be in my stomach. Even as I write this I'm conflicted, because while I do want to publicly endorse Ponty, I want it to remain as intimate as it has been during my previous visits.
