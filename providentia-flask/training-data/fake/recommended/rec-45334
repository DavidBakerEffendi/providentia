I really enjoyed my second visit to Sazon. We had a rather late brunch, and were happy to be able to order omelets in mid-afternoon. They were accompanied by arepas stuffed with cheese, and a lovely salad. The omelets were chock full of ingredients, and cooked to perfection. I am not an expert in arepas, but these were very tasty and fresh-tasting. Of course the visit would not be complete without a choclate. My dining companion and I each had the cuaima hot chocolate, made with cinnamon water and chili peppers. Delicioso!
