I have this bad luck that as soon as I write a nice review about a place, the next time I go something bad happens, so Skytown, please don't let me down! The drinks here are awesome!  The Macintosh is my favorite and it is amazing!  Anywhere else it would cost $12 - 16, but at Skytown drinks are in the $8-10 range.  It's a really cute place, warm and candlelit, and good for catching up with friends or just having a drink, bite or coffee on your own.  Bathrooms are clean and there are hooks for jackets and bags under the bar.  The bartenders are really nice.  Really nice and neighborly.  All in all this place is a gem.  I have nothing bad to say about it other than I wish it was closer to my apartment!
