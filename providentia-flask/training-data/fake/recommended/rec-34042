It's rare that I compelled to write a review the moment I leave a restaurant, but I am this time. Momo was a fantastic experience, starting with the quality of the sushi (amazingly fresh and flavorful) to the beautiful presentations to the creative fusions that all succeed beyond your tastebud's expectations even, to the most attentive owner/chef we've ever encountered (he brought a complimentary beer over to split with us and brought us the hand rolls himself, explaining every ingredient right down to the toasted (with a blow torch, of course) seaweed wraps. Must orders: Karage (fried chicken so good I'm certain the chicken volunteered to be part of this dish).  Pork Belly (we added the duck egg which made for a creamy companion to what was already pork perfection and, along with the fresh cilantro that comes sprinkled across the top, created a dish that sung bass, tenor & soprano all at once.  All three hand rolls (we had the softshell shrimp and scallop... note the chef will hand feed you these if he really likes you). Okay, you can skip the ramen.... no comparison to Chuko. Beer & wine selection is simple but SPOT ON. Pre-mixed wasabi soy sauce combo?  Why is this so special??  Not sure, but it made the meal. Environment is super friendly and relaxed... we felt right at home.  It does get h.o.t. with the space heaters blaring up above, and the music became so loud at one point that I think our neighbor's live uni was trembling. Loved it so much I want to go back.  Tomorrow.
