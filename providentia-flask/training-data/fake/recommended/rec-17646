So let me put it out there that I'm Haitian.  I grew up on this food, I cook this food, my mom's kitchen is the best ever! That being said...I went to this restaurant with a critical mind already. The atmosphere and service was very good. Its an intimate and color establishment and service was attentive. The food is very very good.  I had the legume (spinach) and he had the griot (fried pork). The serving size for my legume was great and it tasted awesome. They gave me a mini pot!  His serving size of the griot was not a enough at all, especially for dude. Most Haitian restaurants give u very large servings.  I didn't see to much wrong with it but he did and others will too. Overall, their food is very good and I love the atmosphere. i would go back....
