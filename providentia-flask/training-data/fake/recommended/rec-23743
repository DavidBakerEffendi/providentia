As of March 2011, this diner is now re-opened under new management. It's excellent. The menu is more extensive, and everything we've tried has been inspired. It should not be viewed as a basic "greasy spoon". The offerings are first rate, and mostly made in-house. Portions are generous, and well-prepared. The selection and specials are inventive. The premises seem fresh and bright, and the waitstaff is very friendly. Yes, this place is now better than Lou's in Hanover. Give it a whirl if you haven't been there in a while.
