My wife and I grabbed brunch on a Saturday- the food was impressive and reasonably priced. The service was friendly and attentive. The booth Â was really comfy and the atmosphere was warm and eclectic. One of the best dining experiences we have had in LIC! My wife loved the "Green Goddess" Salad- I recommend the Capt. Crunch & Coconut French Toast. Amazing!
