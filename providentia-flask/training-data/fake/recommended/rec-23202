Darn good and humongous cheesesteaks.  I have tried a variety and my favorites still is the original with provolone and onions.  Though for health sake (yes I realize the oxymoron) I go with the chickensteak which is also very good. With that said, I have tried other things, and cannot recommend the salad or fries.  Just stick with the cheesesteaks
