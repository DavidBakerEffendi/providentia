I wish I could have eaten there every day! We had a very good experience here: after reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to go with the Punctuated Equilibrium flatbread, and did not regret it for a second. (Thanks, reviewers! It was perfect.) We only had a 10-minute wait, and waited about 10 minutes for our food, since we were there fairly early, having just rolled into town after a 6-hour car ride. The atmosphere was really nice as well. Everyone was really nice & friendly, despite how busy it was. Burlington rocks!
