I have had this restaurant on my list of places to eat for some time now. My son and I finally had a chance to eat at Marc Forgione this weekend and it was well worth the wait. Although we didn't have reservations, we were able to be seated at the "communal tables" in the bar area. This was fine with us, but for folks that don't like high bar stool-type seats, I recommend making a reservation for a real table. The food was as good as the reviews suggest. We got there not really hungry, and that was the best way to experience it. The portions were reasonably sized, so we were able to try three appetizers and dinner. The experience was all about taste. Each dish had such a mix of tastes, but they were not overpowering or fighting with one another. I think the BBQ Baked Olde Salt Oysters was my favorite. My son (14) wouldn't normally even look at oysters, but he ate three of them. We also had the bone marrow and escargot served with toast and the shrimp in a cucumber cream sauce. We shared the Bell & Evans Chicken Under a Brick for dinner. Everything was very good. In addition to very good food, I found the server to be very helpful and very courteous. I had read reviews that spoke of the service there being a bit cold, but that was not our experience at all. I highly recommend this restaurant.
