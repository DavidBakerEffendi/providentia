This place is good and I really hope they stay in business. Contrary to another review: yes, they have good, rich comfort food, but that's not all they have. You can easily get a decently healthy meal here (although the portions will be generous for the price, which is actually a win in my book). My mother and I both had the "lobster rolls" with sweet potato fries -- they were more like toasted lobster sandwiches. Not very traditional, but huge and of good quality. We liked the mix of flavors, however we didn't understand why they would import lobster from Brazil instead of using good old New England lobster, which is much more "local" and just as good, if not better! Alas, still a good place and I'd like to go back and try new stuff on their menu. The outdoor seating is quite nice.
