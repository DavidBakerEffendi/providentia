i was more stoked on the food than the booze, honestly.. although after paying for drinks in new york city for the last year and a half, $2 pbrs were heaven sent. the crowd was iffy, the music was okay. but food! in the same place as reasonably priced alcoholic beverages? if i'd had more cash on me, i would have had a field day. i can safely say if this bar were in new york, it would probably only warrant 2 stars, if that. yay philly!
