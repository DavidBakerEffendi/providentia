I must have ordered the wrong dish (and my sis in law must have, too) because I did not enjoy my meal at all. I ordered beef thai basil. My experience with thai basil dishes is that they, at the very least, have some miggyfiggy thai basil in them. This bowl of soupy veggies did not have a hint or trace of anything resembling thai basil. Literally. None. Not like, "oh man, i love thai basil i sure wish they put more of it in here!" It was just completely absent from the dish. This place also doesn't take cards. I totally get that lots of little cafes in West Philly don't take cards. It's inconvenient and I hate it but I get that when most of your transactions are $1.75 cups of coffee, accepting debit and credit is not a necessity. But when the average dish on your menu is $10+ being cash only is ridiculous to me. I just don't see why I'd ever return. meh
