I have been on a search for the best cheesesteaks in Philadelphia since I moved up here from FL in 2010.  I know some locals are biased towards a particular steak place because they either grew up nearby, or they have some sentimental memory about the joint ("my dad brought me here every Saturday growing up...", etc.), or maybe it's all they know. Fortunately, I am totally unbiased, so you can trust me on this. These are the BEST steaks I have tried in the area.  And I'm pretty sure I've tried them all. Sorry, but Pat's and Geno's are both totally overrated and don't even come close.  Yes, Tony Luke's has a pretty good roast pork sandwich. Even Saessano's and Pudge's out in the 'burbs can hold their own as far as hoagies and steaks go. Chubby's is good and thumbs up to them for selling more than just steaks... BUT, if you want to try the best steaks that Philly has to offer, come to Dalessandro's.  Or if you want to bring your out-of-town visitor to a place where it's truly "Philly", but not overrated (re: Pat's/Geno's), come to Delassandro's. Or maybe you want to experience the Philly cheesesteak "experience" from the true experts and actually receive fast and courteous customer service? COME TO DELASSANDRO'S. Or maybe we should just keep them a secret, so that they don't sell out like those other guys. ;-) Just saying'... Call ahead, bring cash, and enjoy!
