If you're looking for Manhattan chic, wrong place. If you're looking for superior service, beautiful ambience and outstanding food, step right in! Though my wife, two young kids and I were in jeans and T-shirts after a Trenton Thunder game AND ordered only two entrees and some drinks, the wait staff and management treated us like royalty. To boot, our food was very memorable and presented with style. House salad was perfectly dressed. Sorbet was a pleasant, unexpected surprise (been a long time, even with many nice restaurants since getting that). Homemade potato gnocchi was light and matched well with the "award winning" marinara, which really was special. Our flounder was just firm enough to be a solid filet with the awesome marinara. And for dessert, the waiter asked if the kids may have ice cream because the owner likes to give out a free scoop, before seeing whether or not we were ordering dessert. OMG, the homemade tiramisu was heavenly, along side black coffee that was perfectly balanced to enjoy two cups without cream or sugar. I would definitely go back, though next time I'm in Trenton, I hope it's not a Sunday so we can try Delorenzo's.
