I've been to frankford hall countless times when I had an art studio in fishtown. Frankford hall has some of the best burgers and bratwurst ever. And for real good prices. If your into spiked milkshakes then I suggest trying their spiked smores. Yes. And the curry ketchup is pretty darn good. I like the ordering process; you order then take your number ot your table and they bring it over. Your wait is short because you're either too busy playing Jenga, or playing table tennis. The outside seating is nice and well lit at night. The beer is standard but pretty good. Give it a try if your in the area and just want a good ol fashioned meal and beer. Its perfect for big groups with their picnic type tables.
