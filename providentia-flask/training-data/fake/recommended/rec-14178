Yay. My sister took me here when I visited her last weekend.  This place is packed and people would line up for hours, in order to get in - therefore we came here at around 3pm and it was perfectly quiet.   Famous for their pancakes and so we ordered the blueberry pancake.  It was very delicious.  A plate comes with 3 pieces of warm, fluffy pancakes, filled with fresh cooked blueberries.  I could taste the juicy blueberries in every bite.  And get this - the pancakes come with homemade syrup with a hint of caramel - oh it is heavenly. Nom nom nom.
