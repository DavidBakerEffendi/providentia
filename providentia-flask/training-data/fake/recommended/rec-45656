This used to be my favorite bar. Seriously... It was every-evening-after-work-sitting-at-the-bar-alone-­with-a-book-and-eating-some -scrumdiddlyumptious-fried-shrimp-and-drinking-­tasty-brew favorite. The food is still really good (though not 5 star good anymore), the drinks are still reasonably priced, and the staff is still nice. But since they added the upstairs, expanded into the building next door and added a brunch, they've become too busy/popular/trendy for their own good. It's still a really fun place to go, especially if you like crowded nightclubs filled to the brim with hipsters and indie-rocker wannabes. But I really miss the simple drunken joy of the old JB's. Oh yeah, the modified Budweiser sign over the juke box made to say "dive bar"  no-longer applies. EDIT (May 7, 2008): I just went there last night and found out that the Yard's Philly Pale Ale is now $4.50... that requires me to take away a star. If the rest of Philly starts charging more than $3 for a Yard's, then I will give them their 3 stars back. Maybe not. I doubt I'm going back (unless an awesome band plays a show there).
