I recently went on a very nice date here, with a travelin' man who told me that the food he'd eaten in Cuba was nowhere near as tasty as the steaks we co-moaned over at Cafecito. I don't find this hard to believe considering how good the food and drinks are at this Alphabet City gem. The flank steak with chimichurri sauce is a must for carnivores.  The perfectly/barely cooked beef pairs unbelievably well with the tart, garlicky chimichurri sauce it comes with. Bring your appetite because in addition to a very large steak, you'll get delicious rice and beans with that... AND tostones with the delicious garlic cream sauce they come with.  Mmmm, garlic. Also: the mojitos here are quite addictive. Strong but crammed with fresh mint, they're sweet without being too sweet. A must.
