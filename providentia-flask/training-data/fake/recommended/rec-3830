I really hated this experiace. To start, this has got to be one of the dirtiest corners in Manhattan. Patrons of this business seem to think it's ok to leave used napkins and plates about. I ordered the falafal with hot sauce and white sauce, and they were all terrible. The falafal was greasy, the pita was super market variety, the white sauce was a watery, flavorless disappointment and the hot sauce was just hot, no flavor! I think if you're not hammered there is no way to eat this and feel a anything but a strain on your upchuck reflex and a sad lack of $5. After we had this for dinner, we got Jamba just to get the taste out.
