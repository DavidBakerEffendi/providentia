This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in New Haven and our go to place for lunch or dinner. Â  The loaded nachos with steak are UNREAL (and serve 2) and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The margaritas are strong and wonderful. The bananas flautas are to die for. The chips and salsa are homemade and delicious. The staff are friendly and pretty quick. We recently tried the enchiladas. The mole sauce is great and the sweetest I've had, but I'd still go for the nachos. Haven't gone wrong yet at this place.
