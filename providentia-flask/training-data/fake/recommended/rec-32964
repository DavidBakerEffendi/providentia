Place was just ok. Calamari app was a little chewy. Not enough pita with the hummus app. Moussaka was ordered by a guest. Was tasty. Seafood kabob.lacked flavor. As far as service was a small place and felt like I was looking of the waiter all night. A little cramped. Would try other places first. Descent food
