This should tell you all you need to know: I don't even LIKE Indian food as a rule, and when my partner asks where we should go out to dinner, I say "Gandhi" without a second thought. The menu will definitely appeal to just about anyone--I've taken people here who are Indian connoisseurs and they love it just as much as I do. Three things I recommend the most: 1. the garlic naan. OM NOM NOM NOM. 2. the vegetable samosas. They have beef and chicken ones too, but the veggie ones are outstanding. The outside is perfectly cooked and salty, and thick enough to serve as the perfect container for the veggies, potatoes, and sauce. Not so thin that it dissolves in your hand, and not so thick that you don't taste anything else. 3. the bindi masala. I recommend this for folks who don't usually like Indian food--it's fried okra in a spicy tomato and onion sauce. It's perfect on rice and also makes for great leftovers. Â  EDIT: ALSO THE MADRAS. omg. It is the perfect blend of spice and flavor, and you can get it with crab (REAL crab, which is not normal in this soul-crushing city) for, like, $12. Are you kidding me? Amazing. Bonus: if you eat in the restaurant, they have lots of dramatic foreign-language soap operas playing on the tv. Also, the staff are incredibly sweet and polite. Don't hesitate to ask them any questions about the food, or ask them for recommendations.
