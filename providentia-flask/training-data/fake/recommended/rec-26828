recently found that they serve a pretty passable bowl of hu tieu substantial broth, loaded with tendon, brisket, fishcake, shrimp and quail eggs(!) over your standard dried rice noodles served with cilantro, green onion, and bean sprouts already in it (though you can ask them to omit any of the above); obligatory sriracha, fish sauce and lemon on the side not the best i've had, but pretty amazing considering it's off-menu and a far cry from ba xuyen's specialty hu tieu for a hangover, hot horlicks for these brisk autumn mornings, miscellaneous noodles and desserts rotated on a daily basis, all while continuing to serve the best banh mi in the five boroughs? living two blocks away and spending entirely too much time here (and only a very modest amount of money)
