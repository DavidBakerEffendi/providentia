I came back again this past weekend for dinner and was hoping to update my review to a five-star, but Palma is still a solid 4 stars. The food and service were both fantastic again. This time I was seated with two friends at a table near the bar. The area near the bar is a little too crowded and noisy; it's hard to fully enjoy a conversation without feeling like you are raising your voice. Other than that small point, Palma is fantastic! I will definitely be back and will continue to introduce friends to the restaurant.
