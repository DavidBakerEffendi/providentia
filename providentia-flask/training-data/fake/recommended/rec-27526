Yum yum yummy yummers! Not a great place to go with a group, but the perfect place for a date.  The brick chicken, swordfish, crustini, salad, and chocolate/caramel/sea salt cake were ALL amazing!!  The cocktails and wine selection were also wonderful.   I cannot say anything negative about this place and I am really excited to go back!
