Completely not worth the price! I am not sure how the bill for three people was almost $100 for lunch! Extremely overpriced and overrated. The service was poor and the salad with strawberries consisted of a handful of arugula with two strawberries. Do not plan on ever going back. We left hungrier than before we arrived
