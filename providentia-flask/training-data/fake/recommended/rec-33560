Came here for dinner as a party of 3 on a Saturday night. The seating in the restaurant is very tight. they seated us at a 2 person table with a 3rd chair on the end which killed the ambience. As you can imagine with coats and bags it just wasn't very comfortable dining. For appetizer we had a mixed seafood ceviche that was pretty good. For mains we had the seafood paella which came out really dry. The rice was crusty on the edge of cast iron pan it was served out of. Do not order paella from a Cuban place. The seafood casserole was pretty good. If you like rich and heavier seafood dishes then I would recommend it. It's also served with rice which makes for a hearty meal. The churasco skirt steak was also pretty good. The outstanding and memorable part of the meal was the dessert. You must order the flan! It's the best flan I've ever tasted and probably the most fattening! It's much less eggy and more similar to the creaminess of a panna cotta. Food overall is good and dessert even better. However I am giving it 3 stars because they we're trying to pack in every single guest they could seat on a Saturday night. Our plates barely fit on a table and we were seated like 6 inches from the table next to us. If you are trying to catch up with friends on a weekend I wouldn't come here. But worth trying on a quieter night.
