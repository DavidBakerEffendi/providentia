Heard so much about this place that I finally decided to check it out tonight (Saturday night). Thanks to my fellow yelpers I knew the wait could be crazy so I decided to come with one friend at 8pm and we had a table in less than 15 minutes. The staff is friendly and happy to make you feel like your experience isn't rushed regardless of how many people are waiting. I ordered the truffle burger and truffle fries. Anything truffle I'm game. My friend ordered the smashed potatoes along with the B.U.B. burger. I can't find a word to perfectly capture the experience my tastebuds had today. Scrumptious. Delectable. Unexplainably delicious. Umami makes their own truffle cheese, aioli as well as 4 amazing sauces that come with your meal; garlic aioli, jalape√±o ranch, diablo habanero sauce and truffle ketchup. Although I feel guilty for eating a burger, if you are going to binge this is the only thing that is worth it. Umami is a must in New York City. My only question to the owner is: HOW CAN I BE VIP?!!?!
