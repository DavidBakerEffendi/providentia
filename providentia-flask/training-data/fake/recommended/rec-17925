I'm a fan of all things bbq and was surprised to realize that we've never tried this place. We went for dinner last week and all I can say is.... NO. From the minute you walk in - and wait a while for everyone to stop talking and slapfighting with each other to seat you - it all seems to go downhill. Inattentive service in a mostly empty restaurant - server forgot we were there, forgot what we ordered and then disappeared toward the end of the meal. Seems as though one server was pulling the weight for the rest of them - poor guy got stopped repeatedly by several tables for missing items from their own servers and he seemed to at least try to oblige. The food: just NO. No no no. I had the ribs, which I never should've done: overcooked, dry, tasteless. My dining companion had the chopped pork, which he said was reheated and bland. The sides were reminiscent of frozen food, ill prepared and served lukewarm. In particular: cornbread was an epic fail. Dry, old, crumbly. Total disappointment. Period. Best part: we finally get the check, pay and leave the guest check with receipts on the table. We stand up to leave and before we get five feet away, one of the waiters (not ours) says "WAIT!" and runs up to it, flips it open, checks the tip and says "UH HUH". WTF. I used to wait tables and always tip - even in this case where it was undeserved - but that is just poor taste. Bottom line: there is no redeeming quality to this place.
