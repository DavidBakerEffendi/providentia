With all the hype around the Momofuku restaurants, we had to try one of them out. With a limited budget and just the two of us, we decided to eat at Ssam Bar for lunch. We arrived shortly after it opened and we were the first ones there. The restaurant itself has a very clean, modern design, but I found the chairs a little awkward. We ordered the pork buns and the duck lunch special to share. The pork buns were amazing! Super tender and fatty pork belly with a little bit of crisp cucumbers inside of a fluffy bun. Yum. The duck was a little disappointing. We were expecting the most amazing duck ever, but it was just average. The accompaniments were just okay as well...the pancake was a little dry and the rice was fine. Overall, I'd come back for the pork buns, and hopefully with enough people to try the bo ssam dinner, which looks delicious.
