I've been to Winberie a couple times and have never really been impressed. The food is on par with Chili's or TGI Fridays with a few slightly more creative menu touches and better beer and wine choices. Nothing ever tastes great, although nothing is ever bad either. It's consistently decent pub food. The positives for Winberie are its great location (Palmer Square, right across from Princeton University), Princeton memorabilia (think Applebee's, except the junk on the wall is actually regionally-specific and carefully chosen), and unpretentious nature. Despite the close proximity to campus, this is generally not a place that students visit or hang out; the clientele is typically 30s+.
