Came here at 830 on a Friday night and had to wait 15 minutes.  Decor is nice and lounge.  Prices are slightly higher than the thai places around.  We got pork chop and lychee Siam duck.  They were generally not bad.   pork was a bit salty and slightly overcooked but came in a huge portion.  Duck was nicely flavored but the skin was not crispy enough and overcooked. Overall one of the best thai experiences I've ever had. I wish hotels actually had this kind of cuisine as room service.  Like the checkin checkout menus.
