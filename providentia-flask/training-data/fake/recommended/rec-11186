Right now, Vietnam is my very favorite restaurant in Philly.  The spring rolls are nice and crunchy - perfect with vermicelli.  The egg noodle soup was tasty and just the right size (just big enough that it's still hot when you get to the bottom of the bowl).  Fresh food, great service, and inexpensive.  Plus, the bathrooms are probably the nicest in Chinatown.
