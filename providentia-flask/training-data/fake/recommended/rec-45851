Today I ordered and tried for the first time Ikasansai and it was so tasty.  I also ordered the wakame udon.  Usually this is good but this time the noodles were a little over cooked.  Still tasty though.   I like the guy who works the front, he is cool.  He let me know about a fundraiser that is this Saturday night which seems pretty interesting.   I hope I can make it!  It is about Japanese culture etc.  I love learning new things!
