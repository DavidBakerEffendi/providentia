SO OVERPRICED for what you're getting. Very nice atmosphere, impeccable service and plating. But my gosh, it is expensive, and you don't get that much on your plate. The food tastes good, but not for the prices. Came here with 2 friends and had appetizer, wine and entree each and we each paid over $100 with tip.
