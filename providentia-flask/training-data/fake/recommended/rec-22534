OH  how I miss my old Brooklyn, and that was not so long ago.  Welcome all those who have turned the quant neighborhood of Windsor Terrace into  Manhattan .Well, I visited The Brooklyn Commune for dinner recently and thought I was in Manhattan. A Twenty Five Dollars fixed price menu, small servings, and way over priced. I guess one could say "your not in Kansas anymore".
