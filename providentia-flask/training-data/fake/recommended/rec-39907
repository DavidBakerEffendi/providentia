LOVED applewood, from the decor to the food. I went to Applewood with a friend for Brooklyn Restaurant Week, and left super stuffed with delicious food. Everything we got was delish! They serve homemade bread with a variety of spreads, and both appetizers (the black bean soup and beet salad with ricotta cheese) were great! My friend's mushroom risotto was amazing, and I really liked my sea bass. And, the desserts were nothing to sneeze at either. Definitely going back despite the hour long commute from my apt!
