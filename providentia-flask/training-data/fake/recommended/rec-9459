Matadro combo was amazing with the rice and beans avocado salad and chicken! I would definitely go back! the sangria is amazing as well we had two pitchers when we went! The only reason I gave it four stars was because the service was a little off..not about the food because everyone i tasted was amazing..oh and the plantinos with the dressing was delicious as well!
