I was in Philly in Aug 07 for my sisters wedding and decided to check this place and Geno's which is across the street from Pats. This place is very quick . You order and in about 20 seconds your cheese steak appears. It was good but I let my cheese melt a little bit more because when they give it to you the cheese is not melted at all . You can get yours with cheesewiz but I love provolone.I was lucky to find parking as someone was pulling out when we arrived or it would have been a challenge.....Between Pats and Geno's....Geno's was better... Â  Both these places are better than those chain places they have around the country.. So if your ever in Philly try'em out
