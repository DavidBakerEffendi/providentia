As far as I'm concerned, there are only 3 restaurants in this part of LIC that are worthy of 5 stars: LIC Market, Cafe Henri, and (now) Casa Enrique! Props to the owners of Cafe Henri for getting this right. Some highlights of my meal were the TACOS and the MOLE. This was honestly the best mole I've ever had. I usually don't even bother ordering mole, because many people just can't get the flavor right. It's either too sweet or too bitter. Casa Enrique gets it right, with the perfect balance of savory, bitter, sweet, and complex chocolatey flavors. The fish and lengua tacos were also amazing, and I'm sure all of the tacos are. There doesn't seem to be anything extremely different about them, they're very simple, but they get all of the textures and details right, and I think this is how tacos should be. Honestly, everything here was a highlight. The only downsides are the space/decor, and slightly unpolished service. But I still stand by my 5 star review, because the food outweighs all of that.
