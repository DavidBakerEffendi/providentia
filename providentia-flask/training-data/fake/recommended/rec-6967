The other restaurant listed here is misspelled. It's Mamma, not Mama. I'll say up front that the food was very good, but there were some problems throughout my visit. It took more than a few minutes to get seated, despite no line. This was at 1 pm in the afternoon, so I figured I was coming in at the end of the lunch rush. No big deal. The look and feel are very nice -- no overwhelming music, nice simple decor, smell's great, seems clean, orderly. Service was one of my big issues. Had to ask for coffee refills. Got one. Didn't think to ask for bread, but other tables within earshot got it without asking. I didn't ask, didn't get. My party (of 2) was there for an hour and a half, one hour of which was simply waiting for the food. My food came out at least 3 minutes before my lunch partner's, and after waiting all that time, it was awkward to sit patiently and wait until his food had arrived to take a bite. It's the little things, people. That said, I got the split pea (soup of the day). Bread would have made it perfect. Soup was homemade, seemingly, and delicious. Great texture and flavor. I should say the soup came out within minutes of ordering, which is why I was perplexed about the next hour and 3 minutes of wait for the Rockefeller style personal stromboli special with an amazing tomato sauce on the side. The food, no question, is amazing. The service could use a bump in personality. That being said, the only reason I knew my service was especially bad was because I saw other people getting better service without effort. Go for the food, ask for the bread.
