hands down, my favorite mexican restaurant EVER. this is not your average mexamerican fare. it is an experience. as you can imagine from the name, their selection of tequilas is daunting, and their margaritas are delicious. the food is incredible, authentic, and plentiful. but i think my favorite part is the waitstaff. something about watching your margaritas come towards you balanced on your waiters head just adds to the evening. only drawback is that they don't accept reservations - at least they didn't when i was living in philly. but every time i'm back in philly we try to get there.
