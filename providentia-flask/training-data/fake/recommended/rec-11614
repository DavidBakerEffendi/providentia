Ok, just stop what you're doing and head over to Salt and Fat and order the pork belly buns RIGHT NOW. Do not deprive yourself  of one of life's great pleasures. The kimchi cucumbers really make these special. I'm about to make an unholy comparison: they're reminiscent of those pickles on the McRib. The little spicy acid from the cucumbers are a perfect complement!!! And I know you may be skeptical of someone who just referred to a McRib in his review,  but I think these were better than Momofoku's... The trotters were delightfully crispy. Do order. Don't ask what trotters are, just eat them. Trust me, would I steer you wrong? Yes, I would, but it's more fun that way. Then go with the oxtail terrine. Don't worry what's in that either. Just eat it, you won't regret it. The place is called SALT AND FAT. If you're not ready to have your taste buds tantalized and rolled in orgasmo food sex, then go away. Stop wasting everyone's time and just off yourself. Then order some more pork buns. There's a wonderful theme of down -home Southern style cookin' being molested by some brilliant Korean guy in the back. Every dish had an appealing grease factor, but a nice touch of bon chon or acid splash to cut it. Michelin, what the f*ck  are you doing? Give this place a star right now. If you don't, I'll switch my tires to Hankook. Is that what you want, a Hankook guide? Didn't think so. And I forgot to mention, they have BACON POPCORN! My only regret is that on many of the saliva-inducing dishes, I was excited to see poached eggs accompanying them. But when my eager fork split them open, I found the yolk wasn't very runny and too firm to make a beautiful dripping mess of everything. Get your ass to Sunnyside.
