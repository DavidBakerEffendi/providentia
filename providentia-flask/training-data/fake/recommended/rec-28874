Definitely a go-to spot on campus. In fact, going to Greek Lady is somewhat of an initiation ritual when one is accepted into Penn. One of my favorite dishes is the lamb gyro which is simply delicious. It is stacked high with lettuce, tomato, lamb, onion, and just the right amount of tzatziki sauce. Additionally, they put a few french fries inside which serves as a nice surprise in each bite. To accompany the gyro I always order, the crispy, perfectly-seasoned curly fries and what I consider to be the best milk-shake I've ever tasted. The milkshake is made form about a pint of ice cream and just the right amount of milk, making it silky smooth and creamy. Add to that a dollop of their freshly made whip cream and you have heaven in a cup. They satisfy my sweet cravings and in general are a good pick me up after any stressful day. In terms of the service, considering their high demand of orders especially after traditional class time, they are generally quick to serve you. The atmosphere is dependent on what time you go. the place itself is very nice, but on what I call rush-hour times the restaurant can get very noisy; however, I highly recommend Greek Lady as a casual place to hangout and pick up a good, affordable meal with friends.
