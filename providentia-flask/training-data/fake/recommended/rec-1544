The service is horrible, the lady that took our order at the window was incredibly rude, I would never go back based on this. As far as the sandwich goes I thought it was overpriced for what it was and not very tasty.  The steak was extremely greasy and not very flavorful, the bread seamed almost stale, the only good part was the cheese.  This place is just a tourist trap, they don't make the sandwiches fresh they simply scoop the meat from a pile of precooked meat and put it on your roll. I would recommend skipping this place and going somewhere where the food is good and the servers are not incredibly rude.
