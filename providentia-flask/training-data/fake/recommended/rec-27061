Portions are some of the most filling portions you can find! Not Just the pancakes are good, but the omelette's are also a great choice. Biggest selection of breakfast food around. (Pancakes anyway you could want them) Food is excellent, I usually get Chocolate Chip Pancakes and Bacon, or French Toast, and I have never been dissatisfied. This place is usually pretty busy, so expect a little bit of a wait, but it is worth it.
