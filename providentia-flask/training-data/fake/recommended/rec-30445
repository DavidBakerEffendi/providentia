I'm so in love with this place. Stop reading this review right now and just GO GO GO! They don't take reservations so you better just RUN. I think their menu changes periodically (maybe seasonally?). When I went for brunch, I tried: - Lamington stuffed with strawberries and cream ($3.50) - Coconut pancakes with fresh ricotta, mango salad and ginger-lime syrup ($11) - Tea-smoked salmon, spinach and poached eggs on toasted sourdough with yuzu hollandaise ($14) - side of quinoa hashbrowns ($4) The lamingtons (along with other yummy muffins and scones) were located on a little self-serve table at the front of the dining area. I was starving when I got there so I most certainly helped myself to a delicious lamington (sort of like a little yellow sponge cake sandwich with strawberries and cream) and TONS of their freaking amazing coconut butter as I waited for my food to come. Coconut pancakes were delicious. They had a somewhat cakey consistency with a delicious, crispy texture on the outside. They were definitely different from your traditional pancakes, and they came with these big pieces of candied coconut that tasted AMAZING with the ricotta, mango chunks and ginger-lime syrup. The smoked salmon was like a glorified eggs florentine - SO GOOD. It was probably the most smoky salmon I've ever had, and its intense flavor meshed incredibly well with the creamy, tangy yuzu hollandaise. Quinoa hashbrowns were verrrry different. They came in crispy, blackened squares and I think I even detected a little hint of spice..maybe cumin? Crunchy and delicious! Everything else on their menu sounds amazing too. Just go and share everything with your friends. It's definitely worth the 1 hour wait!!
