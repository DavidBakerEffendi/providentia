To me Lilies seems more of a bar than a restaurant. I came here tonight to celebrate my friend's 23rd birthday. The food was delicious. I had the salmon with mashed potatoes. A friend had gotten the mac and cheese. I tried some of it and It was also very delicious. The decorations were lovely with stained glass, chandeliers and artwork on the walls. My only complaint is that it gets very packed and was VERY loud. It was hard to reach the back of the bar, where the birthday dinner was set. Once seated, people kept bumping into my chair as they passed from how packed it was. I had also called the place earlier before dinner and the lady who asnwered only said "hello". I expected a 'Hello Lillies Establishment', so it had confused me into thinking I called a random person's phone and I felt it was a bit unprofessional. There was also a tv where baseball was being shown. I will most likely come here again one day but maybe for lunch and hopefully it will be less crowded then.
