Excellent cozy vibe here to my exit 164 taste. Loved the chicken liver and eggs with potatoes , which went well with my wake-up Six Point Resins...nice blended brunch/lunch menu, cute original space and a pleasant crowd..on par with The Hangar in Seattle for a top travel-for-brunch spot I will return!
