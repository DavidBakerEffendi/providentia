I love the atmosphere of this small French restaurant tucked away in Williamsburg but was not satisfied for what we came for -- crepes. They had a good array of crepes to choose from although they were lacking anything with strawberries and bananas. They just don't have strawberries at all which was disappointing. Ended up getting the pear and almond crepe with homemade chocolate. The chocolate was ehh-- nutella has spoiled me. The pear was a little mushy but still OK. The waitress had a cute French accent and was really sweet although we were only having takeout. The water they served us while waiting smelt like eggs and the guy who rang us up had to do the math incorrectly on a piece of paper. The bathrooms were charming tho -- postcards of France all over.
