Hummus is a good place to get a snack, especially if you like...hummus. The decor is decent, but most people take it to go.  While I dined in, it was a little difficult to maneuver around the lines to get more sauce or water.   The falafel was pretty good, and the hummus smooth.  The beet salad was good, even though I usually stay away from that type of dish.  The wholewheat pitas, however, I could eat all day.  Call me crazy, but the hummus and bread would have been enough for me. Although a bit on the pricey side for what you get, it is far better than going to the McDonald's on the corner.  :op For a quick snack (except during peak times), Hummus is a good change of pace from the usual fare.
