So worth the wait- been wanting to eat here forever and we finally had the chance to. They open for dinner at 5pm and we got there at 5:01pm and the line to get your name on the list was already out the door. We waited inside the entire time since it was freezing out. We were finally seated at around 6pm. We tried the pork buns and and the spicy ramen and original tonkatsu. Omgee everything was delicious!! We tried to order some buns to go but unfortunately, they don't do take out :( boo!!! The Mille crepe for dessert was the perfect way to end the meal!
