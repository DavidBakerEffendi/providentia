Guys, UWS is becoming really cool. I came here on a Saturday night and immediately liked the place. Cozy, just the right amount of light, not too crowded, music at a nice volume. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple glasses of wine and the leek and potato fritters and the chicken kebabs. Everything was great - it did get a little crowded on later in the night and so some of the other people there were a little grumpy and started hoarding chairs, but the waitresses and staff were stellar. Will definitely be back for dinner, drinks, etc
