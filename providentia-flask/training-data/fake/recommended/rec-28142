Great service and even better food. Menu is simple, but has variety. Sandwiches run $8-11. They have meat and cheese platters with an amazing selection.  I've eaten there on numerous occasions and have had take-out as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant is appropriate for a date or even a large group. Outdoor seating area is nice on a summer night. It's out in the back of the restaurant.  My only complaint is that the lighting outside is a bit dark. I had to use my cell phone to see the menu.
