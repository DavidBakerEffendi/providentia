I had lunch plans with my old pal Max... lunch with him generally means poached fish and lightly dressed greens, the type of fare that keeps his body looking soooo superior to mine. Somehow, after we lingered uselessly in the doorstop of Cafe Havana for ten minutes without so much as a greeting from an employee, I lured him over to Lombardi's where he shocked me by ordering an 18 inch gut-busting pie for us to share and two Cokes. 9 hours later, I'm still full! It was a near perfect lunch, and, as I am in the twilight days of being a New Yorker (7 days left to go!), I was happy to check out a place heralded as the best that there is. The crust is perfect, thin and smoky with carbon; the sauce and cheese are just the right consistency; and our chosen toppings (pepperoni, wild mushrooms and garlic spinach) proved to be a winning combination. The interior has the generically commercial look that is somehow/sadly exclusive to any ancient and staunch New York establishment... as if somehow all of the tourists have worn off any originality with their flashbulbs and fanny-packs. For all it's legend, Lombardi's resembles a strip mall pizzeria in central Illinois- checkered tablecloths, bright lighting and fountain soda machines. Service is "turn-and-burn". Place your order, the next time you see them is when they're dropping your check. But they do it with a smile, and there IS an hour long line at the door of patrons they're trying to accommodate, so all is forgiven.
