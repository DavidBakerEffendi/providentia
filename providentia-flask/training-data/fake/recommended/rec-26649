Finally checked out one of the neighborhood gems. The atmosphere was lovely for dinner. We celebrated our anniversary and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. It's a limited menu, but offers something for everyone. We had the lamb ragu as an app (so good) and beet salad. Both were great starters. Our main courses include duck breast and hanger steak and equally delicious. We finished with a chocolate gateau with peanut butter and cherry. So wonderful. With such an intimate dining experience, we expected the service to be a bit more attentive - which leads to my 4 out of 5 rating. Definitely recommend it!
