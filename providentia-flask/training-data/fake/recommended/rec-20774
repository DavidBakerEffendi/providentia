This was my first and last visit to The Spotted Pig. I went yesterday for lunch.  My 3 friends arrived before me by about 15 minutes and even though they were allowed to put their name down, they were not 'considered' for a table until we all arrived.  Whatever that means.  Anyway, the hostess reasoned that because she told the table before us 1.5 hours for a wait and there was a table sitting open big enough for the 5 of us, our wait would only be 30 minutes.  Fuzzy logic aside, we were seated a bit before the full 30 minutes and were met by our server who explained that 2 items were sold out (it was only 1pm and there were only about 6 items on the menu).  He also explained that the burgers would take about an hour to cook.  I'm not sure on what planet it takes an hour to prepare a burger especially for a restaurant with a maximum of 20 small tables. So we all placed our order and had some beers (a decent beer and wine list, I'll give place that).  Then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally all the burgers arrived.  Apparently, medium and medium rare temperatures equates to more or less raw and the hour it took to cook the burgers was not enough to make them hot or even warm.  Not good.  The taste of the burgers was a 5/10.  The cheese was overpowering and there was no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything to go on the burger.  Only one person at our table ordered something other than a burger- a salad.  It took even longer than the burgers to receive the salad which was unacceptable considering they had an hour to toss some greens together with goat cheese and dressing. Overall I'd say The Spotted Pig was overhyped and the service was poor.  You can find a better burger easily at hundreds of other restaurants throughout the city without an hour wait to be seated and an hour wait for your food.
