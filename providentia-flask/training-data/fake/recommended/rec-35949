Went there last night with my husband as a random date night. We were not in the mood to be fancy or to go crazy with our dinner plans, so room service came to the rescue. Ok so the most amazing thing about yhis place is their SERVICE!!! I mean i really wanna know what goes on in their kitchen so that food is on the table within 10min of ordering. And on top of it, food quality is not compromised. And drinks, wow!!! Is their bartender related to superman, how cn he make 2 drinks within couple of minutes of ordering them. So we started by ordering corn spring rolls and shrimp calamari. For drinks i had zeeda zaada( i have no idea wat it means) and my hubby had ginger mojito( so predictible). So the calamari and rolls were a little oily but prefectly done. Sauce on the side was amzing. Drinks were beyond expectation. I enjoyed every sip of it, so much so that i finished it before i wven ordered my main course. For entree, we ordered spicy basil noodles and room service pad thai. Their pad thai comes wrapped in thin egg white paper. My noodles were a little salty but spice level was perfect. My husband really enjoyed his pad thai too. For my second drink i had their detox something and my husband had mandarin mojito. Second round of drinks was just ok. In all i would say a great place to hv a good dinner if u r in a hurry but still want sit down dinner. And on top of it, that chandelier!!!!!
