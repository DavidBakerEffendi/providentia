August First cafe and bakery is a lovely place to sit down and enjoy an cup of coffee, something for breakfast and a nice conversation. seating is very comfortable the lighting is perfect- with morning sun rays shining down on you- its really quite nice. i will be back soon! a little pricey... but not bad
