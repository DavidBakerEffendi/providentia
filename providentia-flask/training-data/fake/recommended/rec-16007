This place is one of the finest Italian restaurants on the Upper East Side.  It has traditional Italian food along with it's special creations.  Their outside dining is not to be missed.  On hot and humid days that turn on their "split duct" air conditioner which - which is not even audible - creates a very comfortable dining experience.  Very romantic as well.   I love going here.
