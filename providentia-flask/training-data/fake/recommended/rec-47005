If the experience ended the way it started, this review would have been much lower. I made an 8 o'clock reservation for 7 people, a few of my guests arrived on time/early and were seated. Unfortunately, due to traffic created by a festival on South Street, my wife and I had to call the restaurant and tell them we would be a few minutes late. The restaurant then proceeded to tell the other guests that they needed to get up because we were not all there and wait outside, and they would get them another table when we arrived. Needless to say this was pretty embarrassing to my friends and very frustrating to me when I arrived a few minutes later, to me, that was an inexcusably rude way to handle the situation. Other than that, the only problem was being seated at the end of a table, where they threw an extra chair, and being constantly bumped into and having to move so people could get by...another result of overbooking. After the initial debacle with our table everything got better as the night progressed. The food was awesome, the service was very good and everyone enjoyed the evening. After getting the whole experience, I can only assume that this was indeed an exception for this place and not the rule, I worked in the restaurant business for a long time so I do understand that these nights happen. All in all I would absolutely reccomend the place...just make sure you don't go on a night when they overbook.
