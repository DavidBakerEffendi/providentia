More like 3.75 stars. My roommate and I biked over here tonight for dinner. Right outside was a bike rack which was super convenient. We got a seat right away but by midway through our meal the entire place was pretty full. Service was fine, friendly staff. I ordered a PBC Fleur De Lehigh...yummy. My roommate and I split the delicious Hefeweizen Hummus. The hummus was absolutely scrumptious. We didn't really care for the pita triangles, they were a little stale. But it also came with some chips which were soooo good. The cucumbers were super fresh and yummy, and the sumac was awesome. We then moved onto our sammies, We split the vegan Smoked Coconut Club which was pretty good. I couldn't taste any coconut at all though, so that was pretty disappointing. I also couldn't taste the tomato herb mayo. Sadness. The vegan bacon on it was awesome, though! The tofu was also cooked well. We also split the veggie burger, which I didn't care for that much [probably because Josh made us get Swiss cheese and I can't stand dat shit...] It was also pretty charred around the edges. Ah well, what can ya do. I slabbed some spicy mustard on it which was awesome. All in all we had a good time and I will absolutely be going back to try out more of the menu. They have so many good sounding dishes and I just want to experience them all! There was a good crowd there, everyone was very relaxed and just enjoying their time. Good stuff!
