Just stopped in yesterday to try the famed Bistro Burger. I was walking around the West Village and found myself standing in front of the Corner Bistro. "I'm hungry, I'm going to do this burger I've heard so much about...now." In I walk. I'm pleasantly surprised with the vibe. It doesn't look like a burger joint at all. It just looks like an old-school Village dive bar, full of locals of all shapes and sizes. I saddle up at the bar next to a guy named Eddie, who in is seventh decade of life is finishing his burger and sipping on a double of some fine amber spirit. Peter, the no-nonsense bar-tender in his fifties, who's singing a long to "Helpless" by Neil Young, ambles over and take my order for the house's signature burger...a cheeseburger with bacon and the works. I relax and read a bit and a couple minutes later one of the chef's comes out and sets a small plate in front of me with the enormous burger on it. The Burger....it is a gargantuan hunk of meat. It feel like it honestly might have been a half pound burger. At least a third of a pound. Nice soft bun. Slice of tomato, lettuce, and several strips of yummy crispy bacon. I hit it with a touch of ketchup and dive in. It's delicious. Medium-rare, juicy, tasty, and wonderful. Now that said, it's so big as to be unmanageable. As I bite into it, the burger is trying to escape the bun in every direction. After bite three, part of the burger unfastens itself and plops down onto the paper plate. Another bite and other piece of meat falls off. Now...the burger is so big, I still have plenty encased in the bun to satisfy my craving. After I finish what stayed in my hands, I cleaned up the remains that had dropped to the plate. Finally, the bill comes. $9. For the burger and a coke. Wow. In New York City, it's a steal. And I went in on a random Tuesday afternoon at 5 and the place was not crowded at all. Great atmosphere full of real people and of course....one of New York's best hamburgers. Reputation=EARNED.
