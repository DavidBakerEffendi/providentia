Was just visiting from Oakland and my friend took me here. I'm a big fan of Indian... when it's good. And this...THIS...was really good. It was really hot that day so, we ordered light but, ate like kings. First, it took forever but was totally worth it. Even after sweating for a half hour while waiting. But, it was clear the cook takes pride in her creations. As the presentation was classy and colorful. The shrimp masala was phenomenal! The naan was lightly crisped and they serve papad with chutneys to start. The proprietors were warm and generous with the rice! Highly recommended little joint. Worth the trek. Fair warning, there's only 5 tables so, plan ahead(?). Thumbs up!!
