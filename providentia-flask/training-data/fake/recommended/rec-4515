I adore Soul de Cuba. I am very proud to be able to say that in present tense. I have to admit that I was a little nervous seeing it again after having such fond memories of it from over six years ago. It was a little like seeing a long-lost friend: Has she aged well? Is she happy? Has she gotten fat? Yes, yes, and no. She is still absolutely fabulous, and doesn't even make you feel bad about it. A few weeks ago, I took some friends kind enough to host me in their new New Haven home, and it was so worthy of their hospitality! All three of us left happy with the experience, from service to food to drinks to flan. Get a mojito, get platanos maduros, get a flan, but most importantly, get a reservation!
