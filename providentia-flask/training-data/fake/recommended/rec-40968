I looooove it here. After moving back to Crown Heights, I quickly made my way over to the beloved Hot House on a Saturday for brunch. There's always a wait and the place is small so you should expect to wait outside. Don't forget to put your name on the board because that is how the host calls you when seats become available. As other yelpers have mentioned, you must try the hot chicken. I especially love to dip my chicken in the hot sauce they provide - it's more of a tangy bbq sauce and I'm pretty sure it's homemade. I love the creamy cheese grits, although the crispy grits are just as good. The corn cake pancakes are YUM. I also love love love the granola crusted french toast with bourbon peaches! The bacon potato salad is deliciously spicy. The service is superb. My only complaint is that this place is just too small for the demand. On my latest visit, the three of us were crammed into a two person table. A must try while in the Bed-Stuy area of Brooklyn!
