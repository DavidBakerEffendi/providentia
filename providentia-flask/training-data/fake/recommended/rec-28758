Attended the opening night soiree at Hu, and tasted a broad sampling of their offerings.  I'm no food snob by any means, and was doubtful such uber-healthy fare would please my palette.  But I was simply blown away by everything I had: from the grass-fed burgers on vegetable buns, spinach creamed with cashew cream, sweet potato tots, and chia seed pudding - All amazing!  Usually, one expects to make certain concessions when eating this healthy, both for taste and consistency, but not here.  Kudos to the chef.  The wine and coffee offerings were equally impressive.  And the space is fantastic: well thought out layout and decor, and plenty of upstairs seating (beautiful tree trunk tables).  Enjoy!
