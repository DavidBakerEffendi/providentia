I love 9th Avenue and I adored Room Service.  It seems like 9th avenue has become Little Thailand which is just fine with me.  And Room Service was EXCELLENT thai food served in a really fun, quirky environment.  Great date place.  Great place to go with friends.  So many appetizers make for good/fun sharing, and everything was delicious.  I'm not a drinker but the drink menu almost made me change my mind.  Girls night out!?
