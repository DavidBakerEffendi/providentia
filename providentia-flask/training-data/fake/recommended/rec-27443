Went here on a Friday Night for dinner and drinks.  AMAZING! For appetizers, we ordered the arugula salad, scallops and bacon covered dates.  My husband enjoyed his scallops very much and I scarfed down my salad and dates.  We ordered the ribs, which came with grits and greens.  The ribs were boneless and so tender, just the way I like them.  Afterwards we went upstairs to get a few drinks.  The music is awesome, the waitstaff are on it and very friendly.  We will definitely be dining and hanging out here more frequently.
