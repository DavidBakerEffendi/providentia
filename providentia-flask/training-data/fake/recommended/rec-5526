I'm really sad about the Margherita being so watered down. I really love Cafe Lift and have been a major supporter for years. For some reason Prohibition and Bufad have missed the mark. I tried the burrata and it was good, if not overpowered by the salty seasoning. I tried the escarole and similar to the Margherita the tomato sauce just doesn't pack a punch. You barely taste any flavor. No thanks. I'll continue to support Lift but I'll pass on Bufad and Prohibition.
