Love that soft-shell crab. They put a sign in the window to indicate that they're in season. These are really worth getting. An order has 2 crabs and was $16, I think. The barbecue stuff is also excellent. It's pretty dingy inside. The prices are great. When I went, the service was pretty friendly.
