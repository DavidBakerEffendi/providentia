We went to dinner here because of the high rating it received on Yelp. It lived up to the expectation. Very cozy, warm and friendly service. Our server was so pleasant and nice. We started with salad/scallop special and then had the gnocchi and the ravioli. All were excellent. You also can't beat $5 glasses of wine.
