The family and I were hanging out at Chelsea Market when we stumbled upon Old Homestead Steakhouse.  I was two seconds from trying their $50 Kobe hamburger, then I pulled out my trusty Iphone with the Yelp app.  Lo and behold, Corner Bistro was .2 miles away.  Despite the blistering wind that day, I made the executive decision to hike a few more blocks to Corner Bistro for their infamous burgers, not to mention they were 90% cheaper.  Plus I had the intention to visit the Shake Shack the same day.  Got there and the dining room was packed and we were the 3rd group in line.  I saw the broiler that they cook the burgers on was filled to capacity.  I can only assume that the burgers had a high turnover ratio so they had to pre-cook them in order to keep up with the demand.  I came to this realization after receiving my burger only 3 minutes after I put my order in. Now the burger......  Huge and tasty.  I was really impressed that the burger was so huge and lacked the slight toughness most burgers of the magnitude usually contain.  I also noticed that the burger was not piping hot.  But GREAT none-the-less.  I could have waited an extra 20 minutes to have a fresh burger, but since the place is tiny and people are usually in-n-out, I can understand.
