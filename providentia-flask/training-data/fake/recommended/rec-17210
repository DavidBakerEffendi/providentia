Review for lounge only: Nice, relaxed atmosphere, almost elegant type look. Lots of seating in a nice looking space. Crisp couches, candles, small bar. Upstairs from the Halcyon dining area. (Weirdly connected to Egan's on the inside which has a totally different casual bar feel to it. wth?) Yet to try the dining.
