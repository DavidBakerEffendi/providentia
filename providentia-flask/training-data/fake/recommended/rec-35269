From the outside it is difficult to tell just how bustling and noisy this place is. We were seated at table 22 which came with a nice whiff of the ladies room. The menus are a simple sheet of paper with a list of standard pizza toppings. The food itself wasn't bad but not a place I would seek out in the future.
