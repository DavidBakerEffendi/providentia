CASH ONLY!! I grew up in Taiwan and came to US at age 26 in 2000 so I'm old-style Taiwanese. Today, I went there to see what they have to offer that are truely Chinese and just realized that they only accept cash when I got there. With only $13 cash with me, I ordered the Special Pork Shop Over Rice (正宗台灣排骨飯) to go.  I finished the pork chop during my drive back to work!! it just smell so good and also taste as the way I like it. It comes with plenty of spinch and bean sprout and some minced pork sauce. Not exactly the version I had when I was in high school but a healthier version. (The minced pork sauce doesn't seem salty at all maybe just because the pork chop has heavier flavor. ) So it passed my first trial and I will definitely go back again with more cash when I have a chance. :) Four star just because I only tried one dish and not sure about other dishes.
