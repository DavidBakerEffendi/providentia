Best beef tendon and fish ball soup I've ever had! Ok, honestly first time I've never had either of them. Very good. The hand drawn noodles are much more substantial than what you find at a typical Chinese restaurant. Small place, so don't be surprised if you get doubled up at a table with other patrons already seated/eating. Actually adds to the atmosphere. The service is very good as well, you're seated quickly and have your bowl of noodles in minutes. The guy next to us had the seafood noodle bowl with clams, scallops, and I believe mussels. Can't wait to go back and try that one.
