Yum Yum! Ate here on a Friday and have blueberry pancakes (per the recommendations) and I promise I had to stab them to keep them from floating to the ceiling. And goodness the prices are very low.  It is a great place to people watch, or better yet strike up a conversation. They also had my pineapple juice that was great.  So glad my tummy told me to grab a bite here.
