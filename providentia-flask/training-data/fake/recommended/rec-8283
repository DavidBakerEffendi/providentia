I went to Grimaldi's years ago and it was delicious. Recently i went back after spending a day at Brooklyn Bridge park and i was very disappointed. There was a 45 minute wait on line outside, then we were stuffed in a corner, the service was very rushed. Then I'm told they don't take cards and i had to go searching for an atm because theirs was out of service. The pizza was just ok. I think it has just became to popular. I won't be back.
