5 stars because they deserve it! Yuca bar is full of lively people. An Awesome Happy Hour, Monday - Friday from 1-8pm. Frozen Margaritas a must-have! Servers are very pleasant and attentive. I saved the best for last....the food!.....you will not be disappointed. Chips and GUAC on deck! Move on the delicious tapas! Or have yourself the delicious Yuca Burger! Just check out the photo. Not the place for a romantic, intimate experience as it tends to get crowded and very loud. Often times, there's a wait for a table but worth the wait. If you've never been...GO! If you've already been...GO AGAIN!
