THE BEST CURRY ANYWHERE! Based on solely what I have ordered, this restaurant is 5 starts A++++++.  If you go, order the Peneang Curry, it is hands down the best.  It's curry made with peanut and since you can order the spice to your liking, it is always perfect.  Literally, I eat it, and then I dream about it for a week.  I think about waking up in the middle of the night and eating what's left in my fridge.  Or for breakfast if no one is watching.   And, they serve a great selection of fresh veggies with whatever you order.  The red curry is also great.   However, my husband tried the fresh spring rolls once and they were weird and not enjoyable.  Also, some of their other dishes are good, but not as good as their curry.   The restaurant is tiny, but I  have never had to wait.  Maybe I'm just lucky.  CASH ONLY!
