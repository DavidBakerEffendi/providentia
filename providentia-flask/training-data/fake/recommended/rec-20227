For the record my sister and I are the "black folks" Richard D was commenting on in his early december 2010 review of Tasty Noodle Shop...lol, I had to chuckle when I read the review and I thought to myself, that's dude we sat next to that didn't get his dumplings and was mad they didn't pour any of us tea!!! Hahahha, big up for poppin my Yelp cherry Rich!! Anyway on to the comida(cuban/black for ur information! Lol): Anybody on here complaining about service needs to be chin checked. Its not that serious! We're lucky we gettin those sexy black and red bowls to eat out of. I've tried the beef noodle and shrimp noodle. Love them both but honestly, the duck noodle has some incredible broth! Though I suspect the duck flavor has sumthin to do with it! Pick a noodle size and go to town! Want a soda or corona? Get it yourself out the fridge. Parking stinks so be very calculating when coming to get ur noodle fix. Place is small maybe seats 18, so leave the crew at home and just bring ur trusty foodie friend! Best 10 bucks you'll ever spend on a massive bowl of good stuff!
