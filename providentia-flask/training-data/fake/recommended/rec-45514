I went to Frankford Hall on a Saturday night - just as it was starting to get cold here in Philly. If you haven't been yet, don't worry, Frankford Hall has both an indoors and outdoors section so it will still be open. Having said that, I think there is something special and fun in hanging outdoors with friends, around the fireplace or heat lamps - the vibe of the beer garden is alive! My friends and I got there relatively early, around 7 pm. While you might think this seems a little too early, trust me, you want to get there no later than 8 pm because the place really fills up, especially on weekends. We started off with a giant pretzel and cheese spatzle with caramelized onions to share. Both dishes were your typical comfort food, great tasting but nothing too unique. I then got the Classic Burger, which comprises of a beef patty and cheddar cheese. Again, it was your usual burger, a solid option but nothing too special. The best part though, is the curry ketchup that you can get from self-serve pumps. They went perfectly with the fries (or on the burger if you please). To finish off, I had the Grapefruit Hefeweizen. It tasted like hard juice, and I could just keep drinking it all day. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves cider - this is just the grapefruit version of your typical hard cider! My friends and I also split the seasonal (pumpkin!) spiked shake. While this was sweet and very much a fall drink, I do not recommend getting one by yourself because it is pretty rich and might get too sweet after a while. My friends and I just chilled around the beer garden for the night, playing Jenga and catching up. There are also ping pong tables around, and the whole place was alive with activity!
