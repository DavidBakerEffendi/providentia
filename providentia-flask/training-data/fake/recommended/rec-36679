Went here at about 4 am on Friday night, sat morning.  The line was around the block!  I was thinking is this place really worth standing in line this long.  Well I finally found out.  The meat was really tender and juicy.  But the best part was the HOT sauce.  Everyone warned me about it, I tried to be very easy with it, but a lot poured out!  It was SO hot, and I am used to heat!  I loved it. I wish I knew what they put in it so I could make some at home!
