Had dinner here.  Thought the food was alright.  I didn't order from the gluten-free menu, but that seems to be a big draw here.   In terms of their regular menu, it was ok.  I had the steak dish which was good, if not average.  The pasta dish, one with seafood, was good as well.  Overall, I think it's a bit pricey for what it is, especially if you aren't getting the gluten free items.
