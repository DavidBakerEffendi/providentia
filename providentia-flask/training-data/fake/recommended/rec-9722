After looking up the restaurant on Yelp and seeing all of the beautiful photos of the view, I had to come and try the place out! It's inside a biotech building right on the FDR. When we walked inside the building, it felt like being in a different city like San Francisco rather than New York because it was over looking the water, away from all of the chaos of the city. They have a simple menu, with a lot of varieties of seafood. We got a dozen of oysters: both east coast and west coast. They were both really good, fresh and firm. We also got the baby octopus, salmon tartare, and the avocado himachi. The baby octopus was grilled perfectly, and had a bit of the char from the grill coated on the skin; when you but into it, it had the rubbery consistency but also had a little crunch to it. The avocado himachi was also delicious and plated beautifully. For the entrees, we got the dorade, squid ink pasta, and ravioli. The pastas were good, but a small portion is more than plenty if you're ordering appetizers. I ordered the dorade and was also impressed. It hardly had any bones, and retained a lot of juice from the fennel that was packed inside when cooked. It was the whole fish, and so I couldn't finish all of it, so I would recommend getting smaller appetizers with that dish. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating. We Â were running about 15 minutes late and they had no problem. I would recommend coming here for a date, with family or friends!
