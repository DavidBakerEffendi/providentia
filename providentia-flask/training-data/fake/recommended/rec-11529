I came here for Restaurant Week 2013 last night, and I'm still irked by the unacceptable service I received last night. Riverpark's menu is great for RW because they let you choose mostly everything off of their menu, with some choices having a price supplement. No big. I ordered the Sweet Corn Panna Cotta (mediocre), Mozzarella (very yummy), Squid Ink Pasta (my favorite part of the meal, very lemony and light with the cilantro), Trout (was ok) Dorade (a big portion of fish, very fresh) and the Chocolate Mousse (underwhelming, would pass). Here's the kicker - my appetizer portion squid ink pasta came out at the same time as my husband's fish entree. Then came the dessert about 30 minutes later, my entree no where in sight. When I inquired with my waiter where my entree was, he says "I took the liberty of packing it up for you to go, I hope you don't mind." Why yes actually, I do mind. Another thing that really bothered me was that there was a tiny little mouse roaming outside on their terrace. Not what you want to see when you're eating your meal. So basically I ate my fish cold at home because Riverpark doesn't know how to treat customers. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
