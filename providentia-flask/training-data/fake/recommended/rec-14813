This restaurant is AMAZING. I had a vegan philly cheese steak - the bread was so light so the sandwich didn't feel too heavy.. and the soy steak/ nutritional yeast cheese were perfect! For dessert I had coconut cake - moist, DERRICIOUS. If I go back to Philly, I will go out of my way to come back here.
