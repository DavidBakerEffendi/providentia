This place is AMAZING! The best food of Philly! I love everything but especially the basil crab red pepper potato thing for the appetizer. The only issue I have is that I am from PDX and have a wee bit snobby attitude for coffee. Their coffee is awful--you can taste that the machine needs to be cleaned. If they fixed that I think this restaurant would be one of the best in the country. You cannot go wrong! Plus its BYOB so its dirt cheap for what you get.
