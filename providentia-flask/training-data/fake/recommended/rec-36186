Was shocked, but happy to get in with no wait on the Sunday night during the long weekend. Started with grilled octopus which was very flavoerful, then moved on to a perfectly done medium-rare steak with my favorite sauce.  Chose a nice Chateau-du-pape bottle...finished up with amazing cheese...all good.  Our waiter was great and my friend enjoyed carrying conversation with him in French.   Great ambiance, food, and service as before...
