I was here on a date night at 8pm on a Thursday, and we only had a little bit of wait, and the staff kept us updated and let us look at the menu. We sat at a high-top table along the wall. The place is cozy inside, but not cramped, and the noise level was lively but not too loud. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was good but could have been stronger. We ordered your classic tapas dishes: patatas bravas, garbanzos fritos, gambas al ajillo, and some scallops. The food was tasty and, as a side note, it was monochromatic :) This place is definitely a great spot for dinner if you're in the neighborhood.
