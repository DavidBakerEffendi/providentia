Came back for Winter RW 2013. So happened my brother is visiting from Asia and I decided to bring him here to celebrate his belated birthday dinner. Again for RW, Riverpark offers the entire menu with some supplements. Between the three of us, we had the crab fondue, baby octopus and some pasta dish for appetizer, then we had the ribeye & brisket, berkshire pork loin and steamed branzino, and lastly for dessert, we had the chocolate souffle, beer sundae and date pudding. My fav dish was the beer sundae and pork loin. I have to say nothing here disappoint and I love every dish i had here. Ahh amazing restaurant, it just gets better and better!
