Best cheese steak! I prefer this place over Pats any day. I ordered a "whiz, witout", which means cheese whiz without onions. The bread is a little crunchier and the whiz is nice and cheesy! Even with a huge line this place is quick. Eating here is like eating a piece of history. Ben Franklin would be proud.
