My friends and I met up around 7pm on a Sunday night and there was no wait at all. Usually the lines are super long for brunch. I ordered the arugula with chicken meatballs. The meatballs were extremely moist and very savory but the arugula was a bit bland since they only added shredded pericono cheese and a bit of olive oil. My friend got the Brie with apple sandwich and it was divine. The whole thing was perfectly moist and extremely delicious. The ambience was homey and very relaxed. Great place to catch up with friends!
