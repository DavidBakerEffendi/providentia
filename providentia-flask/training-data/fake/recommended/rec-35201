When doesn't Tonkatsu curry sound good? I pretty much love katsu anything. --Panko makes everything taste good. :) The hubs said that outside of Japan, this is one of the best he's had. The most common offense I find is that Japanese restaurants often serve pre-frozen katsu. Not fresh. Just the same inferior katsu from the same supplier. This obviously hand breaded meat, was a nice surprise. Perfect fried goodness. I ordered the oyako donburi, which translates to parent/child. --Chicken cooked in a broth with raw egg on top. The egg whites cook from the heat of the chicken but the yolk is left runny, covering the chicken and making the broth creamy. Â That's what keeps me coming back for more. It was a deep bowl and yet I ate every bite of it. Service was mediocre. I asked for water with my food. Had to ask a couple of times before I received it, despite my husband's drink being immediately delivered to him. However, once his coke ran out, no one ever checked to see if he needed/wanted another. I'd most definitely return. Mediocre service wouldn't keep me away. :)
