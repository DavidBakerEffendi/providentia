We were driving around the area and looked at yelp to find a good place to eat. Sabor Unidos had 5 stars so we decided to eat here and we are so happy that we did.  The  restaurant was cue and homey and the food was excellent. We ordered the BBQ combo for two with the top Sirloin and the whole Chicken,  We also had the fired yuca and boiled vegetables. The flavor was amazing on the meats and the yuca was amazing. I can't wait to come back. In addition the  restaurant is family run and we recieved great service and attention. This restaurant is work all of its 5 stars!
