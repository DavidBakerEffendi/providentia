After being educated by the locals on where to get a good cheese steak and to order a "whiz with", we headed over to Sonny's.  I have to say the service was terrible, but the cheese steaks were phenomenal.  So if you don't mind bad service and you're not sure where to go, then Sonny's Famous Steaks is your spot.  Just be prepared to get your hands dirty, because their cheese steaks are dripping with flavor.
