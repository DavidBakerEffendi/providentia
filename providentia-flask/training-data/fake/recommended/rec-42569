The bartender made this place the best experience for me.  My family and I discovered this place in Philly while we were looking for a nice restaurant to celebrate.   You know a good restaurant if they have a good bartender and a good bartender that attends to your needs without you having to ask.   I had the cuban sandwich which was awesome, guacamole was excellent as well, the bartender continued to refill my moms margarita all night!  Great service, great food, nice place for a evening out but nothing too formal!
