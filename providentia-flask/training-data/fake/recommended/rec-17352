Overall good ramen but a bit Americanized. Wasn't over the top fusiony but definitely not completely traditional ramen. The menu also has several pages of appetizers and small meals, of which the pork buns were perfect and amazing. However the price and the ridiculous lines set the expectations very high that street food cannot really meet. With an add on of pork belly or one of the other options it can be over 20 a ramen easily. And waiting over an hour is absurd (despite the nice feature of texting you when your table is ready). The ramen bowls all have different veggies included depending on the flavor which was interesting but none were too full and some of the broths were mediocre. Overall though the flavors were good and if the wait and price was less it would be an excellent place. 3.5 stars.
