Flew in from Chicago and some friends took us here for dinner. We really enjoyed this dinner with our friends. The craft cocktails were really great. We got 4 pizzas for the four of us to share: Bianca, Brussel Sprouts, Quattro Formaggi and the Funghi Rustico. They were all delicious. We also had a dessert pizza: Pizza alla Nutella. So amazing!! Our wait person was very nice. The atmosphere was perfect. It was casual but you certainly didn't feel like you were at some fast food place. It was a *nice* pizza place!
