This is one if my favorite cafes in the city. I make it my routine to stop by here with a book for a nice meal whenever I visit Manhattan. In a city full of very tiny spaces, most of which are partly below ground level, Cafe Sabarsky really stands out. With its super high ceilings and very tall windows thus is one cafe where you can actually eat at a table by the window. The ambience is extremely pleasant.   There is often a long wait during peak hours.  But just before or after the rush, I've never waited more than five minutes.   The food is delicious as well and the portions are just right where you can tickle your palette without falling into a food coma. Amazing desserts as well.
