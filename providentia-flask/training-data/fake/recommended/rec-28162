I came here a while back with my father for lunch so I don't remember exactly what I had. I never had cold soup before, so I decided to try it. It was interesting, but not something I would get again. I also got a sandwich, which I remember being very fresh and the spread on the bread (I don't remember what it was) was AMAZING, which made the whole sandwich great.
