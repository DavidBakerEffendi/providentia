Stopped in spur-of-the-moment for lunch October 15, whatta find!  Delicious food, we sat outside on the patio, can't believe more people weren't there.  Absolutely delicious, the chef sent out a fantastic zucchini fritter type thing for a starter as a gift, we loved it!  Free (delicious) nan, wonderful Rogan Josh, black bean Dal, 6 dishes total, and my friend and I left satisfied and impressed.  Great deal, too, considering we had 2 apps and 4 other dishes, and the bill only came to $21!  Will definitely be back.  YUM
