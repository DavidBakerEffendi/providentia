The Smith is an East Village staple. If you haven't been yet, GO! I live a block away and whenever I'm unsure of where to eat, I go to the Smith. I've been over 10 times and it's always been pleasant. The waiters are always polite and extremely attentive. They food is delicious and the presentation is wonderful. I also really like the portions here. The place is almost always full. The crowd is pretty eclectic. My only complaint is how difficult it can be to get seated for Sunday brunch. The restaurant's decor is very cozy and easy on the eyes. Also, If you're a Martini person, try "The Dirty Jane." It's amazing!!!!
