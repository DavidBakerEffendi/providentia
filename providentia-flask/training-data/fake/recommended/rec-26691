VIsited McCrossens for the first time last night.  Out with my date for a few drinks and the bartender Jamie was incredibly personable and helpful.  Great recommendations for the beer and wine, great service - made us feel like one of the regulars.   Will definitely be back again very soon - hopefully I'll become one of the regulars
