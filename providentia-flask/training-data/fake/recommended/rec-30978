Went here twice on a date and with friends and both times the service was great.  They have a beer and wine selection and their specialty is brick oven pizza.  They and a great special of pizza and beer for $15 that they offered that sounds very reasonable.  The first time we went, we ordered the garlic mushroom pizza that had way too much garlic on it.  The second time we were there, they changed their menu and the sausage pepper pizza I ordered was perfect.   Prices are around $12-15 for a pizza and the salad appetizer reminds me of a variation on bruscetta served in a jar with bread which was really unique and delicious.  My friend had the 3 pasta dishes for $30 which seemed a little skimpy on the portion.   Otherwise great place, great location on the river and good beers.  Would recommend for anyone looking to get out of the city for a change or a pit stop after a long run/bike ride along Kelly.
