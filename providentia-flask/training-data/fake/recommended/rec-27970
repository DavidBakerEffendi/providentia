I first came here as a 17 year old. I remember it being a small, fun place with amazing mussels. I returned 10 years later for a bachelor party dinner last night, and absolutely nothing has changed. The women running the joint were incredibly friendly, and made everyone feel like they were members of a family. The atmosphere of the restaurant is small, old fashioned, and wonderful, like something out of the 1950s. As we walked in (and throughout the course of the night), about 6 different people spoke with our group and congratulated the groom on his wedding- that's the charm of old South Philly neighborhoods that Bomb Bomb exudes. I sampled a slew of appetizers (including my much beloved mussels), and they were all excellent. The mussels were as good as I remembered. For the main course I ordered the ribs and chicken combo, and was incredibly satisfied. The ribs were the best I've had outside of Texas. The prices were very fair I'd say, and the drink selection was just fine. The only small let down was the Bomb Bomb lager, but that was such a minor thing it really doesn't register with me. Bomb Bomb is excellent. Even if it's not everyone's thing, it's worth a trip, especially for visitors to the city or first time residents, to see what old fashioned South Philly neighborhood culture is like.
