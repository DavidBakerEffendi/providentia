My boyfriend and I just tried this place recently and LOVED it. We have some "go-to" breakfast places locally, and this one is now at the top of the list. We tried them on Easter morning, so were surprised that they were even open for the holiday. Everyone was very friendly and the food was great! We ordered quite a few items, some with 'interesting' specifications, and they got our entire order correct. That's important to us because sometimes we get home with our food and realize several items are missing. It's so frustrating because who wants to go back for their missed items when the rest of the food will get cold?! All of the food was good. My boyfriend went there for breakfast again this am and teased me by sending me a photo of his blueberry bagel with cream cheese. He said the second time was just as good, so we are repeat customers for sure :)
