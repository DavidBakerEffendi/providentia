Pretty good hotpot place, cheap compared to Queens or Manhattan. Â We first had a mando waiter but then they noticed we didn't speak mando well and they had a cantonese lady wait on the table. That was a nice touch, in other places around 8th ave it's mando or point at the menu items. :) We brought some friends and the service didn't feel rushed at all. The cuddlefish was the best part and the ingredients were fresh and the place is well lit and not overlay loud. Good for gatherings.
