I am never not excited to go to Vanessa's. They have the best duck sandwiches here (they make the bread right in front of you!) and it is dirt cheap. Their dumplings are good and their bubble tea is refreshing and sweet. Vanessa's isn't health food- every time I eat here I feel like I've eaten some kind of greasy burger (that tastes better than your usual greasy burger). But if you want something greasy and filling, this is the place for you. Final note, the place gets pretty packed, and there's not a lot of seating.
