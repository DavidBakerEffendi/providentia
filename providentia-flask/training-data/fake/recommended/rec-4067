LOVE THIS PLACE. I ate here with my roommates on a chilly Saturday morning.  We live about a block away, so the convenience of this place is awesome. You know how you usually hate waiting for a table at Denny's or IHOP?  I loved the wait at Tom's.  They serve you cookies, coffee, fries with "secret sauce," orange slices....   I ate lemon ricotta pancakes with beef sausage and lemon.  Mmmm.... Vanitha had blueberry/mango/walnut pancakes.   The fact that they give you strawberry butter, cinammon butter, and lemon butter is soo great... you can bring it home with you and use it for your own dishes!! The owners are fabulous and sweet and I highly recommend this place.
