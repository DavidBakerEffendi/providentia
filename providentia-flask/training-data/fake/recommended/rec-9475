Pio Pio is a really solid Peruvian restaurant that's easy to miss from the street. It has a small dining area an bar on the street level flowing into a larger dining area on the lower level. They have very good Lomo Soltado and sangria. Service is usually very quick one your seated. It can get loud in the lower dining area when it's busy - something to keep in mind.
