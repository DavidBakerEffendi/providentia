My philosophy to writing reviews is simple. You can't write one on a place unless you have been there more than once. So what do you do when every time you visit someplace, it gets better? Habana Outpost might be the best kept secret in New York, although it is not to native Brooklynites. We go there all the time. What more could you ask for in your local eatery? Great food? Check, with the reinvention of the corn on the cob. I have tired to duplicate and its not the same. I barely like corn and I can't stop eating it! Good Drinks? Only the best mojito I have ever had! Ask anyone who has had it and they will tell you it is the best summer cocktail in NYC. Outdoor seating? Check. If you are single and looking to mingle, it features the most beautiful black people that Fort Greene has to offer. Talk about food for the eyes and taste buds What about the environment? Got that covered too! They are a eco-friendly restaurant. My usual order: the INFAMOUS Corn of the Cob, sweet plantains and a mojito. LOVE IT! On Sundays, they show free movies. They do community events like a haunted house for the kids during Halloween. And at night, their downstairs turns into a lounge/club spot. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.
