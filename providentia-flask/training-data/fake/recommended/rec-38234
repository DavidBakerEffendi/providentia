In New Haven there aren't too many places downtown to get good greasy American food and fair-priced beers.  So odds are, if you're someone who likes this sort of thing, you're one of the 50 gazillion people at Rudy's at any moment. I used to go here because of the consistently good food.  Unfortunately, the consistency has been declining, but when they're on they're on.  The food can be great. I guess the staff has become complacent since they realized their new location wasn't going to destroy their business.  Incidentally there's a palpable apathy from the moment you step inside.  If you're from New Haven you're probably used to this, so go pull up a stool and enjoy the famous frites! (except for the 30% of the time that they're old).
