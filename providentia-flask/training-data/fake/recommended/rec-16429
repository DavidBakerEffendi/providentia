Happened by the line of people waiting to order their take-out and immediately figured I should stop by and give it a try. Glad I did - I got the large lobster bisque which tasted great. And I was surprised to see it came with a loaf of bread and an apple. All for $5.50 - pretty good deal for Midtown!
