LOVED this place for lunch yesterday with a few girlfriends. Atmosphere was super relaxed (minus the waitstaff which is why I am giving this 3 stars - they were sooo pushy and why? there were 3 other tables IF THAT!) and enjoying our time. I felt pressure to order and leave as quickly as we did walking in...DO NOT RUSH CUSTOMERS WHEN YOU HAVE 3 TABLES!! aside from feeling super rushed, the mushroom platter, meatballs and mixed salad were very tasty. I am 1/2 Spanish and this is as close to Spain (minus Despana which I need to try) as it gets for me.
