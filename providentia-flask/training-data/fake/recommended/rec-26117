The food here is wonderful and the atmosphere is really delightful in that countrified, pseudo-pastel, step-out-of-the-city way -- a bit like Marlow, but cutesier.  I was already full from a spinach-artichoke appetizer, so I couldn't quite finish the ginormous curried chicken salad I ordered, but that's okay, because it tastes damn good.  And because it's cash-only, Penelope isn't plagued by business meetings the way just about everything else within five blocks of the New York Life Insurance building is. Guys, you might be interested in the fact that when I went here for lunch the other day, THE ENTIRE CLIENTELE WAS FEMALE.  I'm not joking.  Really not joking.
