My boyfriend and I were wandering around Chinatown with a few hours to spare, and two rumbling tummies.  Good ol' Yelp directed me here for soup noodles, and I sure am glad I listened! This place is kind of small, on a small dirty street (why do Chinatowns always insist on being dirty?  I don't understand it).  It's fine inside though...no-frills, very unassuming.  We ordered two niu rou mian, and I don't know if it had just been too long since my last asian meal, or if it really was that good, but I thought the noodles were delicious (great texture), the broth was a little light (I like it that way anyways), the beef was tender...and it was so cheap!  I'll have to go back and try it again, but first impression was wonderful. I originally gave this place a 4 (but really it was more like a 3.5)...because given how much pride all of my asian NYC friends have about NYC foods, though--I would think I'd be able to do better.  It's not the best asian food we've had in the city, but it's solid...I'm thinking between 3 and 3.5 stars.
