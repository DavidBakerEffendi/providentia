You could never guess that this type of place actually exists in the middle of the most touristy place in NY. Â It's tiny the seats run out quickly so it's always best to get there @ 5 PM when it opens. I like sitting at the bar and just watching the crowd and kitchen at work. They have a good balance of food items and sake; thank God they are not overpriced. This place keeps it real and the food is solid. You cannot go wrong with ordering anything off the menu. Not sure what it is about this place but it's definitely a cool spot to hang out, grab couple of cold beers or hot sake and talk about life and things.
