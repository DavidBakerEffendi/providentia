Start with sangria and end with sangria, you will enjoy everything in between. Sunday Funday or Happy Hour-- Yuca hits the mark. This is where Tapas is at its best... on the east side. The ambiance itself reminds me of a tapas dish, yummy warm colors and festive vibes; makes me think of a charming place off the coast, but alas, it's not off the coast of anywhere but Ave A and 9th St. I would come here on all occasions... great place to start if you plan on venturing out in the east village (be mindful of Yuca's intake, may wait for a table with large groups but it will be worth it). Tasty tasting size dishes are the best for groups--a little bit of this a little bit of that is the Spanish/Latin trademark and this follows suit. Must Haves: cubano sliders, platano relleno, crab cakes, albondigas, espresso bbq ribs & spicy shrimp... among many, many others. Dig in and enjoy the fiesta vibes!
