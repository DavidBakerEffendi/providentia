I only wanted to write a review because there were so many bad ones that I worried about my choice to take the ferry over and spend an entire Saturday here. I must say I'm so glad I stuck with the plan. Went early with a bunch of friends on Saturday. We got a table up top around 12:30. The crab bites and calamari were delicious. Calamari always seems like such an easy staple but it can often end up rubbery. This was super crispy and lovely. I got the antarctic king crab roll. So incredible. All three of us who ate it were very happy. The friends with the Jonah crab roll reported that ours were significantly better. We paid our bill and moved downstairs to spend the rest of the afternoon drinking. The place definitely has some odd rules. If you want to have friends coming and going you cannot keep a table. This is pretty normal and not the end of the world. The bar downstairs is cash only, no pitchers. We got around this when we ran out of cash by buying drinks upstairs and bringing them down. No problem. Bathroom situation is not great. There are two stalls for the entire place so often we had a line. The porta potties in the backyard were disgusting. All in all. We spent a fortune but had a blast running all over the place. The backyard is an awesome spot to spend a weekend afternoon. Kids are everywhere but that didn't stop us from getting silly. I recommend spending some time here.
