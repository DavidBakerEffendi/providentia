Stopped here on a whim after my lovely bachelorette. After a night of drinking, a good breakfast was in order. We had a group of 6 and arrived at the height of the brunch/lunch rush. We only had to wait 10 minutes. Everything was wonderful - the fun decor, great servers, and incredible food. I had the breakfast sandwich - beyond delicious. The prices are so reasonable for such amazing food. We will definitely be back!
