This gay friendly restaurant is decorated so wonderfully you almost don't care about the food. Warning though that I am biased. Whoever the owner is, my style is very similar, i.e. fabulous... but not everyone can handle fabulous.   The food is solid. I was so afraid that the decor was compensating for bad food, but it's not.  It's solid for Thai, nothing over the top amazing, but a consistent performer.  It is a little loud, particularly on the typical Th-Sat set, where people are actively looking for a cool place with atmosphere to unwind.   I give it 4 stars, because if i am looking for a place to bring out of town friends for food, atmosphere, and a price point that doesn't scare non-Nyers this place always delivers.
