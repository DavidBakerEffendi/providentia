Can't thank this place enough for helping us to host an incredible birthday dinner for my friend. 19 of us attended dinner last night, where we had a number of starters for the table, as well as each person having an entree. The food was superb and all came out at the same time. The ambiance is comfortable and airy and you feel like you can breathe, even when you're at a table with so many people. The food was delicious and we got some great bottles of wine. On top of all this, the staff was remarkable! So attentive and friendly, always there to help fill wine and make sure everyone had everything they needed. This was my second time at Ciccio, and it's only gotten better (and I loved the first time). Definitely recommend.
