Absolutely fabulous!! The food was delicious. Our waiter, Ali, was also the owner and he is an incredibly kind, very smart guy. He was great at picking out cheeses and charcuterie for our cheese plate. We told him what we usually liked and he picked out a great selection of things for us to try. I highly recommend the Bon Bons for dessert. I paired my three chocolates with a flight of three wines. excellent, fun, delicious. What more could you want in a dessert? My sister, a very picky foodie, said it was the best meal she's had in a long time. She was very impressed by the restaurant. My mom loved the semolina, made by Ali himself and a very neat treat of Ottoman origin. Definitely check out Pierre Loti!! Tell Ali we said hello!!
