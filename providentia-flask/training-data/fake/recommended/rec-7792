A friend of mine recently asked for my recommendation for a restaurant in Midtown that's not expensive, but interesting and cute because her out-of-town family was visiting. So I recommended her this place. The food here is decent, but not recommended for a real foodie who loves authentic Thai food. What makes this place so great is their hip and stylishly modernized Victorian style decor and their extremely reasonable price. And they serve Thai food??? What a crazy and fantastic combination! LOL! Although the food is just 3 stars, I have to give this place 4 stars for its amazing price considering the neighborhood, and for its awesome decor, especially the oversized chandelier in the glass case! It's so over the top, I love it! I've never been here on weekend but I bet it must be hard to get a table because even on week nights this place gets packed!
