In the late 80s and while in college, this place used to be called Willowbys (sp?).  It was a great bar.  So some 25 years later, when I found myself in Connecticut with my lady and touring Yale on a Sunday, we opted for a drink and some appetizers.   What a great gem!  The waiter was Jason and was superb.   The bar manager also stopped by several times and game us a shot (sorry we forgot his name) but he was equally awesome.  We ordered a couple of drinks, the margarita flatbread (order with meatballs and extra cheese and suggested by Jason) and shared a Caesar's salad.  Everything was absolutely delish.   It brought back some great, great memories being in this city again.   We highly recommend this place.  The atmosphere, the food and sit in the bar and ask for Jason and ask to meet the bar manager.   You won't be disappointed.
