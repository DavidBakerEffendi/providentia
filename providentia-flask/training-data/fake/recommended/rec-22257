We went for happy hour...and missed it by 15 minutes. Alas! Still, you can't beat dollar oysters, though Max Fish has the win with an 'oyster of the day'. However, Dish does have the friendliest bartender this side of the river. Win-win. Delicious fries, a charming, well-decorated atmosphere, and a neat dessert menu makes this a good place to go.
