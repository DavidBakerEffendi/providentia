I'm a little surprised by the rave reviews, since my panini was good, and my soup of the day was many steps above good, but I wasn't blown away.   I'm just writing about the service, which was a bit weird.  I guess I've turned into one of those people who cares that server protocol is followed just a little bit.  And at Il Bambino, there were little deviations.  For one, we didn't even get water until 10 minutes after being seated.  And when the waitress did bring water, she interrupted my friend in mid sentence with, "THE SPECIALS ARE..." - no "Hello"?  She then didn't ask if we wanted drinks, just proceeded to ask if we knew what we wanted to eat.  Hello?   And she followed that up with being pretty absent for most of the meal.  I'd totally recommend this place to friends in the neighborhood, but it was just a little off.
