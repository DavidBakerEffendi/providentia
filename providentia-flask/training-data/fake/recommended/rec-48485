I feel like this place deserved a more recent review. I came here based on the fact that I was staying at the Marriott next door and it was convenient. Let's start with ambiance:  The deli is on the side of the restaurant. I did not have to walk through that. I simply went in the front door of the restaurant and there was a hostess stand there. It's small and I like the interior design. Not crowded on a Sunday night. About 8 tables filled. About 12 more available. Service:  My waiter, while not full of personality, was attentive. Bread and herbed oil right away. Food came quickly and plates were cleared right away. Drinks were refilled before I sucked them dry as well (and I drink a lot!).   Now on to the food:  I was impressed with some items and not others. The bread and herbed oil was very good. I got the lobster stuffed ravioli for an appetizer and it was mediocre. Should have been stuffed more. It was mostly ravioli. It also needed salt, which I added. I ordered the grilled salmon for my entree which was excellent!  However, the side of garlic risotto it came with was pretty much flavorless. But, just dip it with the lemon butter sauce that is on the plate from the salmon and you're set. Death by chocolate cake for dessert. This was baffling to me. It was more like a vanilla sundae with chocolate fudge. I'm not sure if the batter was just not cooked or if it was supposed to be like that. It was tasty but, just not right. I think the cannoli is probably a better bet. Overall, I had a good experience and would go back, especially if staying at the Marriott on business.
