Really should be a zero stars option. The food was terrible. "Beans" were mostly water, veggies gross, everything just kind of awful. Somehow they are using twice the amount of carbonated water than anywhere else...probably to cut back on the syrup costs. All the drinks tasted like perrier water with a little bit of sugar. The service was horrible. The poor girl in front of me asked for pinto beans after the dude had moved her tacos down the line, and he replied "Thanks a lot"...apparently it's a major inconvenience to do your fucking job. Just a bunch of attitude and bad form. This was my first time in an El Feugo. It's totally the Hardees of the San Francisco-style burrito places. Terrible.
