I went to Philadelphia yesterday and i decided to try Genos and Pats to see which one was better. Genos slightly edges out Pats. I ordered a Philly cheese steak with cheese whiz and onions.In addition i ordered a side order of fries and a cherry coke.My impression of Genos is that the cheese steaks are good however it wasnt anything special. There are places in New york that make better Philly cheese steaks.When i travel to Philly again i would like to try some other places that sell Philly cheese steaks. Genos is strictly for tourists! Special note: make sure you speak english when you order lol
