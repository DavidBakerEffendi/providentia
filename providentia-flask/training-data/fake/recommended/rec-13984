I've had my fair share of pancakes traveling around the country for work and I can say the blueberry pancakes here are often worth the 1-2 hour wait for me. The quality is always consistent with the pancakes, and I'm never disappointed in the portion, presentation or straight out deliciousness of the blueberries and pancakes.
