Such a cute spot for brunch with friends and family! Bright, spacious, close to the 137th-City College stop on the 1 train. The staff is attentive and the owner is very friendly. The challah french toast was delicious with yogurt and strawberries, and I had a few bites of the frittata and turkey sausage and everyone in my party was happy with their meal! Â The coffee is also delicious-- the staff whipped up the half and half cream which was pretty wonderful!
