I've heard really good things about this place, so I was super stoked to finally eat here the other night. I got to say...I was not blown away by their offerings. To begin with, we had the pickled plate, which seemed to carry the same acidic tone across all items on the plate. I would have hoped to have some variation and to have a little more depth in spice flavor instead of just using the individual vegetables to carry the palate. The octopus was good. The smoked yogurt was a nice touch and the succulents were tasty and I know it's tapas, but portions were dainty. They had a swordfish steak that was the highlight. Very tender. The beet and berries was very simple, but was hoping for something a little more refined. It was cooked beets with berries. My savory and sweet beets are way better then theirs. I would come back, but only if somebody else wanted to.
