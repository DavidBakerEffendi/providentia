This was certainly not our first experience with Topaz. We had enjoyed good meals there on many evenings. Unfortunately, tonight was not one of those. The waiter (who I had never seen before) seemed nice enough, but he was emphatic about forcing a special (sea bass) on us, which we agreed to (we later found out that the dish was $25.00 - not surprising for a special, but wish it had been worth it). We started with some appetizers we have enjoyed in the past: Thai Tacos, Topaz Puffs and Chicken Satay. The puffs came out cold and soggy. Then ten minutes later the Thai tacos came old cold with the chicken satay which was the best of the three. The two entrees we ordered were Pad Thai and the sea bass special . The Pad Thai was greasy and inconsistent in flavor, and the sea bass - which we ordered steamed - was soggy, Overall, not a great meal. We were ready to chalk it up to an off night until 2 minutes after we paid the bill (with a 20+ percent tip) when the waiter came over and asked if we could leave because he had another reservation waiting for a table. This was the first time I had ever experienced this, and as best as I could tell, there were only 2 people waiting for a table. I do like this restaurant and always have enjoyed going there. I just hope this is an odd occurrence and not an indicator of where the service is going. P.S. "Momma" was not there this particular evening. Maybe that had something to do with it.
