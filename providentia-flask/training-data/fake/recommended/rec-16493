My boyfriend had been wanting to try this place for a while but it's usually pretty hard to get in here Thursdays through Sundays. So there we were on a random Tuesday and the place we had settled on was out of the very thing we were both craving and so we wandered down University Place and across to 10th Street and found Graffiti open and quite empty. As others mentioned, the tables are communal and we were seated across from a couple on an awkward first date which provided endless entertainment, especially once they left. The dishes here are crafted with thought and excellent attention to detail. All of the elements work together to create an impressive taste experience that is unique and thrilling. We ordered the pickled ginger scallops which were served with strips of naan bread and a chilli jelly - an inspired combination, the chilli shrimp which was more delicate but also good, the coconut chicken noodle soup which was creamy with a touch of sourness and was just to my taste (my bf thought it needed salt), and the chickpea crusted skate which we both found a bit greasy/oily (however, we are both on low fat/oil/cholesterol diets so are very sensitive to greasy food, YMMV). The most divine dish was dessert. We had the strawberry truffle with pepper ice cream one and it was probably the best thing I have ever eaten. Really. It was sublime. I made this Yelp account specifically so I could rave about it. The portions were small enough that you could try a lot of things and not leave the restaurant feeling sick like you over ate. If you like leaving a restaurant stuffed, you should probably go elsewhere, like The Olive Garden.
