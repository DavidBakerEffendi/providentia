We were told to get the date cake. Do any of us even like dates? I'm indifferent on them. I'll eat them, but I wasn't sure if I was about to pass up creme brulee for them. That's when a fellow diner at an adjacent table chimed in - "Get it," he said. We followed his advice and we were not disappointed. The cake was amazing. Granted, I shouldn't have been surprised - everything was amazing. I got the seafood risotto - a special. My girlfriend got the macaroni and cheese, which might have been best-in-show. Fellow diners raved about the ribs. As a vegetarian, I cannot comment. The atmosphere was fun. It had a vintage chic to it. The restaurant is cash-only. They have a relatively thorough wine list. The beer list is short, but good. I tried the black velvet - Guinness and champagne - and was pleased with my choice, albeit obscure. They also offered a black and tan that consisted of Guinness and Brooklyn Lager. They did not, however, use a spoon to separate the to beers. This practice is more in line with the traditional Irish style - regardless, I prefer the aesthetics of separation. I would return there in a heartbeat.
