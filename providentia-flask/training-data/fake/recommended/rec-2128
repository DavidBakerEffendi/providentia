Was ok, not sure if it lived up to the hype though.  Was about a 45 min wait for an ok cheese steak whiz.  Have never tried Pats so can say who is better.   Oh and good luck finding somewhere to park. Best thing was that the people we waited in line with keep buying us beer from a small bar around the corner.  Thanks guys.
