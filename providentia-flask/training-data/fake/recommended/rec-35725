My friends and I really enjoy this place. We always come when we are in the mood for a good burger. If you've never had it before, please order the Good Dog Burger and have a beer to go with it. The meat patty is filled with a melted cheese that makes it so delicious. There are also onions, and the plate comes with sweet potato fries. I never order anything else, but I have the impression that they serve some other great dishes. I bet you could get away with asking the waiter/waitress their recommendation, but I always stick to the usual burger. Service is always very good, even on busy days. Great place to meet for a meal or drinks.
