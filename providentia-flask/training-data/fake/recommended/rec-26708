This restaurant is fantastic! First of all, it is on a corner and filled with light.  The service was excellent, and the waiter was very friendly but not overly intrusive. There are a lot of vegan and vegetarian dishes on the menu. My friend had the seafood soup, which she said was excellent. I had the oxtails, which were unbelievably delicious. I asked the waiter how many oxtails came in the dish, because I have been places where you get one or two small ones.  He said "a lot" and that it was the best dish on the menu. There were four really big oxtails. The meat was falling off the bone. I substituted rice for mashed potatoes, and it was truly one of the best meals I have had in a long time. There is something on the menu for everyone here, and it is within walking distance of the Barnes Museum. Check this place out!  You will not be disappointed.
