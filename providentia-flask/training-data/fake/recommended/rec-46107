Just want to say what a wonderful time we had at The Mill on the River.  The food was delicious.  The menu for our party had great offerings...5 different main course items, as I remember.  Everyone in our party was happy with the food and the service.  I want to give special thanks to Eve, our waitress.  She was especially caring and attentive.  Just want to make sure she is aware of our appreciation.  All the staff were very professional.  Great product!!  Great presentation!!!  I hope to return, soon!! Thanks, again!   (We attended the luncheon party, last Saturday, the 28th of Sept.)
