We enjoyed our dinner at Salute. I'd give it a solid 3-1/2 stars. It's BYOB (thankfully I finally remembered to bring a bottle of wine!) Started with the zucchini flowers (eh) and calamari (average). It was a later than usual dinner so by the time we sat down, I was hungry so I ordered the pasta with shrimp and lobster. Â It was delicious. Pasta was cooked al dente and the shrimp and lobster were flavorful and cooked perfectly (not overdone). The space is nice but it is very noisy. We were there with another couple and you really had to speak very loudly for anyone across the table to hear you. Otherwise, service was great. The hostess and waitress were very nice and professional. We will go back again.
