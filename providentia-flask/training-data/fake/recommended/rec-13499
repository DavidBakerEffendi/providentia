Admittedly, I did not go to the Red Hook location - Red Hook Lobster Pound has a stand at the Madison Square Eats event this year, so I was able to partake without having to travel all the way to Brooklyn. At first I was a little hesitant about the price per roll ($16) but eventually my craving for lobster overpowered my financial sensibility (no news there). I chose the Connecticut style lobster roll since I've tried Maine style lobster rolls before, and my GOD was it delicious. The lobster was fresh and succulent, while the butter and lemon made it a perfect combination. I think it took more time for me to decide to buy the lobster roll than it did for me to finish eating it. Will definitely have to make the trip out to the Brooklyn location so I can try their lobster mac n cheese.
