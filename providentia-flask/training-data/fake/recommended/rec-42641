Good buffet style restaurant. Just quick and easy. They weigh everything for the price. Had a nice assortment of meats (about 8-10 to choose from Churrasco style) rice, beans, salad, pasta, vegetables. Cost about $10-12 a person on average. Overall a good place for lunch or a quick dinner. Only negative was the over seasoned meats (kinda too salty) I'll definitely check this place out again.
