116 Crown, you are too expensive! Don't get me wrong. I like what you do, I like getting dressy and pretending I know how to be hip for an evening, and after all my work in sustainable agriculture I certainly appreciate any/all emphasis made to local and organic sourcing. Plus, I have had some unique drinks and tasty bites here over the years. But I am confused by the exorbitant prices of everything--food and drink, cocktails and drafts. New Haven is not Manhattan, and I'd like it to stay that way! Nothing (nothing!) on the menu seems reasonably priced, and when you think you can trick me into paying that kind of markup for a Red Stripe...well, you've crossed a line, mister! Let me know when I can afford to come here again! Until then, I'll be adventuring elsewhere.
