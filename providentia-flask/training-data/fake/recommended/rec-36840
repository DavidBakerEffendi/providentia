Melchior and Balthazar... went upon a journey, went upon a journey. Yep, it's the Holidays! Ducked into this restaurant for a drink to escape the mobs outside on Spring St. I was immediately at home. Giant ceilings. Old world feel. Wooden bar. Oysters. I'm a big fan of Keith McNally's style. Whether its Schiller's Liqour Bar or Pastis, they both get my seal of approval for food and design. What really made a splash, was that whilst sitting with my girlfriend, and a good friend from England and his sister, the couple sitting behind us dumped off a half bottle of $60 dollar ros√© at our table. That doesn't suck.
