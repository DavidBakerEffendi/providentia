So I don't eat pork- which left me with only 1 option- the vegetarian meatball. Every other meatball had some form of pork in it. I was apprehensive- considering I was looking forward to a beefy meatball- but I was pleasantly surprised! I had the vegetarian meatball hero/sandwich with vegetarian tomato sauce which makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The service was also great- they were quick to greet, take orders, and checked up frequently. They did a great job and I'll definitely be back for more!
