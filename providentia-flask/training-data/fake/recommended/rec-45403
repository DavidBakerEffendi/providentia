I had lunch with a colleague at Rucola a few weeks ago. It was amazing!  The pizza and asparagus appetizer was divine and I have since planned my birthday dinner this week for ten people.  The staff is super friendly and the space is lovely.  With new businesses, we all need to give it a chance to get its legs.  It's like a  BABY people - I'm speaking to you negative reviewers who slash a place within 1 to 30 days of a restaurants existence.  Really? You know most people don't ask a baby to run a marathon.  It's gotta learn to walk, learn it's steps, it's strengths, it's weaknesses. That all comes from real experience.  And yes, they need to get the kinks out in due time and I wish Rucola all the success in the world.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood and Yay! I'm a fan!
