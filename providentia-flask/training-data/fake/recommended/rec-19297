I think I may be one of Honeygrow's biggest fans and most loyal customers. I cannot get enough of this place. I work around the corner and eat here 1- 2 times a week. I am a picky eater so the kiosk ordering system and the fact that you can completely customize your meal is my favorite part about this place. I have never tried the stir fry as I usually stick to the salads. but they always look and smell amazing. I do not eat meat, so I have only ever tried the tofu and shrimp in my salad both of which never disappoint. The only problem with he protein is that they never seem to give you enough, but the staff always accommodates when I ask for extra and I am never charged more (maybe this is an option they should add to the kiosk). The veggies are always fresh. I love the recent additions of the brussel sprouts & cauliflower. One of my other favorite parts of Honeygrow is the sriracha dispensers and their never ending supply of Tamari Soy Sauce. I recommend that they add grilled eggplant as salad option as they have it available in the stir fry. Also, asparagus! I would also like to see egg whites added an option. Other than that Honeygrow is the first NYC-like customizable salad place to open up in the area and I think they have done a phenomenal job. Keep in up! -Your biggest fan :)
