Intimate, reasonably priced and family run since 1968, Benita One in the heart of Little Italy is a gem of a restaurant we discovered on one of our regular vacations to NY City. Italian myself, and very critical of Italian cuisine, I highly recommend the Puttanesca, Carbonara and Cappuccino. If prompted, Joe, 4th generation NY restauranteur, generously shares memories of New York City.
