Not so great. I started off with the fried dumplings...for some reason I kept dumping soy  sauce on them to get a little more taste. I then had the Rainbow Roll, Ruby Roll and 3pieces of Yellow Tail Sashami.... All of the fish was flavorless and it was pre frozen.  I heard so many  good things about this place and walked out disappointed.
