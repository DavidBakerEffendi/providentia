I've been here a couple of times already and it's always packed. Last time I was here, it was more than an hour wait! Luckily that shithole Time Square was nearby so I took my visiting sister a quick walk about over. By the time we got back we were ready to be seating. It's great that they text you a couple of minutes before they're ready so you're not necessarily glued to the establishment for X feet away. Â But if you're one of those that likes hanging around the restaurant waiting and waiting to get seated, there's a bar you can hang around in. Standing room only though. I highly recommend the Hirata Buns for an appetizer. Since I'm a creature of habit, I pretty much always get the Akamaru Modern, very good and filling -I always get second helping of noodles! My sister ordered the Torishio which has a different base broth. Not partial to it, but it was good enough! One of the best places you can take a visiting friend/relative in the city.
