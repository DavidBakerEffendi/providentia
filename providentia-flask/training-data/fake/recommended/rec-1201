Stopped in for a Root Beer to wet the whistle.  Picked up some mozzerella sticks as well.  The sticks were as good as you'll will find anywhere else, so that's not a bad thing.  The Root Beer, however, was really good.  Don't get it to go, sit and take a load of and get it in a frosted mug.  There isn't anything like it.  They'll even do car service and bring your order to your window.  Throw back to another time.  (I know, Sonic does it, but you don't want me doing a review on that chain.  It wouldn't be pretty.)
