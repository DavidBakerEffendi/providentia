Chatni is a great spot to get an authentic indian meal. It has the basics on the menu as well as a few unique dishes. The service is fantastic and if you take a sip from your water, it is filled up immediately. The food tastes great, and its a nice spot for a family meal or a couple who want to be able to talk among minimal noise. The cauliflower is delicious, and especially in the sweet and sour sauce. Of course, you would be missing out if you didn't try a curry, but all dishes are bold in flavor - and I especially enjoy the noodle dishes!
