I went for happy hour not too long ago. I had the nachos and the margaritas. The Margaritas were not to be messed with ! Not for the faint of heart. Super strong with lime juice, it was superb! They were inexpensive as well, I believe (and don't quote me) about 6 bucks a glass. Very nice! The only thing i hate is they do not take cards except AMEX. That is super wack. You have to go to the ATM in the back to get money. Other than that, it is so worth your money.
