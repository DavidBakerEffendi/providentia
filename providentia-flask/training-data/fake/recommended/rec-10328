If you're in a rush don't eat here.  But that's the point...food is amazing, service is like being in Portugal.   You are left to eat and enjoy and take your time.  Portions are generous.  Variety and tastes are authentic.  Mariachi band wasn't though.  What were Mexican gypsies doing playing for tips in a Portuguese restaurant?
