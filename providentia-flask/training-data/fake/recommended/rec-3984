I don't know what the hell they put in this stuff! I used to be absolutely terrified of street food. When I first moved to the city I had some terrible (and I mean TERRIBLE) street food experiences, including but not limited to a shish kebab composed entirely of chicken fat, a super stale pretzel, and some chicken and rice with enough hot sauce to choke a donkey. Yesterday when walking down Broadway near Prince street, I was starving and decided to brave a halal cart again by ordering a gyro. It was delicious! Good pita, good chicken, good sauce, lots of veggies, and it renewed my faith in street food. So today I decided to try the famed 53rd and 6th cart. Not disappointing. Period. Long line? Moves fast. Food? Stays warm the whole way to Midwood, Brooklyn. Portions? Enough for two meals. White sauce? Mayonnaisse based, which normally grosses me out, but this was pretty good. Hot sauce? hottest fucking thing I've ever put in my mouth.
