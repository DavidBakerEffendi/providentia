I can't imagine many vegetarian, rustic Buddhists enjoying this hip Asian restaurant, but my friends and I certainly did. We celebrated a birthday here and ordered half the items on the extensive menu. I loved every dish I tasted, from the lobster egg rolls to the wasabi mashed potatoes down to final drop of Zengria. With vibrant lighting and helpful service, the atmosphere was just right for a celebration. There was even a large Budda in the center of the restaurant. Perhaps Siddartha would enjoy Buddakan after all.
