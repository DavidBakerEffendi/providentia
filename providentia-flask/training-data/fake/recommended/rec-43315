I have gone to this restaurant my whole life. Its great. The servers are all helpful, happy, Â and funny! The prices are a reasonable, maybe a bit high, but it is worth it if you are in the mood for a burger you cant get anywhere else! Everyone I know has been to tigers tale and has positive things to say about it. I would highly recommend going to Tigers Tale.
