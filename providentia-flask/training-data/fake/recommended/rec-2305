Had a "Whiz Wit" and liked it better than Geno's. Their hot sauce is NOT hot at all. OK, and here's my verdict. As far as "Philly Cheesesteaks" go, this was probably the best one I've had, but definitely not by leaps and bounds. The crispy bread was real nice, and the warm sandwich in the cold wind was very pleasant. However, I've had "Deluxe Cheesesteaks" here in Chicago that I like better, I guess it's more of the style than anything. It's like a Philly but with cooked peppers and mushrooms too. Drip some buffalo sauce on it and it's amazing!
