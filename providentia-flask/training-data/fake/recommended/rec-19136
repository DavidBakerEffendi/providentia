This is the one tapas restaurant in nyc that has never disappointed me. Question... how is it possible to make a pork product even better? Add chocolate! Surprising, isn't it? And true. Seriously, don't leave here without ordering the crostini with chocolate spread and chorizo. It is a thing of beauty. The crostini with fava bean and mint puree is refreshing, unique, and delicious. Fava beans are seasonal though, so I don't know if you can get that all the time. I usually eat here with my friend Craig who is Australian and likes to drink a lot. My enjoyment is significantly heightened by the two bottles of red wine we take down per meal (split 60/40, I can't drink as much as the Aussie). Best patatas bravas and great lamb and shrimp too. The space is cramped though so I wouldn't come here with a group!
