What a great addition to the neighborhood!  I love this place.  The scallop appetizer was delish, and the pork loin was perfection.  The portions are exactly right, the service attentive but not intrusive, and the hummus with little toastie-breads a welcome change from the standard bread-and-butter (or oil).  I'm going back soon.  Very soon.
