Patio was truly beautiful on a lovely early fall evening. Very relaxing atmosphere. The steaks came out cooked to our liking. They were out of the appetizer special we wanted and it was only 7:30pm however, it is a special so we can't complain. The food, atmosphere, and service were all a little more than we expected. We'll be back; one of our top rated steakhouses for sure. Large portions for standard prices.
