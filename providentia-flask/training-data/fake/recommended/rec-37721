Like a good restaurant reviewer, I've been to La Pulperia twice in the past month. And both times were shockingly good. And better yet, it's in a neighborhood relatively close to mid-town and the theatre district which has a lot of restaurants...but not a lot of GOOD restaurants. Had the Sangria short ribs, with cauliflower - which was delicious, meaty, tasty and the cauliflower was like whipped potatoes (but low carb). Also tasted the Ceviche - which is their specialty as a Latin seafood restaurant, and it was amazing. Mostly what brought me back was the perfect European service, good advice on wine, helpful...and if you look up to catch their eye you get instant presence. It's a medium-small space, cozy but still lots of seating, and we got a table without any problem. On the 2nd visit, the owner Victor stopped by late in the meal to say hello, chatted for a bit and then brought us a complimentary icecream with these tiny cookies. Both were hand-made and couldn't believe how tasty. What a great find.
