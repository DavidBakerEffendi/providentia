One of the best Japanese Cuisine I have had.   The miso soup is just right in flavor with tofu, seaweed, and scallions.  The california roll is always fresh and my favorite are the vegetarian dumplings.  These vegetarian dumplings are green in color and  light on the stomach but powerful on the palate. Great place to visit especially for lunch time.
