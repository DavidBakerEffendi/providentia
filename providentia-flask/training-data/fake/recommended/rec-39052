Kabocha squash toast, roasted butternut Â from market table and roasted carrot and avocado salad were fantastic. Calamari was really good, pretzel crust is a bit heavy. Kale salad was great. Desserts were a disappointment. Relied too heavily on sugar and not enough depth of flavor. Had chocolate cake with toasted marshmallow icing (icing was chewy). Salted caramel ice cream wasn't caramel-y or salty enough.
