This place is great! word has it that Hassan actually invested every flavor of lassi except Mango. this guy is a genius. I got honey and mint...what a unique and not-to-saccharine flavor combo. sweet, herby and tangy! Also, the chaats are amazing, though i would not recommend the meat varieties. Â  I am glad delicious chat is available down at this end of baltimore!
