Went here yesterday for lunch and had one of the best experience of my life! The aroma of bacon spread throughout the restaurant before even ordering. I ordered the lobster, bacon mac & cheese and it was incredibly delectable! The chunks of lobster were so juicy, bacon was outrageous and moist, and the noodles were super cheesy. For $20, it was the best choice and left me satisfied without even finishing! If you're a bacon lover you MUST GO! Yum all the way.
