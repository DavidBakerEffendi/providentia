Solid Thai food.  Had to wait for an hour to get a table. This place is packed!  No reservations so the line is long. It is no frills place.  Thai ice tea is how it should taste. Everything is how they should taste. Very authentic.  Atmosphere is more cafeteria-like, so eat, be merry, and leave so that the line of people can be seated.
