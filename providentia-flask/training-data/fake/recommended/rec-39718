So as I work nearby, mostly all of my work crew orders take out from Joya at least 3 times a week. The same delivery guy is always greeted like family! (lol) I must say, I ordered the Fried Calamari and a chicken pad Thai, and boy was it mouth orgasmic! This was so delicious. I can't wait to continue to order more delicious food from them!
