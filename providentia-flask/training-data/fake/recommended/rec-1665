So I just visited from Chicago and wanted to see what the hype is about. Pats was tasty. The bread was good and loved the meat and cheese. Good flavor. Pats is indeed WAY better than Genos. Its not even close. On another note I wanted to see if what Philly had to offer was better than what we had in Chicago. I am happy to say " Philly's Best" in Chicago is as good if not better than Pats.
