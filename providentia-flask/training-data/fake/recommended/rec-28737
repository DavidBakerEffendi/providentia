yum! yum! yum!  Healthy and Organic food at not insane prices!  Friendly and helpful staff that are actually enthusiastic about their jobs -- and the owner actually took the time to talk to me for 15 minutes about his concept and what drove him to begin a healthier lifestyle! I would have already have come back to eat here a dozen times, but I couldn't find it again until tonight.  i almost thought I dreamt it up.   Prices are not cheap, but 14.95 will get you a gigantic, yummy, healthful meal (one entree and two sides).   they have these yummy little snack mix in thingys that are 6 bucks and out of this world yummy!   Freshly pressed juices seem to start at 5 bucks (thugh most are up to 10 dollars). Love this place!  Even the coffee rocks!
