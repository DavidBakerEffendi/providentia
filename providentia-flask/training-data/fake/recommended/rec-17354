So yeah... the chicken at this place is crazy addictive. Also it doesn't really seem to matter if you call ahead for an order though I do it anyway. If you do call ahead I'd say give it about 15 mins and you'll prob sit there another 10 mins depending on how busy they are. Also like Tuesday nights are slow
