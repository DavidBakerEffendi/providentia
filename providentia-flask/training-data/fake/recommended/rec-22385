I was not a fan of the old Rudy's.  Everyone was always like, "I love Rudy's- it's such a shithole!"  I, however, am not a fan of shitholes and don't really understand the appeal of a bar that's known for being a shithole.  Luckily, the new Rudy's is very different!  It's cleaner, has a bigger menu and a better beer selection (yay Kwak!)  Frites are still just as tasty and everything I've had there has been delicious.   I'm not sure if they'll be able to keep the old Rudy's crowd, or if they even want to.  The back area where bands play is small and disastrously laid out, so it will be interesting to see what happens.  Hopefully I won't have a beer land and explode on my table because some drunkard chucked it randomly into the air.  When that happened at the old Rudy's people were like, "Haha- what an awesome crazy shithole this is!"  I have a feeling that wouldn't be tolerated at the new Rudy's (in the dining room anyway), and I appreciate that.
