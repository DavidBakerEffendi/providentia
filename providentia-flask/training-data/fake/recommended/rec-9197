This is some pretty serious fat people food. Bacon? Processed cheese? A huge softball sized beef ball? If you salivate at these foodstuffs, you must order the heart-stopping Bistro Burger with a side of fries fried in bacon grease. Wash it all down with a cheap ass (2 dollah holla!) McSorzzzleyzz, the carbonation will clean your poor arteries. NOT. HAHAHAHAAHhahahAHAHaha. It usually gets crazy-ass-muthalovin' packed in this hole. Just fucking come when there are a shit ton of people, it's the ultimate West Village neighborhood exprience, Brits included!
