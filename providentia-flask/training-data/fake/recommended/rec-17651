I sat on the red pleather barstool and looked out the window as I took my first bite of the spaghetti with meat sauce... Swooosh I was on the veranda  of a beautiful Tuscan villa... Overlooking a sun drenched valley each bite like the car ride to your new crush's house ... Filled with joy an anticipation.   Funny how beauty is sometimes most clearly expressed in a simple basic meal..What can I say this is love on a plate!  Tell them Jeff sent you!  Lol!
