I had dinner here with my boyfriend 3 days ago. We noticed the place just walking in Tribeca few days earlier then we checked it on Yelp and decided to book it for the last night together in NY. The atmospere is really warm, the lighting and the design are sophisticated. The waiters were mannered and skilled and explained us very enthusiasticly all the dishes part of the degustation menu we went for. The wines were also good. Our fav dish was the chili lobster, simply amazing. It's worth the price and I'd love to come back.
