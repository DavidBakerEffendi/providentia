We waited quite awhile for a table on a busy Saturday night. It was extremely crowded with big groups of people, not really a romantic dinner type place. Everything is made for sharing so beware. The portions are huge and the drink sizes are small, which was kind of odd. We had tons of bread, penne ala vodka and ravioli. Everything was delicious. It was only 2 of us and we had tons of food left over. Save this place for a large group or a special occasion. Carmine's has picnic table covers, it really feels as though you are at your hardcore Italian's house for dinner. I personally thought the pasta could have been better, than again, I am no genius on Italian cooking and maybe I should have asked for the pasta well done. Overall, I would go back with a big group and just make reservations ahead of time. It is really loud, and beware there are annoying little kids everywhere. Service was acceptable, nothing to write home about.
