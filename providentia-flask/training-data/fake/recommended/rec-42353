Been here twice and both times I loved my food. I recommend the Thai Curry Cod, it is super yummy and just hearty enough to leave you feeling pleasantly full. Servers are super nice and the atmosphere is very quaint and cozy. But don't forget BYOB :) * If you are coming with more than 4 people I would definitely call ahead because the entire dining room probably only seats about 12.
