A year after I moved to the neighborhood, I made my ninth or tenth trip back to Grimaldi's, this time with the parents in tow.  At 9pm on a Sunday we expected quick, awesome pizza.  Unfortunately, the service was anything but quick, making out experience anything but awesome.  After waiting an unconscionable 40 minutes for a table (when the line was just 8 deep), we were roundly ignored for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, there was more than adequate space to seat my party and many others waiting in line, but because of their seating policies/ineptitude, nearly a dozen of us were kept waiting outside while the space sat vacant inside.  Service was non-existent.  I was grateful for the carafe of water they brought us, because hadn't that been delivered, we'd never get a refill again. Pizza was nearly launched at our table, as was the check.  And when we were within 30 minutes of closing time, the music was cut off and the air conditioning was blasted. A potentially great experience with the parents that was dampened by the Grimaldi's staff. Thanks for giving me a reason to Yelp again.
