We stumbled across this place famished after a day at the MET. Â Don't judge this place on it's looks*. It reminded us of a low end chain store that specialises in yoghurt rather than delicious and authentic homemade Greek food. You can select from a variety of ready-to-go Greek dishes including White Beans, Marinated Beetroot, Quinoa and Kale Salad. On top of that they have an amazing selection of flavoured yoghurts including rose petal yoghurt that is thick and tangy. On the main board they offer a range of gyros, burgers and soups. I had the Vegetarian Burger which was the perfect size (not so big I couldn't fit it into my mouth), and you can taste the freshness of the pitas they make there. There is a huge range of vegetarian food and all the ingredients used are fresh and good quality. Pre packed items in the fridge range from $4-$7 but on our first visit we ended up spending over $20 each wanting to sample all the dishes. On the counter they also have a range of Greek pastries and biscuits including intriguing variations like coconut baklava. The staff were super friendly but this is more of a to go spot so they didn't bother too much with niceties. We'll definitely be heading back there the next time we have a Museum adventure in the Upper East Side. * I removed 0.5 star for the shop front because we almost didn't go in because of it!
