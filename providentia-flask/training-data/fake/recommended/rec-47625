Pepe's is worth the wait every time. Don't let the lines intimidate you; they move relatively fast. Â The staff, despite their busyness, are for the most part courteous and attentive. Their thin crust pizza cooked in a coal-fired brick oven can't be beat! I've taken friend's from New York and they agree it's some of the best pizza they have ever eaten.
