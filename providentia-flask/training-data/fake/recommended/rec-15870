Bourgeoisie pieces of heaven flown in from France. I am very picky about macaroons... I find them to be like the hot guy you see. They're physically appealing (eye candy!), but once you get to really get to know them on the inside, you get disappointed that they're nothing special and just "eh". I came here with high hopes... as I wasn't sure if it could beat Bouchon's macaroons... but I was pleasantly surprised. The fillings really set this macaroon shop from all other places (well that and the price too... at $$$ 2.80 each). The filling is super flavorful... not just some cheap ass creme they stuck in there to make the macaroon hold together. The 4 flavors I tried are: + Green Apple: ***3.5 stars: basically a green apple gummy ring in macaroon form. Super sweet. + Caramel with Salted Butter: *****5 stars: SO good. The filling was gel like and really flavorful... def. recommend this one. + Rose Petal: ****4 stars: I wasn't sure what "rose" would taste like, but it had a quaint taste...an aroma-ful flavor. I would recommend this for those who don't like overly sweet macaroons (aka your asian parents). + Raspberry: ***3 stars: Fruity, but didn't stand out to me that much. - They don't allow pictures inside (so be conspicuous!) - There's often a line, with a door attendant! - They charge a couple dollars more for the boxes.. depending on which box.. (Most were around $21 dollars.. for a box of 6.. which comes out to costing $4.20 just for the box!!) - **They have THE cutest hello kitty box*** for 6 macaroons for a damage to your wallet of $21. - They have cute Landuree gift bags to put your purchases in... so cute! Overall, I thought their macaroons were tasty, but for the price... I think I'll be sticking to Bouchon ($3.25 for 2x the size) to get my quality and quantity.
