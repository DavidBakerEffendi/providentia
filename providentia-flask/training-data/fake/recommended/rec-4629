Went here for Sunday afternoon lunch, ordered three different dishes which were all very good.  The place was not too crowded so it was relaxing and we enjoyed the  nature videos and background rock music.  I loved the colorful hanging lanterns! Unfortunately I can't recall the names of the dishes we ordered so I can't recommend any one in particular,  but we did order 2 desserts to share, one was like a coconut tapioca pudding and the other was the ginger ice cream, both were very delicious.  My only complaint was that I ordered Jasmine rice but was brought plain white rice.
