The people giving this place so many negative reviews have lost their damn minds. I don't get why so many people are downing this place. The food is NOT authentic Mexican food. Why? Because they use a few ingredients here and there that you wouldn't have found locally in Mexico. But does it taste like authentic Mexican food? Yes. It's delicious. Mexican food is not complicated. It's cheese, beans, meat, vegetables and tortilla. Every Mexican dish is that. Ask Jim Gaffigan. I've eaten Mexican food in Mexico. Beana's has their dishes spot on. They also have a few dishes that are not Mexican but are still delicious. Their coconut/ginger Salmon dish is amazing. I don't recall the exact name of the item, it's usually on their special's board. My boyfriend loves the Tequila Sunrise Chicken. And all this trash talk about the salsa is ridiculous. The salsa is delicious and spicy. I'm sorry Beana's didn't serve you some crap from an Old El Paso jar. If you want crap, go to the supermarket and get an Old El Paso taco kit. The service their is wonderful. You seat yourself and you're almost immediately brought your chips and salsa and asked for your drink order, even when it's super busy. We get the same server every time we go there and she is a sweet heart and a doll. The owner's used to come out and talk to you if you were a regular but the husband (the owner's were an older married couple) recently passed away. They were both very friendly and personable. The prices are in the middle of the scale. Dishes are mainly 10 dollars and up but you get HUGE portions. And the atmosphere is just what you'd expect in a Mexican restaurant. An overload of color and trinkets. I'll summarize with a list of pros and cons: Pros: Delicious food, decent prices, excellent service, enjoyable atmosphere. Cons: Bad parking. Sorry, I'm a little defensive of my Beana's,
