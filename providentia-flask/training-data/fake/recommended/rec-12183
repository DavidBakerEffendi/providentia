We took my parents here when they were in town visiting as they have few opportunities to eat Mexican food.  From the start, our experience was excellent.  My father is deaf in one ear and whilst a small gesture, it was notable how responsive the staff was to this and tried to make him as comfortable (and able to hear the menu) as possible.  In addition, I'm currently pregnant, and they were especially understanding and responsive to my current food restrictions as well. Three of the four of us did the tasting menu, and for $29, I declare it the absolute best value for a tasting menu I've ever had.  SUPERB from start to finish and so much food for this rate.  Truly awesome.  My father said their mole sauce was the best he's ever had. YUM!  From the truly sweet staff to the food, we'll definitely be back!
