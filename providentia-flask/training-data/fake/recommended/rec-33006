Every morsel of my Beef Bourguignon was fantastic. The bartender was superb around the little round bar in the back of the first story of the restaurant. The espresso martini was great and with Bushmill's Irish Whiskey you cannot go wrong. BTW - there are things for families that are unique to this restaurant. They serve cotton candy as a desert for young children. They also offer coloring sheets that are copies of pictures, if not from a coloring book dedicated to actual Mad Men scenes, then these pictures are from a close look-a-like coloring book. It is fitting for TriBeCa. I have not seen this nuanced innovation that brought pleasure to the young children as well as their nearby adults in the group at other restaurants. So the it was a great evening with new friends and their children. Just lovely. Great service and atmosphere. I recommend this to others.
