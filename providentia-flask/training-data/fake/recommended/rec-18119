I doubt that I will ever encounter a bar or restaurant with more personality on display than Terroir Tribeca.  Or with a more knowledgeable, genuine staff.  This place rocks my world.  (And, um, my wallet.) The menu/wine list is pretty hefty.  It currently features pages about: - Why street fairs should be banned - 10 Reasons to Drink Rose - How Jane Jacobs saved Manhattan - Why F.C. Barcelona is the "Greatest Sports Team on the Planet" - And assorted defenses of or polemics against various winemakers, grapes, winemaking regions... It's all good fun, and the wine helps wash it down.  There are a million offerings by-the-glass, and half-glasses are an option. The annual Summer of Riesling celebration is my favorite time to visit.  During this time, Terroir refuses to serve any white wine but riesling by the glass.  Trust me, you didn't know you could like a grape as much as this.  Get you some. I usually don't eat much when I visit Terroir, but the food generally pleases.  The veal/ricotta meatballs have been a standout.
