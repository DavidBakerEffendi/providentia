I'm rounding up to 4 stars with this one.... After reading all the mixed-towards-the-negative-side reviews, we didn't have high expectations and honestly considered going some where else but then decided we shouldn't rely on other people other people's opinions and instead make our own.  We sat at the bar and ordered the stuffed squid app, rice balls and a pizza.   Service was fine.. Maybe a little slow with our drinks but it was mid day and relatively busy.   I would've liked to order one of the pasta dishes or entrees but $17 for noodles and $25 for an entree in what really is just Flatbush seems hard to swallow for me.  I'm from here and love that's there's all this new stuff but just because google maps calls it Prospect Park South doesn't mean justify prices higher than Manhattan restaurants... (I will probably include this same rant on The Farm's review if I ever get around to writing it) The rice balls were fine, a little under seasoned but good when dipped in the sauce that came with the stuffed squid.  The stuffed squid I enjoyed mainly because it was interesting.. Warm squid stuffed with standard filling but surrounded in a sauce that reminded us almost of a bloody mary.    Hubby ordered a refreshing cocktail with gin and rosemary which he enjoyed and was apparently very popular as the bartender was making lots of them. I really enjoyed the pizza.  The crust was very different than other pizzas I've had.  It was light, thin with lots of charred flavor and at the same time, almost doughy. There were a couple women walking around who seemed to be at least managers of some sort and seemed alert and aiming to please their patrons.  Atmosphere is nice, open, airy and cozy.   I would come back again for a drink and light lunch on a nice day...   and if I had money I wanted to part with I would try one of the pasta dishes as I'm a sucker for good looking home made tagliatelle.
