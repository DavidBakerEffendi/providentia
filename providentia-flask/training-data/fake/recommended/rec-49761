Excuse me, but what are you trying to do here? I was looking at some internet last week and learned that there was a store in NYC specializing in chicken fingers. I LOVE chicken fingers. Much of my childhood was devoted to the pursuit and subsequent acquisition of golden, crunchy chicken morsels. I nary discriminated between the popper and finger varieties. The best days at schools were Mondays because for one day, the heavens delivered the fingers of chickens to all the hungry children at Medlock Bridge Elementary. However, Sticky's Finger Joint must be an allusion to the Sticky Bandits (see: Home Alone). Let me clarify - for the low low price of (at least) $3.50 you can get ONE whole finger (other than the original). One. That's it. Depending on flavor, they get more or less expensive. I guess this is a privilege? I got three fingers in total (buffalo, vampire something and the caramel). With fries, it was over $17. I smiled and paid because, surely, the fingers must be gigantic or the flavor must be mind shattering, right? Negative, on both accounts, counsel. Do yourself a favor and get something awesome in Union Square. There's so much. Just don't pay $12 for THREE AVERAGE SIZED chicken fingers like I did. You'll feel like a fool. Don't be the pitied fool. Viva la finger!
