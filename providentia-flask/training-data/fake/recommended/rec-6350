I was in a party of 3- we put our name on the list, and were told the wait would 1 hr. We returned after an hour and our table still wasn't ready; we had to wait another half hour outside.  I've been to Malatesta before, so I wasn't surprised or outraged.   However, when we got our food, there was a HUGE half-alive bug in the caprese salad! I showed the waiter, who was extremely apologetic. I saw him tell the manager about it as well. He brought another caprese, but we were a bit wary of it. Still, we ate most of it, and the rest of the food tasted good...although bugs were on our mind for the remainder.     The reason I'm writing this negative review is that the salad was not taken off of our bill and no compensatory measure was offered to us.  Sure, this is a gray area for restaurants, but most nice places would do something to show that they are sorry and that they realize that our meal was subpar as a result of their mistake. With so many great options in the West Village, I probably will not return to this place.
