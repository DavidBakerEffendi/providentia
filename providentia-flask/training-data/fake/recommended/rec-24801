I came here for an early dinner and ordered the special (fried chicken & waffles).  I was expecting to get some good fried chicken, but what i got instead was a soft waffle topped with some nasty, salty, gooey gravy with a few teeny bits of chicken mixed in.  It also came with some brownish corn (tasted like canned) and underseasoned mashed potatoes with a large dollop of brown gravy, which I didn't want on it.  Apparently this is the Dutch style of fried chicken and waffles,  but I think they should explain that on the menu, or at least verbally warn you.   I would've given this place one star but don't think that's fair based on just one dish, and the apple dumplings did look amazing.  Will definitely try this place again, but next time will come for breakfast.
