I don't know if I can say enough about this place. Carmines is an all around nice place to take a date on, Â for a group of friends, even a family outing. One of those spots that depending on the company you are with, you are pretty much guaranteed to have a good time not to mention great service. In a lot of NYC restaurants, (esp high class ones as this one is) there is no in between, you get either the best of the best or the worse of the worse, and I have to say, kind of surprisingly, Carmines is the up there with the best of the best. Great service, which as all NY'ers know, counts for a hell of a lot, superb food, (chicken parmesean, simply fantastic) and very good portions. Not to mention that the price is not bad either. And FREE, yes FREE coat check. Definitely the all around good spot, for good food and service!
