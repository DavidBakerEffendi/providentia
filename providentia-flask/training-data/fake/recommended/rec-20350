LOVE Tia Pol. Outstanding food, great wine list and very fun staff. Consistently well executed food. (much more consistent than some other hot Tapas restaurants). And while the wait at dinner can get crazy, the best time to go is for brunch (great brunch menu) on the weekend when you can sit at the bar and chat with neighbors and get to know the staff.
