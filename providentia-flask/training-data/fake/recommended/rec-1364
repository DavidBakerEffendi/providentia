The food is fabulous. The beer is plentiful. The crowd... UGH. It's always crowded when it's beautiful out, we need more beer gardens in Philly! All staff is super friendly, even the bouncers (That is rare!). The location is in a nice neighborhood and the prices are moderate. The only issue is that there is rarely anywhere to sit. Whenever a large group has reserved a table, they never use it which definitely annoys me.
