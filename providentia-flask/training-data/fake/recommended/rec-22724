I've been very excited to eat at Republic since it first opened; it comes from a group with a good reputation. The menu is not extensive, but has a nice selection. We were seated in a small, attractive dining room in the front of the building. I gave the restaurant a noise rating of energetic. Truthfully, it was seriously noisy. The decor is casual and it has a nice feel. The space was full and didn't feel crowded. Unfortunately the size of the room made all the sounds just bounce around. It was a Friday night so service a little too slow. It was about 5 minutes to be told "I'll be right back", and another 5 to ask about drink orders...and they another 5-10 to actually take the orders. All in all it took about 15-20 minutes to get a drink. The food was very good. It was difficult to not pick a group of apps-they all looked good. We chose the calamari, which was terrific. The burgers and fish were perfect. My au poivre burger was the best that I have had in a while. It had a number of strong ingredients and they were all well balanced. One comment, both our fry orders were chewy as soon as they cooled. My companion said that hers were that way as soon as they got there. Mine were nice and crispy when they arrived and got tough later. Since they are the standard offering with meals I think they should be perfect. I'm not sure that I will be back for a regular dinner. It's pretty pricey for burgers and fish and chips. We'll definitely be back when it's warmer. Maybe sit outside with a bottle of wine and a mix of apps.
