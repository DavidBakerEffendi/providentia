Veggie wings. Need I say more? ...No, but really. Being a vegetarian all my life, wings were probably the one thing that looked the most appetizing to me because they're doused in only the best thing in the world - HOT SAUCE! This is the only place I've ever had veggie wings, but they are so magically delicious! Must try for vegetarians!!!! Oh and the $1 chips and salsa + $3 side of guac = best. thing. ever. Cheap and yummy!
