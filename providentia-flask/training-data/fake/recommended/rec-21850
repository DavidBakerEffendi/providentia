First the not-so-great: The waiter kept telling us "it's a small portion" while we were ordering so we got 2 of a few things. The portions are not that small. Seemed like a way to make us order more. The Calamari: Not breaded but only grilled. It's a bit tough, the pieces are huge and difficult to eat. Also, they serve it on wilted lettuce. Not so great. The pizza: we got the prosciutto one. The toppings were fine but the crust was soggy in the middle. Really? I thought pizza was your specialty? Very disappointing. The rice balls: The shrimp one was really fishy tasting and also tasted reheated from frozen. NOt very good at all. The Good: The pastas! The orechiette with sausage and rapini was great. Cooked well, sauce was really light, white wine flavor and lots of garlic. The papardelle with ground veal was delish. The pasta tastes homemade or very fresh. The artichoke salad: very good and fresh, maybe lighten up on the dressing though. So, it was a mixed bag. I've had better in NYC.
