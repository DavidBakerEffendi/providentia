I'm probably the first vegetarian person writing a review for this place, which might seem odd, but the menu actually has a "vegetable" meatball on it which is completely meatless.....and completely delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect so I ordered a slider with tomato sauce along with a coupla sides.  I wasn't too excited with the sides, but the slider....wow!  Surprisingly super yummy.  I'd def go back for more and possibly try a hero or meatball smash next time.
