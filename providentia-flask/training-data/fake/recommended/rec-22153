Wonderful, tiny space. Definitely make reservations. We had to wait 30 minutes past our reserved time, but the host brought us complimentary glasses of wine, which was much appreciated. As per several other reviews, don't come here if you're starving. It's more of an experience than a meal. My fiancee and I both had the 5-course chef's selection and while it was spectacular and varied, it was not filling. Still, highly recommended!
