kings of that buttery parmesan corn, they've never failed with some tasty mexi-cubano treats. add to that some of the cutest latina servers east of the mississippi, and you've got a hit! the only draw back is that this place packs asses and elbows deep, like a nightclub. interesting crowds though, but still, no one likes tostones with a pair of ass cheeks floating too close for comfort.
