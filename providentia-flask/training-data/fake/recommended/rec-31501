We had been here twice before and loved it.  Was excited to use a restaurant.com gift cert that I had purchased.  Left it on the table so the waiter could see.  He came over picked it up - looked at the date and told me it was expired.  Now you and I both know that restaurant.com gift certs don't expire.  But I decided it wasn't worth a fight. Waiter either hated us or hated his job or was not feeling well/sick. Anyway - him reciting the specials was uncomfortable.  However - here's the skinny on our meal: Insalata mista was so vinegar-laden that it was basically inedible. I wanted to not eat it - to leave it nearly untouched - in order to send a silent message that it was not good. But I was so hungry. Black & green olives? That's kinda weird to have them both in a salad? Her roasted beet salad was delicious. Her filet was tough & the potatoes stale with burnt ends that gave them an overall smoky/burnt taste. She did say the filet was cooked to the right temp (mid rare) & the coffee was good. My shrimp fra diablo was good - sauce was very fresh.  Won't be back though. S Philly has so many good Italian restaurants, don't need to keep trying this one. Poinsettias were still out - In April. It breaks my heart to throw them out, but if I owned/ran a business they would be removed with the Christmas decorations.
