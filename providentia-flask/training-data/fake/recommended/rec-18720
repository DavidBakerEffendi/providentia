I would give Rotondos's five stars, if I did not have many negative experiences with some of the deli counter workers. The sandwiches here are EXCELLENT, however the service (at the deli counter only) leaves much to be desired. I have had frequent problems with special requests. I have received eye rolls and giggles for asking for my sandwich a particular way. Being that the sandwich is "gourmet" and on the pricier side (around 8 dollars), I expect it to be made the way I want it made. The owner and people at the checkout counter are always super sweet, but the deli counter staff could use some polishing.
