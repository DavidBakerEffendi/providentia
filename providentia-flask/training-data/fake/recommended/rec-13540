I had been hearing about this cart from so many people and I was soo excited to finally check it out myself. There's a few other Halal and Guys carts near by, but I wanted to make sure my first try at this place was from the original cart. So we waited for a mere 10 minutes.  For 6 bucks you get a pretty big platter of food!!! We walked back to our friend's apartment and ate our dinner on the living room floor- felt like the good o'l college days. The food is full of flavor and just pure goodness.  The white sauce is amazing and the hot sauce is spicy! Be careful with that stuff!! Loved the food, unfortunately my stomach wasn't big enough for it all (fail!!!), but I'm soooo glad that I finally checked this place out. It'll be one of those must go to places when I'm back in the Big Apple!
