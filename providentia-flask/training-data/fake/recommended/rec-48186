Loved it!  Skip and I went there today for the first time (we are out-of-towners so we have an excuse!!)!!!'  Skip had the Old Fashioned which included steak, provolone, peppers, onions and grilled tomatoes.  He was in seventh heaven.  I had a cheese steak hoagie with the traditional Cheese Whiz and grilled onions.  Mine was dripping with delectable delight.  Embarrassed to say we wolfed them down in a flash, washed down with a Birch Beer!  Met Sue,the owner and a delightful lady - full of energy, spirit and a great outlook on life! We have tasted a lot of different cheesesteaks in and around Philly, but have to say this was absolutely one of the very best!! Btw, it's open 24 x 7!!!
