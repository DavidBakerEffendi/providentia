Affordable amazingness!  The chicken cooked over 3 hours was the best chicken I've ever had.  So was the eggplant starter.  Toward the end of a very satisfying 7 course meal, a belly dancer unexpectedly appeared to entertain everyone in the restaurant.  Best of all, the experience didn't break the bank.
