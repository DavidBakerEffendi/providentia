food was very good if not a bit on the expensive side - wish it wasnt so i could justify coming here on a more regular basis! short rib entree and steak entree were very good. ricotta appetizer great as well. bit of a knock on service as we were seated 45 mins after our res time but it was quite busy and we were able to find a good seat at the bar - was hoping our round of drinks while we waited would get comped but oh well. waiter was fine though.
