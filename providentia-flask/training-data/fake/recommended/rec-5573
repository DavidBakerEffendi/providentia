We ate lunch there several weeks ago. Loved the physical space, the decor, and the fact the windows in front can be opened in warmer weather. The food did not meet expectations, however, as we just found it to be all right. We had the fish tacos and the brisket burrito. Both were decent but nothing special, and the later was an odd mish-mash of ingredients that did not meld well. Granted the food was perfectly prepared, but the recipes themselves need some work. Here's the odder thing, we were the only ones in the restaurant during our entire meal and got to hear the bartender in the back bitch about how she made more tips at her coffee shop job as opposed to being at Rex the previous night. To be honest, I wish she was our server, because ours seemed either goofy, slow, stoned, and/or unsure of himself. And he disappeared for most of the meal and I had to attract the bartender's attention to get the check at the end.
