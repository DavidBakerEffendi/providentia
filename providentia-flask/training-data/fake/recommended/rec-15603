ABC lived up to its hype for us! Six of us had a fantastic time. This ranks in our top ten best dinning experiences. Â  Interesting note-the dress was more casual that I would have thought. I was business casual but actually felt a little overdressed looking at everyone else (maybe because the wind chill was 0?) A drink at the bar first is a must as they have a nice selection of wines, beer and top shelf. We were seated in the first dinning room. Such an appetizing room. Fresh vegetables are displayed and the fun, dim chandeliers make for a great vibe. Our server was all about serving US. Our group had many questions about the dishes throughout the evening and she was patient and knowledgeable. Unlike so many servers these days, she would really listen to you and answer your questions completely. Everyone loved every bit of their dishes. For starters we enjoyed bow tie pasta with kasha, kale salad, carrot avocado salad, smoked salmon and ricotta. All fantastic-but the best were the pretzel calamari and mushroom pizza. For mains we all shared the salmon, organic chicken, cavatelli pasta and Akaushi cheeseburger. For sides we shared the sweet potatoes (like candy), brussel sprouts (the best I have ever had), and the mashed potatoes (full of butter and salt). We have a very talkative crew and it got very silent when the food arrived. Yes-it was that good. For dessert we shared the apple pie, cinnamon ice cream and a couple of the sundae's. Don't ask questions-just order the sundae. This was pricey but worth it. If you have an upcoming special occasion-make your reservation at ABC Kitchen.
