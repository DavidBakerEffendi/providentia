i took my boyfriend here for his 25th birthday, and let me just say that it was incredible.  the staff was very accomodating - sat us 25 minutes early!  it was the kind of meal that you eat with your eyes closed.  not only that, but the ambiance was top-notch.  it was just so romantic and cozy. to start:   -skillet braised calamari [lardo croutons, spinach and basil broth].  they split the dish into two portions... the presentation was impeccable.  i had never had calamari that wasn't fried, and this was just amazing.  there was left-over broth, and don't you worry, i asked for a spoon to finish it... and might have finished my boyfriend's too ;). my entrée:   -halibut [chive mashed potatoes and lemon creme fraiche].   simply amazing.  came with 3 lobster ravioli.  yum. his entrée:   -crispy chicken [brussels sprout homefries, lemon, sherry and dijon]. many people speak of this dish, and now we understand why.  the chicken was so juicy and delicous.  the vegetables surrounding the dish were so yummy - one of which looked a bit like an asparagus stem, but was juicier than it... i wonder what it's called?!  before he ordered this, i was worried that it would be like fried chicken, but it was delivered to the table, i was proved wrong... it wasn't how i imagined... it was just amazing... ahhh i want more. :) dessert:   -chocolate lava cake (i don't remember what it is called there, but that's what we know it as). amazingness. i give The Little Owl 5 stars... such a special experience.
