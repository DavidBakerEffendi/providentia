This was the first time I've ever been to this place. Heard rave reviews from friends about the blueberry pancakes w/ maple butter. Yelp reviews only added to that. Went there at 8am and service was fine. I had the blueberry pancakes and shared the sugar cured bacon and chorizo sides. The sides were really good, but the blueberry pancakes were average. I mean, it's not hard to make pancakes. I cook a total of like 5 things in my house and boiling pasta is one of them, and I make much better blueberry pancakes. The problem with these for me was the fact that they were too dry. Not enough blueberries in or on the pancakes, and the warm maple butter comes in a tiny ramekin. There's too much pancake for that to have much effect. It gives them a bit of a buttery, verrrrry slightly maple taste. If you want another round of warm maple butter, menu says $2. Which brings me to my last problem with them. Price. The food's good, but it's not $63 (w/o tip) for 2 people good. Next time, I go to the supermarket and do it myself.
