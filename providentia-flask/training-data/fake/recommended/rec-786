Place only accepts CASH !  Be aware! All the hype on the food network and Man Vs Food... The cheese steak wasnt the best Ive had ! Meat was a bit chewie grubbie and the bread was too soft. Ate the cheese steak and was still hungry. Went to Genos across the street to try thiers! We felt Genos was better and more flavorful!  Def worth checking out tho!
