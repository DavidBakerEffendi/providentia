Wonderful menu, warm, tailored decor, excellent service.   When I walked into the restaurant, I smelled truffles and immediately started to salivate.  Although I was not up to spending $65 for the special which was presumably the source of the heavenly aroma, I started my meal with an apetizer of the creamy polenta served with fricassee of mushrooms with truffles ($15).  It was everything I could hope for!   For my main course I ordered the black tagliolini with lobster ($28).  The pasta was clearly home-made and fresh.  My inablilty to finish my meal was due to the healthy portion size and not the quality of the food.  If I could have, I might have spent the whole night fondly nibbling at this pasta!
