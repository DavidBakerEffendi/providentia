The greeting when you walk into a restaurant is so underrated.  A 15 minute wait on a hot  day is nothing when greeted by a welcoming owner who appreciates you'll hang around for a few despite so many nearby options, so we pulled up a seat at the bar for a Peroni and sauv blanc next to the handful of patrons enjoying their dinner. Cozy Murray Hill Italian spot with lots of gluten free options for those who require them; I do not, but Bistango is an excellent option if you're making plans with someone who does. The artichoke app which was so good I decided it's time I learn to cook artichokes at home.  The chicken special (sauteed w prosciutto roasted red peppers, & buffalo mozz, served with creamy scalloped potatoes and carrots & green beans) was very satisfying and reasonably priced (specials priced out on the menu, $17).  A nice but not over-stuffed  portion.  I found eggplant ravioli with lobster & tomato basil butter to be an outstanding dish, again a nice portion with a generous amount of claw meat for $20.   Would absolutely recommend/order again. The lasting impression after an excellent meal is a handshake from the owner, a memorable 'thank you' that makes it almost impossible not to come back for more!  (Well, that...and next time I need to try the desserts!)
