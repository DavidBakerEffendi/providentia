This is a fantastic Austrian cafe! Their coffee and espresso drinks are amazing - there was a thick layer of crema on top of the coffee which was served on a little silver platter with a small glass of water, just as coffee should be. We stopped in just for a coffee, but were trapped by the deserts. I also had the bratwurst with riesling sauerkraut and potatoes which was one of the most amazing taste experiences I've had this year :) It's upscale and a little expensive, but absolutely worth it.
