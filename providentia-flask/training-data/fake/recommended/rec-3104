ArtKitchen is a welcome spot of tranquility in a long-standing (but little known) artistic enclave in Newark.  The food is great: sandwiches, breakfast items, smoothies, soups, and paninis have all been tasty every time I've tried something new.  The cupcakes usually get all the attention in this place, but the food and tea/coffee beverages need some Yelp love too.  Ambiance is relaxing and very smooth, with eclectic artist supplies for sale and lots of great info about local art events.  Really dig this place, and would recommend it to anyone who wants healthy good tasting food in downtown Newark.
