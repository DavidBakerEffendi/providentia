Fantastic service, a very satisfying menu, and just a really nice experience overall. I suspect complaints about "blandness" in the food comes from the prep, which is pretty restrained and in keeping with the locally-sourced vibe of the place. Worth seeking out; make a short walk of the High Line and end up at the 20th St. stairway... you'll be glad you discovered this cousin to 100 Acres (great brunch spot in outer SOHO). Marred slightly by the road noise of 10th Ave. Even during dinner, it can be a bit noisy and annoying when the windows are open. Can't fault the place much for that, but it's something to be aware of.
