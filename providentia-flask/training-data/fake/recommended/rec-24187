Visiting in-laws who suggested this place for lunch. Delicious! We had a group of 5 and were seated quickly around 2PM on a Thursday. The place is nicely decorated and very welcoming. Water was brought to the table and our waitress was friendly in taking our orders and giving suggestions. Our table got the smoked lox Benedict, 2x the kitchen sink, crème brûlée French toast, and steak & eggs. All very generous portions and all presented nicely. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area and looking for a good brunch/lunch place. TIP: If everyone orders a regular sized meal, you can add a kid-sized order of their red velvet pancakes to share for only $6! Very delicious and worth trying.
