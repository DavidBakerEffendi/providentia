My friends and I came here on a weekday at around 12 and we didn't have to wait at all so I can't complain about the wait time. I ordered the original burger and I thought it was okay. One of my other friends ordered the manly burger and she really enjoyed it. For the appetizers, we got the sweet potato fries and onion rings. The sweet potato fries were amazing and the sauces that it came with were fantastic. The dessert was nothing special but I'm definitely gonna come back in the future to try their other burgers.
