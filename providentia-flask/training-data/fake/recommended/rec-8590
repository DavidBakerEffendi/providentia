I completely love this restaurant, even for all its quirks. Although usually crowded, the Tiger's Tale tavern is a great place to get a (somewhat large!) meal that everyone can enjoy, if you have an hour+ to spare! Their service can be slow at times, and the atmosphere sort of loud. But, at least they have added better lighting to the place, as it used to be really dimmly lit and the whole place smokey (thankfully they solved that problem as well). I recommend the calimari, cheese sticks, cheddar burger, and brownie a la mode for a perfect dinner! :)
