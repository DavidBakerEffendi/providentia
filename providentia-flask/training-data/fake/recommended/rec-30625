sat down to dinner w/two friends after only a modest wait at one of their front tables with the bench seat. was immediately greeted by a host that put me at ease about the perceived dress code - this restaurant draws a well dressed crowd for sure, name notwithstanding. our waiter, a friendly good-looking guy, got right down to business discussing the specials and answering our questions about one combo of appetizers versus another pairing. we settled on the duck confit samosas and pizza with pickled peppers and red onion. great choice with great tastes. still, it was readily apparent that the vermont suckling pig with dried fruit mostarda was the only dish that could satisfy the taste of three decidely hungry men, two of whom were visiting from los angeles. and this follows on my wholy delicious thanksgiving dinner at campanelli's on la brea. similarly priced, these two dining experiences easily stand out either because i'm a fool from whom who's money he's easily parted or because i know good food. that said, have you tried the hudson valley rabbit duo?
