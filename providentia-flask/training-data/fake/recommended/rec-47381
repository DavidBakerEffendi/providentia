Corner Bistro is great, and I give it points for being right by my apartment!  The burgers are delicious. The atmosphere is quaint and charming.  The bartenders are old pros.  And the patrons are a mixed bag.  If you sit at the bar, you might hear an old war story from one of the more "mature" drinkers.   It's a good place for afterwork drinks, or a late night burger since it stays open til the wee hours.   Corner Bistro is definitely a place that you can count on for a good time and good food.
