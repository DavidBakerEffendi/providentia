I've been coming here pretty frequently with my colleagues after meetings. Â We never had to wait longer than 10 min to get a table even on a Friday night. We have ordered almost every appetizer on the menu, tried a few dinner specials and drinks. Great food, friendly staff. Last time we went we ordered a dessert that we didn't think was great so we left it there and continued talking. The manager came over and asked if we liked the dessert, we told him we didn't like it and he said he would make us something new (we were already stuffed). He apologized and even told us he would take it off the tab. Out of the many times we have been here the manager greets us and is always attentive.
