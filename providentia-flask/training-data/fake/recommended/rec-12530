This place is like a hidden gem from the construction going on around the location. Was recommended by a NY local to this place specifically for their pork buns. First time we went, our wait time was over an hour, so we passed. We came back another time and the wait was 2 hours, so we had to wait to see what the hype is all about. The restaurant inside was nice but the environment is loud. They have great service and all of the team would greet you on your way in and out. Tried the pork buns, 2 pork buns for $9, but we got a little too greedy after waiting 2 hours so we ordered 2 orders of it. It was good, but not really worth raving about. It tastes like freshly made pork buns, and the ramen was pretty good! They charge you extra for refills, but I'm not too sure about the pricing. Maybe we got a little too excited for a bill around $70 for a party of 2. Wouldn't mind coming back, but NY has lots to explore!
