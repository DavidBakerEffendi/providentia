OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD. If I could give Luzzo's a one million-star Yelp rating, I would. Atmosphere is great, the staff are helpful and patient with indecisive patrons (such as myself), and -- most importantly -- they serve mouth-wateringly delicious pizza. I would say, overall, that it is the best I've had in New York. Which isn't to say that it's perfect, but taking taste and quality and presentation into consideration, it is a damn delicious pie. I agree with Grant C's review -- I wish the crust had held up just a little better toward the center -- but whatever. Minor detail, really, because everything else about it was so to-die-for. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this place before! Definitely try it out; you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend the Tartufata pizza. Mmmm.
