If I could give this zero stars I would. We were seated promptly but it took a while to get our orders in and longer to get our food. If it were busy, I'd understand, but there were only 3 tables occupied at the time we were there. The food was way too salty and overpriced for the quality. When we asked for water and utensils, they never came. We had to get up and look for another waiter for our utensils. After we paid the bill, we were chased down the steps by a worker, saying that we did not provide enough tip. According to her, in NY it is required to leave your server a 20% tip and that we should stick to McDonalds if we can't fork over the money. Never has any one spoken to me in such a manner. Tip is always determined by the customer, and their judgement on the quality of service. Â Very disappointed with the customer service and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!
