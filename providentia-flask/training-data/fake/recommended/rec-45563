Excellent pastries.  I've been to this place a few times before it moved - but with the move, it is now somewhere everyone should stop.  The new building is bigger, nicer, and has an ambiance about it where the previous place had a lack. Definitely try the almond and apple one.  They are both fantastic and not too sweet.  In fact, everything I've had has tasted quite good and complex, not like sugar bread. I do wish that they labeled their pastries.  But I suppose they sell out so quickly, that it might be a waste of time.  Yes, in my experience, they tend to sell out or at least sell quite quickly.  So, it's a morning treat - and quite a treat!
