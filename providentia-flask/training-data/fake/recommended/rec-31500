This place is off the hook good. A coworker and I were in Philly for a couple of days for training, and after my first disastrous adventure with Italian on the first night, the third night decided to give it another go. Boy am I glad we did. The Artichokes were just spectacular-- some of the best I've had across the country. Grilled with Olive Oil and lemon, perfectly seasoned. Just order them if they are offering them the night you go in. Not a huge fan of the calamari, but it's wasn't bad, just not on the same level as the rest of the food I had the fish special, which was a perfectly cooked Branzino (European Sea Bass), served with sauteed green beans and a crispy polenta. Totally unbelievable. So good. Just the right amount of seasoning and garlic, and the fish was flaky and not overcooked. Their deserts all sounded good, but we decided on the cheesecake- with honey and crusted with sliced almonds. WOW. That's all I can say. The service was awesome, the cozy feel made for a perfect evening- the only downside is that it's BYOB, but other than that there's not a single negative thing to say about the place. And frankly, if we'd have realized it ahead of time it wouldn't have mattered as there's a liquor store less than a mile away and we would have stopped there first.
