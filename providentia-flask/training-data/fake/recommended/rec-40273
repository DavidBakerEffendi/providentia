I got a pizza cheese steak with onions and my girlfriend got a regular without onions. Both were unbelievable! Totally worth the 20 minute wait. I'm not really sure whether the sauce they use on the pizza is nacho cheese sauce, but it doesn't matter. Be prepared to want to nap for the next six hours. Also, I botched my order but the guys at the register were nice about it. Don't necessarily buy into the soup nazi stories about the staff.
