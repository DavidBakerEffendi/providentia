I can't wait to go back. We had a wonderful dinner. You have to get the truffle butter gnocchi and pork ragu pasta. Best of my life. We had the soft shell crab special which was good, but the pasta is the star of this BYOB. Chocolate torta dessert was out of this world. Â Service was cool and calm with great suggestions.
