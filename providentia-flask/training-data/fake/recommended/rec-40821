I am a Sri Lankan and if you are looking for authentic Sri Lankan food, this is the place to find it. I ordered the nasi gorang (not on the menu, but you can ask for it) and it was delicious. It was like eating it in Sri Lanka. My wife ordered a fish kotthu. Even though I'm not a big fan of fish in my kotthu, I had some of it and it was the best quality kotthu roti I have eaten in a long time. I recommend getting a meat kotthu rotti, just because fish is easily chopped up and you can barely see it. I got a deviled chicken as well which was very well prepared. Price is very reasonable too. The only downside is the food takes a long time to prepare (which is a good thing because you know the food is freshly made), so I suggest calling ahead (atleast 45 mins prior to arrival during prime lunch or dinner times). I am looking forward to going again soon. To the owner- please don't let your quality go down. Lot of other Sri Lankan restaurants in that area were extremely good when they first opened, but after some time the quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant kept degrading. I would also like to see a unlimited Kotthu night at least once a month (I did not know about the one you had before). Good luck to you!
