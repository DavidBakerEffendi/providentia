Short sweet and to the point. We went there on a whimp. Doesn't look like much on the outside but absoutley gorgeous on the inside! I'm Italian and know what good Italian food taste like. . And this is it! Delicious eeverything from appetizers to the hugeeeeeee aray of desert. Drinks a little on the pricey side but they make one hell of a Bellini. Deff recommend!
