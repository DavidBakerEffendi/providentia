Wasn't impressed, seemed like a great idea to make the trip on my Hayabusa with my fellow riders from DC for a steak but I can honestly say I've had better outside of Philly than Geno's so I'm confused about the whole thing.  Overpriced, very little meat, cheese whiz was ridiculously runny...so disappointed I didn't even get into the SECOND line after waiting in the long first line for steaks only to get fries.  Excuse me, "American Fries"...which by the way unlike many that work there I've served in the military 23 years and can call them whatever kind of fries I want.
