The Franklin Ave game-changer. Chavela's is an embarrassment of riches. If there's a single thing that keeps me coming back, it's the mole. Good god, the mole. A heavenly balance of sweet and savory. I could put it on just about anything. I'm guessing the only reason they don't sell it by the jar is because they'd run out every night thanks to people like me. I'm also a huge fan of their brunch, particularly the eggless plato don. I feel like such a baller when I order this thing. It comes out on a giant tray with maybe 6-8 smaller trays on top. It's what vegetarian mob bosses would eat, if such a person existed. Lastly, the place makes some mean drinks. The standard margarita and sangria on tap are both solid and affordable. There's a drink made with beet juice I also dig. Take away the food, and Chavela's would still make for a totally great bar.
