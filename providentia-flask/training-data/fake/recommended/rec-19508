I've been to this place several times, and every time, I was very pleased with the food and service.  It is little dark inside but classy.  I like the huge gold (color) Budda in the middle.  It has very traditional Asian mood but also fancy and exotic.   I have tried Crispy Calamari Salad, Sweet and Crispy Shrimp, Shrimp and Scallop Spring roll, Hot and Sour Scallops, Lobster Fried Rice, and more.  Even though, the food do not taste Asian much, they are always decent (in taste, portion, and quality).  My favorite is still the Sweet and Crispy Shrimp and Lobster Fried Rice.  I only had the Chocolate Bento Box and Buddakan Creme Brulee for dessert.  Both were descent. It is little overpriced considering Pad Thai is $18, but if you order something that has lobster or scallop, I think it is worth it because they are fresh and generous portion size.
