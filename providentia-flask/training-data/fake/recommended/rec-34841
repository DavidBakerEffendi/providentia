I tried Dos Toros for the first time last night as I had heard some great things from friends who live in the area. I had a carne asada burrito which was pretty average. What makes a burrito for me is the tortilla and DT's tortilla was probably the worst part of the burrito in my mind. It was a little crunchy and made a bites' texture a little different than what a burrito bite should be like. The meat was actually seasoned pretty well and maybe next time I will try something tortilla free (carne asada salad with quacamole could be yummy). The burrito was definitely big/filling but a little pricey (compared to equally filling/quality burritos from chipotle/qdoba). Will probably give it another shot and see if they can change my mind but for now...pretty average.
