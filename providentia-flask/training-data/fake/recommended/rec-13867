Real hand made noodles are hard to come by in my neck of the woods.  For some reason, it just hasn't caught on yet.  Needless to say, when I'm in Asia I get my fix.   I ordered the beef tendon soup noodles because I like the chewy texture.  The noodles here are hand made; the thickness of the mein varied from angel hair to linguine.  They were cooked a little too done for my taste but were still good.   The tendon pieces were very tender and not tough at all.  Overall, a great value and you can save your hard earned cash for drinks at Apotheke next door.
