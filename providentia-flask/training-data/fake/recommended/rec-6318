Seriously yum. Their patatas bravas are the stuff dreams are made of. We went on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm for dinner before a 9:30 movie at the SVA theater. We were told there would be a 40 minute wait which ended up being all of 15 minutes or so. It is nice because even seats at the bar are overseen by the hostess which moves the wait list along. Although we didn't have one, they do take reservations five days in advance for groups less than 10 people. We tried the patatas bravas (drool worthy), gambas al ajillo, ramps with romesco, and asparagus with an egg on top. The ramps and the asparagus are spring specials and worth trying! I would bathe in the romesco sauce if I could. The gambas themselves were overdone but the olive oil they were in was divine. Good thing they bring bread to soak it up! Our server as well as the hostess were friendly and efficient! No complaints there. Total bill was $96 for the two of us which included a $42 half bottle of wine. I'll be back Tia Pol!
