5 stars for the amazing, well-balanced dishes in terms of color, texture, and flavor 3-4 stars for the ambience and rushed nature of eating in a very busy, crowded space 3 stars for the absurdly long menu that needs to be edited down to their 20 best dishes 2 stars for the single bathroom and line that took 10 minutes (with only a weak hand dryer and no paper towels) My friend and I ordered a chicken soup, the fried taro appetizer, and the green curry with chicken made mild at our request. The soup and curry were AMAZING. I have not had such great well-balanced flavor in years. Not too salty, not too sweet. Just perfect. I am dying to go back and try other dishes. The only thing that confused me is that I saw at least 6 tables that ordered the pad thai which appeared very monotone in color and un-memorable. On the other hand, I was raving about our soup and entree the entire night and next day!
