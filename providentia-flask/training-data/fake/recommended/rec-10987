A New England native who doesn't consider a summer well-spent unless it included a visit to Maine, I was excited for my first visit to the Red Hook Lobster Pound. We decided to take advantage of the Wednesday special ($20 for the meal which is usually $25...a 1.5lb lobster, corn, coleslaw, and potato salad). While the food was good (also including the Connecticut-style lobster roll we ordered), our experience hit a sour note when the counterperson informed us that the special only included either the coleslaw OR the potato salad, not both. We were confused, because both the menu board in the restaurant and the website clearly said that you received the exact same usual lobster meal for 5 bucks less. She shrugged and said no, you get both on every day except today. A half hour later while we were finishing up our food, a couple sat nearby us and had almost the exact same conversation we had after finishing ordering, commenting on the way the restaurant duped patrons and making sarcastic remarks about having to pay for every little thing. The lobster was great, the corn was great, the atmosphere was fun, and generally the prices seem good; I don't understand why they would feel the need to be deceptive on their website and menu to draw in customers. Easy to fix and we probably still would have gone there anyway--but not left feeling resentful! My only other complaint is that their only two sides (potato salad and coleslaw) are both mayonnaise-based. ideally both, but at least one, really should be vinegar- or mustard-based.
