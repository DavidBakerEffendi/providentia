Very thoughtfully laid out in decor in every way.  The furniture and bar are beautifully finished and everything seems to work together to compliment the whole. (the large Sea Witch mural , the curved facade of the entrance)  The ceiling lights are large woks that have the constellations drilled into them.  The ceiling is painted a midnight blue and the effect is that of being inside a boat on the ocean at night.  The fish tank behind the bar gives the effect of looking out from  a portal out from the ship' s hold.    The menu is great,  very affordable foods of many varieties.    The beer list is very potent and eclectic !!
