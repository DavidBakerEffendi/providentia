Brazi's is old school italian. It's heavy, delicious and a calorie splurge. What you'll notice when you walk into Brazi's for the first time is that I'm pretty sure the decor has not been updated since the place opened.  It's about the opposite of modern and sleek.  Luckily the service and food make up for it.  Each meal starts with a basket of freshly baked rolls...some were even pepperoni rolls if I recall correctly.  Their menu also has a lot of the italian classics - veal parm, lots of pork chops, pastas, pizzas, etc.  My absolute favorite thing to get when I come here is the spicy calamari - served in a spicy marinara sauce.  I've also enjoyed their pork chops with broccoli rabe.  I also recommend the Brazi house wine. It's pretty good!  The service here is usually spot-on as well. Friendly and formal. Thumbs up for Brazi.
