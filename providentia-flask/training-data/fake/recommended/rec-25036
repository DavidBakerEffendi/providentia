fairmount pizza is my go-to place when on my way home from the bar or too lazy to cook. I always get the food to go, as I live nearby. Most of their to-go food is packaged in styrofoam, so skip the fries...they will be a soggy mess by the time you get them home. I used to die for their Buffalo Chicken Rustic Sandwiches, but last time i had it, it was just a chicken breast with buffalo sauce on a roll. Definitely failed on that one, they should have stuck with the original. Bottom line - if you're getting home from the bar and you're hungry, or you're just too lazy to cook, grab a pizza and some apps (again, not the fries. The mozzarella sticks arent great either) then this place will do the trick. Breakfast menu could be improved by adding a couple of sides, like hash brown patties to the menu. Its basic, convenient food. Not great, but not disgusting either.
