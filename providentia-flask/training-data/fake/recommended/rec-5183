Lamb gyro platter: yummy!! The lamb gyro meat was tender and very flavorful; the pita was a little tough and tasted weird to me but it was edible haha; the rice was good but their lemon potato was really awesome!!! Much better than "greek fries"; this was a pretty healthy serving of food for $13 and worth it I would totally go back there to dine in; it's super cute and it's definitely more authentic than other Greek places
