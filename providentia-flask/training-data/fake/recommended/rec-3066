Listen, this place is all about authenticity and top quality that speaks for itself. No wonder the truck by 44th St/4th avenue is consistently packed - top quality tacos for the awesome price range of $1.50-$2.00? Hell yeah I'd be a regular if I lived a bit closer. Keep up the good work. Places like these are the ones that make others like La Esquina weep.
