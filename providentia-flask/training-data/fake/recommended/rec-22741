This was my first visit to Azucar.  My girlfriend and I had a gift certificate for restaurant.com and we had a choice of several different restaurants on Franklin Ave.  We picked Azucar having never heard of it because of its Italian/Cuban menu which we thought was very interesting.  We figured we would choose items from both and share.   When we arrived we were very surprised to find the place entirely empty.  There wasn't even a hostess, bartender, or even a customer to be found.  After looking around a few minutes a chef/waiter arrived and seated us back into the restaurant.  The dining area was fine except for a weird vibration under our seats.  The chef/waiter ended up being the owner.  He seemed nice, but not overly talkative.  We asked why the place was so slow and he blamed the summer and it was the weekend before July 4th, which I guess was a good point.  The bathroom were also a bit gross.  But, not a huge deal.   To this point I know I have been a bit rough.  But, I hope you are still reading because here is the good part.  The food was outstanding!!!  Definitely one of Hartford's best kept secrets.  We ordered based on the recommendations of the owner and we were very impressed.  Lack of decor or not, we will definitely be back because the most important part - the food - was well worth the trip.  We also had some fairly good mojitos and the price was reasonable for the entire meal.  Perhaps on my next visit I will be able to move it to four stars.
