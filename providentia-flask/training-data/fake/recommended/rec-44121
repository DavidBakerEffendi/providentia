Rye is a whole new level of luscious.  Yes, other places have charted the Prohibition-era American traditional cuisine with classic cocktails course, but Rye rocks the hell out of it. The Havemeyer Cocktail?  Tasty, Manhattan-like, & fulfilling.  The Improved Tequila Cocktail?  Intriguing and indulgent.  The Southside?  Crisp and refreshing.  The short rib terrine?  Perfect blend of flavors, rich and crisp falling on top of each other.  The pork belly? Oh my god, yes. Give me more give me more give me more give me more. I don't care that they don't take credit cards.  I don't care that it shows that they're not fully up and running just yet.  I don't care that the hostess got up from her meal with her table of 8 to greet us and direct us to the bar.  Rye just vaulted itself into my personal top favorite places to eat in Williamsburg and I expect for it to stay there quite some time.
