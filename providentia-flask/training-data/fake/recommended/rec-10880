Yum. Yum, yum, yum. Yum to the power of 10. I really don't know what else to say except [insert ecstatic food swooning noises here]. The fried chicken and waffles are a revelation -- I swear they double-dip the fried chicken, the skin is crunchy and golden and light and perfectly seasoned, the chicken meat is juicy and tender, and the buckwheat waffles are beautifully crisp on the outside but not the least bit grainy (as buckwheat can sometimes get), doughy or cakey on the inside. A side of grits, cooked so they aren't gummy or runny but at the right consistency to take with a dollop of butter and a dash of hot sauce, completes the perfect brunch. And while I was way too satiated to eat another bite, I simply had to order one of their homemade doughnuts to go -- I think it was the lemon curd-filled pistachio doughnut. I believe it was the best doughnut I've ever tasted. Even the coffee is fantastic. I am most definitely coming back for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. And there goes my diet...but with food this delicious, who cares?
