Incredible customer service and delicious food once again at Jones. My party of six people was late getting out of a show and we were 30 minutes late for our reservation. The restaurant was packed and without shaming us for being late, the Jones staff worked to get us space (pushing two smaller tables together). The host especially was good humored and efficient in keeping our hungry party occupied for the ten minute wait. So appreciative of that! The wait staff was smiling and friendly on a busy night and the food was scrumptious. Two of us got the grilled salmon, two got burgers and the others hearty sandwiches. And I cannot ever pass up a bowl of the Matzoh Ball soup at Jones! Thanks, we'll be back soon!
