These guys have opened two DAYTIME carts BUT THEY ARE NOT ON THEIR USUAL CORNER.  They can be found on the SE corner of 53rd and 6th and the NW corner of 52nd & 6th during the day.  They are STILL at their normal spot at night. During the day, don't be fooled by the knockoff cart on the normal  (SW) corner at 53rd & 6th .. They have a line down the block and yellow hoodies on for unsuspecting patrons.  Not until you notice the chicken looks funny and the sign has changed slightly, and the bags aren't yellow, do you feel like a silly person for being duped.
