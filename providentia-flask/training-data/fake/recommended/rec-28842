ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PLACE!!! Had the opportunity to hang out with friends here today. It is a big place and in warmer weather, has a very large back patio. There is also a full-sized ping pong table and Jenga sets. During the day, it is very family friendly. The food is delicious. I got the German platter which had great salami, ham, and liverwurst, which was great, as was the schnitzel. It is definitely worth the trek to get here, and it is a great spot to spend a casual afternoon.
