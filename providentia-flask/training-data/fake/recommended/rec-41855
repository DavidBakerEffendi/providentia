Absolutely LOVE this place...  an impressive list of all things whiskey, with tasting notes for each variety the bar carries.  They have a quality selection of specialty drinks as well if you're in the mood for something other than a whiskey neat.   Whiskey is a Southern specialty, and the decor definitely matches that ideal.  I feel very much like I'm hanging out in an old Tennessee tavern.  It's a comfortable, welcoming spot, perfect for sharing an evening with a smaller group of friends.   On to food... I was starving and had the appropriately priced Pulled Pork sandwich.  I'm always a fan of food that doesn't leave me feeling weighed down, and this sandwich did the trick.  I wouldn't say it's a great deal, but $7 for a good sandwich is more than acceptable.  I was able to finish it off and continue with another drink without feeling like I needed to loosen my belt a few notches. I love this place
