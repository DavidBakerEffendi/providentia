Holy shit. I've never ever ever ever had fileted (read: cooked by a white person) fish that I enjoyed. Until now. This sea bass, man. I don't even know. It was absurdly good. Perfectly cooked. Seasoned well and just done. I don't eat fish that's cooked until it flakes. What is that about btw? The only time that's acceptable is at McDonald's because it's not fish anymore, just a vehicle for tartar sauce. Anyway, I won't bastardize this review with any more mentions of fast food. Bread with tomato olive oil - I knew this place was going to be a winner when I tasted this. Also the bread hangs from a basket hanging from the ceiling. Yea, I'm a fucking sucker. Get at me. Seafood chowder - So buttery. There were only a couple chunks of fish amongst the veggies no actual seafood. I was hoping for some scramps and maybe a clam but whatever. Still delicious Mussels Provençal - Yes. Just yes. Get more bread, suck all the mussel meat outta their shells and start dunking. When you're out of bread, introduce the bowl to your face, don't let go til it's empty. Worry not kids, sand = fiber. Sea bass special - Fish done right. So so right. FINALLY. Good job white people! Oh mash and veggies on the side were also bangin. We got here late, there was only one other table of some majorly randy Brazilians. And I mean RANDY. There was a foot massage, swallowing each others faces, groping and all the lovely noises that go with it. I'd never felt like a sexually repressed Asian/American up until that point.  Whatever though. They could've boned and I'd still stay for the sea bass.
