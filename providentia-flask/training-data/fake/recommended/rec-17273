Absolutely love this place!  I hosted my mother's 70th birthday in a private room of theirs for 35 people and everyone had an amazing time and absolutely loved the food.  Their menu selections are great, the pricing is great and you cannot go wrong for the amount of food and beverage you get on their party package menu. Time and time again this place and the food never disappoints.   Do yourself a favor though and plan ahead for a weekend meal there as you can wait for over an hour or two for a table from Friday - Sunday and they do not take reservations.  It's that good!
