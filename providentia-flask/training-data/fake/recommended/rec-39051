Ate here late October. Well dressed wall street crowd and loud room. Outstanding service - efficient and friendly. I had chicken with lemon which was tasty and wife had pasta special which was bland. Good wine selection by bottle, but limited by glass. Food was good but not excellent. Complementary grappa was wonderful and an unexpected treat at a fine dining place. Pricy as befits the address but a nice experience. Would try again when in NYC.
