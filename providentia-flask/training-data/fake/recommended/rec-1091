Being a native to the suburban area...it was always Pat's.  I've learned my lesson.  I found others that blow it away from the meat, to the cheese, to the bread.  The one thing that is the stigma is the price.  $9!  Nine freaking dollars for a cheesesteak!  Shame!  Good bye Pat's.  Thanks for the memories.
