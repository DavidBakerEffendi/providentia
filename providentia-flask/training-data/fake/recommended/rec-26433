I've eaten at the Irvine, CA location many times when I lived there so I was surprised that they made it to Korean town in New York!   This location is very big and as busy as they were, we didn't have to wait full 30 minutes as we were originally told.  Friendly hostess but the wait staff so so. They have the best rice it's so tasty and the fried fish goes very well with the rice. I highly recommend the seafood tofu soup and since I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, they are very good at making it mild.  I've been to some restaurants where their "mild" is at least medium... I know there are sooo many restaurants to choose from in Korean town but this one is a must!
