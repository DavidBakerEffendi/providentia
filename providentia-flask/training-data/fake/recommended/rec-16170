I absolutely adore this place. The atmosphere is authentically old-world European. The food is phenomenal. I think I've tried every bruschetta and couldn't possibly pick a favorite if I had to. Their wine list is wonderful, very comprehensive in terms of having both new world wines and old world wines as well as a wide selection of varietals and more unique wines like the sparkling red served in a bowl (definitely worth trying). The staff is pretty good in light of the fact that the restaurant is usually very packed. They haven't all been very well versed in wines, but there is always someone on duty who knows what they are talking about. This is a great place to meet friends (albeit a little loud) or take friends from out of town. It's so lively and buzzing with good chatter and laughter. The covered patio is great in the winter and summer. Dinner can add up, especially if you get an appetizer, drink and dessert (which you should). If you're looking to keep costs down, go early and do a flight of wines for their happy hour and grab an appetizer or two. I can almost gaurantee you'll have a great time.
