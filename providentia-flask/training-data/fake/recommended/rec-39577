The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the lack of air conditioning inside. It's open air so going here while it's 80+ degrees outside isn't a good idea. BUT the food is excellent! The calamari appetizer tastes so fresh & is soooo chewy. And the service is impeccable - everytime I go here, i get the same quality of service from their staff.
