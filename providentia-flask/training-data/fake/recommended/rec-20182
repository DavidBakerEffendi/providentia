I have been to Cafe Luluc twice.  Once for an early dinner and another time for the brunch.  I loved both meals.  I thought the menu looked quite simple on paper, but the classic choices were sensational. For example, I avoid chicken sandwiches when dining out as they are usually dry and bland.  Not so at Cafe Luluc.  It is a must order.  They also make a great espresso and yes, the pancakes are good enough to fight your momma. The restaurant itself is lovely and the back garden is quiet and comfortable.
