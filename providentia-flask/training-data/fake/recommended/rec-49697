Awesome food. We had Moo Krob larb salad (crispy pork). Amazing texture. Very crispy. Right amount of veggies with it. And spicy. We also had Duck pad ped. Duck was slightly over cooked. The taste was awesome. Â Again right amount of spicy. Overall good food. There was no waiting since we went a little before 7. But the place was full by about 7.30. Food arrived on time.
