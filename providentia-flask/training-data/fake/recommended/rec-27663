This is the best deli in NJ ( true story)! Â I have been going to Belgiovine's for over 2 years now and if its possible it keeps getting better. You have to try the rice balls, best I have ever had ( and I like me a good rice ball). In the past it was a hit or miss to get them but recently they started having them more and to top it off this week they started packaging them with just enough sauce. Next-- The sandwiches are amazing! Fresh and very filling. I always get the same thing because its so good. Its called "cheese lover" sandwich. I add a chicken cutlet, which is hands down another tasty treat. When I get home warm it up and I call it my ultimate grilled cheese. IF its not to many calories at this point, stop at the freezer for the ice cream that cup in the glass cups. I think I have tried them all and they are EXCELLENT!
