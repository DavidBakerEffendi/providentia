I have MOSTLY good things to say about this place. The atmosphere varies widely depending on the time of day you go. During the afternoon it's pretty pleasant and I like to hang out, drink some coffee and get some work done. Granted, this is Windsor Terrace/Park Slope, so after school gets out it becomes incredibly loud and full of children. Service is generally friendly and attentive, but they started doing table service on weekends and I don't think they have figured out an efficient way to serve tables and take to go orders at the same time. You can also bring wine here which is a major plus. I'm really happy they have vegan options for both lunch and dinner. I've tried the tempeh, lettuce, tomato and avocado sandwich and the vegan scramble. Both were Â enjoyable and tasty, but I recommend eating there as the food doesn't seem to hold up when you take it to go. I also got roasted carrots and kale as a side dish once and the flavor was perfect. The carrots had cumin and cinnamon on them I think? Whatever it was it tasted good.
