*sigh* I really really wanted to like this place because I am a Texan and I have faith in all things Texas BUT I just didn't. When I arrived I ordered an ice tea, just tea and it took over 15 mins for my tea because I guess they were washing cups? That rubbed me the wrong way but I thought no biggie. We ordered Chips and Queso as an appetizer and the Queso was soooooo bland, nothing like the Queso at home, it lacked flavor, it was thinner than what I'm used to, just a failed attempt at the dish. For my main dish I ordered a loaded baked potato stuffed with brisket because at home it's a delicious dish and I was so happy they had it. It was such a disappointment, the potato was small, just regular sized and it was undercooked, the inside was pretty firm, it lacked in the amount of butter and cheese, and the brisket was very subpar. Usually, this particular dish is served and the potato is basically falling apart because of all of the butter and cheese being melted by the hot meat in an already hot potato, it's usually pretty epic but not here. I don't want to give up on the place because I am a Texan and I believe in all things Texas. I'll probably give them another chance but I was just not impressed.... At all.
