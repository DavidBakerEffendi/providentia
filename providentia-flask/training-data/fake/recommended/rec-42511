This classic café is a favorite in our family... Well, it's actually a business I've been hearing about for years and years, since it's "the place" my husband and his brother go every visit to NYC.  I finally made my way in on a recent visit, and was able to experience it myself.  Needless to say, I can totally see why they love it so much! CG may be small in size but it's huge in personality and flavor.  It's casual, but amazing for people-watching, getting a drink, a bite, or all of the above.  It's very European, and sitting inside (or out if you're lucky to get one of the few outdoor tables), makes you feel like you've been whisked away to a place where you can escape the daily grind (whatever your daily grind may be). It was a Thursday afternoon when we made our way in for a drink and snack.  We sat outside, chatted with a couple of other guests and staff including Lindsey, the hostess, who couldn't have been friendlier.  Jared went with a coffee and I had a mint tea, and we shared the cheese plate. The plate was fabulous, but it's worth noting that there were a ton of other things on the menu that looked pretty incredible... I wish I could go back to try some of the other items.  Hopefully next visit! If you're vegetarian or just looking for a lite bite or drink, you cannot go wrong at Cafe Gitane.  One thing to note: cash only!
