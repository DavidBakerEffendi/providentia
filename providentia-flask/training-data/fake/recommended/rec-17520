LOVE LOVE LOVE THE PORK BUNS!!! Went recently with a girl friend of mine and we were so stuff.  We finished everything.  The Ramen was great.  We sat around the mirror and found the decor of the restaurant to be pretty unique.  The services was great.  It is a little pricey for ramen but it was worth it.   There was a pretty long wait at 9pm.  I will definitely be going back.
