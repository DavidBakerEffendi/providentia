Wow, Best Green Chili this side of the Mississippi! Went for lunch with a friend, I had a lunch combo burrito and taco, she had the taco salad. 1st - The taco was served with two soft corn tortillas and diced up steak piled on top just like the food trucks all over the southwest. It is served as one taco with enough meat to separate and make two if you prefer as I do. 2nd - Pork carnitas not pulled pork for those who don't know any better. Â Burrito had plenty of pork and potatoes I asked for mine SMOTHERED!!. This is the WOW part as this was the best green chili I've had since I moved from Denver. Good flavor, just enough heat to make your mouth tingle. Taco salad was plain - spend the calories and order some real Mexican food. Combo comes with rice and beans, plenty of food, just the right portion size for just the right price. I'll be back, next time for breakfast.
