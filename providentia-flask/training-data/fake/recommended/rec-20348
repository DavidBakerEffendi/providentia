i want soooo badly to love lucali!! i'm trying!! granted, i've only done take out so far, but that's because it's so effing hard to get a foot in there. before moving in, my (at the time potential) roommates (hey, guys!) told me about how delicious/authentic/renowned is it, and i couldn't wait! my first take out experience was soured by the fact that they never called, we never called, and we ended up picking up cold pizza. then, on a whim, i decided to go for one of the calzones i've heard so much about. i think it was garlic and basil. it was good! but they didn't give me any sauce (which i specifically asked for) because they didn't have to-go containers. bwah?! so, the perfect crispy-on-the-outside-but-doughy-on-the-inside crust was good, but would have been better dipped in warm marinara. oh, and i liked the fact that it was flat as opposed to ballooned like most calzones. better crust to cheese ratio! i'm gonna give it a few more shots. it does look really nice inside. step up your game, lucali! don't let me down.
