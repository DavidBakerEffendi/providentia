My husband and I kept going back to this place hoping it would be worth it, but it really isn't. The service is friendly but ridiculously slow. We've eaten there at least four times, and every time, it seems like there are four waitresses working a practically empty restaurant and yet our drink orders are forgotten and they don't take our order for 15 minutes. I normally don't mind bad service, but slow service is really frustrating (especially when you're hungry). The food itself is hit or miss. Don't be tempted by all the "homemade" sodas and lemonades they have, which are really just fruit syrup mixed with sodas. The pulled pork was decent, as are the sides. Some of the cakes are fairly good, others just seem like box mix. As I said, hit or miss. We gave it a fair shot, but we won't be returning again.
