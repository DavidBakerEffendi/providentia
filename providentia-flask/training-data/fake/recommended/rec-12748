I love meatballs. Ha. They're so good. And this place makes them in all kinds of yummy varieties. You can go healthy or full or fat.. No matter how you play it... Guaranteed tasty. But I recommend just going for the fat, right??! Yolo. Ya I said yolo Whatevs. So I got the beef meatball with veggies all smothered with cheese and a ridiculous amount of pesto. They def do not skimp on the sauce. And I freaking love that. I'm like the extra ketchup type of girl. So just try this place out. It's small and cozy inside. It makes you feel good, and the food makes you feel better!
