We split the banana and walnut pancakes between the three of us.  I thought they were pretty delicious but I've been told the blue berry are the best.  In addition I also tried the biscuit breakfast sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon, just wonderful.   Btw, the wait is normally going to be pretty long.  They told us it would be a two hours wait so we walked around the area for an hour.  We came back after an hour and were seated right away.  So don't be too discouraged as they seem to move people through there pretty fast, and I assure you it will be worth the wait!
