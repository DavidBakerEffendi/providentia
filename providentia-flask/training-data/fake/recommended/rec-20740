There is no better noodle option on a sweltering summer day than the cold soba at Cocoron. Â The flavors of Cocoron soba are intense and savory, but the cold buckwheat noodles are light and incredibly refreshing, creating the perfect counterbalance of temperature, taste, and texture. I recommend the sukiyaki soba, which comes with a cold pile of chewy buckwheat noodles and a separate bowl with beefy, herby dipping sauce. Get a poached egg and add it to the broth for extra thickness - this makes the sauce stick better to the noodles. Don't forget to use the big wooden spoon to catch the drippings of every yummy bite :) Eating soba is something of a learned art, but the waiters at Cocoron are more than willing to teach the uninitiated. There's also adorable comics about soba inside the menu! I haven't tried Cocoron's hot soba, but that looked really good as well, and a surprising number of people seem to order their soba hot even in warm weather.
