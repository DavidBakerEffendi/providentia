Crappy old infrastructure, tight space, seemingly dark and dirty, although in a great location and makes terrific burgers. Can't help to love places with old school charm. Top 3 burger in the city, 3 dollar drafts. Good to top in for a burger if there's no wait, or a quick beer before walking around meat packing.
