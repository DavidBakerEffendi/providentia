Want to be on stage? Literally This place gives you those 15 minutes of fame...or maybe more, if you opt for a boozy brunch! I came here with some friends and sat at the table that's on a mini stage by the window...waived at passing admirers...perfect Hollywood fix! ;) For a $15 brunch you get a brunch item, coffee or tea and a drink. Drinks are $5 btw (fancy ones too)! The food was delicious! I had the breakfast pizza and ginger-rita! Definitely heading back there soon
