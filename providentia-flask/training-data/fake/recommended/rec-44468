Food is great! We come a few times a week. They seem hard on there employees , a lot of turn over in staff. Would give 5 stars but staff not very accommodating making substitutions. An example would be small fruit cup instead of home fries (like my friend was getting with his egg white omelette). They say no - that we would have to buy big fruit plate in addition - otherwise they'll get in trouble with their management. Most places would just charge a dollar or two for substitutions. Also front desk staff not very friendly. Â They see us all the time (2 - 3 times per week) and act as if they don't know us. Not good! They should recognize and appreciate loyal and repeat customers.
