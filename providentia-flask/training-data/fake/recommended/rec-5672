I went to Philadelphia to work on a golf tournament. Went out with a few people from work to enjoy some Philly night life, after a long day of living and breathing golf, and this place really hit the spot. I have to agree that the place is quite trendy, but it was a change of pace, since people don't often find me at trendy places. The decor was very vibrant and eye catching. I remember watching people sitting on upper deck of the restaurant. Their chairs looked like golden, egg shaped bird nests. The food was fantastic. Loved the fries, which were thinly sliced into curly bunches and then deep fried, making for crispy, crunchy potato goodness. The high lights of the night were the lobster mac and cheese and Philly cheese steak egg rolls. I'm not a big fan of heavy food, but the mac and cheese was surprisingly delicious. They used orzo instead of noodles, the cheese sauce was bursting with flavor, but light, and they were not stingy on the lobster pieces. The Philly Cheese Steak egg rolls were another great surprise. The egg roll wrapping provided a lovely crunchy texture that contrasted well with the juicy, succulent filling of beef and cheese. I cook and have my own cooking blog (foodforhunters.blogspot.â€¦). The cheese steak egg rolls I had at the Continental Midtown is something I'd like to adapt using wild duck instead of beef. I can't give this place 5 stars because it is on the pricy side.
