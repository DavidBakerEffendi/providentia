One of the most over hyped place in Brooklyn and apparently on Yelp. I am not sure how it is for breakfast or lunch but definitely NOT great for dinner.   the wait is too long but I dont mind the wait for a good food. The food is just average and super overpriced.    If i come back again or you planning a visit definitely order 4 orders of Crostini.... or better yet - get some General Tso from Wong Cho around the corner
