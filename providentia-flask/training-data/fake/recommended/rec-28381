Sanford's Restaurant has become a regular spot for my girlfriend and I. Initially it started as our brunch spot of choice on the weekends as they do a package brunch for 14 dollars. This package includes a brunch item plus a choice of two mimosas, or bellinis. The brunch food there is excellent and for the price can't really be beat in the area. Recently however my girlfriend and I went there for dinner. It was an amazing upgrade from the brunch menu. The dinner menu is sophisticated and delicious. Once again the price for the food we got was amazing. We shared two entrees... Pork Osso Buco and Garlic Roast Chicken. We also got this spanish organic wine called Botoni, which I highly recommend. The desert we ordered was amazing too... I wish I remembered what it was called so I could recommend it, but it was the first listed on the menu and a recommendation of the waiter. The staff is friendly and very inviting. I highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't been there before!
