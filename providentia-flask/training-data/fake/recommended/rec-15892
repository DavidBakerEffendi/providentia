We sat in the cute patio area in the back, which maintained a nice ambiance.  The menu had an array of options, though mostly just sweets (chocolate pancakes or crepes) and omelettes.  The pricing was fair.  None of us got the brunch special (breakfast + side + cocktail) but that seemed like a good deal.  We all really enjoyed our food!  Service was quick and respectful as well :)
