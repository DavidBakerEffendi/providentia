Spent 10 days in NYC and visited Balthazar 3 times. Every trip to the city includes at least one visit to Balthazar's. I have to say that the food in the restaurant is good. It is consistent and always has attention to detail. The bakery is always amazing. I give the bakery 5 stars, every time. The service in the restaurant is awful. Just awful. I get better service at the Waffle House driving down the highway then at this restaurant. After being in the foodservice industry with my wife for a combined time of 30+ years, we know the difference between good and great restaurants. The food at this restaurant is great. The bread is great. The bakery is great. The restaurant could care less about the quality of service, the communication between front of house staff and most importantly that the guest ever comes back. The name "Balthazar" is synonymous with NYC restaurants, but do yourself a favor and go down a few blocks and get great food AND great service at Lombardi's, get some amazing rice pudding at Rice to Riches and then go back and get some goodies from the bakery at Balthazar's. Don't waste your money supporting a restaurant that truly does not care about great service, great atmosphere and having return customers.
