I came to Jane for brunch with a bunch of friends. We had a reservation, so they accommodated us almost immediately. The food was very good. I had the special eggs Benedict with salmon and they were delicious. The ambience was really nice too, it wasn't that loud despite being packed. We had a wonderful time there and the service was also very helpful. Even being more than 6 in the table (that sometimes irritates waiters).
