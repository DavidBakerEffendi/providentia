I can't say enough about Barboncino. It's such a gem in the neighborhood. The staff is attentive, the ambiance quaint and personal, and the pizza... THE PIZZA! Delish. Melt in your mouth. During warmer months they have a cute and romantic backyard area to dine. Just beware the 'squitos. All in all, Barboncino is a no-brainer for a great (and affordable!) dinner out.
