I try to travel to New York for my birthday and try new restaurants each time. I read the reviews for this place and figured I HAD to try it.  When we walked up to the "restaurant" I was a little shocked.  People said it was a hole in the wall but I didnt think they meant literally.  We ordered the dumplings and I think our total bill was 7 bucks.  I was hesitant about the food and then I took my first bite.  BEST DUMPLINGS !!! just close your eyes and enjoy because they are amazing
