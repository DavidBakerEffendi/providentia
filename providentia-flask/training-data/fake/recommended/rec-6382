Had a terrible brunch here. High points were the decor, the bloody Mary and the coffee. Low points were the pretentious 80's hip hop, the French toast swimming in sauce, the stale cookies and the server who was consistently nowhere to be found. The worst part though was the burger. Well done when ordered med rare, flavorless and juiceless. For $14. Worst burger I've had in years and that's saying a lot...sorry anella I wanted to like you so bad.
