You've seen Man v. Food, you hear your friends tell you to "Try the Philly Cheesesteak!", and you ask locals where the best is around... you get Pat's! We were visiting and we had to stop here. Trekked from downtown to the train, then walked half a mile to this area and we get two places to pick from. We split up and each got one from this place and the other place. First of all, I have NEVER had cheez wiz before (like EVAR!) and this wiz wit cheesesteak was SOOOOOO GOOD! Their provolone one not so much. I like the bread from Pat's better than Geno's and the meat is juicier, tenderer, and just overall better tasting. Second, service is quick and friendly. Luckily, we read the website so we knew how to order and not hold up the line. WIZ WIT WIZ WIT WIZ WIT! Is there any way you can send an order of wiz with to CA!? lol
