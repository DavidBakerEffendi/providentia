I have to give it up to this place if your looking for a punk rock rock bar it doesn't get much better then this. Cheep ass drinks (cheeper if you have a chip...ask your friends if you don't know) good bar food, not a whole lot of vegan options but the fries are pretty good. The 2 jukeboxes, one upstairs one down, have everything from Jawbreaker to Fear. Two pool tables. Great staff. All the writing on the wall you can shake a stick at. I went here A LOT so speaking from experience it's easy to get burned out on it but it's always chill durring the day and on tuesdays you can get 1 dollar pbrs and 1 dollar tacos, bean tacos if your veggie without cheese if your vegan. Only drawback...it's on south street.
