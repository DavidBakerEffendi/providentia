Be ready to wait ...a long time! I've been going to this place for over 10 years now. I only eat vegetarian/seafood now and I'll never stop coming here (unless they piss me off, which I highly doubt). All of there dishes are good, the margaritas are good. If I go back to eating meat, no matter where I am in the US, my first dish will be the gumbo. I have NEVER had such good gumbo in my life! My favorite dishes are the Blackened Swordfish, Catfish New Orleans (and I don't even like catfish), and the Cajum Popcorn Appetizer, and the Camptown Shrimp appetizer. If you can...ask for an extra roll! They are so yummy. Ok I gotta run and head to Jersey, I need a fix!
