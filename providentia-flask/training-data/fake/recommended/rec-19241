It was just ok. I don't know...after reading all the glowing Yelp reviews, I expected more. But I guess I shouldn't compare dim sum in LA or San Francisco with that in Philly. I don't mean that to sound elitist (although it sure sounds snotty), because based on sheer numbers of the Asian population in those areas compared to Philly, of course you're going to find better dim sum places in SoCal or NorCal. The good things first--the new restaurant location (I never visited the old location, so I can't compare, but previous reviewers commented on the old location) is nice. The restaurant is very close to the downtown convention center, and easy to get to from there. Relatively safe and clean looking neighborhood for Chinatown too. The interior of the restaurant was clean and pretty too, and the waitstaff all wore tshirts with cute cartoon smiling dim sum dumplings on them.  The prices are all very low, so low that I was a bit surprised at the number of dumplings you could get for the list price. Our bill ended up being about $12 per person, which is pretty inexpensive. The meh things next...the dim sum was just ok.  The fillings were very skimpy and small. There wasn't enough meat in any of our dumplings. The pork dumplings were barely half filled, the shu mai had very little pork in it, and the shrimp in the shrimp har gow was miniscule. No wonder the prices are so low--they hardly give you anything to eat inside those dumpling skins!  Flavor-wise, the dumplings were pretty good. But again, it's hard to overcome the emptiness of the dumplings versus the promise of their savory looking outsides. Come to think of it, this is sort of symbolic of the entire restaurant experience.  Cute on the outside, but empty on the inside.
