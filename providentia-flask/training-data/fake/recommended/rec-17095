If you're looking for ambience, this is not the place for you. It's a bit if a time warp but the food far and away makes up for it. Farm-style sausage is delicious; the strawberry pancakes are only made more exceptional by the homemade whipped cream, and the omelets are fluffy and delicious. I shared both, and still left feeling satisfied and not over-stuffed. Also! Order the fresh OJ!
