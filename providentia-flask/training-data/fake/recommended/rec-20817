A group of co-workers and I come to Hapgood's pretty often.  The food is always spot on with interesting specials to choose from each time.  Shrimp and grits, sausage, steak and eggs, chicken and waffles...the list goes on and each item is delicious.  Service is always warm and friendly and the restaurant is clean and cozy.  Will continue to visit and tell (drag) all our friends.
