The food here really is choice, but they've got to do something about the service, because that is where they are seriously lacking. I was in here for brunch with my friend and it just seemed like everyone was hungover. Moving very slowly. and despite lots of noise in the kitchen there was no food on anyone's table. Several servers dropped cups and spilled things in the hour we were here, which is weird, maybe everyone just had a rough night? like REALLY ROUGH. We didn't order anything too fancy, but our food took over 30 minutes to appear, and when it did it was the appetizer and the meal I had ordered, my friend's took an additional 10 minutes and his eggs were overdone. So I mean, my chicken quesadilla was fantastic, but I was so upset with the service it was really hard to love on it. the ugly donuts were tasty- but also overdone. It was as though the cooks who were making all the noise in the kitchen are really worried about serving underdone food or something because everything was a bit overdone. I'd give them another try, as the price for 2 with an appi was under 30 bucks, but otherwise I think I'd be writing them off of my brunch places list.
