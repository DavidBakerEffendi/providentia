Whenever we visit my parents, I love to go to Shanghai Garden (called "the Yellow Trailer" in my family because it is in a yellow dinner type building).  They have the best shrimp lo-mein and lunch specials (you can get them after 3pm for an additional charge).  We usually do take out, but when we have eaten there, the service has been good.  The staff are always friendly and the food is always good.  I don't think we've ever had a bad meal.
