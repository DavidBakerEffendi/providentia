One word: YUM! I stumbled on the Yelp reviews for this spot and decided that my next trip to nyc would include a visit here. We decided to eat here for lunch yesterday and I am so happy I did! Place is VERY small but we decided to eat in (it was freezing outside!) Apart from being right next to other diners in very close quarters, it was fine. The waiter was extremely helpful and offered suggestions. Based on the Yelpers, I knew to order the spicy chicken empanadas. I also ordered the seafood (viagra), and plain chicken and the hubby got cheesesteak ones and a side of maduros (sweet fried plantains). I made the mistake of eating the spicy chicken first which made the others, though yummy, pale in comparison. Hubby thought the cheesesteak ones were delicious too. I also had a coconut sangria - delish. Great service and great food. You can order to go and pick-up as well. Will be one of my regular spots here on in!
