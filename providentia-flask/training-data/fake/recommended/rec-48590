What a great place to come for a cold brew, good conversation, and good food.  Walked from South Street to try this gem, and it's worth going out of your way if you're a South Street tourist.  The locals are sweet, it was ice cold inside (mid 90's outside).  We must have stayed two hours making friends with a pair of marrieds from down the block who were only stopping in for a beer or two and ended up chatting with us for quite a while.
