Delicious meal all around. Skipped the first course but had oysters from Atlantic and Pacific Coasts (which I recommend doing because they both taste so good and different). Had the Halibut for an entree with sunflower seeds and it was DELICIOUS. It was a pleasant surprise how much the sunflower seed paste made for a delicious accompaniment with the fish. Granted the menu changes often but it was a wonderful meal and experience.
