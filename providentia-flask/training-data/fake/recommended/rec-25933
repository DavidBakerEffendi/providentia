Slow waiter service and take long time for food to come out compared to the better diners. Service is below average. Took fore than five minutes for us to be noticed after being seated. I only came here for breakfast since i don't think other food on par. Food is a little below average, and portion is very small compared to the other diner in the area. Also very expensive. I still come once in a while due to the good location. But I am actively looking for a new diner to actually enjoy. I think thy lost it. Go to Empire Diner one mile from there. Much better and fast and more food.
