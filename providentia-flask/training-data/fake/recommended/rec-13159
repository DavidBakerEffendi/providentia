Likes: Gyros over rice, chicken over rice, lettuce and pita bread included, 3 sauces available: creamy white, bbq and red hot, only 6 bucks, not much of a line later at night thankfully, can sit by the fountain and risk getting your bum wet or walk a few blocks down to rockefeller plaza to enjoy your meal Dislikes: Be careful you don't accidentally go to the wrong halal cart if you want to try the original ones.  Their umbrella says the original halal cart.  Plus the line is longer.
