First of all, Steven R., the reason why I stopped yelping for so long is because Nish N. passive aggressively ripped me a new one after I gave a Yelp-event restaurant a bad review. Do you know what it's like to get passive aggressively ripped a new one, Steven R.? Its like someone is playing the shell game with your anus. One minute you're on the 71 with 40 bucks in your duct-tape wallet; next minute your butt hurts. ANYWAY Bro and I got manis san pedis down the street from this place and all the delicate Korean hand-petting put me in the mood for a martini. So bro took me to this place. We ordered drinks and oysters and just chillllled. My first drink wasn't dirty enough but that was bro's fault because I was so busy convincing mommy to spot me scrill for a digi cam on the phone, that I was unable to explain to the bartender how dirty I wanted my drink....which I guess makes it my fault and not bros. Anyway, drinks were great, oysters were great, atmosphere was great. I didn't eat dinner here, but bro's never eaten dinner here either and he still loves it. While I was smoking my first-drink cigarette on the street some lady asked me where Green street was, to which I replied "DUNNO, I'm from San Francisco!" She then told me I look like a New Yorker, which either means I was dressed well or she thought I was Jewish. Either way, I'll take it.
