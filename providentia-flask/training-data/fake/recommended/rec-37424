My favorite restaurant in Williamsburg right now.  Everything is done to absolute perfection.  Aside from the mean lesbian that works behind the bar who absolutely NEVER exudes a single ounce of happiness I will continue going back.  You should order everything on the menu!  Trust me Ive tried it all!
