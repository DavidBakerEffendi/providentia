Took my girlfriend here on our first date.  This place is TINY, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in the food.  This is one of my top hidden gems in the city.  When people ask me where to go on a date, this is usually #1 on my list.  Food is quality and a quaint atmosphere make this side street a true gem of NYC.
