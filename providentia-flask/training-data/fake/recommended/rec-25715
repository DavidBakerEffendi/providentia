Love Love Love!! Â The first time we came here was for a nice place for our anniversary and now we find any excuse to eat that this cute little BYOB. I've eaten here about 3 or 4 times now and have never had a bad experience. I'm a vegetarian and they don't have too many choices for me but everything I've gotten I have loved. My boyfriend also has a gluten allergy and he says that Giorgio's has the best gluten free pastas and breads he's ever had. The staff is also super friendly and knows their stuff. The place is small so I would recommend reservations. I've never seen in not crowded here. There are just two small rooms that are connected by a couple of stairs so it does get a little noisy in there sometimes. It a nice romantic spot where you can bring a bottle of wine and have a great dinner!
