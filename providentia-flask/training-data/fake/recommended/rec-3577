I had never heard of this place when I went, but my colleague said it was good so I decided to give it a go. We went right before 5 on a Saturday, so there wasn't a wait. I will start off with the good. The service was fine. Our server was friendly and cheerful. I got the burger (medium well) with bacon and cheddar cheese and the truffle fries. The truffle fries are pretty good. I think perhaps there was fresh parmesan cheese on them. The burger wasn't so great. Besides the fact that it was small, it wasn't tasty. It was also dry. The total price for my burger, fries and soda was $21. This place has a very trendy feel to the place, and I think many people like to go there. However, I don't think I will be going back.
