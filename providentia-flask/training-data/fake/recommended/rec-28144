This place was great! I had the Chicken sausage pizza and it was wonderful and big enough to bring some home. The staff was nice and everything came out in a timely fashion. One of my friends said that they had these amazing brussels sprouts but I didn't see them on the menu. I can only hope that they are just not in season and will pop back up in the fall? Oh, and the Baby Jesus cake! WHAT?! It's so amazing I want it every day!
