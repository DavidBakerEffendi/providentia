Bread and soup came out very early. Bread was unreal (garlic was real) and the soup wasn't really my style, but it would be good anyone else. The waiters were really nice, but our food took 45 minutes to come to the table. We were starving. But besides that, food was great and the spaghetti just tasted like regular spaghetti so nothing special. Food was 5/5 and service was 3/5 so over all 4/5 :)
