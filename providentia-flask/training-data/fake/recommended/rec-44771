Very pleasant and helpful staff. Great casual atmosphere and nice decor. There is something special about their margarita pizza. It is definitely in the sauce... an ingredient that makes it stand out from pizzas around town... even Luzzo's itself. It definitely is a standout pizza!! I highly recommend giving it a try if you haven't already!!
