I just came back from dinner from Barboncino and I wanted to write this review while it's still clear in my head. First off, I rarely come to Brooklyn, I was around the area because I went to visit the Brooklyn Museum. So I decided to Yelp what was good to eat around the area after a long day at the museum. Barboncino caught my eye. When I entered, there was three couples in front of us waiting for the Hostess to seat us all. (Strike 1) The hostess was no where to be seen or heard. We all literally waited ten whole minutes for her to even show up at her hostess counter. (Strike 2) Then a party of 8 showed up after us and they got seated before us. (Strike 3) She finally acknowledged us and ask us how many people. Before she seats us she then stepped away to give out menus to the party of 8. She came back and ask a customer that just walked in how many people. I was like "uhh, we are here first" Why can't she just seat us first?! Like really?! It just doesn't make sense! Ok let's talk about the food. The menu is really small. Their main focus are their pizzas. The pizza was soggy and was like not dry or crispy on the bottom. The meatballs were good though. To conclude this review. I am never coming back or recommending anybody. And the hostess needs to go take a Hostess 101 class and learn the basics of good customer service.
