Best $6.00 you'll ever spend in NYC. Mixed (lamb and chicken) platters, lamb platter, and chicken platter are all the same price. The platter includes yellow rice, lettuce and pita bread with your desired meat(s). Add white sauce and hot sauce to make it a complete meat. This will be the only time where I'll keep requesting white sauce to be drizzled all over my...platter. :) Add a buck for can soda. Please beware of the hot sauce. It is extremely spicy even for the veterans!!
