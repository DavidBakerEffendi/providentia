I've been to several Banh Mi shops, but this is hands down the best I've ever had. I got the Super Cub Classic, which came to $6.53 after tax. The bread was perfect: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ingredients were fresh and warm. The only downside is that I came when the shop was almost empty, but it still took 10 minutes to make. I'd imagine it could take longer if it was crowded. Well worth the wait though. The shop is small, with only a small counter and a few stools for people who want to eat inside. Better take it to go if you can.
