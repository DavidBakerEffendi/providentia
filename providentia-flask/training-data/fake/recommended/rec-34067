Love love love! While my sister is a regular here and knows the owners, I was a little reticent because I didn't want to be disappointed. I was not disappointed in any way whatsoever. For starters, we ordered the bruschetta, which was absolutely phenomenal, and today's special, which was the prosciutto with the most amazing mozzarella ever in life. Wow. For dinner, the people in my party ordered the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, the pappardelle, and the rigatoni alla norma. We each tasted the others'--there were NO complaints whatsoever, but only rave reviews of each dish. You really can't go wrong with any of these dishes. We finished off dinner with the tiramisu and panna cotte. It was such a great way to end our wonderful meal while enjoying the outside dining area and finishing off our tasty wine. Service was outstanding--we all loved Davide and Giuseppe. This is now on my list of go-to restaurants when I come back to NYC.
