For all seafood lovers who don't mind getting their fingers dirty.  I love their fried catfish; shrimp and snow crab legs with the Boil's special sauce in medium spiciness.  It's worth every dollar :). PS I love that they play old school hip-hop and r&b :D. Make sure you go a little earlier to make reservations because dinner is a long line!!  Best seafood spot in NYC!!
