Three words: Salt and Ash I will return here just for this one cocktail every time I stop by. The bar's not really crowded during the week but gets busy on the weekend. The downstairs doesn't really fit well with Williamsburg (kind of clubby and douchey) but it's fun if you're in the mood for loud music and a place to dance. Not sure if that's how it is every weekend - I was there on a Friday night and they were playing Rihanna... Overall, awesome cocktails upstairs and bar food. Nice and friendly bartenders.
