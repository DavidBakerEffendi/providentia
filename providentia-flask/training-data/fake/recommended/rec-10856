A notch above everything else in this neighborhood when it comes to new american and probably equal to the best anywhere in the city if you are focused on good food and friendly, competent service rather than fancynancyness. Plus, the prices of everywhere else are creeping up to the point where a meal here comes at not much of a premium to other very good, but not special, nearby places like Prime Meats, Buttermilk Channel, etc.
