Just drove 3+ hours from Boston to meet my friends from NY at this joint, but these slackers decided to close at 3PM. We had to go find another place. Shame on you! You ever heard about the word "consistency"? That is what a good restaurant supposed to be. Consisten hours, consisten experience. Fail Fail!
