Spectacular dining experience. Only comment I have is on behalf of vegetarians. Chef will make substitutions or a surprise dish; my surprise dish consisted of a handful of carrots, string beans, fava beans and spinach. It was delicious, but not really reflective of why you would visit this fine establishment. But the service, decor, and pound cake goodie bag was worth it.
