Everything about this place is great. Located in Historic Reading Terminal, quick service, flavorful dishes... :) I don't know anywhere else in Philly that you can get amazing, authentic New Orleans food. I seriously salivate thinking about how amazing the bread pudding with the whiskey butter sauce is... MMMMMMmmmmmmm !!!!! The jambalaya, cajun chicken alfredo, and gumbo are also so yum. The owner (I hear also a professional caterer on the side) loves New Orleans food. Go here when you go to Reading Terminal, trust me.
