READ THIS!!!! I thought they had the best nachos around BUT! Â I was still waiting after two hours for delivery and they were not answering the phone because its so busy, I get that its Saturday, but it gets worse. The delivery man shows up impaired, smelling and making up excuses saying so many people were there. I said I did not want to sign for it because it was over an hour late and wanted him to call the manager and then he starts showing me his broken phone and literally starts whining and crying in a seemingly drunken rampage, saying he fell three times on the way here. He was obviously on something and getting very angry, hitting his phone and yelling. I never raised my voice once and I went and grabbed my boyfriend to come stand with me at the door because he was getting so emotional and throwing his body against the wall, yelling at his phone and saying if it was a woman he'd love it and then kept saying I love you to the phone. Crazy.. It was creepy and disgusting customer service. I finally got through on my own phone to them and they said they will refund me when they get the signed receipt back. Then I tried to be nicer and told him I was sorry for his rough evening and to try to have a good evening but he's still throwing himself against the wall and yelling "nooooooo" because his phone is broken. I feel bad about the phone but seriously!! Is he in first grade throwing a tantrum when it's his job to be the face of this company? In conclusion, beware of the delivery service. The nachos avocado was dark and gone bad the time I opened it. Im afraid to report this man for public intoxication or tell his superiors because he might lose his job and knows where I live. His name sounded like Tappy or something with a T. The end.
