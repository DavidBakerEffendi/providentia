When asked to choose between Pat's and Genoe's I'll take Pat's 100 out of 100 and I judge a person's character who likes Genoe's (not even kidding). With that said Pat's is in the bottom half of my top 10 steaks in the city for a number of reasons but one of the biggest is its size. If you're hungry get two but it is a great 3am snack after a night of boozing. OG Jim's in West Philly (not South St) is hands down the best steak you will ever have.
