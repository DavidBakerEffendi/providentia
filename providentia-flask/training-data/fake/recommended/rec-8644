Offering 2 stars. Not likely to return. What I liked: Cozy, warm, intimate. I like how they have the place set up, found their latte very much to my liking, and WiFi. Wait staff was friendly, good music piping through the speakers, comfortable chairs. Their Web site is cool too. What I didn't like: I found their quiche to be bland and rubbery (maybe suffering the side effects of being gluten free - not sure). Their baklava, although tasty, was tough and tasted more like apple pie. Maybe because it was a vegan recipe - again, not sure. The fork they gave me was something one would use to pull meat out of a lobster claw, and totally didn't do the trick with my dessert. Service was "eh." The owner, who walked by me at least 3 or 4 times, didn't smile or say hello once. He and my server were much more attentive to their friends who came in: they sat, ate and drank with them while my coffee cup was empty and I was ready to order a salad. I had to flag down the staff after my initial order to receive anything else, including the check.
