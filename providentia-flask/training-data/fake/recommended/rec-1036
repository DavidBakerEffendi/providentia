As a guy who purchased a home in Point Breeze I must say I'm excited to have ASB in the hood.  It's a quick walk for me and all my friends that live here too.  The food seems to have gotten better recently.  I had a pulled pork sandwich last night that was pretty stellar.  It's a decent place to go for sure.   Here's the downsides.   1. Seriously just fix the front door.  Get out a planer and shave the bottom of the door and put an arm on the top so it closes.  Every time the people come in or leave the door stays open causing the artic air to come in.  People get mad (I've seen customers cursing at each other over this) Inevitably a customer has to get up and close the door. 2.  Everybody complains about the menu locations.  We get it, you don't want to print out new menus everyday because the menu changes.  You have to get up and walk to menus which are written on the wall.  They won't put menus above the bar because the owner "likes the mirrors to much".  Restaurants are all about convenience.   3.  You don't get fries with any sandwich you order.  They must be ordered separately.   This may be the only place in Philly where you don't get fries.  For a $10 pulled pork sandwich that feels kind of like a rip.  Take a hint from Side Car and give people the option of fries, salad, or a little of both.
