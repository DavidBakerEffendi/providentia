Just had food delivered! Ordered chicken valdostana which cost $16.95. It was the smallest piece of chicken stuffed with minimal mozzarella, prosciutto and spinach. Worst of all the chicken itself was like cardboard! The sauce was good but not worth $16.95! The veggies and potatoes were soggy and bland YUCK! The turkey sub with lettuce, mayo and provolone was equally repulsive! I was billed for a turkey club but there was no bacon or lettuce. It actually appeared to be chicken roll rather than turkey. The meat had air holes (picture posted). The roll was toasted until the bottom was hard as a rock! The fries were soggy and had no seasoning. I will never order from here again. I uses to order all the time but it has been a few months. Something has gone horribly wrong!
