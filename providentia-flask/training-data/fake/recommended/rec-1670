There are much better Mexican joints to hang out at in Philly.  Wound up here on a Friday afternoon, thanks to Steve Starr having the brilliant idea not to open his beer gardens until 4 PM on Fridays (huh?) for some drinks and light food. The beer list is decent and the happy hour margaritas are only $2.50 (which probably is worth a star by itself), but the table-service and the food wrecked the experience. We were there for about 4 hours from about 2:30 PM to 6:30 PM - a group of professionals looking for drinks and food with money to spend.  From the time we ordered our first drinks until the time the waitress bothered to come back and check on us was over an hour...we were so thirsty that people were going to the bar by themselves and paying cash...and hungry...we were ready to order food no one in sight, that it was sad.  One of the women with us, who had waitressed in a prior life, actually considered pulling the girl aside and explaining to her how much she was losing in tips.  And it is a tiny dining room and the place was mostly empty until about 5 PM. The food barely rose above Chipoltle-quality, although it was relatively inexpensive for Philly.  The guacamole was very spicy, but that didn't mask that the avocados didn't taste fresh at all.  The tomatoes in the salsa were bland and mushy. Won't be back.
