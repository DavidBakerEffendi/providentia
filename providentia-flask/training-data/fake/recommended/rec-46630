The food was good and the menu implausibly extensive. It is pretty tricky that several things are called "Banana Leaf Something" but they are not at all similar. This led to my friend ordering, what she thought, was the tofu version of my chicken and getting a dish she really did not want. That being said, the curries were only OK and not very spicy (even after the menu gave it the spicy star AND we asked for it extra spicy). The beef was a little dry and they roti was either stale or overcooked. The Pad Thai was probably the best dish at the table. I was told by my friends, regulars of this restaurant, that it is pretty hit or miss on the food but is normally a bit better.
