This place is pricey, but solid. Princeton tends to be on the expensive side anyway so the priciness is to be expected. Their fish is fresh, from a fish store next door, which does get daily deliveries. In terms of menu options, their bass is phenomenal as many others have pointed out. Entirely worth spending the 4-10$ extra. The oysters are good, but don't stand out in any way. The crab cake was something I enjoyed, but again, no fireworks. In general, a very solid restaurant for very simple, but fresh fish.
