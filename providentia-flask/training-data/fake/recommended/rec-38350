Words of caution: if you want to go to a "normal" pizza place with your family or friends to grab a cheese or pepperoni pie, this is NOT your place. You're better off at Ken's or ordering something from Leonardo's. Got that out of the way. So...Flatbread rocks. American Flatbread is a sit-down place specializing in localvore flatbread pizza pies. Om nom, right? However, picky eaters might have a difficult time here. Flatbread specializes in more imaginative pies--we got one with mushroom and basil and one with beets, goat cheese, and (I think?) broccoli. The alcohol selection is also outstanding. You can get mead here! Before Flatbread, I didn't know mead made it past the medieval age! If Flatbread were anywhere else, I'd say the atmosphere is beyond comparison. Brick walls, rustic but not kitschy decorations, and wood-fired ovens keep the place toasty and cozy. But since it's in Burlington, the vibe here is actually not that different from a lot of other comparable downtown establishments. Â  The one undeniably GREATEST thing about this place, though--and it really is GREAT, especially in downtown Burlington-- is that it's pretty cheap. You can get a flatbread pie for a cool $18 or so, which is a great deal considering the locally sourced ingredients in/quality of the pizza here. Again, om nom.
