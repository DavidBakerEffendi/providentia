I am for lack of a better word obsessed with Taim, so I knew I eventually had to try Balaboosta when it opened up. My husband and I came here for an early dinner before heading to the Theater District for a show on a Friday night. The staff were friendly and the food was good. However, it didn't change my life like the falafel at Taim did. We ordered the Crispy Cauliflower and Hummus Mortar 'n Pestel as appetizers. I loved the cauliflower, but my husband wasn't as into it as I was. However, he did say the hummus may have been the best he ever had and the pita was very fresh. For entrees I got the Skirt Steak and he got the Braised Short Ribs, we both really enjoyed our dishes, but agreed that the Skirt Steak was better. Overall we had a nice experience here, but I wouldn't rush back. My only small complaint was there seemed to be a good amount of tiny bugs in the restaurant and they kept flying in our faces when we were eating. :\
