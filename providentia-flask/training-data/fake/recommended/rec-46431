Maybe it was all the hype. Maybe it was the wait. Or maybe Din Tai Fung is just plain better, but while I enjoyed the dumplings here, I wouldn't rate them as the best. We of course ordered the famous soup dumplings, both the pork and crab. They came out almost immediately and were pipping hot. I thought the pork ones were better than the crab, but we had a difference of opinion among the 9 people at our table. Like I said, the dumplings were great, but something made me long for the ones back in California at DTF. I think the ones there, while smaller, packed more flavor. What was excellent at Joe's though was the crispy beef. Of course you're going to order the dumplings, but I really think an order of the crispy beef is well worth it. All in all, great place. I just wouldn't rate it as the best.
