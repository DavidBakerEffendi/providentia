Clinton St. Bake Co has great food, don't get me wrong. But they sell brunch, not magical lamps with genies inside. Why there is a line that long every single day of the week is a mystery to me. Do they lace their syrup with crack? Because IMHO no stack of pancakes is worth an hour-plus wait at 9 am in the cold weather, no matter how fluffy or buttery.
