What a great beer bar!! Kind of a hidden gem based on it's proximity to the bridge but wasn't super over crowded albeit for a Tuesday night. One of the better beer selections I have seen in NYC, not quite ginger man status but really good. The bartenders were beyond amazing and friendly as well as the wait staff when we sat in the back later in the night. It looks like they change their beers quite often and do tap take over nights which is awesome and always keeps you coming back. HUGE whiskey selection, but I think they need to put a menu together for that. If you aren't a big whiskey drinker and can be a bit overwhelming. Definitely have to get back here soon to try the food and then again when the weather gets nicer for the outdoor space! Can't wait.
