I love Beyond Sushi. I am not even a vegan, I don't even like vegetables lol but I can totally eat this and enjoy it! It is so flavorful and delicious. I would highly recommend the Spicy Mang. I've also had the Crunch n' Munch and Nutty Buddy, absolutely delicious! I wish the place was a little bigger but when you get there before the rush you're able to find a good seat and have a good experience.
