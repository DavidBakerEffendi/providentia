To be quite honest, I was planning to eat at Smith & Wollensky tonight.  I went to S&M and find out that the waiting time will be somewhere around 35min so I decided to leave and settle with a restaurant near by.  Now, I believe that this was fate.  Everything happens for a reason.  I'd have to say...WOW!  This place is delicious!!!!  Thanks to Smith & Wollensky for not having the table open for me when I arrived. I ordered the caprese salad and it was good.  This was a ordinary good caprese salad.  Then came the pasta dish (fettuccine w/chicken, mushrooms, oil, and garlic sause) that I ordered!!  OMG, it was love in first sight and bite.  The pasta was al-dente and with the sause it sucked in, it created a flavor that took my mind to heaven (my brain was going under the process of Big-Bang.)  The atomosphere of this restaurant was like an at-home trattoria you'll find in the Tuscan area of Italy which made my heart relax and enjoy the food even more.  Oh yeah, and the best part is...for NYC, the price is very sincere.  Delicious food with a reasonable price.  What else do you need? The only reason I didn't give this place a 5-star was because the service was sloppy and kinda slow.  Still even with that aspect, I will still be coming back here again and again.  Yay for this restaurant's location being near my school too :)
