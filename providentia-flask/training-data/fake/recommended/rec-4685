No No No No No. Not good Pizza. But I love the people there. I have that problem, it seems, I always love the people... They even let me have a food fight when a date started paying more attention to a baseball game than me. That was fun :-) Anyway, the pizza sucks. I used to work at a very Greek pizza place and the crust is nothing like theirs. And every time I leave Yorkside I have serious indigestion. And the red wine stains your teeth immediately upon contact. Some of their other food is good, like the Spinach salad. It's nothing special, but isn't disappointing either. Stop here for cheap eats when you're drunk.
