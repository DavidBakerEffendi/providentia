Here's what we had: - Croquettes - Shishito peppers - Shrimp with garlic and olive oil - Artichokes wrapped in ham - Octopus and potatoes - Crispy marinated fish I must ask:   What's all the fuss about?   Everything was edible (except the octopus, which was horribly mushy and bland), but nothing was stellar.  Definitely not worth cramming into this tiny space to be served tiny portions for not-so-tiny prices.
