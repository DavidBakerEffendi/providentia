Hey Guys, Went here a few Saturdays ago with a few peeps and crowd was mix and cool. Music was decent. This is definitely a chill/lax place with a fun crowd on Saturday nights. The bartenders were super cool and definitely hooked it up on the drinks..for sure. Good guy to girl ratio too. I'd definitely go again soon.
