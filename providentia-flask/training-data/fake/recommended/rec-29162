I finally got to go to the much celebrated Buddakan! This was to celebrate with a large group so it limited our menu to the family style choices. It didn't matter though. The food was outstanding! The only problem is I didn't always know what I was eating. I remember one dish was a tuna pizza which was really good. The dessert was a mixed tray and was great! The service was exemplary. I can't wait to go for a regular dinner!!!
