I tried this place out with a couple of friends since we were all hungry and didn't see anything interesting around the area. We found this little place on Yelp so we decided to try it out and it wasn't too bad. The pizza slices were super thin but they were good! Our server was really nice and engaging too. My favorite was the mushroom and truffle oil pizza, which I recommended.
