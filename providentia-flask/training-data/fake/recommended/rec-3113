The most satisfying dinner of the past few months.  Pull out $20 from the ATM, grab a buddy and a sixer of Modelo from the bodego next door, then pop in for some mofongo.  You're gonna want to use the extra $4 for a tip, if only to say it was the best 20 bucks you ever spent. Sure, the food didn't make me cream my jeans, but it did help me overcome my fear of mofongo, perhaps the least dignified of national delicacies --  a sticky, starchy lump of plantains and fried pork chunks that is usually so dry it takes a whole pitcher of gravy to allow a fork to pass through it.  Casa Adela's was perfectly moist and came with an awesome garlic butter sauce, full of all sorts of spices -- I got monfongo'd. The biggest sell, though, is the atmosphere -- it's an authentic neighborhood dirty spoon, the cooks standing at the counter drinking beer and cracking jokes between orders.  English is a second language here, which is fine because I love going to restaurants where I can practice my Spanish and not feel like a prick.  BYOB, pay at the register, and hairnets is my gold standard from now on, assuming there's also some rice and beans floating around the room.
