I really love this place... Probably the best ramen I've ever had.. and trust, I've had a lot. OH! And the pork buns are muy delicious. I also had the fried peppers, which were pretty good too (for those of you that like peppers). I came here at 6pm on a Friday night and somehow missed the long lines (that I had heard so much about). The thought of a long wait, keeping me from my delicious ramen, scares me enough to plan my next visit strategically, as to not have to wait any longer than necessary. I rarely give out 5-stars.. but this joint is truly deserving. Great atmosphere, good service, and delicious food. It's now a staple for every future NYC visit.
