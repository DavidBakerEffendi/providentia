Round 2.  Arrived around 6:45 and was seating by 7.  Crowd increased later on.  Shared among friends so had a good selection of burgers and dessert.  I've tried the pastrami, truffle, manly and duck burgers.  My two favorites are the pastrami and truffle.  I am also a big fan of the Ahi Tuna burger, but haven't tried any other veggie options yet. We tried all of the starters tonight: sweet potato, truffle cheese, and manly fries.  Onion rings and friend pickles.  Truffle cheese and Manly are my favorite, followed by the onion rings. The 21 U Club bloody mary is excellent! I've tried all four cookie sandwiches by The Good Batch (a bakery based in Brooklyn).  My favorite is the butter brown peach.  Followed closely by the goodwich (chocolate chip cookies) and sunkissed ginger (lemon tart center).  Meh on the double chocolate peanut butter (not a fan of the thin wafer. I prefer the cookies) Sea salt caramel ice cream....awesome!! Hope to try some new items on my next trip.
