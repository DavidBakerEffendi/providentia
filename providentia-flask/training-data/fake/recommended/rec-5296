My girlfriend and I visited Philly last week as part of a US trip. The first and last place we had some food was at Continental. The restaurant is spacious, full of atmosphere and serves delicious food. I love the funny chairs you can sit in if you sit upstairs, even if they do make you move around all the time once you sit in them! The first time I was at Continental, I tried the Green Sub Marine sandwich, which is one of the best vegetarian sandwiches I have ever had. I normally don't eat that much vegetarian food, but this was amazing. The second time I visited, I tried some curry chicken sandwich, which was equally delicious. My girlfriend is not a great lover of burgers, but tried one on her second visit. By the second bite, she was smiling and picked up her eating pace accordingly! One thing I especially like is that while in a lot of places in the US, if you get fries as the side, they are usually tasteless. Not at Continental. In fact, the fries very crispy and had great taste. You don't even need ketchup for these. The staff was enormously friendly, helpful and we did even get a few items slashed off our bill the first we visited since found a small piece of hair in a cake we ordered for desert. Yeah, hair in your food isn't exactly lovely, but it's not extremely awful either. We got a new cake, this time without any hair in it, and the staff fully handled the situation with excellence. I'm not one to complain about things like that, as long as you can get your item changed to a new one. I hope I get back to Philly one day. If I do, Continental is the first place I will go to for food.
