Took my mom here for a belated mother's day dinner. Anthony (the owner) was very helpful and knowledgeable about gluten-free cuisine. I ordered the gf pizza and my mom had the Di Mare which was heavenly! The bartender was great too. He gave us free glasses of wine and suggested I order the gluten free chocolate roll, mmmm so good. When the bill came, I noticed they didn't charge me for dessert and asked our waitress about it. She said it was also comped. I love this place. And yes, gorgeous waitstaff. My mom (the cougar) could not stop eyeing the cute waiters.
