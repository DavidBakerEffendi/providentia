I love B2 so, so much. Vegan options abound, from bagel sandwiches to smoothies and soft serve. The bagel sandwich combinations all look so good that I always end up standing in front of the board for an awkward couple of minutes trying to decide which one I want the most. I like the tomato/mozz/basil combo the best so far. Their coffee is strong and gives me LIFE. Oh, and there are always dogs and babies in here to up the natural cuteness factor that B2 already has going for it. Just wish it wasn't so hard to find a table on Saturday/Sunday afternoons.
