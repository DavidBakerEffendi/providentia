We had a special occasion to celebrate and heard about Salt & Fat. We wanted some good food to celebrate but wanted to stay in Queens and Salt & Fat seemed to meet our requirements.   We arrived late on a Sunday and the place was pretty busy.  We waiting for about 10 minutes before getting seated and the greeter was also our waiter.  I was a little worried that service might be slow since they were almost full but with a slim staff, yet that never seemed to be a problem.   Salt & Fat serves tapas-style dishes so we went to town on a salad, Pork buns, Oxtail, Scallops and the Rice crispies and marshmallow ice cream dessert.   The salad, scallops, and oxtail were delicious.  The pork buns were good, but I'd say trying something else.  The dessert was pretty damn good, especially the marshmallow ice cream. All this plus two drinks = $55 I'd say any restaurant that can provide delicious food under $30/person is at least four stars in my book.
