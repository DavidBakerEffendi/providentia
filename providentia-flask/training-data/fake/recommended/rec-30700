Good to go here at week day, lunch time. No waiting, and everything cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were crisp and very fresh tasting, and no hint of bland, frozen after taste. The four sauces were so good, it was tough to decide which to dip into next. The "Burger Royale" was amazing. Being from Chicago, famous for Italian beef sandwiches, this was done up as  a burger and shredded, beef both, with truffle cheese that was not overwhelming.  It needed no sauce, the beef was that tasty. And no room for dessert, already having left half of the fries and all of the burger bun. But the sweets selections were looking pretty good. Hands down, the best burger in the Village, and maybe all of Manhattan. The menu is diverse, and for some reason, calories of only certain burgers were listed on the menu. Not sure if this is a good thing, or not,  when you are about to indulge in that two or three time per year burger. Shakes would be a nice addition, but done only in certain, flavors, to not upstage the beef. This is a destination.place. I'm hooked.
