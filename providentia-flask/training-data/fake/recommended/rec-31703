When I heard that this diner was under new management (again) I decided to stop in and give it another shot. Bear in mind that I had previously given up on this diner for mediocre food and bad service. Tonight proved to me that it was a mistake to return. They added booths and got rid of the tables by the windows which was nice, but the food/menu situation was worse than before. $15.95 got me a small piece of over cooked salmon with about five grilled asparagus spears. The fish was dense and it tasted frozen. My husband got a breakfast wrap and it didn't come with toast or home fries. Really? The menu has definitely shrunk and dinner didn't even come with bread. I really want to like this place since it's a few blocks from my house, but unfortunately it's just lame. Go to the Colonial down the road or Lyndhurst Diner. It's NJ and we got plenty of Diner choices.
