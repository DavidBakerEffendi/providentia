Maybe I arrived on an off day but I have to say honestly that I was disappointed with the quality of food. With all the high star reviews and with a good recommendation from a co-worker of mine who grew up in the area I was expecting much better food than what I got. Growing up near an area (Astoria Queens) with some of the best Greek restaurants, I can say I've tasted true quality and this wasn't it. My wife & I started with some basic fried calamari . My take on it, Bland, and the cold cocktail dipping sauce, nothing to write home about. My wife had the Gyro and I had the swordfish steak. Let me see...what word can I use to describe the fish....ummmmm...Bland. Sorry I couldn't come up with a better adjective but it fit perfectly. The lemon potatoes it came with were actually very good but then again when the main dish has little flavor anything with some salt seems that much better. Ofcourse I tried my wife's gyro and although it tasted OK (Emphasis on OK) it was dry. I found myself smothering it in tzatziki sauce to give it a little moisture. I will say that the portions were hearty and the service was friendly. The service was quick and the waiter treated me like a gentleman by shaking my hand when I left and thanked me for my patronage. For that I give them 3 stars, otherwise it would have have been 2. Like I said, maybe it was an off day because it surprises me that so many others gave it such high ratings.
