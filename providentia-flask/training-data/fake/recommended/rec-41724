Gueros is a great little joint in Crown Heights that I love to visit. Being a vegetarian, it can be hard to find good tacos. Is it too much to ask for more than peppers, onions, and rice? Gueros does a great job of having options for everyone, and their happy hour is awesome! $$ off tacos and magaritas and I'm a fan. Watch out, because they can have a huge line, and being small there are minimal places to sit. They are also a little pricey, but what isn't these days? I haven't ordered delivery, but I doubt these would last a trip on a bike/by foot, so I'd suggest going or taking out and devouring quickly!
