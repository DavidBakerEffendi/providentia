I love this place....especially the green sauce.  I don't know what it is but it tastes great on the Cuban empanada....and everything else.  $18 for the medium pitcher of sangria is fantastic and more than enough for two. I also love the plantain chips with guacamole.  It would be four stars but the place is tiny and the service can be so-so.  Also last time I was there they were a bit ADD with the music and kept changing it...and it was way too loud.
