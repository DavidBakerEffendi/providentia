Delicious, first; healthy, second.  Just devoured their steak/fig salad which was flavorful and filling and healthy (a tastebud stimulating mix of seared steak, greens, blue cheeze, croutons and roasted squash and figs).  Not your usual lunch stop place.  I'm a soup person & found both their featured soups --cauliflower  and a spicy pozole--to be tasty.  This place is a worth a stop for a gourmet, fairly inexpensive (most of their entrees are under $10-11) quick meal.  I'm already planning my next lunch....
