The food here was simply delicious. I ordered pad kee mao, and the vegetables included in my dish were the freshest I've ever tasted in Thai food. Portions were small-medium sized, but definitely enough to fill you up. The ambiance here was lovely, despite the seemingly small size of the restaurant. One cool thing about this place is that the majority of the food is cooked right in front in a big wok. I know that adds an extra element of comfort for a lot of people who are squeamish about dirty kitchens. Â  The ONLY bad thing I have to say about this restaurant is the length of time we had to wait before we saw a waiter. Well--I should say "before a waiter saw us". Since the place is so small, I saw the two servers chatting and bringing the bills to a couple of tables. Despite my increasingly desperate attempts to get their attention with eye contact, it was like they were in their own world. I'm thinking maybe the guy who sat us forgot to let one of them know. But seriously, how did they not see us? Once we did get seen, the waiter was very pleasant and super flexible when we wanted to add this or that.
