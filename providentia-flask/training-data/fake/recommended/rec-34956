Bland, and lots of it. It is here, underneath buildings of corporate neckties and the ever mounting paper stacks where they claim to have found the best street food your money can buy. Many have gone, writing raving reviews for this place and what not. And if you happen to agree, then you, my friend, are nothing but a brainless sheep following a blind Shepard (Bahhhh Ram Ewe) This is cheap, crap food with large portions and spicy condiments on the side. The size of the platter is flattering to be sure, but where have all the flavors gone? You call that meat? You call that rice? Blech! I could goto any dingy grocery shop and get the same same dry, tasteless rice off of their hot plate menu. 1.5 stars - for taste 2 stars - for price and portion = A low 3.5 stars Last time I let a Manhattanite recommend me where to go to find good street food. Baaaaa Ram Ewe Bah Ram Ewe To your breed, your fleece, your stock be true. Sheep be true. Bah Ram Ewe
