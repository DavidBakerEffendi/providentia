Sad to say but my last experience at this restaurant in my hometown was actually kinda scary. My friend and I ordered several appetizers during their happy hour., jalepeno poppers, mushroom fundido, yucca fries, and mexican chorizo. We also ordered one corn tamale..., The jalepeno poppers were good but you cant screw that up. Same thing with the yucca fries. But everything else was a disaster...The mushroom fundido looked like soup with vegetables and melted cheese on top. DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH!! You will be DISAPPOINTED!! The tamale was one of the worse tamales I have ever had. Then we tried the mexican chorizo...it just didn't taste right from the start. It was extremely dry, had a funny taste, and was served the oddest way ever, with salsa and sour cream...We didn't make it to the car. we both threw up in the parking lot. Not a little A LOT!! The next day I had diaherra so bad I had to take something to make it stop! Don't worry im not suing or anything, but it is the last time I will ever eat there. And I think everyone else should stay clear for a while. Something is obviously not right... I would like to say that I attended a 60th birthday party here about 2 or 3 years ago and it was the best food I have ever eaten. The difference from that is night and day......
