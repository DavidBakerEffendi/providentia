THANK YOU IPPUDO FOR ANOTHER NYC LOCATION!! Wow every time I go and get the Akamaru Moden it is an experience. This is hands down the best Japanese Ramen place in the whole of NYC (aside from the 4th ave location :) If you actually want to experience Ippudo and not have to wait hours upon hours to get a table I suggest you give this location a shot. They have such a friendly staff and you can realistically get seated within 25mins -- perfect to go for a drink and then have the most delicious ramen on this planet. When you go don't forget to order: - Any ramen soup dish - pork buns - shushito peppers - japanese cucumber All are amazing!! I'm slowing becoming a regular and this place deserves my patronage!
