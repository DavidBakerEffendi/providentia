This review is similar to my Geno's review. I had this sub before my Geno's sub, the bread was hard, the cheese wasnt fully melted, and the onions overpowered the taste over anything else. The workers were rude, too. I hate that, why you gotta be like that? I dont go to Philly often, my stance on Philly is similar to Bill Burrs, meh.
