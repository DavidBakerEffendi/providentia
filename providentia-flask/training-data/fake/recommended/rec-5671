This is a great place for small groups or dinner dates.  Most of the menu is tapas-style which, of course, are small dishes meant to be shared amongst the members of your group. But considering my date and I were super-hungry and super-greedy we decided to get our own entrees.  I ordered the Calamari salad and my friend ordered the Rad Na Thai Chicken.  The salad was very tasty and a great portion. My friend's dish also looked appetizing and filling.  Many of the cocktails, I hear, are good. However, please stay away from the Green Tea cocktail. It was very weak and definitely not worth $10. The atmosphere is what sets Continental apart from the other restaurants downtown. It's very trendy. On a Friday night at 9pm there was (as expected) an hour-long wait.  So, to avoid the crowd we ate in the upstairs lounge. It also happened to be the coolest (literally the coolest in terms of temperature) area of the restaurant, which was important on that scorching August evening. The lounge is right next to the outdoor deck with is climate controlled for both hot and cold weather. At the end of the evening my friend and I tried out the swinging chair section just for the hell of it. The swings are fun, but a little far away from the table. So unless you have really long limbs it will be a uncomfortable sitting for a full meal. I also can't forget to talk about the bathrooms. If you haven't read already, there are 2 way mirrors in which the people on the outside of the restroom can see in and vice versa. This doesn't exactly violate privacy because there are still stalls. The only visible area is the sink-area (I mean what indecent things are you really doing in front of the sink?)
