I heard this place was really good. Apparently it's known for comfort food. I had their mac and cheese. I thought it was kind of bland and normal. It's not bad, but there wasn't any kick to it or anything special. I guess I'll just have to try it again. This restaurant is very similar to Gypsy Den in Santa Ana and Costa Mesa. Kind of eccentric.
