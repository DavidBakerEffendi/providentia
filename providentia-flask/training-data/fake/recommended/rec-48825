Checked out Up Thai last weekend because of its stellar yelp reviews, and it didn't disappoint. The service was excellent. I don't think my water glass ever passed the halfway point since our waitress was very attentive. We ordered the mussels for an appetizer. The portion was very generous, but I wasn't really a fan of the broth it was served in. It was watered down and fishy tasting. For dinner we ordered the Pad See Ew which was very delicious. Also ordered the fried pork belly chef special which was overcooked. The meat was very dried out, but still managed to taste good. Overall, I think it's better than any other Thai restaurant in the UES that I have tried (around 5 or so), and I will definitely be going back.
