I love the idea of this place in the nice weather - a great way to be semi-outside and enjoy the (very) big beers. The space itself is really nice. It's a hair on the kitschy side with all of the German stuff, but it's still really fun. The big picnic tables really facilitate conversation. The place is also HUGE which is nice, and there are plenty of bars to accommodate the crowds. Beer selection is great and I also tried the honey flavored schnapps which tasted just like actual honey, not the usual horrifying fruit meets rubbing alcohol thing. Â  The main complaints about this place seem to be the crowd that goes there and the cheesy security people. Yes, there are lots of douchebag jersey shore type characters there, BUT - if you don't like it, don't look at them. Same goes for the security guards. One of my friends went to the original zoning meeting, and a lot of the security stuff is because that's what people in the neighborhood wanted to keep all of said douchebags under control. Go there to enjoy great drinks, big tables with your friends, and being outside in the warm weather. Look the other way when you see spike haired assholes from South Jersey.
