Went here for brunch yesterday, and I'm glad I did. The place is adorable, and the food was delicious. I had the scallop omelet, which was mouthwatering. I would have sampled my friend's soft-shell crab sandwich had they not run out before we got there. We will come back (and probably earlier) to try out the crab sandwich. Oh, don't get the biscuits. They sucked and tasted like cardboard. Not even butter and jam helped. I'm gonna go with toast next time. I only have two complaints: 1) when they ask if you'd like something to drink (orange juice, mimosa, blahblahblah), they don't tell you it's an additional charge. Maybe it's a no brainer to some, but I'd like to know when I'm going to be paying more for a drink. They asked my friend if she wanted some more mimosa. She declined, but it would have been nice if they would mention whether it was complimentary or at an extra charge. 2) The hostess was verrry clumsy. Don't know if that's how she is usually, or just that day, but our brunch was interrupted at least four times by the sound of crashing silverware and glass.
