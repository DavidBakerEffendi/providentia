Wonderful place!  It feels rustic, cozy, it is small with wooden tables.  I went in with a friend for drinks and apps, but the food was so good and the environment so warm, it slowly turned into a meal.  The service as others have mentioned is excellent, attentive, very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. I had the Braised Lamb and Crispy Polenta with pecorino and toasted breadcrumbs, it was incredible.  The flavors of the tender lean lamb, with what I think was spinach and tomatoes, blended together in a perfect way.   For $13 it was either a large appetizer or a small entrée, decent price, totally worth it.  I also tried what I think was Leak and Potato soup with truffle oil.  Really outstanding rich, thick soup.  The hush puppies were just alright, decent maple butter.  Not bad but much better at Virgil's in Times Square.  The last item we had was an order of chease, I do forget the name but it was a soft spreadable cheese made from cow, goat and sheep's milk, served with pecans, some sort of sweat raison or dried cranberry, and toast, really incredible cheese!  Very small portion, but worth it for $5. They also do 1/2 glasses of wine for $3 before 7:00, a nice way to try a few different kinds.  Overall excellent meal, fantastic service, definitely trying this place again!
