Fantastic place. Every single item was very good to great. The atmosphere rocks - giant windows looking out onto Carmine st. Wine bottles against the walls, roomy tables, friendly staff. We started with the wine tasting - 3 flights for $9, along with a Lagunitas IPA. The appetizers were all stellar - the best crispy calamari ever, drizzled with an orange chipolte-like sauce, perfectly seasoned and laid on top of a guacomole puree. Just amazing. The soft-shell crab special (appetizer) was as good as it gets. And the gnocchi was great - served in a flavorful brown broth, with tender lamb and cabbage (or something similar), olives, figs....well, it really worked. Great for dipping the awesome crusty, rustic fresh bread they provide. On to the mains.....I threw caution to the wind and ordered the whole fish (which our amiable waitress informed was impossible to de-bone). It was a "Porgy". Never had it, so i said what the heck. It...was....really, really good. The fish came apart easily, and sure there were bones, but easily avoidable. This nice plump white fish came bathed in a wine/butter sauce with golden raisins. Mama mia. We also ordered the Arctic Char - perfect-o. Crispy, succulent, just great. Finally, the crispy chicken w/ creamy mashed potatoes and cheese fondue.....holy crap. Amazing. Could not get enough of it. We were totally stoked. Just a great all-around meal and experience. For dessert, we got the upside down pineapple cake, and surprise, it was quite delicious. The espresso gelato was tops. Great place for the family, or a date, or friends. Goin' back.
