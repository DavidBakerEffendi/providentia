When I feel like having a burger, I go directly to 500. No matter what I order, I eat that shit savagely like it's the first meal I've had in weeks or something. I'm always completely satisfied eating here once in a while. Those prices make sad, but it's so worth it. All in all, if you haven't been there, you should.
