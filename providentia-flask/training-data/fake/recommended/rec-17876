Excellent excellent excellent. Rodizio was great! Best cut was the top sirloin!!! Tasted like butter! Sangria was also top notch. Wait staff stood at attention waiting for you to need something like they were on your payroll. I came for my birthday and by how many times everyone was singing so did everyone else. Yes this is Newark but at no time did I ever feel unsafe. The free valet parking was great as well. I don't write too many reviews but this place was worth it in so many ways! If you like meat get over here right away! I will be finding every excuse in the world to try to get back here soon!
