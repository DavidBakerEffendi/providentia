Lamb medallions that made me dream of going back as  soon as I could.... and for the last three months had been trying to get a reservation.  So tonight was the night. I brought three friends along...and unfortunately we experienced a let down. Three of us were disappointed with  the crispy chicken, brussel sprouts and potatoes....bland and mediocre. We wondered if any seasoning was used. The chicory salad as an appetizer was okay.One of  my friends had halibut. She said it was good but nothing to brag about.. We could have had our meals some place else for half  theprice and I'm sure  would have been much more tasty.  The only thing that I thought was exceptional was a delicious fig custard. On top all this we were stared at  and felt rushed with every course....in order to seat their next customers.   Not a good dining experience on many levels. We work hard all day and look forward to a delicious relaxing meal at the end of itand it was neither. I'm hoping this was just an off night for Little Owl as had I said above...the first time I visited Little Owl for dinner there everything was excellent. So I hope Little Owl is not beginning to rest on its laurels. It must not forget to honor its customers by providing excellent food and a pleasant dining experience.
