I've always liked Walter Foods. Most recently I went there for dinner with my g/f on New Years Eve. From start to finish it was an excellent experience. The host, server and bussers were very professional and attentive. The food was top notch, from the fresh and plentiful shrimp cocktail to the blackened catfish and bar steak. All dishes were well executed and arrived in the perfect amount of time. Top it off with some delicious bourbon (his) and pinot noir (hers) and you have what amounted to a perfect meal. The odd mix of mostly 80s pop songs pushed this from a 4 star to 5 star review because it shows they know how to have fun. :) Will definitely be back!
