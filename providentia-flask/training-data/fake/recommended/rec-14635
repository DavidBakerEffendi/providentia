All hype. Yes, I was born and raised in Brooklyn, too. Around Italians. And have eaten a lot of pizza. Yes, Di Fara is decent because the ingredients are fresh and the Parmesan and basil are welcome additions to your every day pie. And I respect DeMarco. But it's not my favorite pie in the least. It's just different, and I agree with a few other users - it's too salty and too oily. Sorry!
