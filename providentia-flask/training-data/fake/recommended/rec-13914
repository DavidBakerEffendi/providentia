This is my favorite tea rooms in NY.   Coming into Cha-An is almost like going into a spa.  Right when you enter, the NY rush-noise-craziness just stops.  Being in here is an absolute soothing experience.  I've been here various times and each time is not a let down.  The place is quiet and easy for conversations.  The place is small but I think the quaintness is appropriate for the vibe of this place. They have a wide range of teas, and the menu is easy to read.  Depending on the tea you are having, it comes in a customized tea pot and cup.  They refill your pot with water once you run out.  If your hungry or want an accompaniment, I would recommend the food.  I've had the Cha-An set with Cindy C one night.... it looks like a little but once you start eating it becomes one meal.  I've also had some sweets; I would recommend all of them.  If you or anyone else is not really feeling the tea, they do have alcohol... for drinks they have sake and cocktails. Cha-An suites for multiple occasions whether if its pre or post dinner or with family or friends.  Cha-An is my NY escape.
