I'm being honest here, but New York trumps California when it comes to pizza.  The best pizza I've had in Cali (Zachary's at Berkeley) falls a bit short compared to this place.  The crusts are perfect and the sauce is unparalleled.   If I ever decide to move to NYC, I can see myself dining here a lot.
