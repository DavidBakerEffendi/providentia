I have been to Yerba Buena several times before for dinner and never been disappointed. Their brunch menu however was slightly less impressive. My friend and I ordered the Huevos rancheros which were presented artfully, but did not leave me dropping my fork. The eggs were scrambled Â to a fluffy consistency, but the queso fresco was nothing more than sour cream. Fortunately the mimosas were unlimited and rose above the premixed acidic orange juice taste most brunch places seem to serve, with fresh squeezed orange juice. My review would have been stronger, but the server forgot the side of papas provencal we ordered. I'm sure this traditional dish would have complimented the entrees nicely, so I may have to return with the hope of a different, more competent server.
