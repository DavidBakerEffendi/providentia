1400 reviews and this place averages almost 5 stars.  It's funny...the cart is run by the halal guys.  There are literally five carts with the exact same food within a few blocks, but this one is the only one with the line. I haven't tried the other carts, but I can tell you that I did enjoy this one.  I didn't care for their side salad, but the rice and chicken is great.   And that white sauce definitely goes well with everything. For $6 they give you a lot of food and it's perfect after drinking on a late night.  The hot sauce is hot....you could feel the heat with a single drop.    Overall....good times.
