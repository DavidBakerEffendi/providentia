Lots of outdoor/indoor space with long tables to share with friends or complete strangers. The atmosphere is very hispter and laid back. There's even a ping pong table. The vibe is very chill. There's plenty of places in/out to grab beers and food. The food is OK and I couldn't tell you any of the beers they had, but they few I had were good (they have a healthy variety.)
