1950s Mexican-American fare done right. You'll know this the moment you get the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are perfectly fried and firm enough to pick up the well-balanced salsa. You also get a mini cheese quesadilla. TRY THE CEVICHE. I always get this and share. It's too good to not share, as much as I want it all to myself. The black bean soup is also very good. I always go for the combo platters. The dishes come piping hot. The refried beans are perfect in texture and flavor. The rice could pump up the flavor a bit more. The enchiladas, tacos, and chile rellenos are all good and packed with fresh ingredients. The green sauce is on the mild sauce. They give a banana chimichanga to end the meal. The wait staff is in uniform and friendly. The dining room is casual, somewhat cavernous, and with interesting murals painted on the walls. There is a bar with a full selection (try the Licor 43 as an apertif, if you've never had it). There is also a much different, plainer space on the second floor for private parties and busy evenings (e.g., Cinco de Mayo).
