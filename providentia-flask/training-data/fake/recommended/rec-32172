I love this place. Great lunch spot. I get the a lunch box ( either sushi, chicken or beef teryaki whatever I'm feeling that day.) It comes with salad (I love the Ginger dressing) and miso. Then they bring you out a little wooden box with rice, vegetables, California roll, and some little dumplings. It's great and priced to please. Happy hour is a hell of a deal too. Â In the warm months you can sit out on the patio and watch the Aston Martins drive down new London turnpike.
