This is a Jersey diner like a Jersey diner should be.   Worth the wait for a table, which never seems to be as long as they say it will be.   Friendly, prompt, "diner worthy" service. I've mostly done breakfast here -- eggs, pancakes, really good homefries, four-egg omlettes with generous amounts of filling.  If you ask for well done homefries that's what you get.  And food gets to your table straight from the griddle--not after it's been sitting under the lights for a while.  Excellent coffee in a nice-sized mug with a comfortable handle.  Sometimes it's about the little things... Lunch is good too.  I liked the tuna melt a lot.  Ask for the coleslaw (comes with the lunch, but only if you ask for it.)  Haven't tried dinner or dessert, but both look very nice. Bathroom (and everything else about the place) is squeaky clean.  I never eat twice in a place with a dirty bathroom...think about it. Convenient from Newark, Harrison, Rt. 280.  Try it!
