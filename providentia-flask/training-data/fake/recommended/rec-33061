I put 4 stars, but would probably be 3.5. We went Saturday night, had the Dokboki veggie rice cake app, and a shrimp tempura roll. They were both very good, but not great. For dinner my wife had buckwheat soba noodles with veggies and I had bibimbop. I ordered with chicken it came with beef instead, the waiter apologized. Both dishes were very good. The place has a nice clean decor. The service was good, except for the wrong order. We would go back, and try some different options, considering they offer Thai, Japanese, and Korean. They have a lot to offer for a little place in Princeton.
