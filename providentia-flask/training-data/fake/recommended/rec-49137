If you are looking for a great restaurant that has it all, look no further. While Joseph Leonard may be known for its great brunch and strong bloody's, it has also become my go-to spot on Sunday afternoons/evenings for a relaxing date or catching up with girlfriends. Â Amazing cocktails, great food, attentive service and warming atmosphere..I would highly recommend to anyone who hasn't been!
