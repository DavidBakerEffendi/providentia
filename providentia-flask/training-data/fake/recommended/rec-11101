Although Best Thing I Ever Ate suggested Osteria for its pizza, the highlight of this meal was the dessert.  The blood orange crostata with 63% manjari chocolate was the perfect marriage of flavors: tart blood orange, light cookie-like pie, and bittersweet dark chocolate. The lombarda (baked egg, bitto cheese, mozzarella, and cotechino sausage) was very, very delicious though it fell short of Pulino's artisan pizza circa Nate Appleman.  Still, it's the second best I've had.
