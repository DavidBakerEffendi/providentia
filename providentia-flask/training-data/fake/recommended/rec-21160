Granted that there are tons of quick eat options around here whether it's for lunch or after a night of excessive drinking, the Wolfnights stands out amongst the pack. The place offers sandwiches in a wrap similar to Indian roti plata. I usually opt for The Howling which consist of a date and pumpkin seed dough wrap with chicken, fried pickle, feta, melon, mint, and yogurt sauce; the fried pickle definitely makes this a standout wrap. When I'm in beast mode the regular fries or feta fries adds a nice compliment to the wrap.  The place is somewhat small and at times you may have to destroy your wrap outside,  but  after the first bite you wouldn't  give a *&*^% who walks by and judges your actions because all you would care about at that point would be to finish wrap and pondering a second round attempt. If you do get seating inside though, they do offer an assortment of beer.
