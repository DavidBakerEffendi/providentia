Mexican Korean fusion that works.  The bowls and burritos look good, but I always get the tacos.  3 tacos for $10 is a good deal, and they don't skimp on the taco filling.  I love that they tailor the taco toppings to the protein filling instead of putting the same garnish on everything.  The variety and balance of flavors has been well thought out.  My favorites in order are: 1. The veggie taco: sometimes veggie tacos are boring, and sometimes I only order the veggie option so I can pretend to be a little healthier. But here it's actually my favorite option, the cheese and Korean flavored veggies are a surprisingly tasty combo.  The pomegranate on top is genius. 2.  Short-rib taco: sweet and savory, the kimchi and pear slaw on top is spicy and sweet.  Every bite is satisfying. 3. Korean fried chicken taco: It's tasty, but sometimes I think the ratio of breading to chicken is a little too heavy on the breading.   I've probably tried the fish and pork, but I don't remember.  I wish there was a grilled fish option.  I was totally underwhelmed by the edamame falafel, I thought it was dry.  And falafel with refried beans in the same taco was kind of a fail.  But my friend loves the edamame falafel bowl, so... to each her own. The space is a little small, so take out might be a better bet.  Get it to go and then go to one of the nearby dive bars to chow down. I've had it delivered and it was fine, but they are best eaten super fresh. Service is a little slow, especially when I'm super hungry, but that just means they're making it fresh.   Keep it up Kimchi Grill :)
