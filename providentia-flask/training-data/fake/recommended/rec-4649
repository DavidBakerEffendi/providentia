When I first moved out here, I went to Yorkside a few times just out of convenience, and each time put in a different order, hoping against hope that whatever I decided to try would be miraculously superior to what I had tried before.  I used to let myself get dragged, but I haven't been back in almost a year. This is one of the few places I've eaten at in New Haven where the food just actively sucks.  I understand that it's an established joint, but I wonder sometimes how they stay in business.  A front for the thriving New Haven mob? The burgers aren't offensive, but definitely not good, and I don't understand the rationale behind ordering a burger at Yorkside when Educated is around the corner.  Pizza is also subpar, with rubbery cheese and thin flavor.  The pasta is TERRIBLE - can't get much worse than overcooked in runny sauce.  This was my order the last time I was here, and I ended up puking it out downstairs.  To be fair, this was entirely alcohol-related, but I think the story has symbolic weight.
