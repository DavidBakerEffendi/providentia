Ugh. Rude seating hostess, the waitress was both brusque and incredibly slow, their bathrooms are tiny and not particularly clean, and the food, while pretty tasty in the moment, gave me an awful stomach ache afterwards. The restaurant is admittedly very well-decorated, but that's not enough to make up for the rest of the experience.
