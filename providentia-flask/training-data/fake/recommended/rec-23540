I have been going to Myer's for years. Until recently, they never failed to have delicious, hot out of the oven bagels ready for a quick purchase. Now I fear those days are over. The last few times I have been, the bagels were not warm, and were tough and rubbery. Not sure if they are overworking the dough, or they changed the recipe, or they are just making them in advance and letting them sit overnight. As they are now, they aren't worth going out for. I *really* hope this is just a blip as they work out some wrinkles and that I can come back and revise/delete this review. If not, the Myer's of old will be very sorely missed.
