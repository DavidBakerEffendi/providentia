For a touristy cheesesteak place, the better of two choices. Better wiz-to-beef ratio than Geno's, crispier fries, no xenophobia, and no recoiling at the sight of a partially-eaten Geno's cheesesteak on their property. It needs no glamour or glitz or neon or motorcycles or signs worshiping dead cops as it was still early 1982, it just gets the job done while being surprisingly old school. Kind of like the Action News theme. Seriously, the fact that Pat's uses some sort of seasoning on their meat kind of makes the sandwich and soaks up some of the grease well unlike across the street where it's meat slices mixed with a wiz/grease combo. If I had to choose one of two of the big places for a cheesesteak, it'd be Pat's. Of course, a small neighborhood hole-in-the wall could do just as well.
