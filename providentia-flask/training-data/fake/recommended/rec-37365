My boyfriend, roommate and I were starving last Sunday afternoon. We recently moved to Bensonhurst after living in Bay Ridge for a stint and we were missing all of Bay Ridge's cute little places to eat and order food from. My boyfriend found Panino Rustico online and we ordered two of the salmon, goat cheese, avocado, caper panani; one panino with mackeral; and a salad with grilled chicken and avocado. Long story short...after we ate our panini, we called them back and ordered two more of the salmon one! SUPER DELICIOUS...and the texture of the bread was perfect. I'm subtracting one star because the delivery guy took a while, did not come up the stairs of our third floor walk up, and forgot to bring the salad. Other than that, this place makes me not miss Bay Ridge at ALL!
