I have been to Boqueria multiple times and they've always delivered what the restaurant is. A great authentic tapas place with lots of interesting dishes and an outstanding wine list. The service is attentive, cordial and professional. Management is always present and available to help when needed. I can't say enough good things about this place. The dates wrapped in bacon are one of my favorites as is the salted cod fritters. Also lots of seasonal options such as the tomato and watermelon gazpacho and salad. Wow, just delicious!!!! And the GM Patrick, is the perfect example of the hospitality this company is looking to give. Very knowledgable and approachable guy. Makes our visits worthwhile every time. If you're in NYC and want a fun, cool experience with delicious food, go to Boqueria SoHo. Satisfaction guaranteed!
