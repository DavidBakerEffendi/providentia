Since the area was apparently lacking for a decent cafe, I rate this place as it is as of today. The atmosphere is just fine. Their range could be more challenged and it is surprising if they have such limited kinds regarding their tea in a place as this. I don't fathom eating given others' reviews. I also find it problematic about their lighting so it is best to go when the sun is still up? It still serves me better than any other rotten cafes nearby that I don't bother to name in this cafe challenged desperation in Windsor Terrace.
