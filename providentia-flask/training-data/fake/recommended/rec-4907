Large comfortable banquet hall with huge dance floor and traditional hot buffet menu. Manager Tommy is very service-oriented. No request is too much trouble. Wait staff is experienced and pleasant. Bar selections are average: all the name brands for beer and liquor. House wines available although Tommy offered to order specific items to fit our event if we wanted. Bottom line: Fun, affordable, service-oriented staff, excellent food, drinks and pricing.
