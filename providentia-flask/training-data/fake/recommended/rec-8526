Hands down our favorite BYO... actually... it's a tie with Bibou. The pan seared foie gras is amazing - you'll want to get one to go. The staff is wonderful and attentive - we love Steve! The menu changes fairly regularly - monthly? I'm not sure. I like when restaurants change their menus with the seasons.
