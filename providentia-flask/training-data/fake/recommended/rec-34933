Having just moved to N. Jersey from TX I have been using Yelp like crazy.  Today I was craving some Indian food and once again Yelp has shown me the way.  Upon entering the restaurant the smell that engulfed me was wonderful. Some Indian restaurants are like a punch in the face upon entry but here was inviting and enticing.  Myself and my friend just went with the buffet and was I ever glad we did.  The food was delicious and the service was good as well.  Although there wasn't a ton of choices, what they did have was amazing.  I'm also giving bonus points for some of the best gulab jamen I've ever had!  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is I wish that they had samosas on the buffet.  But I suppose that is just me being greedy.  4 and a half stars.  Can't wait to go back!
