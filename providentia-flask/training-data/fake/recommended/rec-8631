1. Service was really poor on a Saturday.  They don't know how to efficiently get parties out to seat the parties waiting.  The girls were too busy talking amongst themselves to bus an empty table, and somehow paying for your food also takes forever.  I had to ask for water 3 times before I got it.  They also have that weird cash register/ATM setup which they charge you $1.35 to use... so bring cash, or bring patience.  I saw a worker fiddling with a huge bucket of ketchup (trying to open it with a dinner knife) and she ignored 3 people as they waited to pay to leave... mind you, there was a long line of hungry patrons outside, too.  Stuff like that just makes me irritated... 2. Food is mediocre, at best.  The mister ordered the western omelette which came with eggs out of a bag, I think.  Or at least it tasted like that (like the folded egg in a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit from McD's).  The ham came as slices of deli ham, which I didn't like.  The peppers were a bit overpowering.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes which may have well been round-shaped blueberry bread as it was dry, tasteless, and chewy.  The pancakes also had a cinnamon hint to it, which I didn't like.  We did enjoy the side of corned beef hash, which comes with bits of pepper and celery in it.  The home fries were okay, but the potato pieces were all different sizes... so as you can imagine, some were cooked through and others were not. 3. Value was pretty good.  An order of 3 pancakes, the omelette, a soda, and a juice came out to $19 w/tax.   4. Ambiance is totally hole-in-the-wall.  Complete with cracked pleather seats and everything is sticky... Overall, I wasn't impressed and the place definitely doesn't live up to the hype.  We did like the corned beef hash, though, so we'll probably try the place again to get that and the potato pancake.  But it's definitely not a place I'd waste my time standing in line again to eat at.
