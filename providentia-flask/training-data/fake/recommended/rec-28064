I found this place via yelp and so glad i tried it out. So first you get your seats then go to the buffet station where you can get every from rice to potatoes to pasta to salads etc.  You can fill up your plate with buffet items which get weighed when your done and you pay per pound.  Then they have a corner with the steak , susage chicken hearts which we all loved.  The steak is delicious.  The fried fish was great too I told my son it was chicken and he loved it lol.  This is a very casual place.  Try it out or take some to go.
