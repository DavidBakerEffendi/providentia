Had a variety of tapas here. Portions are small even for tapas, but still surprisingly filling. The space is narrow and dark~rustic, cute. Service was really really great. Played Neil Young on the system while I was there~nice on a snowy day. My waiter was very sweet and friendly. Knew the wines well, and seemed to be really happy to be there. Thats always a good thing. The white asparagus was a disappointment~canned? really? Anchovy stuffed tuna was quite yummy. Prices were definitely on the high side for the quality. Would not go out of my way to get here, but not a bad neighborhood spot. Would have definitely been another star if the price point didnt seem unreasonable.
