It is so nice to come to a restaurant that cares so much about their patrons. I've had the pleasure of visiting the Marshal a second time last Sunday and had a wonderful dinner with my husband. We live just around the block from the Marshal and was very happy to see a new neighborhood restaurant open up around the corner from us. Our waitress couldn't be any more friendlier and the owner  was also very attentive and caring. It is rare to see a owner be present at restaurant checking up on every single table and making sure that all the customers are having a great time. I love that! We started off with the chicken liver pate with duck fat and crostini. This was very delicious and tasty. We also shared an apple salad that was very refreshing and so healthy. My favorite of the night was the red snapper. It was served on this little wood board (see pic) and it was sooooooo good. So tender and cooked to perfection, I savored every bite of this. We also ordered a filet mignon which was very juicy and wonderful as well. We shared a side of roasted smashed yukon gold potatoes which were delicious too- so crispy and warm.. perfect for a cold winter day. We couldn't forgo dessert and ordered an ice cream sundae. It was HUGE and more than enough to share for two people. The owner Charlie, explained to us that they actually get all their ingredients from local suppliers (even the ice cream from sundae was from a local ice cream shop down the street) which explains why everything is so fresh and delicious. how cool is that. This was a delicious meal and I love knowing that their menu changes from time to time because everything is super fresh and provided directly by local suppliers. As for the atmosphere, it is so intimate and so cozy and so romantic.  A hidden little gem in Hell's Kitchen. I can't wait to come back again.
