YUM. incredibly fresh pasta, amazing service with hilarious waiters (or at least the waiter we had), great BYO, good for big groups OR an intimate dinner for two, AND had my boyfriend's number on file so called him when he left his credit card. PULPO: This octopus is the best version I've had of this dish. Before, it was Mario Batali's osteria mozza in LA - but the octopus was perfectly charred, sitting over potatoes. The only problem was that I wanted so much more of it. (pretty small portion) TONARELLI CACIO e PEPE: Totally simple and delicious, the way my bf likes it. The pasta was SO fresh and had the perfect consistency. Highly recommend if you like the pasta to just shine on it's own. PESTO PASTA: Also a very simple pasta, done with a very heavy pesto. The problem with pesto is that you eat so much of it without realizing the thousands of cals you've just consumed...the pasta itself was incredible, but I think lighter on the pesto would've made the dish a little better. PAPARDELLE TARTAFUTE: okay, we didn't have this one bc my man hates mushrooms. (i know, how do i live with this???) But, the waiter said it was the best thing ever, and I saw it go by and started drooling. Great place for a really authentic Italian meal- I know Philly has innumerable Italian restaurants, but I would definitely go with melograno for a moderately priced but delicious meal.
