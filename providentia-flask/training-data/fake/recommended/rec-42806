We had dinner at Trattoria Trecolori on our first Â night visiting NYC. The location was convenient, although I was a little sceptical, as it is in the heart of the tourist district. But I was wrong. The food was delightful. I had the Trecolori special pasta, which was delicious. The sauce was flavourful and a little spicy, which I loved. The texture of the pasta could have been better, but no complaints. My boyfriend had the chicken scarpariello, and to be honest I wish I had ordered that. Perfectly cooked with right amount of spices. Two mains, a bottle of wine and a couple of espressos + tip was $100.
