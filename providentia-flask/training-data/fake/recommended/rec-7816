There isn't much that I can say that would add new light or perspective on the pizza, for that read the other 290 reviews, the wiki page en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di…, or the countless newspaper reviews. I can't help but think about Pinkberry (I just had my first one of those recently) and how modern and shiny it was and how completely opposite DiFara's is to that. There is no rapid franchise growth, no fury for MORE, FASTER, NOW, $$$$$$.  We're out there craving artisan breads and craft beers, and going to places in a frenzy of buzz of something new, when really, it's something old. When I came in and saw the picture of Mr. DeMarco from forty years ago, from nearly the same position he was occupying at that moment, it was something special.  Watching the people crowded around watching him, reading the articles posted on every wall, vying for a crack of table to sit, all of it, was something special.
