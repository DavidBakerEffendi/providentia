I still like this place. It is loud and crowded with tables too close to each other, but there is such an upbeat mood, it can make a dreary day seem special. Despite the crowds, there are enormous numbers of wait staff and your drink and food order come quickly and politely. The food is good...maybe not the most exotic thai food in the world, but GOOD! I always feel better after eating here...blackened fish with mango salsa and the soft shell crab in green curry....a thai beer or two...or stoli on the rocks....finished with the cheesecake with lychee sauce. Damn, I'm hungry.
