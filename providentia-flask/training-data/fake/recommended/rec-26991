This was our first trip to Vermont and Montreal.  We really enjoyed Burlington.  Fortunately, we were staying within 1 block of this restaurant. My wife and I dined there twice...out of only three nights!  After the first visit, we couldn't wait to go back and so we did on the very next night.   Everything about this place is amongst the best.  Ambience, lighting, service, quality of ingredients, staff attitude and the FOOD!   First thing I noticed, is that the restaurant had privately labeled two bottles of wine from excellent producers in Oregon.  We have spent countless hours in the Willamette Valley, and love most of the wines from that region.  We ended up having both of their bottles both nights.  Couldn't help ourselves. The food was wonderful.  We ate at the food bar area in front of the cooks both nights.  All of the cooks and the Chef himself were obviously very serious about their profession and it showed.  Steak Tartar?  Watched the man make our dish and it was amazing.  Salads?  Watched the young lady prepare them with excellence and pride.  We had many small appetizer portions and never found anything that we just couldn't wait to have more of.  Homemade mozzarella salad?  Outstanding. Finally, I have to mention our server, Sophie.  She was excellent and she was able to serve us both nights. Friendly, knowledgeable, prompt and professional all in one beautiful young lady!   I will most likely never have the opportunity to visit Burlington again (this was a business trip), but if I do, I will go to this restaurant every chance I get.  If you go, just make sure to watch how well things are managed, smell the wonderful aromas and enjoy a wonderful time in an EXCELLENT restaurant.
