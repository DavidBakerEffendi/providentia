I'd give 2.5 stars, but that's not an option. My deciding factor was the "Meh. I've experienced better" caption for 2 starts vs. "A-OK" for 3. Decent, but nothing special. Everything was a bit bland. The "50% off" rolls menu is just a scam to make you think you're getting more for less. You're actually getting less for maybe a drop cheaper than other places...these rolls are very small. I got a spicy yellow tail roll and more than half of its filling was crunch flakes.
