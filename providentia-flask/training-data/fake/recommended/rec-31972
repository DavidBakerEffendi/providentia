Food here has gone way downhill. Last half-dozen visits the stuff was just not good, tasted a lot like frozen stuff that had been nuked, and not with care. I've moved my business next door to the BierHALLE, which, FYI, is not the same as this place. The Bierhalle has a very limited bar menu but so far it's been excellent.
