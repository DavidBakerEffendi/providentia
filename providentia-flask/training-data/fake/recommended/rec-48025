If you have a very good attitude and enjoy watching customers get made fun of by the employees and immigrants get yelled at while they are washing dishes, this is the place to go.   We walked in and there were two other people there.  They decided to not stay.  The guy, let's call him 'Jim',  taking the orders automatically muttered a comment under his breath and  screamed, shut the door on your way out.  We ordered the kobe burger, one side of french fries, chicken sandwich, and two coffees, came out to $33.  A very tiny chicken sandwich on stale bread and cold french friends came out 15 minutes later.  We meanwhile observed three people ordering a meal coming out to over $70 dollars and when verbally expressing how shocked at the price, they decided to take a couple items off their order, and 'Jim' said 'any other alterations to your order...?!'  another couple came in and just ordered coffee and let 'Jim' know the coffee had ran out. 'Jim' asked oh, well,are you good, or do you need some more?  the couple looked a little put out and just said it was fine and left, without ordering food and most likely, half filled cups of coffee.   after another 15 minutes of waiting for my burger i asked if i could be expecting it any time soon..'Jim' looked down and said, it's right here and presented it.  my medium rare burger was served medium, cool, tasteless, with a mealy tomato and no condiments.  Asking for ketchup, we were told to hold a second, while the counter guy yelled at the immigrants in the back about something and then we were given a saucer of ketchup.   And don't ask for napkins, apparently you shouldn't need them.  maybe it was an off day for 'Jim', and though we laughed a lot at the cruelty and bad attitude of this guy, we won't be going back, and we won't recommend this place to anyone we care about..
