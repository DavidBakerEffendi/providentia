I came to Uva with a big group this past week and we all really, really enjoyed it. I've been thinking about their meat and cheese plates all week and may have to go back this weekend! I'm a sucker for fresh pasta and Uva really gets it right. Their sauces are flavorful, portions are perfect and the service was really efficient. I'm so happy I found this place.
