fancy italian fit for a special occasion. it's become somewhat of a tradition to treat my girlfriend to a nice italian place on her birthday.  she loves good italian food and now she's got me addicted to fresh pasta.  our first experience with a vetri restaurant since moving to philly didn't disappoint.  our appetizers were elegant and filling.  grilled octopus salad was nicely charred with a touch of lemon zest.  salad special of the day was a mix of perfectly prepared veggies (dressed arugula, red and yellow beets, charred brussel sprouts, parsnips, salted tomatoes and roasted peppers).  for our mains, fresh pasta of course.  the wild boar bolognese and chicken liver rigatoni delivered large rustic bowls of light al dente pastas in rich flavorful sauces.  in retrospect, we would have been totally content with half portions.  desserts were recommended by our extremely attentive waiter.  pumpkin tiramisu and chocolate flan lava cake with a scoop of pistachio gelato.  we cleaned our plates.  our waiter also picked up on the birthday celebration remarks and brought out an extra scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with a candle.  nice touch.  thanks osteria for making it a special birthday dinner to remember for my girlfriend.
