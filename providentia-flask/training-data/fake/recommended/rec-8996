OMG To die for!!! This restaurant is open till the wee hours of the morn often serving culinary professionals from other restaurants. This place is always hopping. You pretty much need a reservation to get a seat as it's so busy & such a tiny little place. These people love their food & love to serve it to others who can appreciate their artistry. My friend would eat there multiple times a week & knew every staff member. They would cook things for him that were not on the menu. He would make a late evening of it after a long day at work. I tried dishes I thought I would be sick over, but they turned out to be the most delicious dishes I had ever had! (Bone marrow & oxtail marmalade. Pigeon. Crème brûlée done right. And some kind of chocolate 'cake' that was so moist & so thick & so scrumptious!) Whenever I make it to NYC, I always HAVE to stop at the Blue Ribbon in SoHo. Amazing food! AMAZING!
