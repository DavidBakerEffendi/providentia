BRUNCH. I've only been to The Smith for brunch, and I've been there for brunch many times. Why? Because I keep telling people about this brunch item - a potato waffle with perfectly poached eggs and a spinach hollandaise - and wax so rhapsodic about it that they all want to try. And then of course I have to go again too! There are other good brunch items - the chicken sausage with poached eggs, the giant bowl of potato chips with blue cheese, the handmade donuts, etc. - but every time I DON'T order the potato waffle benedict I end up staring at the plate of the person who did and cursing my own foolishness. Also, it's fairly easy to make a brunch reservation, which is great for out-of-town guests or really hungry people.
