CONS Sometimes, you get stuck in a 2x2 corner where you often bump elbows with strangers On weekend nights especially, the wait is long and you sometimes share tables (and it can get quite loud) The chef in the back, pulling noodles, creates awfully loud banging sounds while he's making them You drink from Styrofoam cups, and that's not really that classy. PROS (the only thing you need to take away from this review) The fact is, this is the best noodle place in NYC and it just happens to be in a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. But hey, it only adds character and it's always worth it when you get the food. Especially for $4-$6 for an entree, that's unbeatable. They should really save up money to expand the place though but still, Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is still a 5.
