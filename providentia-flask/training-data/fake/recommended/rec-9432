A funky joint serving up delicious sharing plates! The yellowtail char was excellently prepared. Scallops perfectly cooked. The mussels were a bit over cooked, the sauce a tad on the salty side. Ambience was very nice. Service staff second to none. Sch√∂fferhofer beer was amazing! Portion sizes appropriate. I will definitely be back soon!
