This place is fun! You can sit at a picnic table in the outdoor courtyard and play Jenga or ping pong while eating a cheeseburger and drinking a beer! Dining at Frankford Hall feels like you are at an outdoor festival, like an Oktoberfest event, but with better food. The burger I had (The Kanzler) was pretty good--the aged beef was tasty, and the cheese too--but it's the light-hearted, casual atmosphere that makes this place enjoyable.
