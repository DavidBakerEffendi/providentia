We ate at Sapori last night. We ordered the meatball and salami in a red sauce for an appetizer and the yellow and red beet salad. The salad was good but the meatballs came out ice cold. I hVe never been served ice cold meatballs and sauce before and it didn't taste good. Next my husband and my friends received there entrees and loved them but I received the linguine with mussels, clams and jumbo shrimp and again it was ice cold. I was vet disappointed and don't know if I will go back.
