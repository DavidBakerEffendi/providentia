Great spot with a solid laid back atmosphere.  There is a General Store in the front selling dairy and pastries.  I had the country pate with egg and bacon, it was great!  Can't beat it.  There is a good selection of craft beers and a good cocktail list.  Worth a trek in from Manhattan.  You will not regret evening here.  The service was also friendly and professional.
