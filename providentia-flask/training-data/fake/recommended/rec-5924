I went here because I knew a restaurant manager that raved about it... the fresh fish, the grilled octopus, etc etc.  It was a total disappointment.  The octopus was awful... hard, rubbery, burnt...  My fiancee's seafood linguine was saturated in some kind of broth that tasted like barely-salted water (and he ordered pasta, not soup.)  My shrimp dish with peppers and onions was over-cooked, bland, and something I could have made better in my own kitchen.  Nothing enrages me more as when I know I can cook better than the chef.  The service was curt and thoughtless... they brought out our entrees before we were even done our salad - AND we were seated at the bar so there was absolutely no room.  Hello!  Don't fire a course if you see we're nowhere near done!  Especially with seafood that cooks fast (although apparently they don't know that because they over-cooked everything.)  It's rare that I leave a restaurant bitter that I actually had to pay for their food.  This was one of those cases.  Will never. Ever. Be back.
