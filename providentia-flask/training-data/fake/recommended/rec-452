East meats west. True story, bro. Finally after all the anticipation of Umami Burger hitting up the Big Apple, IT IS HERE!!! Thank you Umami for bringing us one of the most juiciest burgers in my life. Meat that just literally falls apart in my mouth. Oh haiiii! And that bun. So soft and fluffay! I wasn't raving about the truffle fries. True, it did taste good. They were crisped yet soft from that lovely hint of truffle oil and topped with oozing cheese? Oh, my! But after a good 15 minutes, they became soggy and the cheese hardened. Not so great after that... But hey, we're here for the burger, right?! Staff is really friendly and enthusiastic. Always a plus one. Truth be told: expect a wait. Came here late at night and was expected to wait 2 hours. Â I came around 9:30 PM on opening night, put my name down & the guy with the list said "Well, if we don't seat you in an hour, I suggest it's probably best to find elsewhere to eat." Well, I think if my best friend & I didn't sit down by 10:30, I would've starved and headed to the next best place. But thanks to all the couples on the list before my friend and I for not sticking around because our 2 hour wait ended up being just 30 minutes. Now THAT is a thumbs up!
