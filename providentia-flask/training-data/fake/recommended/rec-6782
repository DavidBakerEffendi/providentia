Not much I can say about Osteria that hasn't been said, other than after living in Fairmount 5+ years I am now pissed at myself for not getting here sooner. I think the one misconception is that it is expensive - for $40 you can have the best food that will buy in Philly for two people - one pizza ($15-$20) & two half orders of pasta ($8-$10) and you are full. Beers at $7, but higher ABV & quality (My Antonia (DogfishHead) & Celebration (Sierra Nevada)) on tap during my visit.
