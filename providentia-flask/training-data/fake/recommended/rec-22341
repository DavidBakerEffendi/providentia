Stopped here after a long day of flying on our way home for dinner in May 2011. Very good Indian. We had lamb madras, chicken jalfrazie and our 9 year old had the app of mixed grilled meat (tandoori tit pit). We all had hot tea and the chai was particularly good. They also brought our son a "sample" mango lassi which was both kind and delicious. Food quality was fresh and spicy (we ordered it that way).  Madras had fresh curry leaves and both entrees were flavorful and delicious. Naan was also great.  Would Definitely stop in again.
