I LOVE SKETCH!!! as far as burgers go, this place is KING, from burgers better than ANYWHERE Ive ever been to amazing fries with awesome sauces the smashed onion burger is great, the kobe beef burger is really something special. but my personal favriote, the cyclops burger, bacon egg and cheese on a burger amazing.
