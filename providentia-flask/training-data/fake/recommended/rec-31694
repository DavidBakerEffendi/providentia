Ambiance/Decor/Atmosphere: Um, picture a cross between a chapel basement and an abandoned VFW hall and you get the inside of Rutt's Hut. Noise/sound level: Normal; mainly couples in there keeping their conversations to themselves.  The wait staff made more noise than any patron. Menu: In between small and normal size.  I guess over the years Rutt's Hut added a few diner like items to spice up the menu. Service: Attentive and friendly in the back, don't know about the front where the counter is.  A little unprofessional, but you're not coming to this place for that kind of service. Food: I made the mistake of ordering a fried scallop sandwich because I've never seen one before.  Stick to the basics and do not get creative.  These scallops were so hard it wasn't even funny.  I wouldn't give these to my boss.  But, the chili was delicious.  The big downside is you have to order everything as a side except for relish, even kraut.   Bar: Full bar on the other side of the dining room.  You can't beat a mug of Fosters for $1.30 to wash your rippers down. Price: Priced accordingly given the smaller portion sizes. Overall: A statewide icon for 86 years, but let's be honest, you're not going to Rutt's Hut for anything other than rippers, fries with cheese and gravy, onion rings, and beer.  It's a dump, other food items are less than stellar (had browning lettuce served to me), the decor is ghastly, and the service could use some training.  I'd return just for the rippers, chili, and fries.
