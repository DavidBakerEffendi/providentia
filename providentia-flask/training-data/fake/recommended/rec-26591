My mom, being the Groupon/Livingsocial fanatic that she is, purchased a deal for this place and we decided to dine here on Friday (7/27/12) after work (5:30p.m.). Upon entering it was a large space with few tables, a bar and a pole in the middle of the room (not even going to touch that topic.lol). The menu had a variety of things to choose from and our waitress was very helpful, offering suggetions of items on the menu (both food and drink) that were favorites. We ordered loaded fries and bbq wings as the appetizers and I ordered the Cobb Salad, while mom had the chicken sandwich. Overall, the food wasn't spectacular, but good nonetheless. We would return simply because the prices were good, food not bad at all and our waitress was really great. Plus she didn't give us any funny looks or anything being that we were using a Livingsocial voucher (as many do sometimes at other places). If you're in the area and want a burger, salad, wings, or tacos, i recommend it!
