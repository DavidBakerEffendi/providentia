I live in Ft. Greene and come here on both weekdays and weekends for the veggie- friendly, local food on the menu!  The design and ambiance of this place is amazing. Today, I was able to taste their Red Velvet Pancakes which were even more delicious than the sound.   The service is unbelievable and I really appreciate how the owners have really worked hard at making this not only a restaurant, but a place that serves the community!  It is one of my favorite spots and look forward to more visits to the Commune!
