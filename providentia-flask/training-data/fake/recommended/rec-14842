Nice little place with very nice staff. The service is what earns the stars for my review. Tried the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee...meh. I think I had reasonable expectations, but was underwhelmed (no exciting flavors or aromas that I detected, typical body). Tried the dumplings; they were good and nicely presented. Could improve the pastry options, which are out of house made muffins and cookies.
