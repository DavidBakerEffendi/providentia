My boyfriend spent some time in Thailand and when we first started dating suggested this thai place across from his apt, I had never really eaten thai (save pad thai) but was too shy to say no.  but it's AMAZING.  I reccomend the sausages, the fresh spring rolls are good, the papaya salad was amazing, tilapia with curry, crazy stuff i had never tried before as well, and i loved every second of it.  It's also got that quirky west philly thing going on which makes it fun.  BYO for sure. A crisp white wine with your meal will make it even more enjoyable.
