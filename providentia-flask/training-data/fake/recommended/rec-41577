New thai place just opened up. Wonderful meal. For appetizers we had cold tofu and kong pun aoy. The tofu was assembles with a spicy salad like mix in (corn, radish, alfalfa sprouts, red onions) the textures and the heat and sweet were delightful. The koong pun aoy (which is chopped shrimp, fried) had some good spice in it. It was cooked on a sugarcane which was cool. The texture was great. You actually get pieces of shrimp. I then has the ba-mee. It's like an upscale pork noodle soup. It was served with the soup separately. The soup it self was lovely. Light and yet it had a Cretan richness to it. When put into the bowl (i like my soup bowl with a bit less liquid so i didn't put the whole thing in, there is plenty for those who like more liquid) it formed a wonderful spice soup with a hint of sweet. The pork was cooked perfectly. Bok choy was crisp. Love the large pieces of crab meat. Eaten separately excellent. When eaten together an exceptional Â mouth full of one of the best soup bowls i have ever had. Eat every bit of it and rudely slurped the soup. The meal was a great experience. Can't wait to go back.
