i love olea and have been going to their brunch pretty regularly since living in the clinton hill/fort greene area. i can't speak for any of their dinner items nor many of their brunch items, but i can say that the parmesan toast is amazing. and i usually have entree envy when i see what people next to me are eating, though i've not been adventurous enough to veer from the parmesan toast. the service is standard, nothing extraordinarily hospitable or prompt, but i go during peak hour at brunch so am not expecting a welcoming committee. they're efficient and take time to refill coffee, which is good enough for me. the interior is homey and mediterranean with a smattering of huge plants that threaten to devour children left unattended. expect a considerable wait during peak hours, but be sure to while it away with their awesome bloody marys.
