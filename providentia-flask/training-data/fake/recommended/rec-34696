"White Sauce? Hot Sauce?" *said really fast with an accent* This place rocks. Great food and great price. The best part sometimes is waiting on line at 2am and mingling with people while you wait to get you hands on this savory street food. My fav is getting the chicken with rice and pita, no salad, little hot sauce and extra extra white sauce. The only downside is that this food only taste good when eaten right away (within 15 minutes of ordering). However, if you can't and are in the mood to experiment go to McDonald's and get some fries. When you get home poor the fries all over top the platter and then put it in the oven for like 10 min or so. It will taste soooooo good as the fries and sauces absorb each others flavors. Some of the fries will be extra crispy and taste great with a little bit of chicken and pitta from the platter. I'm so hungry right now. Try it!
