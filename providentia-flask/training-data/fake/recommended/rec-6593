I got to Brooklyn Flea last Sunday around noon. The line was about 20 people and moved along pretty steadily. Lobster rolls are $13 each. What the sign doesn't tell you is that they offer two types of lobster rolls - New England (cold, with mayo) and Connecticut (warm, buttered). I started salivating as we got closer, not to mention I was starving despite the half almond croissant from Almondine consumed a few minutes earlier. My friend and I settled on each getting a CT roll and sharing a NE. Both were heavenly and had chunks of lobster. The CT one was simply flavored. This is made to order so we had to wait a few minutes. The NE one was just as good. The mayo was really light. They had plenty of these being made continuously (and prob speeds up the line significantly). I'd go back in a heart beat...
