Went here because there was really no other option after bowling next door. First thing that irritated me was they flat out LIE about their "freshly squeezed orange juice". Ask the wait staff "is your orange juice REALLY freshly squeezed?" and they tell you "well, it comes in little bottles, I guess it is squeezed somewhere else then shipped here". The Greek Salad was mediocre at best but my hubby hated his sir loin steak. Waitress sold it hard to him but it came burnt on outside and uncooked on inside (asked for Medium Well). He also said it was WAY too fatty and the rice was served on a different plate with no sauce or garnishing at all. Looked like prison food to me. WORST OF all was the annoying Christmas Muszak they have blasting. omfg, I wanted to kill someone by the time we left. They boast "Best Pan Cakes in the World" on a massive sign inside, but I am guessing this is also a placebo like their "fresh" orange juice. Bring your own food and head phones and you will be fine.
