I had high hopes about Modo Mio because it's only three blocks from my house and every time I walk by it's packed. I was sorely dissapointed. We got there at 8:55 for a 9 pm reservation, and stood in an incredibly packed waiting room for 40 minutes before being seated. Strike one. We were set at a 4 person table with another couple on a date. Elbow to elbow. Strike 2. They brought the other couple's food to us. Strike 3. The portions were tiny, and all of our menu items were marginal at best. Honestly the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time.
