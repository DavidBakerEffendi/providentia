Went when the world probably was on vacation and waited over an hour for a seat for two... I've been to their downtown location and food is no different. Wings were crispy and tasty, and akamaru modern hit the spot on a cold day. Def get the extra egg! Â Nicely soft boiled. We sat at the bar by the kitchen and watched the action. Service was nice and we were there right as lunch service was ending and they went around for last calls. I have to admit though, I prefer totto ramen as their broth is more flavorful and pork a bit more "melt in your mouth" but Ippoudo waiting area is indoors so no complaints!!
