Hoagie Haven is the king of all sandwiches. I've traveled far and wide, and I've never found a sandwich that compares to any place in the area. The key to all of the sandwiches is the bread - it's light and fluffy stuff that crisps up just enough with a light toasting, but gives a satisfactorily spongey give with each bite. It soaks up the flavors and seasonings of the sandwiches and can withstand whatever you decide to get on your sandwich. And boy, can you get some things on your sandwich here. The usual staples are all here - cheesesteaks, chicken and eggplant parm, cold deli sandwiches - but the real joys come from what you can get on your sandwich. Mayo, hot sauce, Sanchez sauce? Check. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, hot peppers, pickles? Check. Salt, pepper, oregano? Check. Those are all the standard things you would expect from any sandwich place. Hoagie Haven lets you put things like cheesesteak, chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks on a sandwich. Feel like chicken tacos inside of your cheesesteak? They'll do it. Hoagie Haven is not for those who are looking to be health conscious. There are a few items on the menu which could be considered healthy, I suppose, but the real reason to come here is to get some delicious, greasy stuff that will satisfy your craving, especially after a long night out at the Ivy. I've been coming here for over a decade, and every time I come back, I always remember why. Hoagie Haven is a staple of Princeton, and deserves to be known as the king of sandwiches.
