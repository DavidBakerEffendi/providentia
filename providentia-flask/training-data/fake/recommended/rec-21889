Great burgers, great pulled-pork, great italian sausage. Friendly staff. This is a weekend favorite.  I have to try to go when there's no game on the TV though.   If you like sitting next to people who talk/yell at the TV when there's a game on, go for it!  My spot at the counter will be waiting for you. I enjoy eating at the counter when it's not busy.  It's a relaxed atmosphere.   All in all, it's a nice place to eat and they have great food. Just bring your earplugs or some xanax if there's a game on!
