Growing up in Philly it was widely acknowledged that Geno's was better than Pat's, though Pat's had the name recognition.  Nothing has changed through all those years.  Pat's may be the worst cheesesteak in all the city. There are four types of people who prefer Pat's. First, those who are loyal to a brand.  Maybe they were just brought on Pat's and they stuck with it.  This is not much different than the Coke v Pepsi situation. Second, those who actually like Pat's steaks.  This is a small number of people I am sure, but they do exist.  Some people actually like Little Debbie's.   Third, politically correct, leftist, haters who don't like the food, but go to Pat's just to tell their leftist, PC friends that they didn't eat at Geno's. Fourth, hostile illegal immigrants with a chip on their shoulder who think the world revolves around them. Fifth, tourists who don't know any better. Pat's cheesesteaks are tasteless, undersized and come on a plain, squishy roll that tastes like it was made by Wonder.  There is just nothing to recommend about it. Maybe the worse thing is that Pat's is usually dirty.  Look across the street at Geno's.  It is spotless.  At Pat's you never know what you might catch. On second thought, the worst part is that tourists come here expecting to get a real, top quality cheesesteak and end up with perhaps the worst possible example.  It is too bad Pat's doesn't have more pride in their product.
