I come here quite often for lunch during the week.  It's usually three of us and we pretty much order the same dishes every time we go.  Beef Chow Fun, Beef Pan Fried Noodles and one of the two....Sweet and Sour Pork Chop or Orange Beef.  That's plenty of food for three of us and one of the guys that comes with us is a BIG eater.  The dishes come with complimentary house soup or we sometimes go for the hot and sour soup. We're regulars so we go there for the food and not really the service.  But honestly, we've noticed the service has gone down a little bit.  We've seen some new waiters at the place and they are pretty poor at their job.  Spilling food, dropping food off plates, not following up if the dishes are good.  It's fine for us but for other customers, that's not acceptable. The prices are very reasonable.  For the 3 dishes we usually pay $24-$27 (including tip/tax)...that's only $7-8/pp which is reasonable for the amount of food we get.  They definitely have lost customers since Qin Dynasty opened up across Rt. 46.  That will be another review....
