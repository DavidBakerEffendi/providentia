My friends who are visiting from another country wanted a fun place to get drinks last minute. I heard that Employees Only had great drinks and atmosphere, so I called to ask if we would have a place to sit within the next half hour. The hostess/waitress who answered the phone was extremely nice and even though (when we got there) it was super busy, she saved us a table in the bar area! The drinks we ordered- Amelia, Lazy Lover, a bottle of wine, etc., were all absolutely delicious and well prepared. The ingredients used for the mixed drinks tasted of high quality. It got pretty busy and happening around 11pm. I would definitely recommend this place for drinks, and heard that their food is great so next time I will make sure to try it :)
