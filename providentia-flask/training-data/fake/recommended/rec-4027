Always a great dining experience. The food is great, inexpensive, and more than just regular diner fare. They have mango-walnut waffles, chipotle chicken omelettes, and a wide variety of other great foods. The wait might be a little trying for those who are impatient, but it's never too long a wait. On the super generous upside, you can often expect a bevy of snacks and drinks while you wait. There's been coffee, water, sausage, bacon, melon, strawberries & cream, cinnamon toast, and plenty of other great treats. Â And to make it even better, it's all free! After the not-so-long and none-too-arduous wait you're usually greeted at the front of the queue by Gus, (presumably the owner) who makes sure that you're doing ok thus far and will lead you to your table. He often pops up later on in the meal just to make sure that everything is just right. Which it is. It's decorated sort of like a T.G.I.Friday's might be, with "a lot of crazy crap on the wall" but each item that's placed there has been done so with purpose and care. I'd give it five stars but they're not open on Sundays. I've heard that the Suzanne Vega song is about this place, but I've also heard that it's about the Tom's on 112th. (Wiki says it's the 112th, but whatever) oh. Also don't forget the egg creams, they're worth it.
