I came here on a Sunday at 12 pm.. Was told to wait an hour and a half to be seated .. Never in a million years would I wait so long but because I was really craving fried pork chops and waffles .. (Something I have never tried but really wanted to try and wasn't in the mood for your typical eggs Benedict brunch) I decided I would suck it up , walk around a little and wait. Besides the hostess having a little bit of an attitude, we were seated after exactly an hour and a half. So here I am all excited to try these pork chops.. I order them and right then and there, another lady comes up to my waiter and tells him we just run out !!!!!! You can just imagine my disappointment .. Oh man was I pissed. Seriously guys , your famous for this meal, why not be a little more prepared especially at the peak time of brunch. If I didn't have to wait so long to be seated and they were out , I would have been a little less pissed. You know you win some you lose some. But that wasn't the case ! I had to wait and I didn't get to eat what I wanted .. Double whammy .... Anyway, they had good bloody Mary's so I'll give them two stars for that and some comfy bench chairs. I ordered a side of waffles so I would at least have half of the meal I initially wanted . Better than nothing right? But even that was hard and dry !! Would I come back ?! Def not !!! I'll go try pies and thighs and maybe sweet chick the next time I'm in the mood for a fatty brunch. I'll wait 45 min if I have too !
