Their sandwiches taste so so good, the best one I ever ate before! Mook's PBLT: They use their secret source to perfect the pork belly! The tomatillos they Â put in the source is a perfect matching with the pork belly! A must-try! Fried Chicken&kimchi: I don't even know fried chicken can be so tasty until I ate theirs. The kimchi goes so well with the chicken. Mook's, you did a really good job! Feed my stomach but also satisfy my appetite!
