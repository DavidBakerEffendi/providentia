I came here for a quick lunch on a break and spent 25+ minutes waiting....the sign did warn that brunch items could take 10-15 minutes but 25 was needlessly excessive. I did get to stand there and watch the kitchen for a long time and I got to see plenty of people who ordered brunch items after me get their food before my friend and I did (we both ordered the egg sandwich). The best part about waiting was the other 3 people in our group (two of which also spent a long time waiting, but not as long as us) were able to find a table and finish their food before we sat down so there was more room for us and our sandwiches. I couldn't even eat my food; I bit into it and there was something so hard inside that after the bite I opened it up and found a half-dollar sized black disk that I think was supposed to be sausage...I didn't even realize that it was so hard that I didn't even get a bite out of it. Maybe if it hadn't sat on the grill for 25 minutes both these problems would have been resolved. It was literally inedible. I did get to taste some of the other food; the eggs benedict was at least edible, but the staff, environment and sausage really killed the experience.
