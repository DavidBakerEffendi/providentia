Today I decided to go to Tmoms because it was an old haunt that had quality food and inexpensive drinks for the area.  My boyfriend and I met two friends and shared a "vegan steak" and a small cheese fries.  We also had 4 drinks total.   The "vegan steak" was a freezer burnt garden burger in a stale roll.  We added cheese, lettuce and tomato and we got a few springs of wilted greens and two slices of Roma tomato.  It cost almost 12 dollars for something disgusting.   Now to the drinks.  I asked for a big gin and tonic.  The bartender did not ask me if it was a talk or a double, just brought it out in their "trick" pint glasses that are not 16 oz. that was also mostly ice.  I had two and my boyfriend had one and a local beer.   Our bill came to 58 dollars for 5 sips of cocktail each and the worst "veggie steak" ever.  Each drink was apparently $13!  I basically bought them 2 whole bottles of gin for about 4 shots.   I remember when Tmoms was awesome and I used to recommend it.  Now I will tell people how much the food is unacceptable and the bartenders overcharge.  I would have thought that the bartender might have told me that the crappy ice filled drinks he was making me were $13.  I could have had a few nice martinis at a classy joint.  Not a seeming dive bar filled with teenagers.  That's another thing.  Why was a group of 14 year olds eating in a bar?   I never complain, but I left Tmoms hungry and not even feeling slightly happy from $45 worth of booze.
