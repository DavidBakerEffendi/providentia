I love this place! Villa Di Roma is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in Philly. Every time I come back to Philly my first stop is always Villa Di Roma (I hope to land around dinner time so I can head right over there). This place is so laid back, you see people here in sport jackets and you see people here in track suits or shorts, anything goes. Every table has their own feel and is autonomous from each other, so dress how you like. What can I say, Villa Di Roma has some of the best Italian food around. The entire menu is just awesome, from the chicken cacciatore to the lobster and shrimp over linguine to the mussels in red. The musts when coming here: start with mussels in red, either for yourself or to share. Get some garlic bread so you can dip it in the gravy. You also need to get the villa salad, you'll thank me later! For dinner, anything goes. Anything from the menu is pure win. The meatballs here are so good, even if you get seafood or a meat dish, I recommend getting a side of them just for the opportunity to eat some of the best meatballs around. For dessert, the obvious choice is a cannoli. If you want to try something else that is delicious, order the tartufo (vanilla and chocolate ice cream around cherry puree, formed in to a ball, dipped in chocolate and frozen)... I'm dreaming about it right now. Just a reminder, they only accept cash! I make the trek all the way from the Main Line, and on my flights home from Arizona I dream about stopping there for dinner. If that isn't enough motivation to come and try it, I don't know what else is.
