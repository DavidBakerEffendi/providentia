I was really looking forward to coming here, as I'm a HUGE French fry fan!! But the fries werent very flavorful on their own and I didn't particularly love any of the sauces I got either. If I were in the area and needed a snack I may stop by to try a few other sauces, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Note a small will feed 2 easily!!!
