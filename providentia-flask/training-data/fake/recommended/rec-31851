Born and raised in Vietnam and eating banh mi every single day for the better part of my childhood, I have to say Banh Mi Zon is very authentic and easily on par with even some of the best banh mi you can find in Vietnam. Meticulously handcrafted & well balanced proportions of the ingredients. I never wrote a review for a restaurant before, but the banh mi is so good it would be unfair if I don't give it a 5 star.
