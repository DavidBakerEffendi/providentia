I went on a Friday night with my girls for dinner. The place was pretty packed but we got seated right away. We started off with a pitcher of sangria which was amazing.. it had all of us feeling pretty nice. For starters we went with the guac (which comes with baked chips) and the bolinho de pescado... Both were delish. I ordered the churrasco with garlic mash and my friends went with the yuca encrusted salmon and espresso bbq ribs. We all really loved our orders. I would've given Yuca Bar 5 stars if it weren't for the loud ass music. Initially the music they had playing had us singing and wanting to get up and dance. Then mid dinner the music went from enjoyable background music to full blown night club status. It was so ridiculously loud that we had to shout at one another in order to communicate. I just think if there isn't a dance floor then there should be no reason for the volume to be turnt all the way up. Hopefully it was just that one night.
