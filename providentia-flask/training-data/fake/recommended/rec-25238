Don't let the small space fool you.  This young taqueria serves up some big time tasty Mexican food with WHOPPING flavor!  The nachos are to die for, and I'm pretty sure the guacamole will top any guac-off for years to come. I've had the roast chicken, al pastor tacos, quesadillas and can I talk about the nachos again?  The toppings deliver so much flavor and for such an amazing price, it's hard to ever want to go to another Mexican restaurant again.  You'll leave with a full belly and happy wallet.  See you there!!
