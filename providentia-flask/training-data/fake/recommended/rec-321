Came here on a Saturday night, called in reservations for a table of 7 an hour before (glad I did because we skipped the line on the street). We were seated all the way in the back up against the counter, it was tight seating and we were a little squished (shoulder to shoulder, with little room to pull out chair without hitting the person behind you). The only issue I have is that they should REALLY have air conditioning! My family and I walked all the way up from touring the Statue of Liberty on a hot, muggy day. We're usually fine with heat but the restaurant was very crowded, and being squished together across from the kitchen didn't help our situation. I don't mind being close to other people, but cool air would've made the experience much better. I was constantly fanning myself and drinking a lot of water. I think there was a fan somewhere, but it still felt like a dense cloud of humidity. It was just one of those sticky summer nights. Anyway! On to the food - which was great and made up for the fact we were all hot. The pasta dishes were delectable and the bottle of wine was perfect for easing the uncomfortably close quarters.
