Never been to this place but I am at work and called today at 9 am to find out what time they are closing. The guy that answer the phone started to yell over the phone that he just opened up and I am asking what time he is closing!!! Buddy I don't give a rats ass what time you open.....I need to know if I can make it there after work!!! Â You sounded very arrogant to a potential new customer. Now I prefer to give my business to another vendor.
