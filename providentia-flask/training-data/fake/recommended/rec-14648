Good pizza, but super duper hot inside!!  I'm sure it will be better when it's freezing outside... but until then...we couldn't wait to get outta there, maybe the air con was broken. Do not order the "Prosecco", it's not. Most entrees around $17.  Stick to arugula salad and a pie.  Overworked looking, but nice staff.
