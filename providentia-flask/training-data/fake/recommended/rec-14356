I should be considered a pizza connoisseur at this point, specifically NYC pizza, and I'm happy to report that Prince Street Pizza gave me the best slice I've yet to have. Don't look for ambiance in this joint (though overlooking Prince St was enough ambiance for me), but your taste buds will dance with excitement. Cheers to their margarita pizza and their cheese square!!!
