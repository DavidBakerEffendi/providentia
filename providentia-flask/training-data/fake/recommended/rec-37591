They have happy hour every weekday from 5 - 7pm. Buck a shuck oysters and $5 cocktails! Everyday they have a different buck a shuck oyster for happy hour. They are always fresh and plump and juicy. Seafood Bouillabase is pretty tasty too - flavorful and they don't skimp out on the mussels and clams. Canadians beware! Remember to bring your passport. It's pretty annoying that they don't accept Canadian driver's license. Seriously!? Who brings around a passport? That really irks me or else I would have given this place 4 stars. This same rule applies to Harvest Seasonal Grill & Bar, which is run by the same owner.
