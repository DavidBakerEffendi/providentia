I love this place! I have been here a few times, and while it's never really been bumpin', it's always been interesting. I came here a couple times with a guy I was casually seeing. One time we spent half the night talking to a guy with a Scottish accent whom we started calling Sean Connery; we ended up doing a bunch of shots together and waxing philosophical. Another time, it was open mic night and we listened to some spoken-word poetry. I have also been here for dinner with my parents. We each had a different cheeseburger and enjoyed our respective meal very much. In fact, the burgers are the only thing I have ever eaten here because they are so good. The bartenders have always been friendly and efficient. The d√©cor is kind of hipster, in a way that appeals to me. Also, the place is pretty clean.
