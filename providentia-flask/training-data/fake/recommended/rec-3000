A frIend and I went here on a whIm. To start, the pretzels were amazing. I ordered the swordfish BLT but was disappointed! The sandwich, while tasty was very, very oily. The must've brushed the bread with olive oil before toasting and that Â combined with oily swordfish and what tasted like pesto, the whole thing was a greasy gross mess. My friend ordered the veggie lasagne which consisted of 2 strips of pasta with overcooked eggplant in between.
