What... it can't be true...the bread cart is gone??  What were they thinking?  Pretty big mistake by Bouley if these reviews are correct --------------------------------------------------­------------------------------------ Any restaurant that pushes around a cart of bread with about 10 different varieties is the place for me.   Bread cart...where have you been all my life.  I will come back to this restaurant just for you! Dinner was also delicious.  The atmosphere was a little formal and stuffy, but you forget about that once you start eating your dinner.  The bakery is also great because you can buy the Bouley breads and other french treats.
