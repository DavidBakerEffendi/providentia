Cozy little restaurant and all the wait staff is awesomely friendly. It almost seemed like they were jumping over each other to serve me. Great service, delicious food, and the strongest espresso I have ever had. I made a reservation a day in advance without any problems for 6.30 on a Friday night. By the time we were done, the restaurant was packed full. Everyone seemed to have ordered the muscles and they smelled heavenly, but we went with the chicken spring rolls, branzino, and the hanger steak. They were all fairly big portions and I was stuffed, but who can say no to dessert? We shared the profiteroles and espresso. All in all, this is a very lovely restaurant.
