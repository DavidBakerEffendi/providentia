I ordered the half roasted duck ($9. Full duck is $17). Very yummy. May be a bit on the salty side. I have been Eating it with my meals throughout the days. It's a ver tiny to-go only place FYI. Smells a bit funky in there so hold your nose if you've got a sensitive on. I believe cash only as well so bring cash!
