Huge Salad and Appetizers selection! Place is enormous. You get fresh cut meat from waiters walking around and slicing it for you when you pleased. Talk about less work and more chow time. I love meat but damn I just love it more! Seasoned just right and tastes so good. The cheese bread...JESUS! I can eat that all day long. You got your fried banana's and then there's that tofu looking thing I didn't even touch it. I don't know why maybe I was too busy drooling over my fresh cuts. We had reservations for lunch time so we can get a good meal for the price of $32.50 a head. I would come here once a week if I had some ICanEatWhateverIWant money. The Exotic Mango is good. The Mojito and I'm a Mojito guy was sooooo strong....Damn it 3 of them and I was floating. It was like I was amongst the clouds in the sky. The Brazilian lemonade was something very different but very good. Me and my friends end up Google the recipe to make our own. There's the one hot waitress walking around with this little gadget of hers and scooping up the meat from the table, she had skills.
