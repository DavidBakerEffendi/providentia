Visited here for Valentines. I was immediately impressed with the interior design, the ceiling is decorated with clay pots. The menu was a 3 course prix fixe. Â We shared the artichoke heart moussaka (anginares moussaka) and the fresh california spinach salad (not on the regular menu) for appetizers; I had the baby lamb chops with porcini and garlic mashed potatoes; and for dessert the only option was the Crisp phyllo Napoleon layered with Greek yogurt. Pros: the baby lamp chops were amazingly delicious. The dish served 4 fatty lamb ribs which were the best ribs I've had. Cons: Made my reservation a month beforehand. The seating assignments are a bit cozy. The food aside from the baby lamb chops were just above average. I was not a fan of the dessert. Will probably return at some point for the baby lamb chops!
