Whatta great find! Stopped by for a drink before the show. Ended up having a bruschetta. Man, was it amazing! It's not your regular saggy piece of bread with tomatoes. It was with different kinds of cheese spreads... I can't wait to come back for dinner really soon. Good job, guys! Beautiful restaurant and delicious appetizers :)
