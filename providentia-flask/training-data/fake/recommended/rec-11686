Loved this place!  Awesome guac and awesome (and strong) margaritas.  I had the shrimp and scallop dish which was a little spicy for my liking, but the waiter gave me forewarning so I probably should have gone with something else.  My friend had the skirt steak and it was AWESOME- we couldn't stop eating it.  Really solid food and I hear their unlimited brunch is lethal- need to try soon!
