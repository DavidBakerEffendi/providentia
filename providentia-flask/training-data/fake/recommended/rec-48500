We got here late about 9:00 pm on a Monday.  Place was pretty crowded.  The bread is amazing, definitely have it.  We ordered the calamari which is a little spicy.  Excellent.  I had the bbq ribs which were very good.  The presentation was nice, but made it hard to eat.  That's my only knock on the place.  The ribs came with sweet potato fries, honey mustard and slaw - all good.  My companion had the Thai Chicken.  She said it was good, but a little sweet. There service was great. Hunter was our waiter and he was very attentive but in a great way.  At the end of the night we found out he's a trainee.   I'd recommend Molly's
