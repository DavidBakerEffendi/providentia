I'm not the kind of person to give reviews but; went today for drinks & wings and their MANAGER/Waitress aka CHARLOTTE was VERRRYYY rude. As we agreed to share out table w/ the Passaic football coaches she wanted us to get up to give them out table as if we weren't paying customers; WHEN THEY WERE OK to share the table as well.. then threatened to call the cops! Really Charlotte!?? By no means were we rowdy, refused to pay or didn't spend a hefty amount there! I support my local business & ppl w/ in the community since I work for the community BUT CHARLOTTE shame on u for being an UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER & judging people!! #CHARLOTTESUCKSASAMANAGER
