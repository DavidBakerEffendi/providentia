I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich it came with blue cheese on it with fries on the side. There really wasn't anything special about the meal. I couldn't manage to eat the entire sandwich without it falling apart in my hands. The blue cheese was a bit overpowering for my taste. And the fries were soggy and unappealing. Ended up throwing 3/4th of it away -- a waste of $15. I Won't order from here again.
