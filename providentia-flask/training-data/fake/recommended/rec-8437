This is really the best dumpling joint in the area. The dumplings are thinner and lighter than the heavier ones at Vanessa's, two doors down, which hail from a different region of China I guess (North?). Service is friendly and patrons are, too, especially if you order the fish bone soup, where they'll advise you to be very careful indeed.
