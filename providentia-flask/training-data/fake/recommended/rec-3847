Another overhyped eatery in NYC. This place is resting on some ill-deserved laurels.  Yes, while you wait in the nonsensically long line, you will be offered orange slices and cheap cookies.  But being given free mediocre food while waiting in line, only to make it inside and be given even more mediocre food that you then have to pay for is too much insult to bear.   I came here after visiting the Brooklyn Botanic Garden with an old friend.  The only memorable thing about this place was the magnitude of the inverse proportion between (a) the quality of the food and (b) the popularity.    I remember having some lackluster grits, among other things, and my friend had some edible pancakes.  This was basically a meal at a Waffle House but with higher prices and more hipsters.  Edible, but at this point in its history, it's relying on style more than substance. The old-timey soda fountain-y drinks were intriguing, but I didn't try any.  Maybe worth a visit for the vintage flair.   Overall, recommended only if you are insanely hungry, and cash-poor (and/or homeless), and in the neighborhood, and have few scruples--i.e., stand in line for the free snacks and then get on with your day.
