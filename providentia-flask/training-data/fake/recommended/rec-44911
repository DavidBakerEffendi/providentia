We found out about this restaurant from a woman on the street in the theater district.  She said this was her favorite Italian restaurant in town.  I understand why. This place is a long and narrow space but very light and airy feeling not dark and dank like many others in NYC.  I love that the kitchen is at the end of the restaurant and open so that you can see what is going on in the kitchen and that the chef and staff can feel the pulse of those dining out in the restaurant. The evening was delightful starting with a wonderful raspberry martini recommended by Wanna the bartender.  We had a melt in your mouth lightly pan fried crab cake as an appetizer. Dinner consisted of a fabulous seafood risotto and VERY tender lamb shank in a tasty red sauce.  Our wait staff was attentive and happy to make dinner suggestions. This is a small neighborhood restaurant that is unpretentious.   Food and customer service is first and foremost for Basso56. I highly recommend this lovely little Italian restaurant near the theater district in NYC.
