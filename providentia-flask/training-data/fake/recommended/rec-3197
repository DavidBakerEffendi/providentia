Tried to go to this place one night and the line was too long and we were too hungry to wait so had to give up. So the next time I found my self hungry at a random hour, I figured 'why not try the corner bistro'? As predicted, the place was quiet, with a few guys sitting at the bar. We sat at the bar and ordered burgers straight up. Their burgers taste honest. It's not made with kobe beef or dressed with asian inspired sauce but it's juicy, well seasoned, and grilled to perfection. In some ways, this is probably what a burger should taste like.
