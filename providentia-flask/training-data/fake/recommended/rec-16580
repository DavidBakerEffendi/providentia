great food. my friend from tokyo said, "wow, this place is cramped even by tokyo standards!" -- like seriously both my elbows and my back were in direct contact with other patrons for most of my meal. the servers wanted to explain every dish as it arrived and eventually that started to wear a little thin. again, though, loved the food.
