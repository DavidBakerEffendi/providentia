I used to love Egans, but I won't be going back again. Their computers went out and we were told we couldn't leave because they didn't have a bill for us. Okay, we will deal. We then ordered another meal for someone who arrived late and it took over an hour. Another hour passed and we were over waiting. We flagged down our server and ask what the solution is since the computers are down. We offered to make a list of what we order, she stated that she will not be able to do that because we may lie. She then said she'll call the cops (this is while we all have our money out to pay). Â We asked for the manager and she refused to bring her over. Finally the manager came out and didn't offer us free drinks, a discount or anything and said we had to leave a credit card without any idea of the price. She even told us we would be charged gratuity even though the server yelled at us! I will not be going back!
