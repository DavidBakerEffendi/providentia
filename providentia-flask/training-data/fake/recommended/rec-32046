Well shut my mouth!  I am not sure how you improve on the roast pork sandwich.  Four or five simple, quality ingredients, expertly prepared meld to create a complex taste experience - to me, this is the essence of enjoyable food.   Any of the ingredients on their own (the roast pork, the brocolli rabe, the sharp provolone, the roasted peppers) would be enjoyable.  Combine them and they become almost magical.
