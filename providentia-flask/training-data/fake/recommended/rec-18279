This has a great atmosphere and ambiance, but that's about the only thing which is good here. We came with a group of 10 and had made a reservation 2 weeks prior. When we arrived they were understaffed-thus our food came out late and cold. 1 member of our group did not even get his food until everyone else was finished. If that wasn't bad enough, the menu items did not come out as listed on the menu. Example:the vegetable pasta was listed as including wild mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini and carrots. It came out with just zucchini and carrots which conveniently happened to be the same thing and the "vegetable medley" served with other dishes which consisted of zucchini and carrots. When we inquired if mushrooms were available, the waitstaff was rude and completely dismissed the concern. Upon asking for the check-the waitstaff had an attitude and we're going to charge for the pasta which we did not even eat. Overall recommendation-do not eat here!
