Fabulous hummus and falafels- definitely one of the best in the city. Portions are big, especially for the price. It's only $5 for a huge falafel sandwich.  As far as seating goes the experience is far better if you can get a seat in their back room - really pretty with skylights and lots of hanging plants.  Service can be slow here,  but the atmosphere and food absolutely make up for it!
