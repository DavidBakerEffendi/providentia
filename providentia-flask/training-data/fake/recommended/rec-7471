The food was great.  Crispy Red Curry Salad and Khoi Soi were awesome.  The all you can drink beer was a struggle with the keg flowing bad and serving plenty of foam.  The bar backs and bartenders were great and figured it out and kept bringing me beers.   I wish i could have tipped just them.  The waitress was awful.  She obviously wanted to leave and was rushing us through our meal at 9:45pm on a Tuesday.  She was late to something.  She kept trying to pick up our plates.  I had to take it out of her hands at one point to stress i wasn't done.    I read this article from the GM about customers not being a dick to get good service.  He should realize that not being a dick should start with his own wait staff !! blogs.villagevoice.com/f…
