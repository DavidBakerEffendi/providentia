Being from DC, I have to say I'm sadly underwhelmed. Came on a Tuesday afternoon close to 4pm; figured I could beat the lines since it was pretty off-time. Nope. Still waited a good 20 minutes (party of three). We were seated at a bar-style table; there's a small ledge to put your bags under the table and hooks on the side for jackets. Very cramped. Maybe seats 15 total. Staff was friendly and I guess everyone spoke Japanese, so I knew it was authentic which was a plus. Got the Miso Ramen; came with an egg, bean sprouts, green onion, and pork (can choose between pork & chicken). Honestly didn't know what to expect... They add a dollop of miso in the middle which makes the broth really thick once it's dissolved. Also, there was a definitive alcohol taste in there (probably sake) which was a little too strong for my liking. Everything else was average, but for me it's really the broth that makes or breaks it. Probably won't be going back whenever I come back to NY. Still like the local places around here better.
