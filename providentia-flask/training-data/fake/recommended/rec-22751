This is going to be another review from someone who knows what to expect from a Breakfast joint and because of that is fully aware Mo's DOES NOT deliver! Cheap ingredients, under cooked, over greased, common fare menu. I've never seen anything that's "signature " or out of the ordinary at the place besides the buckwheat pancakes and even then they taste like crap and if you're someone who wanted to go out for pancakes to take a break from eating healthy you're out of luck. its the one healthy item on the menu and its unavoidable. if i'm ever stuck going to this place i keep it really simple as to not put myself in a position to get disappointed. eggs, toast, potato pancakes. but honestly this place survives off of ignorant college kids who wont go any further than 3 miles from their dorm for food. and any other fool who hasn't the ability to find someplace better. when Cisco was still on prospect doing breakfast at East West Grill i was happy to recommend people there. now that hes in Newington its harder but thats still one of the best breakfasts in CT! yelp.com/biz/ciscos-amerâ€¦
