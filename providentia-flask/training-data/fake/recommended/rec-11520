Immaculate Infatuation loves this place and it's in my hood so it was only a matter of time before getting here. Based on last night, I am not coming back. This place ain't cheap and for the price, the food better stand out. Here's what we ordered: 1) Oyster snack- pretty good! but to find one oyster at the bottom of the bowl/cup was a little disappointing 2) Sunchokes- very hearty. good stuff. 3) Shrimp Starter- bland, and doused in a cream sauce which failed to do much for us 4) Pork katsu- overcooked and tough to chew, eggplant non-existent, covered in what looked and tasted like unseasoned ground beef which looked and tasted like what most people make for taco night at home 5) duck fat fries - overhyped, dry. disappointing experience.
