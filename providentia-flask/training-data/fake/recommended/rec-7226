Cute restaurant and nice staff. I had the vegetable dumplings to start- very sweet, missing that savory note. The dumpling dough was mushy and the sauce really did not go well. For my main I had the Ratchaburi noodles dry style. The dish was sooooo sweet it was awful, I know Thai food is often sweet but it usually has savory, sour and heat to balance things out. This was like someone poured sugar water over noodles, YUK!
