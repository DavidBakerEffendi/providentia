Interesting little spot for tapas. The food is fusion Asian (not a specific type) and American. We went at an off time, but it was very quiet and the service was very slow. However, they did come and ask what we wanted to order every 10 min or so. Nevertheless, I wish they did ask you if you wanted to join in the happy hour or just tapas. The happy hour is located in the lower floor bar and we ended up sitting at the top bar so we just ordered a bunch of tapas. The food was so mediocre that I do not even remember what I ordered. Nevertheless, this is a good place for a date and conversation starter.
