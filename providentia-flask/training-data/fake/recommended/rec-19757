American Retro is a half bloick South of Jon Stewart's Daily Show studio.  I stumbled on it after waiting in line for show tickets, and it was pleasant surprise. At the Daily show, you pick up tickets at 2:30 then come back at 4:45 to get in.  I went over to the Bar and found nice, friendly people, reasonable priced drinks, happy hour ( $1 off beer, wine and well drinks) and a clean, pleasant bar area.  I didn't eat there but the wings looked really good coming out and menu prices ( mainly sandwiches, burgers and appetizers)  were reasonabe as well.  There were about 15 Daily Show fans there and the place sort of cleared out at 4:30. I'd like to come back, try the food and hang out longer. The 4 stars are ONLY because I didn't try the food.  The overall experience that day was 5 stars.
