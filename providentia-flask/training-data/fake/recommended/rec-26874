Very good atmosphere and friendly service. The food is certainly above average. We were there with two kids and the staff was very accommodating. There is no kids menu but we were able to shop around and compose a couple of kids dishes that were just fine. I recommend this place both for couples and families (as long as your children are accustomed to dining out - this is not a family restaurant per se).
