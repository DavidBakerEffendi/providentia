I have been a life-long New Haven Pizza Lover, and have made it a point to attempt to taste every pizza joint in our great city at least once.  Here is my gripe with Pepe's... While most of the time, I do believe that Pepe's offers the best pizza around, I have noticed a disturbing trend over the past few times that I've had their pizza: lack of consistency between visits.   Sometimes, when I go and it's a relatively slow night - the pizza is the usual awesomeness that I remember and love dearly.  Complex, unique flavors with the original Pepe's touch - perfection!  However, on the nights that I've had a pie when it's been really busy (seemingly more and more often), the quality of the pizza is just not there.  Undercooked & floppy, or toooo burnt and lacking in the quintessential character.  Also, when you wait an hour for a pie and it comes out not as you expected, it's a huge letdown.   Honestly, the past few times on a Thurs, Fri, or Saturday night that I've wanted pizza, I've ended up going to BAR or Modern, just because I know the product will be the same as I've always had it.   Although I'm sure this rating and review will get burried under the mountains of praise regularly given to Pepe's - I feel it's important that when you rush and dilute a product, sometimes it just turns out poor.  I think Pepe's would do well to spend a little more time working to make sure their product is consistent, lest more New Haven pizza lovers start to share my opinion.
