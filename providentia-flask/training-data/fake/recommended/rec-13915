Mmmmmm.  That was a good (but expensive) lunch.  That lobster roll was pretty amazing.  I had good chunks of lobster meat, a little bit of mayo, spices, on a freaking yummy buttered hot dog bug.  This was the best lobster roll that I've tasted outside of Maine.  It is expensive, but if I am treating myself once in a while it is worth it.  It didn't really fill my belly though.  Maybe I should have gotten some soup to go with.  Can I get a raise just so I can eat here everyday please?  I have to say though, my favorite part of the meal was the pickle.  That was the best freaking pickle I've ever had in my life.  I wanted to go back in and ask if they make them or where they get them, but I was too shy.  I am going to be dreaming of lobster rolls tonight.
