Because of Jon Stewart's rant on pizza in new york a couple of years back, I always wanted to try Denino's.  I finally stopped by and was pleasantly surprised.  The pizza does match up to Lombardi's, Johns, Grimaldi's, etc...but it did miss the mark a little bit.  The ones I listed had fresh mozzarella that was standard, at Denino's you had to pay $4 more.  They give you paper plates like Tortunno's which is a huge minus.  The crust was so crispy, I couldn't even bend it.  Denino's has great pizza, but unfortunately they are in the same city as Lombardis and Grimaldis
