For many years Halal Guys was my main go to place for midnight snack ... or food I should say when I was living in the city. I used to always get chicken over rice, but now I feel I like the combo better ... regardless both are awesome. & that white sauce ... god it is good. What do they put in there? I also always have to get the veggie option for my mom, that had always been her request when I drop by. They should consider international shipping because my mom now lives 8,000 miles away and she had just mentioned that she misses the food from here. I don't live in the city anymore, but I always find time to drop by every now and then.
