We've just returned from another great meal at L'amante.  We've been going to this restaurant for over five years and have always enjoyed the meal immensely.  In addition to great food, the wait staff are always friendly and attentive.  It has a warm ambience and a great place for a long leisurely dinner with friends.  Wine list is great and don't leave without trying the chilean sea bass and squash blossom fritters.
