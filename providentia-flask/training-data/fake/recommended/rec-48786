We sat down in this dinghy little place in Chinatown with the waiters wearing these random Hawaiian shirts, knowing that the food would be good but that'd be all. And true that was. I am a big fan of interior and ambience, and really in the conventional sense of the word, the restaurant's interior could've docked off a star on my review. But two things...it really did have feel of a place that cared about cleanliness but not much beyond that except for good cooking. And the whole thing added to its charm. A guy sitting next to us recommended the chicken feet saying something like "nobody likes to order it because it sounds strange, but it's really good." So we went ahead and ordered exactly that. We also ordered sesame chicken, and lo mein with beef and fish balls. I loved the chicken feet, had a great sauce, didn't taste fatty and the bones...so nicely cooked, making them tender and juicy. I've had better sesame chicken, but not at this price. If you're fan of this dish, I'd go to Congee Village. The beef and fish balls were much appreciated by my foodie buddy, I thought the fish balls tasted better than the beef but I am biased :) One thing which was a slight put off, was ho they included the tip before hand but I usually give 15% and above anyways, so I was not as miffed as others were.
