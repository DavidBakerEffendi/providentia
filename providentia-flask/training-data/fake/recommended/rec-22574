I LOVE this place. It is my favorite neighborhood cafe, even though I don't live in Windsor Terrace. The Stumptown Coffee is good (although they don't do espresso drinks.) Good tea and iced beverage selection also. Haven't had the chance to dine, but appreciate the vegan options when I do. The staff has always been pleasant. I like the atmosphere and feel comfortable hanging out for a while. I do agree with the reviewer who mentioned that the prepared foods are not presented in the most appetizing way. I often buy gift certificates for my clients here.
