This was our second time at Yasuda, and I left stunned at the overpriced, overrated sushi.  We ordered the omakase ($120 per person) and were served TEN pieces of sushi each.  Absurdly thin fillets of fish over disprioportionately big sushi rice.  I have enjoyed omakase at many places, and this was, by far, the worst.  The fish was fresh enough, but nothing special.  The entire omakase was served via two platters: one plate of sashmi, followed by one plate of sushi.  The chef had not even bothered to divide up the portions between the two diners.  I have had simple sushi boats better than this.  We ended up ordering 4 appetizers in the hopes of making up for the paltry omakase, but we still left unsatisfied.   The bill came out to $300, and we left the restaurant feeling hungry.  I should also mention that the servers were rude, and rushed us out at the end of the meal, claiming that there were other customers waiting for the table.  Unbelievable.  If possible, I would give Yasuda no stars.  It is overhyped and way overrated.
