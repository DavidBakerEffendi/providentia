HANDS DOWN Â the best burger I've ever had in my life. Even when I reheated half my leftover burger in the nuker the next morning it was one of the best. I got a simple plain burger with horsradish cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato. My roommate found this place by smell while he was out jogging one morning, and demanded we go here for lunch. I'm so thankful he insisted on how great this place smelled! We split some fries - the sauces are as amazing as the burgers, btw. We tried the chipotle, wasabi, and garlic and loved them all. We also loved looking at all the drawings on the walls. There are some really good and really funny ones.
