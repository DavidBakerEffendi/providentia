I've been wanting to try this place for a while so last Sunday I went for dinner. I can say that it's not my favorite Italian byob but it's definitely a quaint little place where you can sit outside (if you don't mind the minimal traffic, people throwing up out of cab windows and occasional crazies on pine) and have an average Italian meal. I gave this place 4 stars because the guy who sat us actually wound up giving us free dessert even though we protested we were stuffed.. Very good tiramisu and the waitress didn't seem to mind that we were so drunk and actually pouring our beer back into the bottle to take with us. Visit this place at least once and get the black pasta with the cream sauce.
