Not sure what all the hype is about here. My boyfriend ordered the Nutella French toast and I'm not sure how he ate that shit. In my opinion it was the worst French toast ever. I don't think brioche bread is supposed to taste stale and I thought French toast was supposed to be soaked in egg and then fried. Penelope's version of nutella French toast was none of this; in fact, it was nutella spread between two pieces of thick, stale bread. $15 and simply put...Awful. I ordered the Penny's egg sandwich on a croissant and it was good, exactly what I needed at the time but I have made better egg sandwiches in my own kitchen for a hell of a lot less then $9. The pesto sauce on it was good but not $9 good. It's unfortunate when the best part of your meal is the $5.50 fresh squeezed juice.
