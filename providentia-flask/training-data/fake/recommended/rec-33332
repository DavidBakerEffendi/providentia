If I could give this a 4.5, I would.... not only because I like decimals (Come On, Playas!  Who don't like the dot?!), but because it is not quite a 5 and Definitely More than a 4! My lady and I have eaten there twice and both times, the food was fantastic, all around the table.  So, I'll focus on some of my favorites: Oysters on the Half Shell - Yup.  Slurp.  Scream "Yum! Now that is what I'm talking about!"  Repeat. The Popcorn Shrimp with Bacon Mouse - THIS IS THE DISH THAT MAKES YOU SLAP HIGH-FIVE WITH RANDOM PEOPLE & then get into a Foodie conversation with them!  Crispy on the outside with some bite left on the perfectly cooked shrimp, inside.  Then you have the Bacon Mouse - WHAT?!  HUH?! YES!  YES PLEASE! - which is light and creamy (not heavy like some mouses... it almost has an aioli consistency) and smokey and bacon-ey.  It is the perfect outfit to compliment the hot body of this supermodel starter. Spicey Fisherman's Stew - Rich, hearty, stew-ey goodness.  Delicious! The thing that would keep this from rolling into the "5-Star" bracket for me would be the two fish dishes I ordered (on two different occasions).  One was the Blackened Catfish and the other was the fish special.  Both were cooked perfectly - that was not the problem.  My issue with both dishes is that they were very, very small... too small.  In fact, they both could have been a large starter, and though they were tasty, neither was quite worth the price point. On the plus side, the servers & bar staff were all well informed and excited to talk about the food. In the fabulous foodie area of Fort Greene, Brooklyn, this has jumped up to one of my favorite restaurants!
