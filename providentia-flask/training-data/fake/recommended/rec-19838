I've eaten here half a dozen times and just always love the food and overall atmosphere. Their popovers they give at the beginning of the meal are delicious. The fried chicken and waffles is the star of the show. The fish specials are always tasty but I wouldn't consistently go to any one restaurant for fish. Good cocktails, good waitstaff and on 2 occasions with a party of 4 or more got a table just by walking in.
