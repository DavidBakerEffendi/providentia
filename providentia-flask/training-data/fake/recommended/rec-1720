I've heard about Penelope for a while for the brunch, but I came for the underhyped, but amazing chicken pot pie (brought to my attention by Buzzfeed's 31 Delicious Things to Eat in NYC this Winter). Penelope is a very cozy restaurant where you can imagine a couple going to eat for years and years. My friend and I came late afternoon on a weekday and were seated immediately. The waitresses were super friendly and fast and ours even expressed her love of the chicken pot pie when I ordered it. The hearty individual pie was sufficiently hyped. The golden crust gave a satisfying crack to reveal extremely hot steaming goodness, including squash, peas, chicken, carrots and asparagus. It also came with a refreshing side salad to cool down between bites (or in my case shovels) of deliciousness. Afterwards I really could not move and was full for the rest of the day. Definitely planning on coming back for some breakfast meals and probably some more pies.
