Mm, not so tasty... Traversed to Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles for lunch with a good friend, excited to try some tasty hand-pulled noodle soup on a chilly Wednesday afternoon... but the two dishes I tried to order were out... disappointed, I ordered the roasted duck noodle soup, hoping at least for some tasty duck and to sink my teeth into the chewy goodness of hand-pulled noodles that I've grown to love. Sadly, the duck was not tasty, nor was the soup.  and the noodles, well they were the most disappointing of all.   The waitress noticed my seemingly lack of interest in my food and the distress that washed over my face as I tried to make the experience better, somehow.  So she walked over and handed me some seasoning to put in the soup. Overly zealous in putting the 'special sauce' in my soup, I soon regretted the decision.  It was now worse than before and I could no longer force another spoonful into my mouth.   Amy encouraged me to order something else since the dishes were pretty reasonably priced, but I just couldn't do it. The soups were unsavory, water-like really, and the noodles ordinary. I'm sorry I couldn't have written a more praising review of the noodles here, I really wanted to.
