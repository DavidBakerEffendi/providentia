Usually come here at night for dinner. The lighting is nice , they made some changes when they closed for renovations. Great drinks made by knowledgeable bartenders. Good food that isn't too heavy on the stomach. I had a few Crimson sour. I recommend the roasted eggplant and kale salad. I have to try their other dishes eventually. The noise level isn't loud so you can have dinner conversations. Music plays low in the background.
