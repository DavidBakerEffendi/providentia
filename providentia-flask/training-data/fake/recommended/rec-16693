My friend lives nearby and is a regular so she took me to Bistango for dessert on a Friday night. Very cute, intimate interior. All the reviews are accurate in that the owner is super friendly and comes over to say hi. There was a small birthday party going on so mental note for once my day rolls around (seems like a nice, lowkey spot for a celebration). We both had the apple tart with vanilla gelato. YUM. O. SO GOOD. YOU WILL EAT THIS AND THANK ME LATER. Apparently everything is made fresh, and you can definitely tell! They have a ton of gluten-free options on the menu and they can make the desserts gluten-free as well if you wish. I'm disappointed that the apple tart was the only thing I had. I will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu because I have heard nothing but good things!
