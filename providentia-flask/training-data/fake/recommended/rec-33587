They have Delicious, delicious fresh baked pizza in this Hells Kitchen eatery. Tavola is somewhere we just stumbled into and it is a great find. The caesar salad was delicious and the pizzas are generous in portion and creative in the combinations available. They have much more Italian food on the menu here, but I can only speak for what we ate. Â  The ambience is very nice, old school Italian feel with fabulous service. Minus one star for less than fresh tasting iced tea.
