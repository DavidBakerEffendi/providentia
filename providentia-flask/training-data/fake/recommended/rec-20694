I am a huge crepe addict and I've eaten crepes all around the world. THIS little spot in Woodside, Queens is the best crepe I've ever had, and ever will have. I'm serious about crepe batter and hers is so on point. The owner/founder/chef's name is Patty - a delightful cheerful woman who takes her craft seriously. She is passionate about her work and a hard worker. I go here on a regular basis and will continue to recommend friends to do the same.
