Update on bento boxes going on sale:  I thought it happened after 4 pm each day.  However, it appears to happen on random days.  For instance, I still had to pay full price at 6:45 pm for one of the bento boxes today.  When I asked about the discount, the lady behind the register smiled nicely and told me "not today."   I got their "healthy" box option (nothing fried in it).  It included a piece of breaded and roasted tuna, two pieces of potato cores, salad with green tea ramen bits and tofu, a little cup of egg and spinach, a piece of broccoli and lots of multigrain rice.  Delicious!
