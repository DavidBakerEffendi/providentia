I've been lucky enough to have eaten at some of the finest/highest rated restaurants in the country and I would turn 70% of them down for Pates Et Traditions.  The restaurant is beautiful, uniquely placing items from France and Nice onto the wall as if a piece of art.  The light blue walls, rustic decor, and European cultural sensibilities make one feel as they've been transported out of New York.  The crepes were creatively crafted, excellently prepared, and simply delicious, unlike anything I've had in quite a while.  We had the Orienale and the Poulette crepes which we highly recommend, as well as the pate appetizer which offered excellent portions for two people.  The experience was truly religious and I can't imagine a better culinary experience.   BTW they only take cash, take reservations, and happen to actually have open tables on the weekend as I now believe most of Brooklyn exists solely on credit.
