The ahi tuna burger with wasabi mayo was so good I'm still thinking about it weeks later. My wife was amazed at how quickly it and my fries disappeared. Despite being insanely busy we had terrific service with only a few minor errors, that were corrected quickly and professionally. Our waitress made us feel very much at home. North 3rd has never disappointed me and my recent discovery of the awesomeness that is their tuna burger has me looking forward to coming back for more.
