All the reviews I'm seeing for Bar are about the food. I have only been here once for the bar and dancing. This place is great! The front rooms are for eating and getting a drink at the bar in a brewery setting. There are 2-3 bars in the front so you can always get service. The back opens up to a large room with a bar and a DJ. I went with a group of friends and it was great! It was a bit crowded and VERY hot. But that's to be expected. If you're looking to have a good time, bar is your place.
