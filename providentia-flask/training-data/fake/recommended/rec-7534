Mr Chu's geen do gwhat (the red pork) is made uniquely to my liking. Otherwise, Mr Chu's dishes seem to be a little lacking. We ordered sea bass, pan fried noodles, and string beans among others, but the only dish I was drawn to was the geen do gwhat. Pricing of Mr Chu is comparable to the other Asian/ Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, from 10-12 dollars per dish, but it's quality doesn't separate it much from the others. You will see when you go into Mr Chu that it is a predominantly Caucasian environment (which is often an indication that the restaurant is not authentically Chinese). However, if you really have nothing else to go to within the area, stop by Mr Chu's for a decent Chinese meal.
