I actually missed this place even after I read another Yelp review warning me I would miss it and resolved not to! This dark slice of a restaurant has no bold lettering or color to catch you but doubletrack, search and hunt until you find it because the experience is WONDERFUL. First of all, you are really squeezed with exactly 8 other people, if you only came with one person. And I recommend you come with either 1 or 3 people, exactly. But I liked being squeezed because I am outgoing by nature and the snatches of conversation I overheard were hilarious. Anyway, my friend and I split the lamb sandwich (as feverishly upheld by other Yelpers) and baklava. The lamb was incredibly soft, juicy and flavorful while the bread was the perfect foil: dense, sturdy and crusty. The baklava was comparable to other baklavas I've had. I would say Kashkaval's is crispier and more held together. However, as I glanced around the table, I compiled a list of what to order next time, with a group of 3: Meze such as hummus, tsaztiki, white beans gigantes, any of the soups (they looked divine), and the lamb sandwich. I can't wait until then!
