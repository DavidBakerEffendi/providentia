I'm sorry, I just can't get into this. There was so much hype about this that I expected more, but it just tastes like a regular burger. I got the bistro burger, which is a cheese burger with bacon. It is definitely worth the money. I think the bistro burger is $7.75, cheeseburger $6.75, and hamburger $5.75. Something like that. The burger is good and big, but no wow effect or anything special that would me go all the way to come back or crave it. There is one thing that I do crave though...the fries! Now I'm not a fries person, I generally just eat 5 and then I'm ok, but I'm actually craving these fries! The are on the skinny side, but not stringy. And it's just so crunchy and yummy. So I might come back for the fries... Conclusion: You should definitely try this place because yes, of its popularity and the rave about it because you might have different taste buds than mine. My friend that I came with definitely really liked it (4 star rating from him) and he would come back for more.
