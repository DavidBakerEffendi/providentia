I am one of those dedicated regulars to late night Yorkside (every other Thursday at midnight I'll be there) for gross, greasy drunk food.  And they fill that niche pretty damn well.  Gross, rubbery cheese on the pizza, so I generally skip it.  But I really enjoy the buttery simplicity of the garlic loaf with basil, tomato, and mozzarella, as well as the buffalo fried mozzarella (mozz sticks coated in buffalo sauce and served with ranch).  Fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, fried wings, fried anything.  Yummm greasy drunk food that you can't taste so well but is still delicious because it's hot and you're at Yorkside and surrounded by groups of other drunk people fresh out of Toad's or Yale parties. The real food is not so good.  I've had sandwiches etc. here before, and really there are other places to get far far better food literally around the corner.  But going to Yorkside is kind of like a nervous tic- you don't really want to, but you do anyways and you're not sure why.  Eventually, it becomes an annoying but endearing part of your identity.
