Visiting the city, and staying near campus. I found this place because of Yelp and really enjoyed my meal. Super casual -- order at a counter, sit at a small booth, or, at a communal table. They bring the food to you on a cute aluminum tray, with all packaging both cute and biodegradable. I enjoyed everything I had and would go again.
