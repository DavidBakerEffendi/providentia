After watching so many TV chefs pull up their nose about truffle oil and how what a copout it is, when I saw the truffle burger on the menu I was curious to finally find out what it tasted like.  Well, I'm glad I finally tried it, because I would have missed out on one of the finer things in life. When the burger came, I was happy to note that the beef patty and the bun was pretty much the same width.  When they're not it's such a pet peeve of mind which is why I almost never go to mass market fast food chains for burgers.  I guess you can blame this on the old woman from the Wendy's commercial.  You can definitely taste the truffle which is another huge plus, they didn't skimp on it.  The fries were made like the ones at Pommes Frites, snap crispy outside and moist on the inside.   They actually have a nice bar here for those people who are unlucky enough to have to come during the lunch and dinner rush.  So if you don't mind getting a little sloshed for a burger outing, this place is perfect.
