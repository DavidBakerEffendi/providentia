this place is amazing. they have everything you can ask for and MORE. I love having a billion drinks to choose from, not just the ordinary snapple or bottled water. they have exotic drinks you can't just get in your regular deli!!! I get a different drink everyday. the staff is great. they give excellent customer service and super fast with everything. the interior is also bright and spacious...a great escape from the busy grey streets of the city. you feel like you walk into a clean bubble of goodness. I highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch. I LOVE IT...makes me not want to go back to work....
