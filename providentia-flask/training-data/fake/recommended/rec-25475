Outstanding! Walter, the owner and executive chef can make anything you want, and prepared just the way you like it. You can't miss him because he greets every table and hovers around the dining area making sure everyone's happy. Price is great and portions are huge. What's key is the fresh ingredients. I really hate when restaurants skimp on quality ingredients. For instance the balsamic glaze in my dish was hands down the best I've ever tasted... Fresh herbs not dried...the little thing.. You know what I mean .)
