I'm usually not a person that takes the time to formally commend a restaurant on good service, but this is an exception. My reservation at Jasmine Rice was set for 7:30p on a Friday evening. It was a very busy night but despite being seated at close to 8:00p, the host kept me and my party informed of the delay and made sure we were comfortable and exercised patience. For my meal, I chose the beef fried rice and without a doubt, it was the BEST decision I could've made. The food was prepared exquisitely with spice, texture, style, and presentation. It was very fresh. It also had a spice level just on the cusp of being too much. Nonetheless, the dish was a bit. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals as well and routinely commented on the taste of everything. The coconut and miso soup as appetizers were about average. If you're looking for an intimate small restaurant with its own flare right in the heart of center city, Jasmine Rice is a top contender.
