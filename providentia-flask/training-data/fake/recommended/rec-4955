This was my first time trying Jahan Kabob & grill and it was amazing!!! I had the falafel pita with French fries (the lunch special) it is the best falafel I have ever had!! The combination of flavors from the hummus and tzatziki plus the fresh vegetables was perfect!! The fries were even amazing. I will definitely be Â going back again and would recommend this place to anyone. The restaurant itself is very clean and looks nice.
