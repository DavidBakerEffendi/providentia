First time eating Spanish food since our trip to Spain a few months ago. This place brought back some great memories! Food: great tapas options - all offerings very authentic or a variation of a classic. The serrano ham place stands out as a favorite. Sweet melt in your mouth spanish ham served with the pan con tomate - like they do in barcelona. They do the classic patas bravas and ham croquettes very well! One dish that also stood out were the paquetitos de jamón. You only get three, but worth it! Service: Our waitress was great. Very attentive, but not overly intrusive. Good wine suggestions in all price categories. (you can get a good bottle here for about $30 - which is also the price for a pitcher of sangria) Paced the food well - we were able to sit for over 2 hours even though it was crowded. Ambiance: Very authentic for a tapas bar...aka very crowded.  It is a long narrow room with nice brick walls and many votive candles. Not too many tables - in fact they are mostly just bar like seating with stools. But hey, it's definitely an authentic experience. They have a room in the back with regular seating, that usually requires 10 people to reserve. It seems like that room is booked out months in advance. We arrived on a friday after work around 6:30 and were able to grab two seats in that room as long as we promised to be out by the time their 9pm reservation arrived. Overall, a fantastic experience with great food. It can get very crowded, so plan to go on an "off" time or plan to wait. Definitely worth it.
