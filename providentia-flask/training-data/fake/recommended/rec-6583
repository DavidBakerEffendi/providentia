Very good food and very nice ambiance.  I loved the rustic Italian decor.  I had the linguine with clams and it was great.  The spinach they served with my sister's dinner was out of this world, so I had to order a side dish for myself!!!  The eggplant marinade dip they serve with the bread is wonderful too....
