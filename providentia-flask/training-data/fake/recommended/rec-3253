I attended a late brunch here, a perk that they still served breakfast at 2 pm. I had the pancakes ... Um delicious! Also when I asked for well-done bacon, I got well-done bacon, something that doesn't often happen. Super cool atmosphere with great decor that served as a good convo starter for a first date ... next time I go back I'm for sure sitting in those swingy chairs! Server was well versed in the menu and gave honest opinions, very much appreciated.
