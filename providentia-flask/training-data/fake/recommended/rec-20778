I had no intention of going to this place but I needed an ATM because the sorry parking lot didn't take debit cards and to make matters worse they didn't mention it on their sign. Anyways I walked in and saw a couple of nice women so I sat my azz down. I ordered a drink call "Red Door" and had and Italian sub. As you can tell by my rating I was happy with both. The barmaid was a little slow but the cute chick to my right made up for it.
