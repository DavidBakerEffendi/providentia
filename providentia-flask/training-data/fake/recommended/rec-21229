NOM. NOM. NOM. Perfect.  Ambience is low volume levels but buzzy.  Food is dynamite: Delicious sushi, but the move is to get the grilled meats and veggies. The shisito peppers are the best i have had, the grilled filet fantastic, everything on the menu is worth trying. All fresh main ingredients that are cooked to perfection, so prepare for a very clean meal where you body feels good walking out.  Best izakaya I have been to. Solid, solid, solid!
