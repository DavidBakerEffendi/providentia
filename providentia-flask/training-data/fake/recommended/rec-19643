I never write any reviews, but I just had to give the credit where it's due. Hero king's sandwiches are the best sandwiches I've ever had. I work in ironbound Newark, and I order lunch from different restaurants everyday. Most places I start to get sick of them after a few times, but I can eat Hero King three times a week and still crave more. The meat, vegetables, bread, everything is always fresh. The prices are very reasonable, they could even charge a bit more if they wanted to for the quality and excellent service they provide. After eating from Hero King, I will never set foot in another Subway again. If you've never tried this place, please do your taste buds a favor and try it ASAP. My personal favorite is the cold cut sandwich ham, turkey, and cheese with the works.
