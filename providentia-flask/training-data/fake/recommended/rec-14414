I'm a great fan of Zest for a casual, fast, and inexpensive sushi fix! Prices are extremely reasonable, especially during happy hour which is Mon-Fri 3:30-7pm and only $3.5 for so many dishes- rolls, salads, soups! I got an avocado salad for $3.5 and salmon sashimi for $3.5. Also this place is BYOB- free for the first bottle of wine, and $10 corkage afterwards.
