First, this is not a fancy restaurant.  If you are looking for ambiance, atmosphere, please keep searching. If on the other hand, you want great tasting Pakistani food, definitely go here.  The food is fab. Their 'Halwa Puri' was great. It came with chick pea curry (channa) & potato disk (Aloo Bhujya) as well as Halawa.  Everything tasted great. They also carry Paan so that was just icing on the cake. We also tried a few other dishes and they also tasted great. There is no waiter service as you have at other restaurants. You go to the counter, place your order and sit down. Someone will bring your order to your table when its ready.  I went there on a Sunday around 2 PM or so. The place was not crowded. However, it is not very large inside.  They can perhaps seat around 30 people.  Give or a take a few.
