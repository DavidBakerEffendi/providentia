If you want to sound like a local, call it VPB.   Start with some gravy fries if you're just drinking-- but if you're eating I recommend the Cock and Bull (why choose between steak and chicken?) I'm not a beer drinker, but the house brews are always good-- and if you like it you can get a growler on your way out. Me, I have a shirley temple with my meal, I'm trying to give them a little adult social cache. In the summer, be sure to wait for a table outside-- especially if there's music happening.  A summer evening, a beer, some good greasy food, people watching, and whatever is playing...those are the best nights.
