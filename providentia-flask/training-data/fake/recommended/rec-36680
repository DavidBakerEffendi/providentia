I tried this place about a year ago and they had the best Mac 'n Cheese in the world. I was SOO looking forward to it...and they don't have it any more. Bummer. But never fear, we found delicious things on the menu anyway. The lobster quesadillas are actually stuffed with lobster which was nice. I ordered some kind of chipotle-shrimp-scallops ravioli nonsense, and I can sincerely say that this was one of the best dishes I have had in my life. Our table was doing family style dinner and we actually wound up ordering a second plate because it was that damn good. The service was pretty good. It is always nice to be plated before each meal. Our server was nice but not completely well versed on the menu. The inside of the restaurant reminded me of the inside of someone's home. I like it. Gold star.
