I'm surprised at some of the bad reviews on here because I've been to many Chinese buffets (and a former owner of a Chinese buffet) and the quality of Royal Buffet & Grill's food is definitely tipping the higher end of the scale.  By no means am I marking them as gourmet or anything like that, but for the $13pp price you pay and the amount of food + the selection ... you're getting a d*mn good deal here.   Their chicken teriyaki on a stick is very good and I love ordering fresh rolls from the sushi bar.  They have premade ones as well, but I like the fresh ones.  They have a decent selection of fried fish fillets such as flounder & tilapia & their ribs are very juicy & tasty.  They don't always have this out, but they make a pretty good cheesy stuffed clam too.   I normally don't have room for dessert b/c I've put away a solid 2-3 plates and am stuffed, but my family usually takes advantage of swishing some ice cream from the machine before we head out.   One point deducted because their servers are very "blah" and only do the bare minimum so they really don't enhance the experience.
