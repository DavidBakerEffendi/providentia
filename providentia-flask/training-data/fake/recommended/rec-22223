The menu is simple so the food stays consistent and yummy! I had the brisket and it was different than I expected but nonetheless tasty. My wife had the pulled pork and it was good too. I haven't had real southern BBQ to compare this to but as it is, it hits the spot as it would for most others. The staff was nice though still a bit confused about the menu because I had to look at the paper menu and show them that they sell a rack of ribs by itself. They insisted that they sell it with the sides. I would say that the prices are fair and leaning a little on the higher side. I didn't expect a fancy dining experience so the decor didn't bother me. Would visit again if nothing else was available in the area. Update: Had some of the ribs I bought to go and yes, they are a little on the sweet side as others have mentioned.
