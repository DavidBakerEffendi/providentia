Typically, I stay away from hotel restaurants, but Kimptons tend to be an exception in my book. I'm so glad we tried this place! I ordered the scallops and they were fantastic! Â The plate presentation was beautiful and they were cooked perfectly! Only giving 4 stars because our server wasn't that attentive, which is odd for a Kimpton restaurant experience. Friendly hostess and manager. Great ambiance. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!
