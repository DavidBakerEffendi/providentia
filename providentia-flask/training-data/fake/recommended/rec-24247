OVERRATED.   The food is good, but it is nothing special for the price.  I got the steak which was pretty bland- any steak I grilled at home would have been better.  My wife got the special- softshell crabs which were tasty.  The veal sweetbreads were an interesting dish which I did like quite a bit.  For me though, the bottom line is that despite this being BYOB, I still spent over $100 for my wife and me and walked out unimpressed.
