These small Spanish restaurants really need to educate themselves in business before opening a restaurant. I went to casa Adela Tuesday night to get an order to go. So I'm standing at the counter and there's four people behind the counter none of who seem to be aware or care that there's a customer waiting to order. Now I'm the only customer there except for a couple sitting at a table. Finally after about 5 to 6 (I should have left at this time) minutes a worker says did you order? I'm like is she serious. I finally order, it took forever to get, I thought it was a nightmare. Then the woman worker can't figure out what to charge me and comes up with a random number. I tell that can't be right and then she says oh sorry that's someone else's bill. Casa Adela shame you. Your business sense and etiquette are really poor. Consider getting some business sense it might help you stay in business longer. Ty
