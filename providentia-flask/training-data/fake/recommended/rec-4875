Ippudo was my first.  Before experiencing the freshly-made, authentic ramen at Ippudo, I had only encountered ramen in styrofoam cups with spice packets.   I went to Ippudo on a Friday at  2 PM, and after a 1-hour wait, my companion and I were led to the dining area through a chorus of Japanese greetings from the cooks and the waiters.  My companion ordered the Akamaru Modern, and I, the Shoyu Ramen.  When the orders arrived, there was no more conversation.  Only the slurp of noodles interrupted by guzzling of the glistening, rich broth.  My tongue was in umami heaven.   Maybe it was the 1-hr wait that created some anticipation, maybe it was a cold winter day.  Or maybe the ramen really was THAT good.   The noodles were also cooked to a perfect texture --- just a teeny bit past al dente.  The toppings were cooked perfectly too, such that every component had its time to shine. Ippudo was my first, but after going to a few other ramen houses, it has still been the most delicious.  Some people ask if it's worth the wait and the price tag.  Yes.  Yes it is.
