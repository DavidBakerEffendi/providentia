My first mistake was going to Dalessandro's after eating at Dinic's . It's like comparing poop to ice cream with Dalessandro's being the poop. The steak was dry with virtually  no flavor.   When in Philly spare yourself the drive and the waste of your hard earned cash. I have had better cheesesteaks in the parking lot of Home Depot in NYC
