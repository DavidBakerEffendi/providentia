I had high hopes for this deli since it has the famed 'Sarcone's' name and I love the bread from Sarcone's Bakery which is just down the street from the deli.  Arriving on Saturday at lunch time, I walked in to the deli and found about 12 other customers jammed into the small space in no discernible order.  Confusion reigned when the cashier asked "Next?" and we all began pointing to each other with raised eyebrows.  But despite the lack of organization the Original Italian hoagie that I ordered found it's way to me and I squeezed out the door.   Excited like a kid with an x-mas present, I unwrapped my hoagie but what I found turned my smile upside down.  There was a big rip in the bread across the top of my hoagie.  Now I had to use my fingers like they were hoagie sutures trying to keep the sandwich from becoming completely disemboweled.  The disappointments continued as I bit into the hoagie and found that I did not seem to poses the strength of mouth required to cut the bread with my teeth.  Realizing that this was not a job for mere incisors I moved the hoagie into molar territory.  I'm sure that I must have looked like a dog with a chew toy, but I did manage to get pieces of the hoagie separated and into my mouth.   IMO, the bread is the most important part of a good hoagie and I would expect that the bread at Sarcone's Deli would be top-notch since Sarcone's Bakery is the best.  Apparently, they are using a vulcanization process on the hoagie bread for the deli.  Too bad, I really wanted to like this place.
