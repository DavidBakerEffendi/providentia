"Crêpes du Nord fuses true French crêpe-making traditions with super fresh Scandinavian ingredients." Definitely a little gem in the financial district. You can easily pass by it without noticing the front door because it's a thin slit. Connected to Smorgas on the other side of the block (Stone Street) Crepes du Nord is on the quieter side - S. William Street. Went there on Saturday AND Sunday lunch because the first experience was fantastic. For only $10 Crêpes Du Nord smoked salmon, scrambled egg, dill crème was phenomenal and I couldn't finish it. For a dollar less, Spiced Herring scrambled egg whites, sour cream, dill definitely fused Scandinavian with French cuisine. Seeing that the Saturday brunch was too much, Braised Beef Short Ribs jus naturel, seared tomatoes, cheese was just the right amount for Sunday, but less spectacular. However, I found cafe latte to be très délicieux!!
