Swanky decor, sexy food, and servers that look like they walked out a scene from the 1920s. The room service pad thai is wrapped in a thin layer of egg and decorated with orchids. They have an extensive drink menu that will satisfy any taste buds. Their blueberry mojito is made with fresh blueberries and the same goes for their coconut. Service is fast and the final bill is more than reasonable. This has become a stable in my restaurant repertoire.
