I have eaten in some of the best sushi restaurants in the US and I can say unequivocally that this restaurant is in the top five. The sushi chefs at Peony Pavilion are from one of the 5 Star sushi restaurants in Manhattan and it shows. Their care and attention to detail is tremendous. They truly bring passion to everything they do, they care about their craft and create masterpieces. If you are a sushi fan, you MUST go to Peony. You will not be disappointed.
