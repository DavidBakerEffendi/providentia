A unique Japanese experience, food and atmosphere both terrific.   Atmosphere: Great decor, and sitting at the counter is an experience.  Two chefs are kneeling on mats grilling and chopping everything a few feet away from you.  The raw product is also stored in front of you on the counter, so you can see the meal from start to finish.  Then the chefs serve entree directly to you on a long wooden stick (even the beer comes on the long wooden stick).  The order process is also fun, the waiter stands behind you calling out your order in Japanese to the chefs who acknowledge (in Japanese) each item. Food: Unique and excellent.  I recommend grilled edamame, more flavorful than steamed.  Grilled whole fish (tasty but a lot of work for the amount of meat).  Grilled stingray fin, Japanese equivalent of beef jerky.  Grilled chicken and grilled beef also can't go wrong. Service: Attentive and friendly. I guess to be a good critic I need to criticize something, so for that reason only I will point out that it is very hard to get filled up here.  I kept ordering more and more dishes and never quite got full, but everything was good and it gave me a reason to keep trying new things.     I recommend Robataya, make sure to get a counter seat. (FFI:  They do have some sushi, but this is not a sushi restaurant.  It is an authentic Japanese grill, though I have yet to make it to Japan to confirm this.)
