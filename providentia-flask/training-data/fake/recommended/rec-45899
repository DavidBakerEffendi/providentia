My girlfriend and I had an early flight into Newark and decided to yelp something nearby to eat. Originally we were going to Hell's Kitchen around the corner but it was not open yet. We walked around and found this Lebanese restaurant. Looked like the owner and her daughter were cleaving and getting ready to open. We waited a bit outside then walked in. After we went in the interior looked horrible, we did not get any water at all until we asked 15 mins later. We ordered a hummus which did not taste good, waited around to see if the server would ask us for our order which she never did. 40mins later I asked for my check. Paid and left. Horrible service. Would never go back.
