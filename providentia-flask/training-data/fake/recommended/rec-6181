Not sure what else needs to be said about this place...it's awesome! The food is consistently great.  The Horiatiki salad has extremely fresh ingredients. The lamb dishes and whole fish are my staples.  Not too wild about their wine selection (food overshadows that enough for 5 stars). Have never had a bad meal here.  Make it a point to go every time I'm in town.
