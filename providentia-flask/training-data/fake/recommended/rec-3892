Brooklyn, the more I know you, the more I'm learning to love you. My friend Brianna suggested that I check out Tom's for breakfast and I'm so glad that I did. This is the kind of place that you read about, the kind of place that all the locals know, the kind of place gives you a taste of what the neighborhood is all about. Tom's is personality refined. The decorations, the wait staff, the overcrowded eating area, the constant lines out the door; it's all here. I saw a sign with a special on it that sounded like an interesting idea: a Spicy Mexican Chicken Cheese omlette with home fries. Add some whole wheat toast great tasting coffee and you'll find how enjoyable a breakfast can be. The spice level was just right; enough to wake your brain up, but not enough to ruin your enjoyment of the dish. The coffee was mild and great, I could have continued drinking it all day, but wanted to move on and let some others enjoy Tom's. I topped my breakfast off with a Cherry-Lime "Ricky" to go.. a cool, refreshing fizzy drink that cooled me off as I left Tom's. Any trip to NY won't be complete with out going back to Tom's. It's a great neighborhood institution that everyone needs to try at least once.
