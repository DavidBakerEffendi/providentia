I know my reviews tend to skew towards higher ratings, but that's because I like to write about the restaurants I enjoy, and not so much about the restaurants that I don't.  I mean, if I didn't enjoy the food, why would I want to take the time to write about it and remind myself WHY I didn't like it?  There are plenty of other yelpers who are more than happy to warn of bad food. Anyways, onto Grimaldi's.  Long before I ever came to NYC, I've heard of this place.  Always mentioned in the same breath as Lombardi's, I've heard it 5 different ways how Grimaldi's is better than Lombardi's, and vice versa.  To be honest, I was fully anticipating being dissappointed.  Why?  My expectations were pretty damn high.  Especially after having to wait in the 40 degree weather for over an hour just to get into the place. So my fiance and I ordered a large with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.  After having John's (which, I'm sorry to say, was pretty disappointing) we've learned that a proper pie shouldn't have more than 3 toppings.  Pizza arrives just shy of 15 minutes later and... well... wow.  That...first...bite.  Best pizza ever?  Without question.  Just thin enough not to be impossible to fold (as one really should, please, stop with the forks and knives!).  The cheese, perfectly chewy, the tomato sauce, perfectly seasoned, the fresh basil spread about the pizza was the perfect touch.  After having chicago deep dish this year also for the first time, I'm thinking every pizza shop should put the tomato sauce OVER the cheese.  I don't know why it should make a difference, but I'm thinking it does.   We devoured the pie in just about 10 minutes.  Yea. It was good. And yea, we were pretty damn hungry.  We finished it off with a canoli.  Best I've ever had? absolutely.  but then again, I've only had it twice before, and in Los Angeles.  So take that with a grain of salt.   So yea.  Eat a giant pizza and walk the Brooklyn Bridge right after.  You won't be disappointed.
