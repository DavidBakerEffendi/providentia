My friend Kristin and I were craving a good brunch, and today visited Penelope in Murray Hill. As far as price goes, it was an excellent value - a delicious grapefruit mimosa and a choice of about 10 different meal options, for $13. I had the blueberry waffles, topped with fresh fruit (strawberry and papaya) and Kristin had an omelette of egg whites, asparagus and feta cheese - both were served fresh and yummy (we even sampled each other's dishes to have the complete experience). It's an adorable place, but something of a cattle call - cozy, it gets very crowded, and there's a huge line to get in for brunch (we waited a solid hour, and then seemed to be ushered out as quickly as politely possible) - delicious mimosas and coffee, and a bakery section that would have been tremendously inviting had I just not wolfed down a platter of waffles....
