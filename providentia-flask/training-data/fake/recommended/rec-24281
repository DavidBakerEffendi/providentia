This has to be one of my favorite places in the city. Small, Cozy, comfortable. No over the top decor, just focus on fantastic food. I have yet to be disappointed by the food here. The duck breast and the filet mignon are still my favorite dishes. And the dark chocolate desert is a must! Best part about this place is the BYOB with no corkage fee. JUST GO. this place speaks for itself.
