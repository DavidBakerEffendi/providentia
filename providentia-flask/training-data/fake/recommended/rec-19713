My girlfriend and I were in the mood for steak last night. While we checked yelp for recommendations this place kept coming up in our searches. We live very close to this place and both of us have been here before, years ago. The both of us weren't wowed by it then, but we were getting hungrier by the second and yelp had a coupon. I'm very happy we went. When we walked in the place was packed so we grabbed a drink an went outside to sit by the fire pit. We didn't wait a long as the hostess said we would and we were quickly greeted by our server, Susan. She was very friendly and later on we realized that so was the rest of the staff. We had the little neck steamers for an appetizer. Delicious! My GF had the filet mignon with yellow rice and I had the ribeye with garlic mashed. We added on the mac n cheese as well. The steaks were cooked exactly as we wanted and were great! The only downside was the mac n cheese and my garlic mashed. They were still very tasty, but did seem to lack a little something. The portions are big and obviously our eyes were bigger than our stomach so we had food to bring home. Afterwards we hung out at the bar for another drink and to talk with the staff. Everyone is super friendly and the building has a pretty cool history and a cozy, homey feel to it. They also play cool music like The Postal Service and The Black keys. The bathrooms are super clean, which is always a good sign. We will definitely be going back for the great food and cool staff.
