Neat decor, Nice layout. Taco Tuesday was cool but they shouldn't have only one server on. Took to long for her to come back and when we tried getting her, it felt we were bothering her. One of our tacos was not cooked (the meat was red and cold) and a can beer tasted weird..when telling the waitress that, we got comment that was not necessary from her. Beer is a little overpriced and so is the food for what it is. I would only go if there is a special or happy hour there, but My opinion is there are better places in the city.
