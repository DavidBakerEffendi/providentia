Great food and don't forget the Fried Calamari, who knew? The BEST Thai Ice Tea but hey, let's get some nicer wait staff, thus minus one star. Give me a break, who died? TRY to be a little bit more welcoming. Glass noodles are the bomb, Salmon Mango (on the spec ial for the day) was fresh and fab. No complaints on the food. HOWEVER, and this was hilarious. I had my own organic tea bag, never had an issue before. I asked for hot water and when the waitress spied my tea bag, she FLIPPED! We will have none of this in here so to speak. Ok, ok, it's organic, I like my own tea, not trying to cheat anyone here but Sheesh! It was the tone and outrage she communicated if you call that communication but whatever, all is fair in love and war. No biggie. It's the attitude of the waitress, we were less than thrilled with the wait staff, Â but we left a big tip anyway and why? Because that's just how we roll. Get it; roll? So go and enjoy JOYA, it's hands down super good. Then off to the Chocolate Room, am I allowed to comingle with the competition in the same review. Oh well, keep pushing that envelope, and so it goes. Oh yes, we shall return. Yes to both (leaving that tea bag at home, lmao!)
