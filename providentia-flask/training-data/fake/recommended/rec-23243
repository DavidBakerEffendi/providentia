Bad Thai food! Don't go there for the food. Everything taste bad and way to sweet, beside the Pah Thai. LOL! Nice looking Thai girls though. A lots of cleavages and beautiful Modern Baroque style decor with a touch of Asian zen. I guess it is a hip dining place....Too loud to talk, seductive environment, but not good for real date.
