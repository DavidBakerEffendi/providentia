Good service.  I'll give them that.  On a Friday night, they got all the food out for our party of 12 at the same time so they get an extra star.  But the food was two stars.  I had the crispy buffalo chicken sandwich, which was neither crispy nor sufficiently buffalo, but was a chicken patty.  I was expecting something like fried chicken on a bun.  Not so.  The flavor wasn't all there either.  My wife's salad was meh. But there's one guy working there who looks like Charlie from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, so it has that going for it.
