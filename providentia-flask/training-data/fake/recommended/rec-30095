I like their egg rolls, Rangoon and the stir fries. If you stand at the counter you'll see to the right inside the kitchen bins of pre cooked food that I have seen them taken from the freezer in cartons and dump into each bin; ribs, chicken fingers etc.   When you order they then throw them into the fryer or broiler if they are ribs etc. So it looks like they buy most of the non-in house made dishes from a distributer frozen and just dump them into the bins until they re-cook them. Isn't that the same if I bought egg rolls in the frozen food isle?  Does any Chinese take out place actually hand make dumplings or anything?
