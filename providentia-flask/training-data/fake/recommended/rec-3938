This is not your average pizza place. (In part because everyone behind the counter is friendly and helpful...) But mostly because it's not New York style by any means--it's not the kind of pizza I like to get on my way home from a bar at 2am, the kind that tastes so good but makes me feel so guilty the morning after...it's pretty much the opposite of that. I actually feel pretty great about eating this pizza. I love the whole grain probiotic crust, the red sauce, mozzarella, and any combination of the fresh vegetables. Most recently my boyfriend and I did a half vegetable (spinach, onions and mushrooms) for me and half pepperoni for him. He never gets whole wheat anything, yet claimed to be a fan of the crust and loved the pepperoni! We'll definitely be back. ***in short, if you want super cheesy greasy pizza, you can find that down the street. That's not what Naked Pizza is (or is trying to be) so it's a bit unfair to compare the two styles.
