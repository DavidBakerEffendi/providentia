It really doesn't get more authentic than this in terms of hand-drawn/hand-shaved noodle soups. A bowl here is cheap, filled to the brim, and absolutely delicious. I got the sliced beef noodle soup and my eyes almost popped out when I saw how big the bowl was. I had just gotten off the bus after a long trip to Philly from Maryland, and it was chilly out, so this really hit the spot. The texture of the noodles is perfect and I literally didn't even try to make time for conversation because I was so busy slurping away at my bowl (no shame... no one comes between me and my food). This place does not take the cheap route and gives you MORE than your money's worth with the ingredients they add to the bowl -- I could barely finish and was shocked to see my total under $10 including tip. The service here is super fast too -- our food was out within 10 minutes! If only I could bring a place like this back to DC with me... yummmmm!
