If there was a 0 star option on yelp this place would get it. 0 stars. The food is acceptable. But the time it takes to get your meal is embarrassing. Give yourself an extra 20 minutes if you plan on ordering more than 1 item and prepare to smell like the grease pan when you get home. One person take a your order, cooks and then rings you up. Oh, and chances are they will mess up your order. Can I have 4 hours of my life back that I've wasted in this place over the past year?
