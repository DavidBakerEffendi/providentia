Rounding up to 4 stars here, and I'll need to go back at night to gauge the beer scene before I really make up my mind, but for the eggs benedict on the Yorkshire pudding (AKA most delicious popover ever), you won my heart. (You win. You always do.) I do wish that the side of mixed greens with balsamic dressing was a heaping pile of crispy homefries, but that's just my inner-fat-self clouding my calorie-counting conscience. My husband had the chicken and waffle, which was tasty, but a little too sweet for us. Next time we want breakfast, we'll be sure to take advantage of the takeout counter. I was slightly confused with the lounge area in the front, but again, I was there at 10:30am and it was mostly empty. I'm sure the place looks completely different at night with fellow craft beer drinkers wandering the room and a DIPA buzz aiding me in conversation with strangers. FYI, if you're sitting at a table wondering where the hell your food is because it's been 30 minutes and your toddler can barely sit still for another second, know that the food in which you are about to partake is completely worth the chaotic preamble. Hang in there. Good food takes time.
