Fogo de Chao, I understand, is highly praised by a lot of people, and I get it, but it's totally not my cup of tea for the price you are paying for dinner. If you prefer slow paced meals, as I do, this is not the place for you. There are waiters coming to your table very often to offer you different selections of meat cut off the bone. I found it difficult to hold a conversation across the huge table because of this. Conversation at the table is also hindered because you have members of your table going up to the salad and sides bar to get their, well, salads and sides. This makes the whole (expensive) experience not worth it for me. At an expensive meal I'd like to be waited on... This miiiight be a good place for a first date because there are many things happening constantly that you and your date could do together. However, My boyfriend and I are past first dates so I probably wont return here. Really nice matchbooks though!
