This place is really good. The food is delicious, and prepared Â with great care. It is quite pricey, however. Went there with a friend and we shared the pan con tomate, patata bravas, and special menu croquetas with iberico jamon which was all amazing. The churros con chocolate are incredible. We shared the strawberry sangria which seemed a little light on the alcohol, but was delicious. We ended up sharing the paella de mariscos, which was actually a huge disappointment. It was a really delicious meal on its own, but it wasn't paella. The rice was brown and cooked to a crisp, the seafood was not integrated with the rice but was just on top so the flavors didn't penetrate the food well, I didn't detect any saffron in the food, and overall wasn't paella. It was delicious in its own right, but it wasn't what I anticipated - which was disappointing because it was $20 per person. That said, I still rate this place a 5. It has really good options, stays fairly true to good Spanish food, the ambiance of the place is nice, our server was attentive and polite, and it was an excellent time.
