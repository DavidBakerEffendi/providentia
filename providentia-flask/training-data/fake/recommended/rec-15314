In the heart of Reading Terminal Market. Tommy DiNic's has gotten a lot of hype after their appearances on the Food Network AND Travel channel. My hotel was only a block away, so I had to try this place out. If locals are saying that they prefer these roast pork sandwiches over cheesesteaks, you gotta try one right? The first day we walked into Reading Market around 4, and to our dismay, they were all sold out, and by the looks of it, they've been sold out for a long time! So of course my "need to have what I can't have" instincts kicked in and I promised to wake up early enough the next day to get one of these pork sandwiches. The next day, we pull ourselves out of bed at 11 (8 am PST, give us a break ok?!) and walked over to DiNics. Damn, there was a line already. But no worries, they had a giant stack of roasted pork behind the counter. We waited in the to-go line to order two roast pork sandwiches. I got mine with cheese, rabe and sweet peppers. Very inexpensive lunch, only $21 for the two sandwiches and 2 drinks. The roasted pork sandwich was great, very tender and juicy. The rabe and cheese honestly made the sandwich for me...just added an extra bite to the pork making it just a notch above the normal sandwiches. I also loved how they dipped the bread into the au jus for extra flavor. Big sandwich, full and happy Ronny. Definitely will be back if I ever head back to Philly!
