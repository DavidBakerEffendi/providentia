You can't not like Tia Pol. That would be like not liking cute puppies and well-behaved children. It is, after all, the antithesis of Chelsea's Olive Garden (and man, did Chelsea need to redeem itself after building that disaster. No wonder the windows are tinted.) It's small, the service is friendly, the decor is rustic, the wines are reasonable and the food is great. The lamb skewers make me want to go home and eat cumin with a spoon. The ham and cheese paquetitos are little gooey packs of happiness. The chorizo with sherry is a bit oily, but resolution breakingly delicious. (Hey if you are going to break your resolutions... don't do it with Wendy's.) The chorizo with chocolate is good, though if you are going to mix meat and chocolate, I prefer the chocolate ribs at Kittichai about 10 fold. The fried garbanzos are a bit bland, but pretty much everything else is killer. And did I say small? Yeah, portions can be a little on the Kate Moss side, which is not bad in and of itself, but if you are actually hungry, be prepared to spend some money. But I'd always prefer 1 meal at Tia Pol over 20 at Olive Garden.
