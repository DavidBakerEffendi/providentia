Great burgers (if it were just about the burgers I'd go with a 4-5), but a little pricey and they are kind of small, I think. I feel like every time I go here that I should get two, but that seems kind of crazy (and they are pretty decadent burgers). Maybe I wish I could give it a 3.5... but maybe it's a 3.4 since I erred on the 3 rather than the 4. I like their truffle burger the most...Â yummm...
