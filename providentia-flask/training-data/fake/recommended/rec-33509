Normally if I reviewed a place where there were a lot of negatives (cash only, long lines to order, meager beer selection) I wouldn't give up the stars.  For Habana, however, it's a different story.  This is THE PLACE for outdoor imbibing in summertime.  Always a beautiful, friendly crowd and anything but the typical "beer garden" experience.  It's powered by 100% renewable energy and the fact that you can save a dollar by mixing your own frozen drink using the "blender bike?" That's sa-WEET!
