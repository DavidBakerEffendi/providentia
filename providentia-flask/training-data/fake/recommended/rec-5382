I made the rookie mistake of not asking our server what she recommended and ended up regretting my entire meal. Ugh. I ordered the veggie burger and fries. I wasn't a fan of the consistency of the burger and my fries were burnt and crunchy (not crispy...yes there is a difference). I left more food on the plate that I actually ate and had to grab a slice of pizza when I left. This place is not on my list of places to return if I'm in town.
