I looked this place up on Yelp because we wanted a lunch place close to where we were planning to take some photos.  It was a very nice day out, so we sat outside in the back, which was a very cute area. We got the: - Sizzling Corned Beef Hash: good, but was a little too salty for my taste - Sizzling Sisig: this was delicious - it was well cooked with the perfect amount of flavor - Khao Soi: this was very good as well.  Just be careful, it splatters when you serve yourself from the bowl!  Granted, this is a common occurrence for me (kiiind of a klutz...) - Garlic Fried Rice: yum! The service was great and the waiters were very friendly.
