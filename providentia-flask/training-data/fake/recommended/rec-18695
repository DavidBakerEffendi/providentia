This is a constant in my otherwise, scattered, eating life. No complaints, things are always good. Guests I take here always enjoy. The new digs are much fancier and make for a totally different dining experience but my quesadilla and tacos are still solid tasting and the margaritas are still tasty. Quick service and lively customers every time. I'll keep going back here. And I don't go back hardly anywhere.
