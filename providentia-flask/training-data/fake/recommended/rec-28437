There's an episode of How I Met Your Mother where one of the characters goes around NYC in search of the best burger.  Corner Bistro was one of the places he went to.  And as he sank his teeth into the burger, he knew.  This wasn't it. I had the same reaction.   I don't know if it was cause I went the Saturday after that episode aired or what, but the place was packed.  We waited for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  While I was waiting, I snuck a peak at the cooks that were grilled the burgers behind the counter.  To my horror, I saw that they were ... pressing down the meat!! I watched all the juices leave the patties and instinctively wanted to leap behind the counter to save it. Needless to say, the burger I got was flavorless and tasted no better than the burgers I could've made from a frozen pack of patties from Costco. The place is pretty gross too.  I constantly had to swat away flies from scavenging my food.  In hindsight, I should've left the food to the flies and gave myself more room in my tummy for the next stop we took.  Burger Joint.
