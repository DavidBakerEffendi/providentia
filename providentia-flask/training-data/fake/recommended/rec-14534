I truly don't understand all the hype. The soup dumplings were very average. We only tried the pork ones (5 out of the 16 didn't have soup in them) and they lacked flavor! The soup inside was average and the pork was not seasoned enough. The soup dumplings at Shanghai Cuisine are far superior! We had the Lo Mein that was tasty and General Tso's chicken was good as well.
