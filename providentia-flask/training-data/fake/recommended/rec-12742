Line was long, which is typical in NYC, but moved quicker than expected.  Only waited for about 15 min.   Food was $6 for a combo plate that was packed full.  I like how you can sauce your own plate up as you like it. Tasted great, would definitely go back again. Only complaint is that the poland spring waters were $1.50.  They should be $1.  If you're a New Yorker, you know this is true, and need no explanation why.  Maybe cos tourists know about this place. small Polland Spring=$1
