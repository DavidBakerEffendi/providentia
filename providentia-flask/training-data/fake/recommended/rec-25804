Unimpressed...nothing bad, nothing great, waiter who didn't ask if we wanted a refill on empty drinks for 20 minutes because he was too busy buttering up a couple next to us who seemed to him (and us!) more apt to spend money on expensive bottles of wine. They got us out in one hour, on the dot. We tried the famed spaghetti and were as mentioned, unimpressed. Don't get me wrong- it was good spaghetti with tomato sauce and (a bit too much) basil. But, I have no doubt I could make the same at home with little effort. Mushroom polenta was cold and unremarkable. Chicken was a small portion and fairly dry. Short rib agnolotti was pretty tasty, best thing we ate there by far. We won't run back.
