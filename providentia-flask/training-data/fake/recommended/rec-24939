Came here for brunch Saturday this past weekend after reading rave Yelp reviews. The first thing I noticed was this place got a "B" for its sanitation letter grade. My immediate thought was Dep't of Health got it wrong because this place looks well kept and tidy. I was wrong. When I went up to the counter to order my bahn mi sandwiches, I noticed there were a couple of flies behind the counter where they were making the sandwiches. Because I am grossed out by flies, I decided I wasn't going to eat here. The flies, however, did not deter my girlfriend from eating here, and we ordered one sandwich just for her. I was a bit annoyed at my girlfriend for wanting to eat here, considering it was just her eating while I had to sit and watch her eat. There were plenty of other places we could've gone together for bahn mi sandwiches in Brooklyn. The whole time she kept rubbing it in my face too about how good the sandwich was. I got the last laugh however, when I pointed her in the direction of the counter, where the old lady who made her sandwich just minutes ago, was leaning back and nonchalantly picking her nose.
