The food is good, not great. It's tiny and cramped. You leave smelling like the daily catch. Â But there is something about this place that makes it irresistible. I think it's because it has the romance of what I imagine a New York dining experience should be like: intimate, personal, out of the way, full of personality and character. It's a small adventure finding and dining at Cafe Condesa (it has no sign), but it's a rewarding adventure none the less. A great place for dates or any time you're looking for intimacy over glitz, character over style.
