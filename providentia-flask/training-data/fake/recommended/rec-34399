I'd eat here every day if it wasn't a gazillion miles from home...oh, and if i had unlimited funds, that would help too. Cheese board, a bit spendy, but also very tasty. Corn cake goodness, far better than fair arepas...and just enough balance of unhealthy/heart attack so you feel neither a saint or sinner. Beer board makes me happy. That is all, I'm too lazy to reiterate what's been stated in the other glowing reviews.
