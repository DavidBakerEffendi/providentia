My husband and I recently visited Burlington with friends, and happened into the Bluebird one night. There wasn't much of a wait, reviews looked generally good, so we tried it. In general, all four of us rated it with a solid "ok". While nothing was terrible, nothing was particularly memorable either. The beer selection was good, but this is true of many restaurants in the city. We all felt that the food wasn't quite food enough for the menu to be as limited as it is. Overall it was fine, but nothing special. Not bad enough to put on my "never again" list, but not good enough to bother going back to either.
