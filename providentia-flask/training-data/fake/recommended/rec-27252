This was a very enjoyable vietnamese sandwich. I got the super cub sandwich. It is a bit westernize with the chipotle mayo but overall I would definitely go again to try another one. I also got it to be xtra spicy but it was just a hint of spice and not really spicy at all so I hope they see this and step it up a bit.
