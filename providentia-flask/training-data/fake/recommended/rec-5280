Many reviews preach the same theme: gave it multiple tries but just can't find anything special about it. Couldn't agree more. Been there 3 times Pictures look great. Presentation is outstanding. Service is good. Interior design exceeds expectations. Taste is mediocre. Seared tuna - fish quality low. Lobster mac and cheese - not very impressed; on the dry side with over cooked pasta. French onion soup dumplings - I don't understand what it is... Either way, dry and chewy. Udon soup? Tasted EXACTLY like what you get at the Asian supermarket. Drinks are overrated - top ingredients don't always mix a great drink. Never satisfied at the end of a meal every time we go. Recommend a visit but don't expect more than a fat check and fun ambiance.
