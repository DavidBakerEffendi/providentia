I hope the Lebanon Diner never leaves. Its so great, so small, so personal and so...homey! Not necessarily in a looks kind of way, but they really make you feel like you are at home and just getting breakfast there. They genuinely care about you as a person, not just another customer there which is one of the main reasons I love going here. Its really great for fellow food service industry people to go, and catch up on whats going on in town. The food is always tasty, cheap, and doesn't take very long to get. I'd recommend the biscuits and gravy, as well as any omelet and the corned beef hash. And the coffee. And the counter. I love to sit at the counter! I know one of the owners had a dream to own a diner, and I must say I'm very glad they did because its such a nice place to go. Its just..right. Its a really good diner. No pretentiousness, no slacking off because they are 'just' a diner. They aren't just a diner. They are THE diner.
