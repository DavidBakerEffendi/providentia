I've been here twice.   The first time was amazing - came with a girlfriend, had a bunch of apps, and a couple glasses of happy hour sangria.  Based on that experience, I would have given this place a 4. The second time, I came with the man.  Started out great - had the bolognese, and this may have been the best bolognese I've ever had.  Lip-smacking, savory goodness.  It was also served in this cute little pan, so more points for presentation.  For my entree, I had the risotto special - which on this particular/unfortunate night, was the pumpkin and shrimp risotto.  Thinking back on it now, I don't know what I was thinking - pumpkin and shrimp... in a risotto??  I suppose I just really love both ingredients individually so I wanted them to work - but alas, what I got was three small pieces of shrimp in a goopy and bland pile of baby food that didn't even taste like pumpkin OR shrimp.  I will say that the risotto was a VERY LARGE portion - so maybe if some of their other risotto dishes hit the mark, this wouldn't be a bad order. Anyway, this all would not have been a big deal if the server had handled it differently.  She was sweet enough, but after I told her that I didn't enjoy my dish, she took it away, asked if I would like to see the dessert menu, and we never saw her for the next 20 minutes.  Correction: we saw her mingle with friends at the bar for that entire time, which was 5 feet away from us.  I don't reeeeealllly care, but I just felt like I had an awful dish, and it could have been a situation easily rectified, but the service totally missed the mark.  Perhaps this bothers me because I used to work in the restaurant business and I know how I would have handled it differently.  So minus one star for a missed opportunity! I would come back though - that bolognese...!
