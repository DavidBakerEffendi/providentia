I cant say enough good things about my experience at the Pines. The staff was amazing.. friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, fun, etc etc. The food was just as good, if not better. I'm a vegetarian (I know, I know) so given the menu, I was really just going to the pines for my significant other. They were very accommodating to me... and the veggie stuff should DEFINITELY be put on the menu. The veggie pasta is to die for. Seriously. My favorite app was also the gem lettuce... much better then it sounds. I wish this restaurant was closer to me, so I could go every night. HIGHLY recommended
