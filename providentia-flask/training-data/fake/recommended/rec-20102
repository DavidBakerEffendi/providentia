Dishes for brunch spanned good to fabulous. Huevos Rancheros Fried Egg, crawfish etouffee, corn tortilla, avocado, pico de gallo, delicious but the size was disproportionately small compared to the other dishes. Shrimp & Grits Fried egg, roasted tomatoes, spicy cheddar sauce, crispy pork belly, blackened shrimp, fantastic all around. May have been the best pork belly I ever had. Biscuits & Gravy Sweet potato biscuits, Fried eggs, chorizo gravy, great spice to the gravy. Cornmeal Waffles Fresh Fruit, orange infused maple syrup, waffles were ordinary and there was little fruit. Monte Cristo House baked Ham, pepperjack, fig-bourbon preserves, Brioche, another winner, very rich.
