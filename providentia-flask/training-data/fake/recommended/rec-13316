Umami /ummi/, a savory taste, is one of the five basic tastes, (together with sweet, sour, bitter and salty). Whatever it means, Umami Burger is a welcomed addition to the NYC burger landscape. I walk in a little after 1pm, during the height of lunch hour. I see a bunch of people sitting and waiting. People are everywhere with no hostess to welcome walk in customers. It looks like mass chaos up in UB?? I grab a waitress making up a (4) top, How many people in your party sir? Well, its me, may-sef and I so 1 please. I'm asked if a seat by the bar is ok. Ok? I expected to wait 30 minutes so yes! I sit at the bar and the bartender comes over and asks if there is any questions about the menu. I tell him, I've been on the website and read Yelp reviews. I want a Truffle Burger with Truffle French Fries please. Truffle everything! I order a Allagash on tap and wait. The burger and fries come out quickly. Awww they made a "U" in the bun. I take a bite.. Outstanding! The truffle burger sauce is almost kinda sweet? This thing doesn't need ketchup, it has a fresh taste with truffle topping. Here's my Larry David impression: that's a pretty pretty pretty tasty burger! The same with the truffle fries. Thin cut with truffle topping, snaps up high baby! All in all, it's a nice place and just like when No. 7 Sub first opened to long lines, I'm sure the buzz will die down and you can get a table with no long wait. Umami Burger to me its more like a bar with a great burger menu. I want to try their other burgers, I'll be back!
