Bravissimo! This hidden treasure deserves MORE than five stars. I'll preface this by saying I'm a pizza snob. I know for a fact the best pizza around is in New Haven, CT. The only other pizza joint in NY I've tried was Grimaldi's (good, but not worth the 3-hour wait). Luzzo's, however, blew my mind. The crust is very thin, yet bubbly and succulent. And despite the fact that, like the New Haven joints, it's cooked in a coal oven, the cheese doesn't scorch the roof of your mouth! Â I tried the Margherita pie and something else with arugula. Both were outstanding. Before our pizzas, our party (about 18 of us) had a round of salads and various appetizers. The mussels were ridiculous. And I was also impressed they had arancini (a not-very-well-known Italian dish that basically consists of a ball of rice, fried, with meat and tomato sauce). Along with our pizzas, we ordered the gnocchi (PERFECT consistency) and the fettuccine with seafood. BTW, coal ovens are now banned. Luckily, they were grandfathered in. Keep that in mind and give this place a shot.
