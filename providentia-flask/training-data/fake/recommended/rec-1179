Right across from the liberty bell and independence hall this gorgeous little gem smells fantastic!! The fresh seafood smell emanating from the kitchen is absolutely delicious! I'm atmosphere alone I like the place already the servers are great and I love the hot chocolate!!! Will definitely be coming back here! The location is excellent and the place is just what it needs to be. Definitely recommend it! I would give it 5 but the prices aren't exactly perfect.
