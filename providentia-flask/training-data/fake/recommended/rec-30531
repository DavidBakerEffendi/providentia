I've visited this place three times in the last month.  The location, outdoor seating, rustic feel and reasonably priced menu are all bonuses.  My faves on the menu are the chicken tagine, chicken kebab, grilled octopus and salad.  The appetizer portions are SUPER small, so you'll definitely want to order one per person.  The chicken tagine is large and can be shared between two people.  My one complaint is the wait staff--they are a little pushy and want you to get your order in asap.  The owner is great.
