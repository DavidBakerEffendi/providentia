I have only been living in New York for a month and I think I've been here 5 times already! The food is so delicious, all the vegetables and herbs are fresh and crunchy and the sauces are fantastic (like, you will drink them when your food is gone)- you can tell everything is made with care. The prices are great - most things being in the 5 dollar price range - and the staff here are always friendly; I think their daughter had just begun waitressing when I last went. The place itself is kind of a hole in the wall, but for a delicious, fresh, hand made dinner for 5 dollars I would sit on a dirt floor with no complaints, so a little canteen style dining room seems like a huge luxury for the great deal you are getting.
