I am dazzled by the crepe soufflé + peach compote dessert. The crepe soufflé bites were as fluffy as they were light as they were perfectly delectable. The addition of the roasted peach compote was  more heavenly than any dessert I have ever tasted. All of my five stars go to this dessert. The ambiance, staff, and dining experience were great but nothing compares to this delectable treat.
