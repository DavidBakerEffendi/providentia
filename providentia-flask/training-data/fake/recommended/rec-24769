I recently purchased a Groupon for this place, and decided to take my wife out tonight.   First, I will start with the positives.  The food and drinks were very good.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered.  The servers were great; super friendly, and quick to take care of whatever you needed.  The atmosphere was also very nice.  Great decor and ambiance.   Now let's talk about the negatives.  My wife order the Pinot Noir, and thought she was going to get what they advertised on the menu.  What she got was a 9 dollar glass of Barefoot Pinot Noir (retail price per bottle 9.99 -12.99).  I ordered the Tennessee Tokyo (Jack based drink) which included "fresh orange and fresh lime juice".  As I watched the bartender poor in Tropicana, I began to question all of the ingredients being advertised for both food and drink. Second, the price was very high.  Even with our Groupon, we still ended up spending close to a hundred bucks for dinner and drinks for two.   Overall, this place is good.  However, with all of the great sushi places in the city that are off the beaten path, we have easily found places that offer more bang for your buck.  Not sure if I would go back, but still enjoyed my experience.
