I have never encountered a bar with a more rude staff. A man, I assumed to be a manager, needed the table my friends were sitting at because it was reserved. Ok fine - however when my friend asked if there was another table available, the manager responds by saying, "No. Every table in this place is reserved. We take reservations just like every other restaurant in this city." Not only was this rude, he said it with an attitude and that's not even a correct statement. I've been to plenty of bars and restaurants that don't take reservations. When asking the hostess, who was dressed in sweatpants, how long a wait would be for a table, she responds, "do you see this list (pointing to her iPad) all these people are in front of you. So it would be at least an hour." Once again, another rude response from a staff member. Maybe they were stressed, maybe an off day, but I have no desire to return.
