I had 2 arepas at this place. One had so much melted cheese, that when I took the first bite, the entire filling fell out. Great. The other one had beans in it, which were very runny and they spilled all over the place. The arepas themselves were good tho, but the filling choices were bad and uninspired. I also had sangria which was average and a couple of other bites that I just can't remember.
