I had a pretty terrible experience here. I had been hearing about it for ages and had only heard good things. Upon arrival I was shocked at how low the prices were. That was all put out of my head as soon as we were greeted. We had been seated all of 30 seconds when our server arrived and simply said, 'are you ready?'. No hello, no can I start you with a drink. This was NOT a busy night btw. It was a freezing cold Monday night. We explained we needed time but wanted to order drinks. He took 2 beer orders and before another of our patrons was able to ask about cocktails he took off. Â  He came back w/ our drinks and took our order. still cold as stone. I had the Tuna Tartare appetizer and I will admit I thought it was DELICIOUS. When the entrees came, all arrived accept for mine. No one explained that it was on it's way and I waited almost another 5 minutes before it did arrive. No apology for the wait. My pad thai was not very good. I would not recommend trying something else. Here's the straw that broke the camels back. 1. He tried to take my beer away before I was finished with it because he was clearly in a hurry to get us out of there. 2. he didn't even ask if we wanted more drinks or dessert and brought our check. We didn't pay right away BECAUSE WE WEREN'T FINISHED. About two minutes later he came back to tell us that he needed the table. Our entire visit had lasted exactly 45 minutes. Not even an hour. Furthermore, there were other tables available and no wait at the door. It seemed like our server was eager to be seated again. I was pretty irritated and in hind sight wish I would have talked to a manager. The sad thing is I'm sure I'll return. Simply because the food is THAT CHEAP.
