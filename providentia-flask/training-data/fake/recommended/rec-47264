I went here for brunch a couple Sundays ago, and I was pleasantly surprised to find this place off 1st ave. Having heard good reviews about it, I had high expectations for the food. But to be honest, I didn't find it amazing. It was okay, but that's really all I can say about it. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice but I wasn't that impressed. Cocktails were not bad though and there was definitely a good view. The one plus (that gives it 3 stars) was that it was a good price for the food that you got.
