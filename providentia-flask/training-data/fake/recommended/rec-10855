I went here on a Dine in Brooklyn deal, but I checked the prices afterwards and it's still not a bad deal.  The place is not a fancy restaurant, but go in thinking casual seafood place with good food.  The view is great and there's outside seating which looks like it'll be cool during the warmer weather.  If you want to check out their menu, their website is outdated but their facebook is current. It has a nice very casual seafood joint feel, which I like since seafood is expensive to begin with,so  why pay a premium for cloth napkins.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, quick to clear any finished bowls and plates.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the peel and eat spicy shrimp as an app, the jumbo crabcake and apple pie.  The spicy shrimp was awesome - seasoned perfectly, good size, good portion and cooked well.  The crabcake was delicious, there was a lot of crabmeat and the sauce complimented it very well. The apple pie was warm, but left a little to be desired as it was a little dry - not terrible though.  But hey, we're talking about apple pie at a casual seafood joint. Overall, I'd definitely say check this place out.  I was reading the other reviews and went in with really low expectations, but in hindsight I have no idea where these people were basing them on. One big complaint was the prices. All i can say to this is that this is fresh fish, on the waterfront in New York City - This is NOT red lobster.  Eat up and enjoy.
