In order for me to give a 5 I have to be amazed. So I give it a 4 because no one is perfect. Yes it was great Ramen. I had the Akamaru Modern, which if you look at the menu you can see what is in it. I asked for extra spicy sauce on the side and kept having to add paste to make it spicy to my liking. I like it hot. My hubby had the classic ramen with an egg. I tried his, I didn't like it because his broth tasted like raw egg yolk from the egg. I guess some people like that flavor, I don't. I prefer salty and spicy and tart, so mine was perfect. We also tried the Pork buns which were great. Slightly sweet, and mildly spicy. The steamed bun was perfectly "cooked" although it looks raw at first glance because it is white. It was not a long wait as we went around 1:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon. Â I have to admit though, I prefer Totto Ramen's broth better, with their sesame spicy oil that you can add to the broth. Also its expensive. But yes, check it out once for yourself! It probably won't dissappoint you.
