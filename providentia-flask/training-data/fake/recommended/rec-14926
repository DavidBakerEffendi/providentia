I am visiting PA and decided to pull out my trusty ole Yelp App to find lunch. I read the reviews and decided this place sounded right up my alley. I was with a group of people and we each ordered something different but equally tasty. We ordered the bacon greased popcorn which is a definite must if you come here! I ordered the fried oyster po boy, what a great decision on my part. My side included the "made to ordered" baked Mac N Cheese... So good. The consensus from the rest of the crew: fried chicken- 4, muffuletta - 2, gumbo- 5 but add hot sauce. Baked beans are bad ass and the best collard greens around. You won't be disappointed, though, the name is definitely deceiving... But it's a great twist.
