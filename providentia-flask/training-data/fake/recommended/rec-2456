Genos was cool. It was really good. You gotta get the cheesefries and cheesesteak. Parking was okay. I wouldnt park on geno's block b/c u ain't gonna find shit. Park on one of the near side streets and you should find something quickly. The only bad thing is that the line is ridiculous. My friends and I took turns with the 30minute line. Great atmosphere, it seems like mr. geno has it all going on and has frequent celebrity visits to his place. If you're not in a hurry and wanna experience a cool part of philly i would definately reccommend this place.
