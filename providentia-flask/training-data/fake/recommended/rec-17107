Nice interior , fast service reasonable priced but food is pretty average. Tried the dry pork and crab noodle. I felt it was really hyped on yelp!! Sorry yelpers :) the thai iced tea was definitely very good. The music is good and the posters on the wall definitely adds to the charm. Also no credit card under 15 bucks!
