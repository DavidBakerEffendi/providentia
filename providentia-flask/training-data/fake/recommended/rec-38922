The boneless wings are awesome (especially the honey BBQ and 2nd level buffalo), but the service and cleanliness of this place is HORRIBLE. Prices are good and you can get huge quantities of wings (great for parties). I love their food, so that's what keeps bringing me back. I would NEVER bring a date here though. The place is a complete dump. You can eat in the restaurant, but I highly recommend that you do take out instead.
