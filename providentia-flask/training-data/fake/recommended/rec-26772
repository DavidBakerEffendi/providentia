I delayed going here for a while because I didn't want to be disappointed by it. As a former veggie I respect veggie restaurants and root for them, but alas I was a little disappointed in my meal. If you go on a weekend afternoon be prepared to wait in a loooong line to order your food. Then be prepared to have to take your food to go because seating is very difficult to come by, especially if you are in a party greater than two. The do have a wide variety of options and there are also plenty a vegan options which is nice. However it is pretty pricy so it is tempting to go for just a simple burger. I advise against that though, because my burger was very very dry, like the sahara desert and it comes with fries that are nothing special. The one highlight though, was the dessert. I got a blueberry bundt cake thing and I would go back for that.
