Came here with a group of 5 friends. We were seated immediately. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The cocktail of the evening was the well balanced and refreshing Southside (gin, lime, cucumber, mint, deliciousness). It was the best of all the drinks that were ordered. A friend ordered a Manhattan and thought it was good. I tried it, felt like i could breathe fire. We all started with the Mission Fig and Prociutte salad. Fresh and sweet mission figs, crumbled bleu cheese, prociutte, on frisee with lemon-chive vinegrette. Of all the main courses ordered, on the top of my list is the short rib sandwich. I'm going to order this when i go back. It is small, but so full of flavor and rich you still leave satisfied. The other dish I would go back for was the meatloaf sandwich. Don't order the tamarind ribs (it was a special). They were misrepresented. The ribs didn't taste like tamarind, it tasted like any other old southern rib.
