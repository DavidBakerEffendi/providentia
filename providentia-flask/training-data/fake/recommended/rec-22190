As a California native, I really missed my burritos and tacos when I moved to New Haven.  Thank the good Lord for this place!  Cheap, cheap and delicious tacos! (You can get 2 for less than $6, and they usually throw some guacamole on it too!). The burritos are also great (and huge).  Just stay away from the Mole - It consisted of 3 pieces of chicken in some nasty semi-sweet sauce and was served with rice.  Just...weird.  But other than that, it's a great spot, and they are REALLY quick for take-out!
