Came in on a Saturday evening with a group of 4, took about 20 minutes to be seated. We were seated by a fairly awkward server who seemed like he had just started recently, nervously filling our water glasses and barely laying silverware out for us. I ordered the Truffle Burger which was honestly very tasty, but disappointingly small at $12.50. I understand truffles are expensive, but all the burgers were similarly priced and sized. So, for what its worth, it was a moderately enjoyable experience but I won''t be returning. Both the pricing and the service left more to be desired, and I personally didn't enjoy the level of noise from surrounding tables.
