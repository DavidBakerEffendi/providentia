Ordered a cappuccino and a fondue for two with the best friend. Both were just decent. I wish the chocolate was melted right but it just kept on turning grainy and clumpy until by the end of the night we were left with lumpy chocolate. Though I have to admit, the portion could have easily made it fondue for three or fondue for four. Maybe because we ate dinner beforehand and were full. The dish consisted of grapes, strawberries, oranges, mallows and wafers. What I really enjoyed here was the open mic night on Wednesdays. The artists were a mix of old and young, and they were playing a variety of genres. The crowd was pretty friendly too and the service was fine. If you like live music, come on a Wednesday or Friday night and sit at the back. They have cozy chairs. I'll probably come back here for that and maybe just get regular coffee. I also noticed they serve crepes so I'll definitely try that.
