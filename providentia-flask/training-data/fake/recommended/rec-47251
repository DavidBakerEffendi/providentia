This place can attract a somewhat douch-y crowd. But that's not their fault, and the food is delicious! I come here on Sundays for their Spaghetti and Meatballs....they are truly the best I've ever had. One order is large enough for 2, and they split the dishes on 2 separate plates if you share. The Italian chopped salad is also good. The service is friendly and above decent, although because they are so popular they seem to be in the weeds a lot. The one thing I couldn't help but notice is that the owner/manager seems to hire only African-Americans. The host, bartenders, servers are ALL African-American. I don't think it's a coincidence, and you get the vibe that whoever does the hiring has some fetish or ulterior motive (I would also notice if they were all white, all Asian, etc). Nothing bad, its just the big elephant in the room that nobody talks about.
