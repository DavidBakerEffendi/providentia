I recently moved back to Philadelphia, and one of the things that I missed the most when I was gone were the crepes served at Pari in Houston Hall.  I've had crepes in many places in France, but I still like the ones in Houston Hall best. The crepes are always made fresh from batter in front of you, slightly (but not too) dry and thick - the way I like 'em.  They're never small and always make a nice meal or treat anytime.  The nutella and banana crepe's are incredible.  This place is every bit the kind of Philadelphia landmark that Pat's and Geno's are.
