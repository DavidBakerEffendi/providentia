Upon two more visits here I had such better service and food and im glad I have a restaurant in my neighborhood that I enjoy this much more and seem to agree with everyone else who is enjoying this place. OLD review" After all the hype surrounding this place I was expecting to be blown away, maybe I'm being  negative the place is maybe 3.5 not quite a 4 , the service was pretty solid, friendly staff , got some extra bread given to me to soak up my mussels and as I sat at the bar the bartender was friendly and attentive it's just they were very slow 6pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't like they had anything else to do so it wasn't really a plus, as for the food I had the mussels along with the no pasta. Lasagna, it was very dense the velouté super rich and heavy a tower or layered eggplant and full leaves of kale, it was very rustic but it seemed to be missing something, I would love to go back and try a pasta or a different entree it just didnt live up to the expectations set to the article on eater and other reviews, but still I would much rather be here then most restaurants in the neighborhood
