If you are looking for truly authentic Napolitan pizza, look no further.  Run, don't walk to Bivio.  If you are looking for a very simple menu with salads, pizza and a few desserts, Bivio is the place.  It's a bring your own.  Very cozy, clean and a neighborhood gem.  Can't wait for my next trip to Bivio.  I ordered the arugala salad.  Dressing was excellent.  I also ordered the Margherita pizza but asked for buffalo mozzarella instead of the homemade mozzarella.  My husband ordered the homemade, and he liked mine much better.  The sauce on the pie is delicious and the crust was cooked to perfection.  For dessert I had a warm sfogliatelle with a creamy inside and crunchy and light outside.  Perfect way to end my meal.
