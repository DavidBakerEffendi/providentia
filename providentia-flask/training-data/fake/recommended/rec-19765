American Retro is my new favorite midtown happy hour bar!  It's worth the walk over to 11th Ave.  You certainly get away from all the pretentiousness of nomral midtown bars.  The vibe is great (especially for watching sports) and the staff and fellow patrons are really down to earth, good people.  It's great for hanging out during the week and I've heard it's a good crowd for football on Saturdays and Sundays.  Definitely recommend it!!
