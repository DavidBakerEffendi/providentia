Now holding the title of America's worst attempt at fish and chips. Boasting a crisp beer battered fish and chips but serving the most gooey, cakey batter ever sampled. I've had microwave fish and chips come out better than this. Note to the kitchen staff, fries are best served hot, not cold!! Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, well perhaps an enemy!!
