Great place! The food is delicious, fresh, and very reasonably-priced. Everything here seems to have a tasty and well-balanced flavor so I think it's perfect for a light lunch where you leave feeling both full and energetic. Stand-out dish is the Buster's Pasta (perfectly-roasted chicken, cheese that's still in the process of melting when it hits your table, sharp bites of sun-dried tomato) My only complaint is that it comes out so hot that I can't wolf it down as fast as I want to. Â  Casual ambiance and a very small space so I think a group of 2 is the perfect size. Try to snag the seats by the window - window cushions are fun.
