Superb dining experience. I took my mom here on the girls night out. She had never been to this type of restaurant before. I was very excited the way everything turned out. From the moment we entered until the end of the night, both of us felt as though we were transported into France. We ordered a 3 course meal. The meal included two main dishes and a dessert. The size of each dish is larger then an appetizer and smaller then an entre. By the end of our second course we felt stuffed. We both agreed that the desert is too big and should be given an option to opt-out. Â Keep in mind we didn't eat the whole day. The only thing I wish we did is brought some wine with us since the restaurant doesn't serve alcohol. So, BYOB if you want to have a drink. I will remember this night forever. Thank you all for a great service and wonderful food. Will be back again.
