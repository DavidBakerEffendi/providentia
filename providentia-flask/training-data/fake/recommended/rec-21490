I've lived in the Northern Liberties neighborhood of Philadelphia for almost 12 years and have always championed The Standard Tap as the best local place to eat. Well, the owners of the Tap have slowly replaced that opinion with their other offering, the always excellent Johnny Brendas. First and foremost, the burgers here are not to be missed! Everyone has a favorite burger in Philly. For a while, I thought the Tap was the one to beat, but after a few disappointing experiences there, JB's has quickly become my favorite. It's just PERFECT! Each and every time. Many of their other menu items are amazing, you can trust that their food is from local/sustainable sources (just like the Tap!) and everything is always fresh and delicious. Their fried fish sandwich is also always amazing and my fiance swears by their Falafel. For the most part, the wait staff is on point and the bartenders are usually awesome, providing stiff yet tasty drinks. One of my favorite things about JB's is they're always wiling to provide a nice big pickleback shot using the spicy picklejuice left over from the Zayda's pickled tomatoes that they give you with their bloody mary's. It makes for the best best PB shot ever! Enough about the food - if a band you like (or even kinda like, or have a passing interest in) is playing the upstairs of JB's, don't hesitate to check them out here. The cozy room is a perfect size - great sight lines from anywhere in the room, the sound is crystal clear, and (from what I'm told) the venue really takes care of the bands and make them very comfortable/at home when playing the venue. Not to mention most shows here are CHEAP! (And to avoid ticket surcharges, etc - you can buy your tickets in advance right from the bartender!).
