I found El Camino while searching yelp. I'm really into the northern liberties bar&restaurant scene right now and this was next on my list. The decor of El Camino is nice. The staff is also very friendly and more than willing to answer any questions about the menu. I had the Texas style chili. It wasn't bad but not what I expected. Maybe I just don't know how Texas style chili is supposed to be. In any case I will most certainly be back because there were several things on the menu I wanted to try.
