In war of Pats vs Geno, I choose Geno's. I know that a lot of my Philly peeps are gonna kick me but sorry I like Geno's. The cut of the beef is better at Pats but it's not much different when you are wolfing down a cheesesteak. But the pure difference for me is the taste. Geno's just taste better! My "Whiz wit 'rooms" is just juicy and filled with yummy goodness. It makes u lick up your fingers after you are done. My recommendation is go buy both and do your taste test. I do it everytime I come to Philly and I always pick geno's!
