This place is the worst place a person could spend time! Food is ok, but heavy and grease. Drinks you can find better around...Respect and Courtesy this doesn't exist Barmaids doesn't have a minimum respect with client, if you want  enjoy a music or stay a while  you can't, they force you to leave. Disgusting!
