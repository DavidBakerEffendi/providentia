I come to New York every few months for work, and have made it a ritual to stop by at least once for their bacon cheeseburger.  I consider myself a hamburger connoisseur, and can honestly say that the burger here is one of the best I've ever had.  While pricey ($17) for a burger, it's perfect for the occasional splurge.  It comes perfectly complemented with a side of shoestring fries and a pickle.
