I reside in the Cheltenham area and will travel if the "food is right" I have tested many cheese-steaks all over the tri-state area and hands-down Cosmi's is #1 in Philadelphia, in my opinion.  It's tucked away in this South Philly neighborhood and worth the trip.  Voted "best of Philly" in the Philadelphia Magazine on several occasions.   The steak is #1 and  chopped to perfection, every bite is cheesy:)   It's the ultimate definition of a cheese-steak.  I'm still searching for a runner-up.
