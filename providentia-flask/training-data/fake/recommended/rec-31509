This BYOB is hands down my all time favorite South Philly Italian Restaurant.  The Lobster Ravioli is spectacular and you MUST try the prosciutto grilled shrimp-asparagus.   It gets the meal started on the right foot.  Make sure to ask Nino (maitre'd) to tell yo all about the specials.  They are always out of the park awesome!!
