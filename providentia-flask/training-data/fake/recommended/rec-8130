Perhaps if I was more of a beer enthusiast, I would have been more impressed by Eulogy.  But here was the bottom line, for me, beer-unenthusiastic: - There was a leak in the ceiling, and a steady stream of water dripped on my head and down my back when I walked up the stairs. - Although there were a couple empty tables on the second floor, the waiter asked us first to stand up and then to take our glasses off the table if we were not going to order full dinners. - Other patrons sat down and said they'd be ordering appetizers, and they were asked to give up the table, too. The typical entree at Eulogy is about $8 to $20.  Had the customer service been better, each of the people in my party could have easily spent this (or more) on alcohol alone.  Instead, we finished what we ordered (while standing, obvs) and headed across the street to Triumph Brewing Company.
