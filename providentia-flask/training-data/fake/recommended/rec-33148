This is great place. My plate was heaping full and it came out to less than $10. You can't beat that. The meat i got were beef, sausage and pork. Sausage was great but the beef was a bit overdone for my taste. I asked for medium rare and it was dry and chewy. I also loved the different selections of rice and sides.
