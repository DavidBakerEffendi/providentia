This place has the best steamed pork buns outside of China. Hands down! It's not a fancy restaurant, so it's not a great place for a romantic first date. It's got a cafe vibe - but the food is delicious and cheap - and best of all - served fast. Don't expect the wait staff to serve you for that hefty 20% tip. They mean business: they want to take your order and get you fed in a NY minute. You can also get food to go. (Pork buns to go, to steam in the comfort of your own home.) Highly recommended if you're in Chinatown, you have 5 minutes and $5.
