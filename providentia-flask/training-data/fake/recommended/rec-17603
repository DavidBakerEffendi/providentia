With my suggestion, the owner of this establishment listened and decided to "unofficially" include Mariscada en Salsa Verde on the menu. If the proprietor should decide to expand their space to accomodate larger parties, i believe that Terra Nostra will solidy it's place among the elite Portuguese establishements in the Newark / Bloomfield area. As a matter of fact, the pontiental of this restaurant to be better than anything that NJ or NY has produced thus far is very high. Terra Nostra has certainly exceeded any expectations that I have had in every visit. Â  And oh, i failed to mention from my initial review about their Dobrada....It's only their signature dish! Pig knuckles & tripe just doesn't get any better. Dan, prepare my table, the VIP is coming.
