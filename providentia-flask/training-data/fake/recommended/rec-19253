What a gem.  Excellent Italian fare presented by a friendly and attentive wait-staff.  I had pizza-oven baked salmon with a remarkably tasty herb-garlic sauce baked in.  I suggest following my desert path to a pistachio gelato hemisphere enveloped in a thin crunchy layer of crushed amaretto cookies fused with chocolate. Scrumptious.
