This is a great date place and I'll be back. The atmosphere is fantastic - cozy but quiet enough to carry on a conversation. It has the feel of being in someone's home rather than a restaurant,. We ate in the larger of two small rooms. When we arrived at 8pm on a Thursday night we were the only ones in the restaurant. By the time we left at 9:30pm, it was full. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful. When we asked our waiter for a recommendation, he actually referenced the two least expensive entrees which made me believe they were actually his favorites since most waiters simply steer you to the most expensive items, I had the seafood chowder and the salmon. My friend had the Thai curry. All three were good but not great, probably closer to 3 star than four. I'm giving it a 4 because the atmosphere and service were 5s. Our tab with a shared piece of chocolate cake and a $5 corking fee was $57 before tax and tip.
