The food deserves all of the credit for the four-star review! We ordered the following tapas... ensalada de alcachofa - exceptional rough cut potatoes with spicy aioli garbanzos fritos - soooooooo yummy! txipirones en su tinta tortilla española chorizo con chocolate - out of this world! pan con tomate: 3 salsas montadito de crema de habitas con beyos embutidos ibericos: jamón, chorizo palacios, lomo embuchado ... and the following desserts: leche frita - I thought this was really special! torta de santiago The service was overall friendly - but the night ended poorly when my gift card was said to be "blank."  They were polite about it, but I felt like they could have done more to fix the problem right then and there; instead now I have to bother my friend who gave me the card so she can call the restaurant with the card number and date it was purchased to get it re-issued.... The atmosphere was honestly nothing special.  It is a tiny space that had a long wait for a table or seat at the bar (that said, the food truly is wonderful!).  I had made reservations in advance so we got one of the long tables in the back - this was nicer because it was less crowded and less loud than the front room.  Warning, they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 11 more than 5 days in advance (they will make you call back if you try 7 or even 6 days in advance)... and they only make reservations for specific times.  For example, I wanted to make a 7:30 reservation, but they said they only make reservations for 7 or 8:30... we took 8:30 since people were coming from work.... but seriously... I couldn't make a 7:30 reservation? Again - the food was great and when I get my gift card to work, I will go back and hopefully have a better experience.
