Love it so much. Have now been for brunch a bunch of times, dinner once. Food *never* disappoints. Favorites include the breakfast gnocchi, salt cod croquettes, variations on the beet salad, last night's pea salad, lamb burger.  Mussels and kimchi grilled cheese also very good. Music and decor are great, drinks options are fabulous and affordable (rose on tap - yes please!).  Outside space is nice and not too crowded. The service has always been friendly, mixed on efficiency/effectiveness, but the place is still new.  So far, my only complaint is I had a corned beef hash with kale that was SO AMAZING and I have never had it since.  PLEASE bring it back!
