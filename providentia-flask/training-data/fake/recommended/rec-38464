Great food, not so great service. There aren't many vegetarian options around but this place is excellent even with the complicated menu. The lighting is terrible at night. And during the day, the place looks closed. But everything is well maintained and the food is very good. But the staff is the real problem here. Some of the guys have this attitude that just isn't right. A coworker, who is gay, mentioned the same thing. It dawned on me it's the manager (middle-aged white guy) who is setting the tone here and it's not helping business. Change that attitude and maybe I'll be more willing to go back each week.
