I totally loved this place. It was one of the best meals I had in Burlington but I might be biased because I adore pizza, especially flatbread. I ordered a large to split with half punctuated equilibrium and half of their daily special, an apple chutney, spinach, tomato, scallion, and cheddar pizza. They were both phenomenal but the punctuated equilibrium was definitely better. It was super savory and salty which is how I love my pizza. I didn't even notice that neither one had sauce. They had a huge selection of drinks but I opted for a lemonade. I guess it was natural but it was kind of underwhelming and similar to Country Time. I'd definitely come back here and the prices are really reasonable for the size of the pizzas.
