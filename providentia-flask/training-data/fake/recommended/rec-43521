We walked here after visiting the Franklin Institute. The atmosphere was comfortable. The food was great, and the waitress was attentive. We had mussels, pear-gorgonzola-walnut salad, penne vodka, baby back ribs, and a "confit" pork sandwich which wasn't exactly confit but was very good. The chef accomidated my request to substitute a very nice veg medley for the fries. We were glad we found the place.
