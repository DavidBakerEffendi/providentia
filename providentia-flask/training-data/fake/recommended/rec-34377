I really wanted to like Stack's Sandwiches already being a huge fan of August First Bakery but my enjoyment of their sandwiches fell short; I found the service great, the atmosphere "old school" and refreshing but it was the sandwich composition that had me at a loss. There was no real flavor. I ordered a hummus with chutney, tomato and lettuce on a hoagie and found the flavor bland and uneventful. The only thing running through my mind as I tried to finish it was, "Well, at least it's healthy." I really wanted to like Stack's but if you're looking for a good sandwich, you can find one for the amount you'd pay elsewhere in town.
