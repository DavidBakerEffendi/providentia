I am so so sad that Room Service has such mediocre reviews for such an awesome restaurant. As a frequent diner at this joint, I have never been disappointed, aside from the wait times. But thats when you know it's an awesome restaurant. Room Service stands out from the rows and rows of other Thai restaurants from Hell's Kitchen. They have a beautiful interior that gives up the classy vibe without the price tag. You can totally bring your date here and not appear cheap. The food portions are average/large and the quality of food is extremely consistent with every dish I've ever ordered. Bottom Line: I would bring my friends here, my mom here, my date here, my bothang here. It's an amazing place to dine. Be sure to arrive earlier to avoid the long waits! Protip: Order the squidink pasta - best east meets west dish!
