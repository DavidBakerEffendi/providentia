I have eaten here many times, mainly for the Brussels sprouts. It's impossible to explain if you haven't eaten them. They are divine. And yummy. They appeal to high-brow and low-brow alike. All of their other food is good, too. Highlights: green beans (I think this is no longer on the menu), yams, hummus, fresh mint tea, ashta. Weird falafel but I like it anyway. Props for offering watercress salad, since I love watercress. One word of caution: Do not, on pain of death, order the special orange blossom white tea -- it's like drinking perfume. I don't think it is tea. Hurray for available seating at any time of day or night (almost). The space is huge, and welcoming and warm with interesting wood paneling from floor to ceiling. There is an upstairs space and they once seated a party of about 10 with no reservation on Saturday night (shh)! I realize this was luck. It's best to make a reservation. If there are no seats, you can sit in the lounge area and order food there. The bar menu is extensive and it's the same delicious food. The service is fantastic and has never been bad (and I've been here a lot). I've never been here for brunch but the menu looks enticing too. So, in closing, I love this restaurant. A lot. And everyone I have ever taken here loves it too.
