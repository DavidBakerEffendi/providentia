This place doesn't look like much (just a little bigger than your typical every-street-corner-in-nyc convenience store), but they make a mean sandwich. I had melted Munster on roast beef with some peppers, etc, but I felt like I was eating a Philly cheese steak. In Philadelphia. Amazing. Cons: there are "too many choices", and the sandwiches are "too big" :)
