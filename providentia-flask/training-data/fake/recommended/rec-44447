The best kept secret brunch in Montclair is at Just Jake's. This was my second time there for Sunday brunch and the food was delicious. You get the best service because the restaurant is empty! My friend ordered poached eggs, bacon, and waffles. None of it was on the menu. I had the omelette and salad and then, another day, had the omelette with hash browns. The hash browns are seasoned with Rosemary!
