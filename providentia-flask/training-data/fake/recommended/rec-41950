This restaurant is ridiculously amazing.  First of all the food is simply amazing but what just as amazing is the customer service.  We had a party of 4 with a new born and we selected to do the 4 courses for $34.  We ordered our appetizers but were torn on ordering another item on the menu but didn't, when they started to bring our appetizer our server saw our quandary and brought out the appetizer we were contemplating about.  We knew at that moment this was going to be an amazing meal and it was.  Throughout the entire night the meals continue to get better and better.  The service was top notch and the chief even came out to make sure the meal was going well.   If you are looking for a great night of meals and service at a reasonable price...you have to check it out.
