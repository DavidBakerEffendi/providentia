Upon having a craving for greasy food (which isn't often for me!), my boyfriend recommended we come to Rex 1516 for its "AMAZING BURGERS". Let me begin this review by saying this: As an on-and-off vegetarian/pescatarian/all around healthy eater, before yesterday, I have not eaten a burger in over three years. Yes, that's right. I have not eaten a burger in THREE. YEARS. So when he said we were going to get some "burgers", I was not expecting to walk into a place like Rex. We were seated promptly. When we looked at the menus, though, there was only ONE burger. My boyfriend tricked me. I thought this was some sort of burger joint! And this burger had none of the traditional dressings... no lettuce, no tomato, no mayo, ketchup, or mustard. What kind of cruel trick was this?! But, it wasn't a cruel trick at all. On top of the fantastic service, the burger. Was. Amazing. Was it the fact that I haven't had a burger in 3 years? I think it was mainly the sweet, soft, warm bun. The sweet, caramelized onions. The perfectly cooked meat, the "onion marmalade" (good enough to spread on your burger or dip your sweet potato fries in)... It was just the best burger I've ever had, honestly. No lettuce, tomato or ketchup involved. (I did sub blue cheese for cheddar and asked for no bacon... I tasted a bite of my boyfriend's bacon though, and it was delicious and smokey). -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- I revisited Rex a week or two after my first visit, where I ordered take-out to surprise my boyfriend with lunch during his double. I have to revise my score and bring it back up to a five. After chatting with the boys at the bar (one had big glasses and was in a tux vest, very cute!), I am realizing that the charm of this small business is in its fantastic service. I would even call it "caring". There is LOVE behind this small restaurant, and I really like that. I'll be back.
