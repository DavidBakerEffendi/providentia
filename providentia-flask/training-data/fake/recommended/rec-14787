Very good experience overall. We went with some friends for Saturday night drinks and appetizers and were not disappointed. Our bartender was very attentive, the drink menu was extensive, and their perogis were excellent. As a man who loves trying a different beer every night, I thoroughly enjoy their rotating beer menu. I'll be back for sure.
