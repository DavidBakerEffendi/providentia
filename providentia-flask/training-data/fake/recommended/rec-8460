This place is just great.   It's kind of a small space, but it's efficiently laid out for cozy seating without crowding, and beautifully decorated.   Our waiter/sommelier was gracious and knowledgeable.  He answered all of our cheese, wine, and menu questions with a great attitude.  He described a few wines each of the cheese selections in detail and with accuracy.  We asked for a couple reccomendations, and were not disappointed.   My friend and i shared a cheese plate, which came with nice accoutrements like fried okra, blueberries, and jelly.   He got the chorizo, which he was happy with.  I got the goat sausage and buckwheat.  The goat sausage could have used a little more fat, but the gravy was amazing and it worked perfectly with the buckwheat. We tasted three desert wines before selecting someting nice to go with our awesome dessert.   SO, a bottle of wine, a glass of dessert wine, excellent quality entrees, cheese plate, and desert 80$.  Can't be beat.  Quality:Cost ratio = Just right.
