Disappointing.  Decided to give it another try since the food was good on our first visit.     And I had been getting updates from the owners via email that they got even better brisket. What a disappointment.  The pulled pork did not have the authentic smoked BBQ taste.  Seemed like it was boiled and the brisket lacked flavor.  Plus we were there around 6 pm on Saturday and they were out of ribs and sausage so they only had pork and brisket.  They also changed the counter service. Now is sit down service, which I usually prefer.   Well service would not be the word I use.  It took over 30 min to get out food and no one checked on us during that time. At the end the server mentioned that "oh sorry your food took so long" but by than it was too late.  Sorry Delancy you are not a BBQ place for this Longhorn girl!!!!  Bring back your previous brisket recipe and counter service!!!!
