For the only cheesesteak I've ever had in Philly, it wasn't bad. But it wasn't the best either. I guess I prefer my steak thinly sliced and chopped rather than served in thicker slices like Geno's. I had a Whiz-Wit (cheeseteak with cheez whiz and onions) and it was tasty, but definitely greasy. The grease and juices were dripping down from the bottom after taking just two bites. I never got to decide if Geno's or Pat's was better since it was Easter Sunday and Pat's was closed. =P I won't be racing back anytime soon. Bottom Line: Tourist Trap
