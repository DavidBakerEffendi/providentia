I would've given 5/5 but dessert was disappointing. Dinner was delicious. Started with beef tartar and the prosciutto platter. For mains we has the pork tenderloin and the osso bucco. Both heavenly. Service impeccable. View of the skyline is picture perfect. For dessert we orders the creme brûlée and chocolate platter. Both mediocre. We were stuffed so that was ok. It's somewhere you want to go for special occasions. We went for our anniversary and loved it!
