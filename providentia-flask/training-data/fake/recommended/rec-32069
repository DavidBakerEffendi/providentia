I had my rehearsal dinner here on April 28th and would recommend this restaurant for both an intimate dinner and a large event. My guests LOVED the food. Loredana and Sam were both excellent to work with and the service was really as good as it gets. The food didn't taste banquet at all, but rather just like a restaurant meal. The caeser salad, penne pasta, entrees and dessert platter were tasty, fresh and crowd-pleasing. The back room fit my group of 40 with plenty of space, and the ambiance was cozy and welcoming. If you ever need to plan a graduation party or large dinner, I highly recommend Spasso.
