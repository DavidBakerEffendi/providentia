Love that I can get a burger after work at 2am! The burgers are juicy and topped with lettuce and tomato. The french fries are decent and are skinny like McD's fries. This is no frills dining and you're lucky if you can get your waiter to give you a refill on your coke... but it's good so I keep coming back.
