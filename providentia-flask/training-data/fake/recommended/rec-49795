I really like this place all around. The service is great the food is very unique and very tasty, and the waiters are very informative about the specialty foods. There are so many interesting combinations and unique ingredients it's impossible to know all of them unless you're very familiar with regional Thai food. But the waiters tell you all about it, they cooperate with one another with you as the focus, and the food is fantastic. I've eaten a lot of Thai food in a lot of different restaurants and cities, and I rate this up there with the best.
