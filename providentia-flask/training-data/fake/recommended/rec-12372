If it's your first time eating at Taim I highly recommend the Mixed Falafel platter. It's tons of food for a decent price ($12.00). It lets you try all three of their flavors of falafel, hummus, tabouli and Israeli salads, as well as three of their sauces. The falafels were all good in their own way. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, they were awesome with the hummus and warm pita. Out of the three sauces served with it, I only really like the traditional tzatziki and ambra which is a pickled mango-fenugreek chutney. It tasted a lot of curry. The third one, s'rug which is a Yemeni cilantro garlic chili spicy sauce, didn't work for me. Too much cilantro. The two salads served with it were nothing much to talk about. Just your typical tabouli and Israeli salads. I also ordered the fries ($4.00) with saffron aioli, and damn they were good. Perfectly crispy , and the saffron aioli was almost like a ketchup mayo. Plus they give you a giant portion of them. You wouldn't expect to find such awesome fries at a falafel joint, but they're some of the best I've had. Service was great, food took a minimal amount of time and was fresh. The seating is slightly limited, I wouldn't go with more than a friend or two, but overall a great food experience, would definitely return.
