Ate here for new years eve this year with a couple of my more "foodie" friends.  I was a little nervous b.c this was a tough crowd.  After our first appetizer came and everyone was tasting each others I knew that we picked a winner. The wait staff was great.  The food was by far my favorite byo restaurant I've eaten at in Philly.  And the atmosphere was very nice.  This will definitely be me and my wifes new favorite spot.
