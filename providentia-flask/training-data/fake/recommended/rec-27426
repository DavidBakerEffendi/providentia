Very nice place but unfortunately forgettable because I had to be reminded that I've already been there before (for my birthday no less) but couldn't remember ever setting foot inside. Even the delish chocolate martini failed to induce some sort of déjà vu experience. So I ate and drank and was merry as if it were my first (and probably last) time. *My sincere apologies to the owner if perchance I never was here before, in which case I take back the above.
