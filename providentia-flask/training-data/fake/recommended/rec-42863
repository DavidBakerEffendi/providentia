Always excellent food. Unique menu, great Staten Island restaurant. Food makes you think you're at a city restaurant. Not your usual boring Staten Island fare. The Summer Lamb is excellent as well at Chicken. Mash potatoes are excellent. I would stick to the wine rather than the mixed drinks. Just okay. fried ice cream is AmAzInG!!!!!! Decor is really cute. Dimmed lighting and exposed brick make it cozy and date night appropriate.
