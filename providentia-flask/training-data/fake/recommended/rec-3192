Adela's WOW. I friend recommended my to come for some home cooked Puerto Rican food. No frills needed just quality delicious home cooked food at a affordable price. I went on a Sunday night around 8. Adela was there with probibly 5 of her family members, three or four generations. All cooking, laughing and smiling. There is a strong sense of love and history in this place. The half the chicken, plantains and cuban sandwich were all delicious. I will prob. go back this week
