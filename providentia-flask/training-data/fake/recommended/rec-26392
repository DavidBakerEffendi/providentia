I went to Korea last week for a few days vacation. I ate at 5 restaurants and I kid you not, BCD Tofu is just as good if not better than those restaurants. I ordered Spicy tofu soup with pork dumplings inside the soup. Absolutely incredible. And relatively inexpensive for NYC. The complementary sides were awesome and they give more variety than the avg Korean restaurant. Service was great too. Fast, on top of their game, but don't rush you at all. Really nice atmosphere too, great date spot
