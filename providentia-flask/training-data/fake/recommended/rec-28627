Am I the only person that didn't love Illili? Â My favorite part of the meal was the Brussels sprouts, to be honest. We ordered a grilled fish that was super boney and didn't taste great. The dessert was good - we have some kind of a chocolate molten lava cake with hazelnut sauce and ice cream. Staff was very friendly and I will certainly give credit for that.
