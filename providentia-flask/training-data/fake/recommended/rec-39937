Was spending the night in the area and stumbled on this place. Since it was our first time there they brought out a plate of samples of their own slow roasted meats, which were all amazing and made my friend change his mind and get one of their pastrami sandwiches. I had their homemade mac and cheese (even though it wasn't offered that night they still made it for me without batting an eye), and we started with the garlic bread fondue which was also amazing.The portions were massive and everything was delicious. The waitress was very nice and attentive. I would recommend this place in a heart beat.
