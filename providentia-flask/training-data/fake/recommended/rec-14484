The best way I can put this place into words is "meh." I stopped by here for lunch today because it looked like a fairl healthy, reasonably priced, sort of fast-casual Qdoba of falafels and gyros. Well, it is all those things, but truth be told it just wasn't all that good. I mean, this is New York City, home to some of the best food on the planet, and this place just tastes like a mediocre, run of the mill pita place. It just didn't wow me with any of the ingredients or the service. If anything, I have to say that the lamb gyro with grilled vegetables, feta, and amber sauce was not good. The lamb had that texture of a meat that is ground up and then pressed together in a mold to form a giant hunk of meat, and was a little dry and crumbly. The grilled vegetables and amber sauce were not memorable and the whole wheat pita brought nothing to the table except for a vessel in which to hold the feta, lamb, and vegetables.Surprisingly, they were busy and appeared to be getting a lot of business, probably because their prices are good. It was $6.95 for a large gyro. Best part: the outdoor sidewalk seating on 6th Avenue.
