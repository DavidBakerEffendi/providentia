Ugh! We came here for lunch today. Apps:: Papaya salad OK            Spring Rolls unbelievably greasy Entrees: vegetable see ew- too sweet                grilled pork salad - shoe leather The service is quick, but they should take more time. Worst part was watching the wait staff and kitchen. Servers constantly going back and forth to their own food. One server was eating with her hands and licking her fingers. Another dabbing with a napkin, then going back to the bar to serve and wait tables. No hand washing here. One chef was also eating and preparing food without gloves. Hey. you have an open kitchen, you see it all. The smashed yet not broken window near the outdoor seating is a nice touch too.
