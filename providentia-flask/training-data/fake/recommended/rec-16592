this place is AMAZING!  so much fun,  the staff is hilarious,  they all cheer something in Japanese every 2 minutes.   I've eaten here about 5 times.  They serve big beautiful hot bowls of soup,  with great Japanese ingredients.  I like chashu pork.  I also always must have the poached egg inside.  There are lots of types of noodles, seaweed and cabbage, and exotic ingredients. The staff is attractive young Japanese men and women,  and they all seem to be comfortable and happy, and expressive.  I like the staff very much. The tables are semi-community tables,  so that sometimes I have shared a table with strangers,  which was nice,  and they seemed to love the food also. I brought my brother once,  and I also brought my girlfriend once.  They both loved it. The best appetizer is the steamed bun with roasted pork slab on it.  its one of my favorite appetizers in Manhattan. ITS A BUSY PLACE,  so get there early to put your name in,  and then take a walk in the east village,  which is always nice.  Cool tattoo places,  record and comic stores,  st marks book shop not too far.  or walk west to strand bookstore,  whatever. Cant wait to go there again.
