I was passing through the area when I decided to meet up for lunch with a friend at the Pat Thai.  While a chlorine smelling odor had us debating whether or not to dine somewhere else, we decided to have lunch here. I decided to start off my lunch with a glass of the Thai iced tea, which tastes a bit like a creamy Orangesicle (it was good).  After reading Pat Thai's extensive menu (they have about 120 dishes to order from), I decided to order the Pad Bha-Mee, which is stir fried noodles with onion, tomatoes, bell pepper and scallions.  Pat Thai also allows you to choose your own spice level, which is a nice option, especially since I tend not to like a lot of spice. The food was generally good and tasted well.  However, that chlorine smell does concern me a bit.
