Had another great experience here last night. It was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait any longer than they told us. We had the macaroni and cheese, which never ceases to amaze me with how delicious and creamy it is. I also decided to try the summer peach fried chicken salad, and it was one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. All the ingredients in the salad just came together perfectly, and despite the fact that I was starving it was still very filling for me. I was surprised at how quickly the food came out considering the fact that it was completely packed. Our waiter was super busy the whole night but still checked in on us several times. The food was just so satisfying and I always have such a fun night there. The music they play is perfect for me. Definitely my favorite bar in Forest Hills.
