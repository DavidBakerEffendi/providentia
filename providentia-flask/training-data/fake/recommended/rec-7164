This place is yummy!!! Super great brunch! All the food was amazing. I had a delicious bloody mary. I got the shrimp bloody mary that is $14 rather than the regular bloody for $8, but that was my fault for not asking difference in price. The pancakes are to die for! Strawberry butter and thick and cakey on the inside. Definitely huge and filling. My friend and I got our own dish for brunch and then split the pancakes. We couldn't even finish the pancakes, but wish we could have. I will probably go back again to try the french toast before I leave NY. Service was great. Environment very cute and cool. Great experience!
