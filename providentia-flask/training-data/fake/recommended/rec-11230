This place is SO bad, I have a hard time understanding why so many people go here. Maybe they're new to Philly, and don't know any better? Or maybe they're paid actors? Like extras on a bad movie set? Whatever. I will NEVER step foot back in this place. Let's start off with the hostess. Do they always have to be brainless? I mean, how hard can it possibly be to handle the seating arrangements for a restaurant that's been around for YEARS? You do not need a college degree for this, am I right? So why do they always screw it up? The waitstaff is always flaky. My order has been messed up here more than once...usually little mess-ups (they put salt on my margarita glass after I specifically said no salt). But the last time I ordered a SEITAN burrito, and specifically told the waitress to make it VEGAN (no cheese or sour cream). I was served a STEAK burrito. I just don't understand. SEITAN does not sound like STEAK, and I specifically said "make it vegan" and it was still screwed up. Unreal. I will never go back to this place. Not even if someone paid me to. Which is a shame, because I used to really enjoy coming here for drinks and food with friends. How this place went so downhill is beyond me. Get it together, El Camino.
