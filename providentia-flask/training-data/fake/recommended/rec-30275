Great, solid food. Argentinian and family owned restaurant. We shared the fish of the day and the ribeye, along with a bottle of wine (of course). This is a solid choice for a more serious-type get together, such as a business dinner, first or second date, encounter with someone you don't know well. Nothing too "scary" on the menu, and a classic ambience.
