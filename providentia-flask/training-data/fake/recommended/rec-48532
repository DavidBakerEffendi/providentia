Great NY Pizza! I went here today to get a large pie. I took it to go and the wait was 20 minutes, but if you eat it here its like 1-2 hours. It's waayyy better than Goodfella's and better than Lombardi's. There's also a great ice cream shop to go to down the block when you're done. They don't do pizza by the slice so you'll have to get a whole pie. It's soo worth it and not expensive.
