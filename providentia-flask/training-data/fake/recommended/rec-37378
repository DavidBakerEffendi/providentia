I have never visited this restaurant after living in the upper valley for a long time.  I visited for a birthday dinner.  Everything went well from drinks, to appetizers, to the main course.  The chef was accurate cooking meat and veggies, plus showy in entertainment value with flames and utensils.  Good food and a well executed hibachi side dinner grill.  Nice and warm on a cold winter night.  Well done staff, we shall return.
