Do yourself a favor and don't eat lunch before you go here. Order the fries, or the beets for an appetizer, get yourself a pour of good whiskey, and then order the burger. It's all sublime. The burger is seriously the best I've ever had. i have no idea what they do to it, but it doesn't hurt that the tomato tastes like a tomato and not some pulpy imitation. A little cracked pepper, a little cheddar, and viola! heaven on a plate. So freaking good.
