This was my summertime routine after a day at the park. Located not too far from flushing meadow park, this cafe serves the best empanadas I ever had! They have different types such as the flour, white, and even organic styled empanadas. The menu offers so many choices you can't help but to order BIG! They serve from the traditional shredded beef, or chicken to the exotic hawaiian-styled or guava and cheese dessert empanadas and more. They have a few tables indoors, and limited counter seats. Â Make sure to bring your cash money because this establishment does not accept credit cards. Theres always a long wait Bc it's just that good. When u eat indoors, they serve u on a wooden plate with a side of their bangin green sauce. Most importantly, save room for the homemade tropical helados. Mmmm.... You won't regret it. This is really one of the best hidden secret in queens!
