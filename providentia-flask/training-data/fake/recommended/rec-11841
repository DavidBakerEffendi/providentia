Came to Applewood during their Dine in Brooklyn week. The overall rating for this meal really falls a little more towards 3 1/2 stars. I enjoyed the options available in the $25 menu, which also has a few supplemental items as well. I stuck with the regular choices and got a beet salad as a starter, sauteed hake as my entree, and an apple bread pudding for dessert. The beet salad was refreshing and spot on. The sweet roasted beet matched with the light vinaigrette, and cubes of pickled beets also dotted the salad, adding both texture and flavor. The hake was perfectly done, flaky and well-seasoned. The apple pudding was custardy and tasted delicious with the drizzle of caramel sauce that accompanied it. My dining companions decided to order different menu items, and some of them didn't fare as well. The supplemental scallop appetizer was one of the highlights of the meal; pan seared to a perfect consistency. But the lamb pastrami that came with the charcuterie plate was just a tad too salty, even for pastrami. The salty theme continued in the braised short ribs dish. While the accompanying polenta was marvelously creamy, the beef itself was oversalted. Kudos for the restaurant for offering homemade soda concoctions; although on the pricey range ($4 or $5 a pop), they were a great alternative for non-drinkers. Service was very friendly and polite, but something was off with their pacing. We waited about a half hour between receiving bread and getting our appetizers. Luckily I was with good company, since I would have been annoyed about the wait otherwise. In either case, it disrupted the flow of the meal somewhat, which was disappointing. There are enough bright spots in Applewood for me to return; thus the rounding up to four stars.
