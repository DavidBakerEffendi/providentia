Food was delicious! Definitely have the Mac and cheese, pickles and burger with Irish cheese. Our bar tender was not that pleasant, my gin and tonic was very week. When I addressed it to Rob, he said there was a lot f liquor in it and if anything he would charge me another drink to change it. Really?? That's not what I would of expected, I would of left happy with his service if he would taken care if my drink like Mika did. Overall live the ambiance and the live band that they had.
