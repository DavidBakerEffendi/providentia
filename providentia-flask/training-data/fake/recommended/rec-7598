This place has a good amount of potential if they make some changes. My wife and I came here on a Saturday night after reading the yelp reviews. It was fairly empty for 8pm. The place consists of a rather small buffet and a guy off to the side w/ a bunch of different meats on a rotisserie, you take what you want, you can take some meat from the rotisserie guy, he'll cut it off right into your plate and then they weigh the dish, give you a number and you sit to eat. The buffet was good w/ some cold dishes, some rice dishes, a few different meat dishes. It was good, i wasn't like "OMG, i want to eat here every night" but it was good.. The staff is super attentive and pleasant. I have a few problems with the place, #1 Way too bright, i felt like i was in my high school cafeteria. #2 3 TVs going , i don't want to watch TV, i want to converse while i eat dinner #3 No music, Â some nice mood music would be nice instead of TV IMHO #4 Dirty & stained ceiling tiles, (this always pisses me off) #5 Dirty a/c vents (this too) Again, i liked this place and i think with a few adjustments they can make this place really welcoming. It was decorated with some antiques, pretty cool. I'll save the best for last, we each ate a plate & had a soda, the bill was $23, as we are walking out we pass the dessert fridge that has a sign that says "award winning", i start talking to the cashier about he desserts, i tell my wife, lets try one, we grab the coconut pudding, i ask the cashier his favorite, he goes to the fridge and gives us one on the house. THEY WERE BOTH AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING... FIVE STARS FOR THESE DESSERTS FOR SURE....and this place is BYOB Give it a try, you will like it, make sure to save room for dessert.
