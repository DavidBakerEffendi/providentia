This is some of the best ramen in NYC.  I like this place more than Ippudo, more than Ivan, and there is a long list, but the waits are crazy.  I would give this place five stars, but there are better in Japan.  Definitely better than the Brooklyn locations to date. If the wait is getting insane I would try your luck at the bar of Danji, up the block by a few minutes on the same side, and grab a couple of pork sliders while you are waiting with a cocktail.  It is the best pork slider I've ever had and better than sitting on the curb for a 20-40 min.
