Damn! When you are eating just the crust and still thinking "damn this taste good" you know the place has to be delicious. From the sauce, to the cheese, every bite is fresh and a piece if heaven. The service is great and filled with very friendly staff. Pizza is delicious and great customer service Cash only though!
