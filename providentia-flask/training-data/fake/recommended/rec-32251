I am not sure how to make this review short so I will do my best.  Prepare to spend a lot of money. Prepare to fast for a day before you dine here.  Prepare to bring a group.  Prepare to wait.  Prepare to watch vegetarians explode into a fine mist as they cross the threshold.  Prepare to consume at least, one whole barnyard animal.  Prepare to leave here feeling satisfied and slightly guilty.  Prepare for an epic dining experience.
