Hands down one of the best restaurants in the East Village, especially this far north. I tried the tasting menu, consisting of 5 courses and it was excellent, and they are very accommodating for vegetarians, in fact you have your choice of any other option on the menu, though the whole table needs to be in on the plan, comme d'habitude. The lobster and asparagus was my favorite dish, I could have had it fives times over!  But the shrimp tangiatelli was a close second.  My fellow diners said the steak was excellent too.   They also have a superb wine menu, in addition to fun and unique drinks that I have never heard of so it's fun to try. The space is quite large in total with different dining areas, and we went there as a double date and it could have been more romantic, but the lighting was great, just a bit too close to other people and in the open to be completely intimate. I assume the bill came to nearly $150 per person, but again, the tasting menu was the kicker, but as it is traditional American cuisine done best, I say it's a good deal.
