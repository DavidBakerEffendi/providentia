Although it does generally take around an hour for delivery,  I accept that because this place is damn good.  So far I've had the burger, salmon, duck torta, elote,  french toast & eggs w/bacon.  All solid and delicious.  Sure it's a little pricier than expected around here but again, worth it.  The delivery guys are always super nice, too.  My only qualm is that when it says "side salad" with the sandwiches, it's really just a small pile of spring mix; need to work on that Chop Chop.
