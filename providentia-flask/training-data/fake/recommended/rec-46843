I love this place. I've taken lots of friends here, and they love it too. Great food and cool atmosphere. Plus, you can't beat the Yelp check in deal: free glass of wine or beer! The only downside is that it's always really busy, so there's often a wait for a table, and sometimes the service is slow -- but only because the waiters are working really hard.
