Love this place!!! It's quaint and has that southern shabby chic feel to it. The food was very good as was the service. Yes, there's a wait and yes the tables are a bit crammed together but we went on a Friday afternoon around 1:15 and only waited about 10 minutes. My hubby got the chicken pot pie & I had a great salad with chopped up veggie burger in it. But the best thing was the homemade potato leek soup - holy hell that was the best soup I ever ever had. That made my weekend and it hit the spot since it was so ass cold outside. We'll be back since we just got an apt 2 blocks away.
