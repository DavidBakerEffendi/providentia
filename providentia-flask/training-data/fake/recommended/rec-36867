I've been to Balthazar many times and it's a gorgeous restaurant with above average food. But last night, when asked the difference between the bar steak, the steak frites and the steak au poirve, our waitress described the bar steak as "crap in your mouth". Hearing about "crap in your mouth" right before dinner completely spoils your appetite if you didn't know. Our waitress had the demeanor of someone selling hot dogs in Tijuana. I suggest that Balthazar reevaluate it's serving staff or at least train them better.
