Its quite unfortunate that there is just one other dim sum restaurant in the 20-30min vicinity of where I live, though sometimes I'm dedicated enough to trek out to NYC for some good dim sum. This is as "authentic" as you can get in terms of "cantonese" food in the area. Born and raised in Parsippany, I've been eating at Noodle Chu since it first opened years ago (and have seen the rise and fall of many chinese restaurants in the area), and the once decent quality food is mediocre, prices inching higher while the quality of dim sum and 90% of the entrees on the menu sometimes come out as dry and lukewarm, or even worse, undercooked. There are some good dishes still, of course. Carts aren't abundant and its fun to sometimes see how long the same plate of  fried squid has been rolling around. In terms of dim sum, you definitely won't find the variety that is in NYC, but it offers just enough before one can really complain about starving at a restaurant. While there are some nice servers there as well, general quality of service is just ok. Funny enough, while it is a Chinese restaurant, I've observed that they tend to treat the non-Asians with better service. Unfortunately  there is not enough incentive for the restaurant to improve since it makes enough and Chinese people still use it as a weekend meetup with big groups. As a wonton noodle soup lover, I highly don't recommend getting that.
