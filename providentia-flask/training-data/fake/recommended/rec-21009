In a busy, fast - paced world...simple is good. Simple is appreciated. Simple is what we need on occasion. Simple and carefully crafted food made this a perfect meal. Combining that with a fresh menu and personal attention made for a very enjoyable night out. Meals were presented quickly and attractively. We'll patron again!
