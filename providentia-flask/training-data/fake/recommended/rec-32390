Located at the top of the hill on Main Street in Boonton, Chili Willie's is a great little Mexican restaurant.  The pastel walls give a cool cantina feel to this shoebox sized eatery.  Owned by a husband and wife team, Jose cooks & Jackie hosts.  This congenial couple makes you feel like you're dining in their kitchen.  Typically I have eaten lunches here while shopping on Main Street (Boonton's got a lot of neat shop to stop in, books, antiques, art studios, etc.)  The menu is standard Mexican and the chili rellenos are highly recommended.  If you show up for dinner try the Pork Chops Durango.  Even on a budget you can probably afford to treat a friend.
