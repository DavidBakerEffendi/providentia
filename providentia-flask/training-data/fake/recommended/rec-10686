Yea it's just ok   portions are  huge.  ......... Price ok great place I guess for tourist  that don't know the difference of what good Italian food  is. I am not saying it's totally bad but ranks "ok" in my book when there is so many better Italian restaurants in the area with no wait. as a native new yorker I can not understand why people flock to this place.
