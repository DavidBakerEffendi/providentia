Once upon a time, this place was magical-the Camelot if brewpubs. Now, its an entirely average attempt in a city that has an abundance of truly good places to eat. As noted by others, the beer and soda are practically flat-I guess they're economizing by skimping on the CO2. The Toad in the Hole was hopefully just a warped attempt at mocking "bad" British cuisine, as I'm assured by my born in the UK mate that he can make me his own version of this national dish that *won't* make me go "what am I eating"? Â The fries were freshly harvested from the back of the Sysco truck. And folks, if you really want anyone to walk out with a growler, then perhaps consider raising the light level in the foyer to something above a subterranean grotto.
