This is the NY version of an LA late night carne asada nachos run... those of you in SoCal.... know what i mean?! it's good... no doubt... but i went in the winter so by the time you grab it and get home to eat, it's cold! yikes! we decided to eat it on the spot... BEWARE! the hot sauce is MUY PICANTE! be careful. some of you light weights may need some prilosec afterwords to assist with the drainage.... most definitely worth the late night trip!
