Definitely a cute spot for dinner. The food here has a special taste to everything.I came here with my brother and sister and we had a great time. The service was good. It kind of depends on who you get as your server though. Some servers were more enthusiastic than others. The food is excellent. I had the skate wing. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce was perfect. The place is pretty pricey but I loved the food. Probably will be a once in blue moon special occasion spot for me.
