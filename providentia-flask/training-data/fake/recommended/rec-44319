Loved this place, despite the hipster leanings (there's kale on the menu. Kale, really? who the hell likes to eat Kale, unless you are trying to prove something). Had the chicken-fried steak and fried green tomatoes, both of which were awesome. They know how to serve a Guinness as well. The place was a ghost town the night we went so the service was terrific.
