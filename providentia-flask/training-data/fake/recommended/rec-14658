Whether it's worth the wait or worth a long trip is a judgment call, but it IS the best halal cart (it's not just hype, it's the truth), and I do go out of my way for it when I can. The chicken is good, but you want the lamb. Trust me. And you do NOT have to be drunk to enjoy this. The white sauce is great, but if you go overboard with it, that's what makes people feel not so good later. Use enough to flavor all the food but don't drench it. And just a dab of the hot sauce will do. Do NOT use the BBQ sauce! You do not want BBQ sauce adulterating this deliciousness.
