Regardless of what I heard, this burger was the best burger I had in Philly.  It's just a walk in place with communal tables and there weren't many people when we got there.  I had the cheeseburger and I would compare it to Five Guys.  Regardless of your local mom and pop, in my opinion, Five Guys is the fast food burger to beat.  These burgers are a little larger but the same juicy flavor.  Really, really good.  The fries are great and there really isn't a lot to say.  You can't go wrong here.  Order medium rare.
