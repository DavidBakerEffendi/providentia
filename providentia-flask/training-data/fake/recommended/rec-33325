My favorite restaurant in Fort Greene, hands down.   The food is always delicious.  There normally isnt a single dish on the menu that I wont eat.  And that isnt cooked perfectly whenever I order it.  The only negative food experience I've had has been overcooked french fries once or twice. Cocktails are always delicious - and the staff is always wonderful, knowledgable and friendly.  Usually a long wait for a table, but.. understandable.
