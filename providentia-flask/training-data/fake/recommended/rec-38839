I super recommend it! A must try restaurant! I'm a foreigner, personally I don't quite like American food, but I really love their food and drinks. I enjoyed their secret home-made source and good quality beef or chicken inside the sandwiches which integrate eastern and western style perfectly! Don't miss their smooth fresh thirst-quenching juice, worth its price! Yummy yummy... ! Most important thing I need to recommend, their beautiful environment inside where can chat with friends comfortably without any tips! Try them so you must agree with me!
