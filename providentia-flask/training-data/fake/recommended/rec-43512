Penelope's has great food and great neighborhood atmosphere.  In order of yum: egg sandwich with apple chic sausage and pesto on an English muffin, pumpkin Waffle - its subtle flavored with the cinnamon apples and walnuts just edges out the Nuttella French Toast.  My plain ol Oatmeal brought up the rear but was actually really good - big bowl and left nothing.  Wait staff is nice and cheery and the place is a neighborhood gem.  Regretting not getting the potatoes.  Maybe I'll just start ordering again...
