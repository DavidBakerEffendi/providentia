We went there around 7pm on a Friday night and had to wait about 20mins for seating. The interior decor is pretty, but there's hardly any room btw the tables. Anyways, we came here for the food and were not disappointed. I had the Room Service Pai Thai and that was awesome; would definitely recommend it for a must-try at this place. We also had the curry puff for appetizer and that was very good as well. Plan to be back to try other dishes in the near future.
