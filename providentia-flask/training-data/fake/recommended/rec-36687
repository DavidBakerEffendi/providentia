We lucked out by just walking in on a Friday afternoon and getting a table. No such luck to get a weekend ressie. By a long shot. But I'm glad we tried it for lunch! Glad I split the ham & Gruyere sandwich because that thing was decadent. Oily, salty, cheesy goodness. YUM  The other sandwich we tried was the eggplant veggie one.  It was also good, and a nice contrast to the much more savory sister sandwich.   Next time, have to try the steak frites.  The person next to us ordered that for their lunch after 2 bread baskets.  Where do people put all that food???
