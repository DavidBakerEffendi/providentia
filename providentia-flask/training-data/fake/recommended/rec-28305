Came here with a bunch of folks for brunch. Fried chicken and waffles, masa cakes, shrimp and grits, kool-aid in mason jars, and beef broth bloody marys were all really spectacular. Yum yum in the tum. :d Southern comfort with a hipster flair. Where else could you get kool-aid in a mason jar anyway?
