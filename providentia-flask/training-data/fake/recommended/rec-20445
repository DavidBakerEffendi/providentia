You know a restaurant is good when you dream about it. Getting there from downtown Brooklyn is a pain in the ass, but it's worth it. Having to run a gauntlet of surly MTA workers would still be worth it. An hour long wait on weekend nights to get a seat is worth it. Listening to little kids throw temper tantrums against all that is made out of breakable china is also worth it. The garlic barbecued pork appetizer is excellent, as are the crispy veggie spring rolls. But I come for the red curry. If you ask for it hot, you'll get it hot and spicy. Not pointlessly meanspirited, but the right kind of sting and burn that gives you that lovely Valium-esque afterglow. They also make a steamed banana tapioca mush dessert that is lovely. The service is a bit slow when they're busy, but who cares? Obviously lots of people care about service, as yelp and other "consumer-driven content sites" show, but those people are missing the point. Or perhaps I'm missing the point, coming to eat curry when I should have been desperately seeking fawning.
