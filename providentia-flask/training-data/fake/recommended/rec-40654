Had the turkey burger with boursin cheese and sprouts on top, it was such a delicious combination!  BF had pork sandwich and he liked it as well.  I would love to try more on the menu, most seemed like simple comfort food but with a twist.  We were seated immediately and the service was friendly and prompt.  We will definitely be going back here, loved it!
