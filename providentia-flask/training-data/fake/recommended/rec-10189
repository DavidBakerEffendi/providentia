We went for a friend's birthday (on a Wednesday night). The food was outrageously good! By far the most amazing thing is the green sauce - I have no idea what's in it, but it is highly addictive. 7 of us shared empanadas, cebiche and 2 of the Matador combos. It was a TON of food and all of it was delicious! We also had the sangria, which I highly recommend. Service was not great, but not bad enough to warrant staying away. I mean...I'm not sure I could go on living without that green sauce. Pros: FOOD! and the atmosphere was chic and soothing. Cons: Service was slow and/or non-existent. Our waitress seemed to forget about us several times, which is difficult to do with dining room is 1/3 full and we were the largest party.
