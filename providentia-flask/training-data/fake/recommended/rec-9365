I FINALLY had a chance to go to Ippudo and lunch is definitely the way to go.  There's still a wait but it won't be for long.  The Tonkotsu ramen was delicious esp with the extra pork belly but I do think Totto's broth is a lil better if we're making this a competition.  I'll need to come back and try the pork buns next time.
