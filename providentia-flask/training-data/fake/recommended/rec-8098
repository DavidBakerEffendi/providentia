I'm shocked at all the bad reviews here!  I love Tomo.  Easily the best sushi in Princeton, and I like it more than most of the places in Philly.  They have a lot of vegetarian options too, which is wonderful for my vegan boyfriend.  Yes, it's a take out place, but it's worth waiting for a seat.  If you're looking for great sushi and don't care about the decor, then definitely stop by Tomo.
