After coming here and tasting these delicious noodles, you probably will never go anywhere else in Chinatown.  You definitely will not be disappointed. I got the beef brisket noodle soup - everything from the broth, the tasty meat, to the noodles were all perfect.  You can definitely tell the noodles are hand made and are authentic. My boyfriend also got the chicken stir fry and dumplings.  Both dishes were very good, but, I think they are most known for their noodle soup!   One thing you have to keep in mind is that this place is cash only so make sure to stop by the ATM or bring the cash with you. Service was good and the food came out really fast.  The prices are really good too - you definitely get your moneys worth. If you are ever in the Philly area, PLEASE GO!  It's worth it :)
