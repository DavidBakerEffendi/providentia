I used to like this restaurant but stopped eating there after realizing they had a roach problem. One night, my sister and I went there for dinner and alerted the waiter to the fact that a roach was crawling on the wall. The waiter nicely offered to move us to a new table but apologetically informed us that we would have to wait at the bar until a new table became available. We reluctantly agreed to stay but left immediatly after noticing another roach on the counter at the bar. The manager/owner was mortified. We have not been back there since that night.
