I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place is. Came here with a group of friends for some authentic Korean food. We ordered the spicy Korean rice cake, chicken bibimbap, tofu stew with beef, and bean paste tofu stew with beef. I've never had legit spicy Korean rice cake before, but I really liked the one here. It came with thin slices of beef, onions, cabbage, and carrots and was super flavorful. Tofu stew is my go-to item to order at any Korean restaurant, and the one at Soonja's was only so-so. The broth was very tasty, but I wish it came with a raw egg to crack into the stew. Also, I didn't like how they put cucumbers into it. I never tasted the bibimbap or bean paste tofu stew, but my friends both really liked them. I love the atmosphere of this place. It's very warm and friendly, and there are so many interesting pieces of artwork decorating the restaurant. Beware that the prices are on the expensive side--our dinner total for a group of 3 came out be $60 without tip. Also, the service is very attentive which is a definite plus. This place surpassed my expectations for Asian food in the Princeton area, and I will definitely be back again for some solid Korean food.
