Today at 3 we had a late lunch from here. It is only steps away from our place so worth a try. Let's do food first: chicken was crispy and moist. Very good, slightly salty. Mac and cheese was poor at best, mushy, no flavor and very "Stouffers". That being said we were very hungry so we ate it all, fried chicken far exceeded that side. Corn bread was delish, per my husband. The place: didn't look clean or inviting. Glad we did carry out.
