Sashimi bi bim bap was excellent, though quite expensive. There's nothing here really under $20; and Ã  la carte options are pricey. The atmosphere is pretty generic - aging Asian restaurant. Service was efficient, but brusque. It's worth trying at least once, however - as those who live on the other side of campus would likely never venture here.
