honestly, i've been to much better. and i don't have high standards for the brunch that i love. totally not worth the wait... - we had an assortment of dishes and their brunch food is nothing good or special... just expensive. - i am a french toast lover and this one sucked. too dry and not juicy. i can make better at home.... -_- +/- it looks nice inside but that's about it. i keep saying this, but really won't go back again.
