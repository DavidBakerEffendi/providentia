Hands down my favorite go-to restaurant in all of New York. I've had meals that may have blown my mind more than this place - but this may very well be my favorite NYC restaurant. We've been coming here for the last 5 years and the food is always amazing - they keep the menu fresh and try lots of new things. The place is romantic and comfortable and delicious. Although not cheap, if you navigate the menu well you'll get a stand out meal and not be crying about the bill. A regular spot I'm happy to keep coming back to. Do expect Williamsburg service (aka Hipster service) and they don't take reservations so you may be waiting a bit to get a table.
