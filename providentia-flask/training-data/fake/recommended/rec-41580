This past week I went to Frankford Hall for the first time. I was excited because I have heard such great things about the place. Walking in it was clear why everyone loves the atmosphere here-wide open, industrial style, beautiful space! The hostess was so friendly and helpful. She asked if we had ever been there and when we said no she took the time to show us where to order food, drinks and where the restrooms were. We were meeting a bunch of people who brought their kids with them and it turned out that it was a great spot to do so. Lots of activities-jenga (though beware, the pieces have not so friendly kid language on them as we learned), ping pong and foosball. Also, the outdoor space is amazing. Even in the cold weather it works-fires and lamp to keep warm.   Obviously, lots of great beer and German food. Unfortunately for me, there was not a lot of selection as I am a vegetarian. BUT, they do have a veggie burger, some salads, fries and other snacks that are veg friendly. I tend not to purchase veggie burgers when they are not house made as it seems sorta strange to pay for a frozen boca/morningstar burger I could throw in the oven at home. I chose the green and radish salad and a good strong beer. The salad was great-solid dressing and nice and simple, just what I was looking for. Until...I bit into a piece of bacon. Clearly, it was a mistake. There was no bacon listed in the ingredients on the board and it was one lonely piece. I have to say though I was pretty disappointed.  My husband had a bratwurst and fries and he seemed pleased though nothing to brag about. I recommend this place and will be back, though probably for beer and not food.
