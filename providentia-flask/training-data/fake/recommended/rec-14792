This is by far my favorite local bar in the city. I started coming here the week it opened and fell in love. I have been looking for a place with a variety of wing flavors and the moment I stumbled into Sto's and saw their menu I could help but go once a week! Tiff is who cooks all the food and not only is she an awesome person but her food is just as great. She is super friendly and willing to adjust to any food allergies! Chelsea and Riley are THE BEST bartenders there! They always know what drink I want and get it for me as soon as I walk in! They are always super friendly and make me feel welcome. Not to mention prices are unbeatable! A must go to bar!!!! Try the food!!!
