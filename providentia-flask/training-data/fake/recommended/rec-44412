Love this bar. Came here to watch the World Cup a few times and had an absolute blast. The drinks are well made and fairly priced. Good selection of drafts. The burger was really delicious too--more upscale bar food. The staff is attentive and really makes you feel welcomed. This bar also attracts a great crowd. Cant say enough nice things about Central Station! Their backyard area is awesome too.
