I have zero complaints. My brunch here was perfection! Â We got there around 2:45pm on Saturday, so the 2 of us were seated immediately. We had a private little nook/table in the back that was very private and romantic! I had sparkling sangria and he had a blood orange mimosa. We started with biscuits and marmalade. I had the corned beef hash and he had the french toast. We devoured everything. So, so good! Oh and the waitresses were very sweet and attentive. I love it.
