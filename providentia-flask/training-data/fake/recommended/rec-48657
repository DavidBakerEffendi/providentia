as good as the food is at El Camino Real, one of the best things about it is the wealth of outdoor seating. that's really probably one of the better things about the Liberty Walks/Piazza area in general - most of the restaurants have enough space for it. in the summer, especially when you're eating Mexican and/or BBQ, the best place to do it is outside. service was great and chill. we ordered fries and the bbq mixed plate to start, which gave me a nice preview of what my brisket would be like. the portion sizes were perfect - enough for me to leave some to take home, but not so much food that I ended up stuffing myself and feeling gross. I can't wait to go back and try out the mac and cheese and get some more of those fries!
