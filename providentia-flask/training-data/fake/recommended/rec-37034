I don't usually write reviews the day after I been to a place because I usually forget but this place kinda got me in a good way! Our main guy was Manny! He's a nice, cool and jolly guy! Great dude! My friend took me out to this place for my birthday and the place is pretty chill and its only a few blocks away from my home! We started off with drinks and one of which was the Lemon Ginger soda spiked with vodka - I think it was from the Brooklyn Soda Works. The other one was an Arno Palmer spiked with bourbon! Honestly, both of them were great! On to the entrée---- We both had two different chicken and waffles entrees. One of which is the maple spiced friend chicken with bacon cheddar waffles. - There were a lot of bacon bits in the waffle and it was actually really savory! The chicken was perfect because it wasn't that spicy but it also came with hot sauce so I spiced it up pretty well. I'd give my entrée an eight out of ten. My friend (she paid for everything =) thank you!!!) had the beer gravy chicken? I forgot the damn name!!!! ughh.. but all I know is that there were beer in either the chicken or the sauce! Her entrée was great too but I think mine topped it =) Sorry if you are reading this!! LOL Ohh ohhh!!! The waffles came with three different butters too but yes.. I forgot what it was called again.. DAMN IT!!! In the end we both ordered more drinks and we pretty much switched it up I had the soda spiked and she had the Arnold palmer spiked Meal came out to be a class 8.5/10!  Manny was great once again! =)
