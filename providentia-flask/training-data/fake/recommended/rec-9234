After flying in from SF and not being able to get to our hotel in midtown until a little after midnight, we dropped our bags in the room and headed off to Blue Ribbon.  Practically the only sense of life so late at night on Sullivan Street, this place was hopping. Our meal was very good, if not a bit over the top in some places: A plate of barbecue ribs was tasty and smoky, with the meat falling off the   bone.  A bit too sinewy in spots, though, which made for some chewing. Salt-and-Pepper Shrimp was also smoky goodness.  Four large shrimp - I think they were jumbo freshwaters - adorned our plate, and were just perfectly done. 1/2 dozen oysters: We normally do not order oysters like this, but they were fresh, sweet and tender. Corn chowder: A very pungent blend of corn and potatoes in a rich broth.  Very good, with grilled bread and a cob of corn.  A bit excessive, though, and very filling.  Enough to stop us from indulging on dessert, which is really saying something! Blue Ribbon is definitely a place that I'd love to have in my neighborhood.  And I'd go there often too if my internet fortune ever materialized.  Alas, reality dictates that it is a place for extremely special occasions.
