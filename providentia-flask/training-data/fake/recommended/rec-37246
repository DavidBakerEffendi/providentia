Not what it used to be! Went for a special Saturday birthday; many of us left disappointed. The old bottle of olive oils no longer adorn the tables. The chicken liver app came out looking like soup; floating in sugary sweet brown broth the fried pieces were soggy and wayyyyy too sweet. Passed around the table everyone made a face -  best comment was "no respect for the ingredient". Two ribeye steak "specials" ordered identically came out looking completely different; one had a decent sear and looked ok, the other was a floppy gray color and lacked that tasty crusted "Maillard" flavor a good steak should have. The crusted salmon had crumbs described as "stale". Clams over linguini lacked garlic punch.  Only the lamb rack drew the normal Luigi glowing review. Service was (amazingly!) poor. It the MANY times I've dined there that's a first. Our waitress started out messing up a drink order, returned a few times and then was never seen again. For the rest of the meal we were tag-teamed by several gentlemen. If they switched waitstaff no one had the courtesy of telling us. BTW Luigi himself was not in attendance. Wonder if that''s why the level of care was so far down.
