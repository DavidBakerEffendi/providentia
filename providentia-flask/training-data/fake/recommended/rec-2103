To my dearest Penelope, the faithful wife of Odysseus, I will walk in your footsteps and remain ever so faithful to your humble abode on Lex.   No matter how many restaurants catch my eye, my faithfulness will remain and I will continue to wait patiently for a table simply to be in your presence. Because....YOU ROCK! Each time I eat here I feel compelled to push my chair out and give a standing ovation to the chef.  I always imagine that I'm Penelope and it's my long lost love Odysseus in the kitchen sweating over a hot fire and cooking that perfect meal just for me, but then I look around and see many other satisfied Penelopes' probably thinking the exact same thing. Just so you know, next time I visit you, I'll barge into the kitchen, rip that apron off your perfectly proportioned bod and we'll run hand in hand into the distance, where we'll live happily ever after.....under one condition - if, and only if, you continue cooking me that perfect omelette each morning accompanied by a large freshly squeezed OJ and a pretty smelling flower to place behind my ear. After all I am Penelope.
