I had a great dinner at Aita, following a drink at their sister cocktail lounge The Mayflower Social. We sat at the bar to avoid a bit of a wait. Ordered a bottle of Italian wine that the bartender recommended and gave us a taste of since they were also selling this wine by the glass. We ordered the vegetables fritto misto and the sautéed chicken livers as appetizers. The vegetable appetizer is quite big and consists of fried shavings of various vegetables with a yogurt and lemon sauce. It was excellent. The sautéed chicken livers surprised me: they were nicely sautéed with small pearl onions, potatoes, bacon bits and tasted amazing. For entrees, we ordered the swordfish entree (plat du jour) with potato gnocchi and the rib-eye. Both tasted really good and we finished every bit of it, in spite of the portions being quite large. If I had to criticize one thing, it would be the french fries. They were fried potato chips, really. Literally battered and fried chips of potatoes. They tasted good but were a bit dry and chalky. Everything else was fantastic. I'd go back in a heartbeat, let alone to try the dessert menu, which I wasn't able to sample the last time.
