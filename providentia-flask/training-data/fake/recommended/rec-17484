I absolutely love this place I have been going consistently this past year and it never fails me. I love that it's byob and I love the people who work here. They always know what I want and suggest some pretty great specials.. They are celebrating their anniversary so go and grab there 20% off cards and bring a group when you do. The lomo is outstanding and being peruvian I have had my fair share of all types from.different restaurants. I highly recommend Sabor Peru! Added note:  Went here this past Sunday and they have a special called Sangria Sundays which is FREE sangria all day!  For our appetizer we ordered the papa rellena again because it was really good the first time (there's this sauce that is super spicy but so tasty).  Also ordered a dish that we shared and it was called the Taste of Lima.  This dish consisted of Lomo Saltado, Chaufa, and a peruvian beef lo mein.  Absolutely amazing.  You can order this for yourself alone, but unless you're a heavy weight eater I highly doubt you can eat this without help or taking it home.
