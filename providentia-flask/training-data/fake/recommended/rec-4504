Very attentive wait staff with limited knowledge of the English language.  Ingredients in the Shabu Shabu were very fresh (including the perfectly marbleized beef).  Although, we much preferred the Sukiyaki; mostly due to their very-tasty-not-too-salty Sukiyaki sauce.  Getting the Tamagoyaki for appy was a mistake.  It may have been good for what it is (I don't know), but it just tasted like sweet eggs in the shape of butter. I hate green tea, but their green tea ice cream was phenomenal.  A must try.
