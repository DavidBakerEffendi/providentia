We went for an early dinner here last week and were immediately seated (it wasn't empty, but not very busy either). The server brought us freshly made tortilla chips with the red salsa which was extremely flavorful. The green salsa is spicy but also delicious. My boyfriend order Enchiladas and couldn't finish ( we wished we hadn't filled up on the crisps!!) and I ordered the Mexican Quesadillas, vegetarian. It was simply the best tasting, non mass-produced, fresh food. We both had leftovers for the next day like everyone else. I strongly recommend this place. It is no-frills but extremely relaxed and down-to-earth. I am sure we will go again.
