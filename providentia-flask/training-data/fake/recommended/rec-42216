Quickly i would like to say, I had dinner on Friday night and between my friend and I we ordered fried calamaris, bone marrow, sushi, and fish. I have to say the food there is exquisite! I didn't tell my server that I like my fish to be cooked a certain way and it was cooked well. This was my fault. I was unable to eat my dish, and the owner Shawn came up to my table and said that he noticed i didn't touch my fish, i told him it was a bit overcooked, and he kindly took it off our tab. (YES i was a bit embarrassed because i did not expect that at all) he was very kind to offer that. Overall the service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, and gracious, throughout our dinner someone else asked how was everything. I am definitely going back not only because the food is exquisite and worth every dollar, its also nice going out to a restaurant and having excellent service.! thank you staff and owners for making my experience at your establishment a great one! Extremely impressed!
