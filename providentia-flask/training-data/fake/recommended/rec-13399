There are no words that describe how amazing this place is. The shawerma is AMAZING. This is about as close as it gets to the shawerma places at home. The white sauce is to die for. By far my favorite place to eat in NYC, went here twice. Only draw back, they don't open till late night. Also, LONG LINES!!! Be prepared to wait an hour on a nice night, drawback to most popular NYC places.
