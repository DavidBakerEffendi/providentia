MY OH MY! I can't wait to tell everyone I know about this place! Found Jimmy's on Yelp and decided to take a shot in the dark (based on the good yelp reviews, of course). We arrived around 9am on a Tuesday so we were able to sit down right away. I wouldnt recommend coming here during peak hours since it's so small and it's a guranteed LONG wait, I'm sure. The waiter was a very nice guy and made us feel comfortable right away. I ordered the chicken and waffles and I can honestly say I think it made stars and rainbows shoot out of my body. The waffle was perfect, the fried chicken was perfect and the country gravy along with the maple syrup took this dish over the top. I was in a complete food daze. My man got the BLT and it was also outstanding! You might not think a BLT could be anything special but Jimmy's found a way to make it amazing! The bacon is thick and they serve it with chipotle mayo. So good! I am so happy I found this place and I will be bouncing off the walls when it's time to go back!
