Went there on a Groupon.  I found the place dark and dingy.  The table at the booth was actually sticky with grime.  The plates looked so worn and dingy that they did not present well at all.  We were the only couple in the place.  I did not care for my food at all.  It was sloppy and unremarkable.  The rug looked dirty.  One can only imagine what the kitchen looked like.  Everything seemed to be grossing me out.  To be fair, my husband liked his food, but I have to be honest about my opinion and not recommend this place at all.  There are other much better Mexican restaurants.
