Always enjoyed the food here. Being a brick oven pizza, slices have a crispy crust and a nice smokey taste. For those that are complaining about the prices, they are mildly competitive (it's Montclair) and the slices are large. I have always enjoyed the selections they have to offer. It is hard to find a good chicken parm slice but this place has it. Seating is offered outside as well as inside. Tip: try the deep dish. I will definitely be back.
