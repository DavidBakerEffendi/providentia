This is one of those times where I really wish there was a half star system simply because 4 stars currently I think is a little high for this place but 3 stars I feel is a tad low, but I don't want to give them more credit than they deserve. This place definetly reminds me of the gingerman which is a place I love with both its beer menu(including the exact set up of the beer menu) and the beautiful long wooden bar and dark romantic atmosphere but as far as the food they've got a little ways to go. (Apparently they are affiliated so the resemblance makes sense) Ordered a special eggplant sandwich and they didn't give me the top piece of bread but I didn't say anything cuz I figured I didn't need the extra bread but I ordered a salad instead of fries and I got fries....and it took me eating my entire meal to eventually get a small side salad the would take 2 minutes to make. Â  The staff was friendly and no problem there. Didn't have many of the beers on the menu bc they apparently had just changed taps or something but that was aggrivating after ordering three beers they didn't have. All in all this place has room to improve and I will be going back its definetly got potential and I would suggest going here to anyone.
