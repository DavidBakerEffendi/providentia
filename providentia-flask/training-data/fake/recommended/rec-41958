Had an awesome birthday dinner here. Great lighting and perfect ambiance and Antonio our waiter made everything even better!! We loved everything we ate from the antipasta app to the mushroom tagliatelle and short ribs and beet ravioli to the creamy tiramisu. My sister found the squid ink risotto to be a little heavy though. All in all would highly recommend this byob!!
