Tonight, I learned first hand that this is THE place to bump into friends.  I've been twice and both times, I've run into a familiar face.  And for that, this place has a place in my heart. Anyhow, my date and I wanted a little munch before our 8pm show and thus, thinking Thai would be good (and drinks would be good too!), we popped in.  First, the service is efficient and so is the bartender and kitchen.  The price is a bit higher than other locations but the food and the atmosphere more than makes up for it.  The spicy squid ink spaghetti was delicious and the zoad zeed was a wonderful drink to have.  But then again, I've had a weakness for salted rims for a bit (yum!) Try this place out!
