Alberto's is pretty cool. The place is small but the food is good. Alberto is very friendly. He greets everyone he sees, talks to everyone when he can and never an attitude. He's been around for many years although his business is still young. Ordering a pie doesn't take long at all. On average 15 to 20 minutes. Check this place out if you're in the area.
