DID YOU SAY "BRUNCH"?! Ok it's been a while... since my last review. This place is a must. No questions. Service: Brandon the hustler. Not only did he make us feel welcome, but he moved with ease & grace through the crowded tables, picking up checks, taking orders & refilling coffee cup, and all with a smile. As a Brooklyn native (yup, not a transplant but born & raised in Brooklyn, NY) I can honestly say there is NO place in NYC from the Upper West Side to New Hyde Park Queens to Riverdale that has a Brandon. Food: Delicious, comforting "Oh My Goodness" "I feel good" food! You cannot go wrong, meat lovers meet vegans type of place. It's the ying & yang of brunch. Place: Small, crowded & clean... Typical NYC spot, but clean. Go clean place!!! Thank you for your great service, food & place.
