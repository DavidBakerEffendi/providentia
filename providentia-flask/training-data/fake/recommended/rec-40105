Great place to refuel when walking about the historic sites in Philadelphia. Tasty comfort food like grilled cheese, tomato soup, and sweet potato fries. Refreshing brews, lots to choose from too. French onion soup was hot, well seasoned and the cheese was bubbly. Very cool decor, church pews serve as booths and stained glass windows add ambiance. Service was friendly and attentive. This seems like a place I would frequent if I was a local.
