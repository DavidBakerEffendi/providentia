Belgian beers and Mexican food just don't meld very well here. I hated the cramped seating area in the back of the first floor. Weirdly, to get to the bathroom, you need to go out the "Exit" door in back, and then up three flights of stairs. Jose Pistolas is just a little bizarro, and not in a particularly good way.
