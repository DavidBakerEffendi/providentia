Went here for brunch on Saturday with a few gf's around 2:30. Pretty quiet scene, but the food was excellent! Their biscuits and gravy are made in-house and probably the best I've had in the East Village. The hostess is very attentive, as was the wait staff. Ordered Kale Salad and The Pear and Arugula Salad between us, as well as the sticky buns and a bowl of french fries. Salads were great, portions were big enough that we did not leave hungry. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood, and worth a try if you're looking for something new and decently priced!
