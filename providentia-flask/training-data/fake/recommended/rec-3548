Came here yesterday. Staff was pleasant. The drinks and food are reasonably priced, (drinks are between 5-10) dinner ranges from 10-19. While reading the menu, I noticed they had a dish to which their disclaimer read "this dish is spicy and will not be changed to suit American tastes." I think they should write this a little better in their menu, i wasnt feeling their approach for you to try the dish. Â I had the mango lemongrass chicken whch was good except the vegetables were too spicy, but they used boneless skinless chicken which i was happy with. I do have to be a little Gordon Ramsey and say my food was on a chipped plate and my plate was not stable on the table. Their decor is very nice they have a big chandelier in the middle, and the tables have enough space so you dont feel like youre on top of the other party. its a decent spot for a night out with friends.
