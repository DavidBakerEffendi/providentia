My boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner on a Thursday night.  We came in at around 8 with no reservation, there was no wait, we were seated immediately.  We sat by the window and the tables were really small.  There was another table dining next to us and I felt like I was going to elbow the person next to me if I moved too much (had to take away one star for that). We ordered the trout tartare and the octopus to start.  Both were excellent and delicious.  The tartare came with fried fish skin and it was delicious, the octopus was on point too, pretty much grilled to perfection! For the main course I opted for the fluke and my boyfriend had the duck pasta.  My fluke came with spaghetti squash and the duck pasta had a raw egg in it.  Again, both were fantastic. Overall, we had a really good time.  The service was great.  Definitely coming back again.
