I visited the Nolita hot spot for Brunch one Saturday afternoon. A thirty minute wait was lightened by the offer to sit at the bar until a table opened up. To get started, I ordered the Public Mary, Public's version of the Bloody Mary. It is not listed on the drink menu of their website, and I can't say I blame them. It was the best Bloody Mary I ever had, a refreshing take on the classic cocktail. Drinks for my meal included my staple Caf√© au Lait and the Passionfruit and Orange Bellini, also very nice. I ordered 2 fried eggs on English Toast, which came with spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I also ordered a side of hollandaise sauce because I heard good things about it. When the food arrived, I was disappointed. I quickly realized I had ordered the wrong dish. I could have easily executed the meal myself, and I make much better fried eggs. The hollandaise sauce was good, but I was so disappointed with the rest of my meal that I barely noticed. The space was bright with high ceilings and mirrors along one wall, giving the appearance you were dining in a place much larger than it was. If you were to walk past the bar, you would come to the Monday Room, a small space with lounge seating, meant to enjoy cocktails or perhaps a muffin. The bathroom had free bars of soap for the taking featuring the Public logo. In the center of the restaurant was a small table with different types of bread and muffins. If you wanted one, you simply paid for it with your meal. There were 2 larger spaces enclosed in wine bottles that were shut off by a sheer curtain. My guess is they are reserved for larger parties over 10 or for a fee. Despite my meal leaving something to be desired, I would be open to going back for dinner or perhaps Brunch, if nothing else but to have the Public Mary grace my lips again. If I do go for Brunch, I guarantee I will not order the same dish.
