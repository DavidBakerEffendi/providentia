282, I hate you.. and I love you at the same time. I'm a pretty hefty eater and I can easily demolish two of these burgers. You hurt my wallet.. but god dammit the burger is amazing. The beef is amazingly fresh, there is something absolutely magical about the freshness of their burger meat that NO PLACE has ever been able to replicate. I usually get the Breakfast Burger as my usual but I've tried the 282 Burger and the Billy Burger which are both decent.You'd be surprised that their greek fries are pretty good too. 282 is better than Shake Shack which is better than Five Guys. All of which are around the general area. If you need a burger joint.. go to 282.
