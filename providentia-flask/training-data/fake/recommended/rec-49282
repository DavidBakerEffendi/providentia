I don't really understand some of the rave reviews. The food is mediocre and spotty, and the service is almost always rude. If you are looking for inexpensive Chinese or Thai food, go to Basil. It's right around the corner from Ivy Noodle, has similar prices, the food is better, and the workers are MUCH more polite. I only go to Ivy Noodle when I'm in a group or most other places are closed. My first bad experience was when I ate at the bar. When leaving, one of the workers (who I had not previously encountered) yelled, "TIP?!" at me and banged on the bar (I had bought a $5 soup). As a general rule of thumb, food carts and places where you sit at a bar to eat don't usually require a tip because you don't have any waiter. I was so shocked that I left $1 but immediately regretted it (why am I giving them money to treat me like a dog?). Can you seriously get any ruder? If it's customary to tip at the bar, just tell me, don't act like a maniac. I usually order the green vegetable noodle soup which comes with tofu. I always tell them I want vegetable broth. On one occasion, the waiter brought me the soup with chicken broth and then argued with me that that is what I had ordered. Another time I was trying to figure out what was different about the soup and then realized they hadn't put any tofu in it, so that it was just noodles, a few vegetables, and broth. The main problem is that the waiters don't pay attention when you are making an order and can get very rude. When I say "Can I have the green vegetable noodle soup with vegetable broth?" and you are not even looking at me while I'm ordering, it's no surprise you get it wrong. Only go to Ivy Noodle as a last resort. It's a roll of the dice coming here. Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it's not. Sometimes you get a polite (or at least indifferent) waiter, sometimes you get an extremely rude one. I'd rather give my money to restaurants that are capable of basic manners.
