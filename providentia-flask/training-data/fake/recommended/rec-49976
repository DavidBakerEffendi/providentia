Oh man, all I can say is WOW! This is literally the closest you can find to the original platters in NYC. The platter was DELICIOUS and the hot sauce was actually hot... Usually most hot sauces aren't even hot so it was refreshing to see someone doing it right. I got the mixed platter along with a lamb kati roll. The platter was amazing but the lamb kati roll was okay nothing special. The lamb in the kati roll was just okay so it wasnt as great as I had expected but maybe im just being picky. My friend got the chicken tikka kati roll and he really liked it. I will deff be going back. Glad to find a place that does platters and actually does it right.
