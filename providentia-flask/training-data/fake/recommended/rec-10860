Excellent lobster roll, for $15 you can't ask for much more. The lobster was definitely fresh. Better yet, there is a Red Hook Lobster Pound truck that patrols the city if you follow it on twitter. This place offers Maine style (who would order anything else) or Connecticut style which is essentially warmer. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the relatively small size in relation to the other great lobster rolls that you can get in the city, but once again you get what you pay for. I'm a fan.
