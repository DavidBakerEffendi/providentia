this may be my favorite sandwich.  Sure Pat's & Geno's is THE philly thing to do and everyone should do it at least once.  But the roast pork with provolone and brocolli rabe is one of the tastiest sandwiches I have ever had.  I did myself a favor and ate half of it last night for dinner and saved the other half for lunch today...it's such a nice treat to have that other half the next day.  I do need to remember to add the hot peppers one of these times, but if i don't...i'm still happy with it as is...
