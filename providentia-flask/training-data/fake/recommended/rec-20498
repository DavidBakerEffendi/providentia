this is a very small restaurant located on Spring St. very few tables and family owned. never had afghan food but i love indian and thought it would be similar. i always get the lamb or chicken korma and it is delicious! the aroma and the taste! the lamb is tender and u can distinctly taste every spice they put in it .. the prices are reasonable - you will get rice, korma, and a salad for $8! not bad. i love the dressing for the salad. its creamy and lemon-y. i wonder what it is exactly so that i buy it or make it myself. my first visit there, the owner was really nice and offered us this pudding they make, on the house. not too much of a sweets fan but this was good. this also had an aroma (a good one lol) Â but i cant quite place my finger on it. this is gonna bother me til i figure it out lol. love this place!
