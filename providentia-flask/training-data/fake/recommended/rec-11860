I get it. At 2am, this stuff makes great drunk food. At 12pm, for $6, this stuff makes a cheap, copious lunch. But earth-shattering or life-changing? Not really. The line goes pretty quickly - I probably waited for 15 minutes max. Yes, the lamb/chicken combo is the way to go -- you get a heaping ladle of tender chicken and diced lamb over orange rice, some lettuce leaves, and a few slices of pita. Covered in white sauce and hot sauce (if you so choose). For all you control freaks out there, they have little containers of both sauces already filled up and ready to go, so you can get them on the side in a hurry. I like to think that I'm a very adventurous eater, but I'm generally skeptical about street food. The good thing about this place is that I didn't even give it a thought as I devoured my meal. Yes, it was really delicious comfort food. On a colder, rainy day, it filled my belly and put a smile on my face. Mixed all together, the white sauce and the hot sauce definitely complete the dish. Yes, the hot sauce is good. The white sauce is nothing to write home about. Together, they work. But it's not like this is gourmet sauce here - there are no complex flavors, no intriguing undertones. Like I said, it didn't change my life. If it were a little healthier (and the wait were shorter), I would add it to my lunch rotation -- but alas, it will have to be an infrequent indulgence.
