the lobster hummus.   kale salad was alright...it was interesting. the dandelion dish was recommended by both the host and waitress but it was less interesting than the above mentioned.  Just tasted like sauteed greens. I will return!  My date and I were grazing lightly.  The other entrees and the desserts look incredibly alluring.  i could tell from the few dishes we got that the chef means business about the cuisine.
