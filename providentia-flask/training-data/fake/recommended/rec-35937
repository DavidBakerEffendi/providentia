Went to Balthazar for brunch ! We went around 11 am (without reservation) and were able to walk right in with no wait.. Though when we were leaving just past noon - there was a queue. So make reservations if you can ! + service is awesome : you never have an empty glass of water, whatever you need the servers deliver straight away + food is awesome : I had the fettuccine - the shrimp was well cooked and juicy, the Spinach was rich and nicely flavored. Husband went for the chicken pillard - the chicken well cooked and the tomatoes made it nice and juicy - it is a little bit pricy ; total bill with 2 main courses and coffee (inc tip and tax) was 80 bucks .. Though would highly recommend to try out !
