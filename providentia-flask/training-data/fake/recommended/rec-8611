Since my last review I have stopped here several times for lunch before my evening classes. Service has been top notch and they definitely deserve all the stars in this review. However, I bumped it down one star from my previous review because of the quality of food. The fries are a bit darker than they should be and are definitely overcooked each time. The meat itself is sometimes dry and overcooked, but the staff is good when it comes to specific requests. For instance, hubby hates his buns toasted (and I LOOOVE my buns toasty). The shakes are probably the best item to get, at least for me. I still love Mooyah and will come now and then, but I might have to start requesting my patty to be cooked medium. I understand they cook food to well-done stage due to health reasons. But still, a lot better choice than any McDonald's.
