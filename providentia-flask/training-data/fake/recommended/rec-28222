+ Egg salad elevated to superbomb wow-factor flavored mouthgasm + Covered patio seating for sunny summer days + Attentive, friendly service + Fancy pants meats/charcuterie on the menu Egg salad is normal homey whatevers plebeian fare. But the TRUFFLE EGG SALAD & SPECK CROSTINI at Il Bambino transcends anything normal and is like crack on a cracker (crostini). The truffle oil and the speck elevate the mortal egg salad into Herculean egg salad. Incredibly, unsuspectingly rich. You. Must. Get. This. Oh and the paninis. Ordered the FRIED EGGPLANT PANINI and added italian sausage to it because I need my meat to feel complete. SUPER BOMB. So rich. So flavorful. The roasted mushrooms, spicy mayo and goat cheese inside it take it to another level altogether. The bread was perfectly pressed and toasted. Don't be too greedy here and order too much - everything is so dang rich that sharing is a must. For two very hungry and normally greedy monsters we ordered just the egg salad crostini and one panini and it was more than plenty. Sit out on the patio in the summertime. It's charmingly covered so it's cool enough to sit outside even on the hottest of humid NY days.
