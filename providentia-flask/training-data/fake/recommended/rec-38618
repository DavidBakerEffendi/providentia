I went to Givinda's for the first time last night, after hearing nothing but good things. I am a vegan and couldnt wait to try this "amazing" chicken cheese steak. First of all, the people who came after me got their food before me. AND, there was a thumbtack stuck in my sandwich. Thank god i didnt eat it!, the people were not very nice at the counter and gave me exact change back, (8.95) with a measely "sorry bout that". Safe to say I will never risk the chance of eating there again, Ill make my own cheesesteak
