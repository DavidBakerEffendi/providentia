Two words: truffle fries. They are the best and my girlfriend orders at least two orders when we come. I wish they place took reservations. There was a hype when this restaurant first opened and its still great every time I come. They offer a few beer selections. The staff is not always attentive when the crowd picks up. The burgers are always good. I recommend the truffle burger. The wait, though it may be long, is definitely worth it. Be prepared on a Friday night.
