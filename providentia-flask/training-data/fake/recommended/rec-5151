Couldn't be happier this restaurant came to Brooklyn AND brought another Elbow Room location with it..  I get cravings for Mac more all the time, and if Barclays isn't open, I.can't.get.in. Sunday Funday brunch brought me into Morgans.  When I saw free bird chicken and waffles on the menu, it was love at first sight. I am talking buttermilk fried chicken so good it transports you out of Brooklyn to the deep south. Add a side of Mac and nothing had a chance on my plate. My friend got the breakfast burrito, thankfully, so I was allowed to sample that as well delish. Adding fresh salsa and avocado to brisket was genius . It will be hard to resist the fried chicken, but looking at other tables around me and reading other yelper reviews I am going to have to go for the pulled pork.
