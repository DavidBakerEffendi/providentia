The food is inconsistent. Sometimes the food is delivered hot and delicious. Sometimes the order is wrong. Sometimes you order a sandwich and there are two slices of eggplant or cold cut meat...its all bread. Also, sometimes the food is very bland. The only thing that is always good is the pizza. They are a bit pricey for a pizzeria and the delivery charge turns me off but they are the best of the worst in town. There is parking in the rear but you must walk between two buildings to get to the front door and it doesn't look safe.
