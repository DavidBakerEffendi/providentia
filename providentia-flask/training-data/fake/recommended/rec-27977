Do not go here if you want fresh hard shell crabs.  Tried  it a couple of Saturdays agao and sent the first order back and the second order.  They had been sitting around, not fresh.  You can tell hen crabs have been sitting round if you have to use a chisel to get the meat out!!  Not sure about the rest of the good but there are much better places for FRESH crabs.
