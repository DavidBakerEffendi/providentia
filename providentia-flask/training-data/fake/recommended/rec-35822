I came here expecting big things at 2 am last night. This review is a little biased because I'm more of a pizza or shawarma type of guy when it comes to drunk food and this is no doubt the best time to come to Pomme Frites. The fries are pretty delicious but fries are still fries and I'm not sure if the sauce can even make this up. We had the mango chutney mayo sauce. It was decent but I wasn't WOWed like people hyped it up to be. I might go back if I'm with a group of people but not by myself. This place is good but in my opinion did not live up to the hype.
