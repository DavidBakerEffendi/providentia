I love paninis so this is one of my favorite places. Whenever I'm in the mood its between this place and press 195 in bayside.  The paninis here are a little more alternative though so if I'm in the mood for change or italian style, I'll come here.  Also recently got the crostini which is a great choice and they have so many options. Would definitely go back on a monday night for the wine discount and to sit outside!
