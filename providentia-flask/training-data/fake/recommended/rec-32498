Definite "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" especially for Connecticut. I grew up on the beef and shrimp pho from here, and just recently my parents discovered their miga on Sundays -- amazing! Though it's funny how each of the three times I've been so far, it's always slightly different in which type of noodle it comes with or the amount of chicken and fried pork rinds. But it's probably because the miga runs out fast and is usually sold out well before noon on Sunday. 5 stars for 501!
