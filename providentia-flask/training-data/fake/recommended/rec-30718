We arrived at Cookshop on Thursday night a hair before our 6:30 reservation time, and were ushered promptly to our table --- where we sat, and sat, and sat for close to 20 minutes without so much as a "can I get you a drink?" Gadzooks. We finally flagged down a waiter and inquired, diplomatically we hoped, if perhaps we'd been seated without the host letting our server know...? (Waiter stage directions: Mumble, stammmer... slink away.) Gosh, would "Oh, sorry! I'd be happy to get you a drink while we sort out who will help you" be too much to ask? As we scanned the wine list, a strange pattern emerged. Seeing as Cookshop trades heavily on its locavore cred, we were suprised both by the absence of New York wines --- is a single Finger Lakes Reisling all one can expect amid a sea of Italian and French bottles? --- and the relative scarcity of American vintages at all. The best part of our meal was a plate of fried hominy we ordered to nibble with drinks: Golden-crisp, dusted in salt and tinged with just a hint of lime. Oh my-my! Gorgeous pork --- a small chop and a big sausage --- was burdened by undercooked black beans and an odd, sweet pineapple relish. The saddest part, though, was our inedible finale: a pair of sorbets --- banana thyme and ginger pear --- that were grainy, gluey, and not the least bit tasty. (And bear in mind, ginger + pear = delicious, in my book.) We took one bite of each, screwed up our faces, and left the rest to melt. When our waiter asked what was wrong, we told him that not only were the textures quite un-sorbet-like and the flavors beyond bizarre, but both scoops had the gummy texture of dessert left too long in the freezer. He told us that simply couldn't be the case, and brought the check. With the sorbet on it, of course.
