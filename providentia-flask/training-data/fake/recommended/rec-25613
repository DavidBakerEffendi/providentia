My boyfriend's friend wanted to celebrate his birthday here and had made reservations for several people, but when we arrived, they said our party was too large and that the hostess taking the reservation was new as they didn't take reservations of our size and past a certain time. Well, no worries, I understand that people make mistakes first time on the job, and we ended up getting seated anyways. I made the mistake of ordering the veggie burger with yuca fries and got horrible food poisoning later that night that confined me to a bed for a week. No thanks. Won't be back.
