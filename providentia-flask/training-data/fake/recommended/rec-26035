We came trudging in here from a nasty rainy day for brunch last Saturday. I was not totally impressed by the menu initially - it seemed a bit brief and nothing totally stood out - but we were super hungry and I was tired of looking for brunch elsewhere. The place was super cozy and pleasant, if a bit labyrinthine, and I finally decided on the egg biscuit while my boyfriend went with the burger. Our food came quickly and I was very happy to see and devour an oversized buttery biscuit with perfectly soft eggs and lovely cheddar and ham (this was definitely a knife and fork sandwich). The side salad had a delicious tart and shallotty dressing. My boyfriends burger was beautiful and also super delicious. I'm happy to report that this is one cutesy brooklyn place that doesn't skimp on the portions! halleluya! I left stuffed and ready for a nap. Definitely not a light meal in any way and both meals couldve been a bit less greasy, but totally satisfying.
