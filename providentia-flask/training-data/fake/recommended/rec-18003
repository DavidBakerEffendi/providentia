We bring our kids here (they are all under the age of 10) and introduced them to Indian cuisine.  It is now one of their favorite places, thanks to the wonderfully hospitable staff, the amritsari fish (glorious texture), mango lassi, chicken tikka masala, naan and paratha, saag paneer.  I love it because I routinely encounter whole chiles, cardamom pods, anise seed, bits of cinnamon, which account for the way the flavors are so lively within the food. So different from when restaurants do the cheap easy thing with mass produced powdered spices.  The lentils are amazing and really, you should try items off the Sino-Indian portion of the menu to sample some real global fusion.  Chinese food travels everywhere and adapts to the places it ends up. Here's a chance to see how it manifested in India and travelled to America.
