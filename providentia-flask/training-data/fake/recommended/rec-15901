Okay, so I am writing my first Yelp review because I am an avid user of the site and have it found extrememely helpful in choosing restaurants in NYC.  So on to Uva... First and foremost, my fiancee and I live in the UES and we are always looking for local eateries.  For a while, I had seen this restaurant on Yelp.  The reviews were so positive that I felt a compulsion to go.  My fiancee and I made reservations for Saturday night at 8pm.  We essentially walked right in and got a table without even mentioning our reservation.  First impressions were very good...terrific atmosphere and youthful crowd.   As for the food, well it was out of this world.  We had the prosciutto and mozzarella (excellent) and the rosemary and oil focaccia.  A very nice, light appetizer to enjoy.  For dinner, I had eyed the cavatelli with pesto.  Let me tell you that it was excellent.  Fresh, hot, delicious! My fiancee and I also enjoy a bottle of wine which was very good!  The mousee dessert was a perfect end to a great evening. I am giving Uva less than 5 stars for two reasons: first, the menu options are rather complex and it is hard to find a simple dish.  Second, this restaurant is given $$ on Yelp, but the prices are realtively high.
