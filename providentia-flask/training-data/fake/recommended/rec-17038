Sometimes, you just want a good hot dogs. I road up on one of those times and did some research while working in Clifton. I found Rutt's Hut and everyone said it was a staple. :-| Staple in New Jersey is used too damn loosely. Seriously. I appreciate when I see places make their own condiments, so I wanted to get a regular ripper with relish and one with mustard. This was a regular ass hot dog. The relish didn't jump out like I expected. The mustard lacked seasoning, big time. I also got the onion things. I can't call them rings because they were at the bottom of the bag Â sort of oil slicked. They tasted of cornmeal, nothing more. The only thing I appreciated was the crunchiness of the dog. Everything else needed help.
