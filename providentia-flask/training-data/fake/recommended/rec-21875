This is hands-down the worst "restaurant" in Brooklyn. After witnessing the crowds for years (and thinking it must be good) we finally tried it. Wow, what a disappointment. I get that people don't go here to eat- they go here to drink. But seriously. How hard is it to make good burritos and salads? My salad: wilted lettuce and dry chicken. The type of over-priced, under-quality food you might get in an airport. And the eco-friendly aspect is really an exaggeration. Habana uses all disposable (although some of it is recyclable) plates and utensils. With the ever-growing variety of good restaurants coming to the area, why people choose to go to Habana Outpost is a mystery. oh yeah, it's THE SCENE.
