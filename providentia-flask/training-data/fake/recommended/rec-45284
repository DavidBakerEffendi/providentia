The food was delicious. It was a fixed price menu of $95 on new years eve. We arrived hungry  and left hungry. One mini ravioli,  four  mini carrots, one small but delicious short rib. Also five tiny raw scallops which I don't eat. They were nice enough to substitute roasted cauliflower which was also delicious but not enough. Very disappointing for the price. I've had larger appetizers.
