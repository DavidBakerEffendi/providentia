Kefi was fine.  Their hummus and pita side was good.  The Kefi Salad was normal and my vegetarian souvlaki was solid.  Nothing was especially inspiring, but nothing was bad.  The service was good.  We told them that we were in a rush to make Shakespeare in the Park and they were super attentive and responsive, and just generally kind.  I won't be rushing back any time soon, but I wouldn't refuse to go back, if that makes sense.
