It's a small place, so make sure you make a reservation. The service is fantastic and the food is perfect. It's got a great open kitchen type of feel, but the dividing wall is high enough that the restaurant doesn't get smelly, hot, or smokey. Literally everything we ate was fantastic. A little pricey, but it's New York and an extremely nice evening out.
