You may feel like you're in a Keith McNally establishment but you're not, and it's MUCH LOUDER.  Bathroom stalls with private speakers and mirrors, photo booth available and delicious oysters and wine.  I'll definitely be back to try dinner.  Seriously LOUD music in here, though, so probably not for any sort of intimate moment.
