Highly recommend lily house by far one of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten in the surrounding area. Definitely a go to spot to have your taste buds put right to sleep. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken with shrimp fried rice and surprisingly the food was not greasy...We all know how Chinese food could be greasy. Found our go to Chinese food spot and it isn't in China !
