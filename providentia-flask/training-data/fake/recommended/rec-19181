HUGE drink menu. Tons of beer to choose from. They also had ciders and bourbons. They have a "6 pack" where you can combine 6 beers, they bring it in a bucket and the 6th one is free. Great bbq options. I had the pulled pork, and it was a great portion size. My friend had the brisket, and it was a little smaller. Three different BBQ sauces they bring to the table in the cutest little bottles for you to choose to put on your BBQ. Came in at 530ish on a Friday, and didn't have trouble sitting down right away.
