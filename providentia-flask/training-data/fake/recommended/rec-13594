I do really like this place.. The lychee sangria is to die for.. It tastes essentially like really yummy kicked up lychee juice.. The ambiance of the place is great; albeit the space is a little small.. Their house pad thai is completely different than any other pad thai you've ever had.. I also got their duck entree once which was pretty good.. This is a great place to bring friends.. I wouldn't say the food is phenomenal but given the decor, the prices, and the pretty decent grub.. I would give this place two very high thumbs up :) This is about as different and as hip as Thai food can get..
