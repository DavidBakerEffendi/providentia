I didn't think I can write more about this place because it seems like everyone else has already. I think I am slowly down on my writing and I do want to keep up my so-called "beast mode." ^_^ Pomme Frites meaning "potato chips" or French fries as we would call it is the only thing this store sells. Lines are always long and people are always willing to wait. It's a small location but according to my friend, this place has been opened forever and people know about it from word-of-mouth. Upon tasting these fries, I admit that there is nothing really special about the fries aside from their great selection of sauces. I only eat my fries with ketchup so I guess that really defeats the purpose of me coming here, no? :-D But I'm a minimalist and simple when it comes to eating. But quite frankly, I think their fries tasted much better than fast food restaurants and most diners in general. These fries are thicker kind of like steak fries. Some of the sauces are a bit weird like mayo on fries? I just like my food plain so maybe that's why. This is a greasy treat it's actually pretty good if you need a quick fix and you don't want a big meal. I do warn you that you don't try to take this as take-out. It gets pretty soggy pretty fast and that is just gross.
