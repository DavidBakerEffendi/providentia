A Stone Street favorite! Their pizza is delicious, their service is prompt and you can not beat the atmosphere. My favorite is the Sicilian with Mushrooms. Most recently, I also tried it with sweet peppers and it was just as good. Adrienne's is a FiDi favorite! The crowd is mixed between those who work on Wall Street and locals who live downtown. During the summer, Stone Street is turned into an outdoor patio for patrons and its the perfect summer hangout. I'd have to say, Adrienne's is my favorite Manhattan pizzeria!
