Finally a great Sub Shop in the neighborhood!  It's not that difficult to make a great sub.  You just need high quality fresh ingredients and a little bit of pride.  This place has all of that.  I stopped in to try them out for the first time yesterday and was really pleased.  Good fresh bread and veggies, a healthy portion of meat and cheese,  and friendly prompt service, all at a very reasonable price.  The place is neat and clean and I could feel a sense of pride not only in the food, but in the place itself and in the way they treat their customers.  Nice job, keep it up!
