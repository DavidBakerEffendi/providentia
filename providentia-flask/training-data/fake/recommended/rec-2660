The food is good. I had the Kafta Kabab sandwich and it was quite good and authentic. The service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. To start with, I ordered a soda and the server brought me a can. No straw, no glass. That was fine.  It took a long time for the food to come out. A small sandwich on a little plate eventually showed up, no silverware,  no napkin. I had to hail the server later to get her to bring me a napkin. After I was done,  she brought the check and I have her my credit card. She ran the card and asked me to sign the receipt as she waited. Bizarre! All in all, good food, bad service. I won't return.
