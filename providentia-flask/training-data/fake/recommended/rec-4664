I've only eaten here twice, but both times we had delicious food and great service. Â The wine list is excellent and the last time I ate here our server helped us pick out a great bottle that everyone at the table enjoyed. My recommendations for tapas are the sweet potato fries, the lamb chops and the grilled steak paillard. I had their chocolate cake for dessert, which is the smaller dense, gooey inside kind of chocolate treat - so good. Highly recommended for any chocolate lover out there. It can get kind of noisy and the prices are a little high, which is why I took one star off. Otherwise it's a great place and I'll definitely be going back again.
