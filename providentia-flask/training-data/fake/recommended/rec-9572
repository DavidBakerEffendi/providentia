I'm such a italian food snob/princess... and I have been known to be very VERY picky.  I had the tasting pasta dish and it wasn't what I thought.  I wanted to try what they featured and the price wasn't bad... but it wasn't what I had thought or imagined Italian food.  The staff was professional and upbeat and attentive.  The wait wasn't long and the food came at a leisurely pace.
