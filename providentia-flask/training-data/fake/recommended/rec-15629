The only reason for the 3 star is the unfriendly and sloppy service. if it were not for that it would get 4 stars and if the food was a bit more tasty it would get a solid 5 stars and more as the decor and ambiance along with the creative menu is just outstanding and the only thing missing is good service and some more wonder into te actual taste of the dish. If the taste would live up to the creativity of the menu this place would kill!!! I will probably go back again to give the service one more chance and taste some other dishes which as i mentioned are pretty interesting (in a good way).
