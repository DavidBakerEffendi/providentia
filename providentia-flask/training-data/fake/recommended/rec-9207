I'm always up for a trip to Blue Ribbon. If you go during prime time, be prepared to wait but it's worth it once you get a nice bottle of wine, the most delicious fresh raw shellfish, amazing sauteed calamari and the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade appetizer (trust me, you will dream about it). I've never gone wrong when I stick to the appetizers but the only entrees I feel are up to par are the duck club and fried chicken.
