I've eaten here a couple times now, and the food is consistently really yummy. I highly recommend the sangria, the tostones with garlic sauce, and the empanadas!!!! For entrees, I've gotten the Fricasse de Pollo, which is basically arroz con pollo. It was very flavorful, and I would definitely get it again. The atmosphere is also really nice for a birthday dinner, or just having some pregame drinks and appetizers.
