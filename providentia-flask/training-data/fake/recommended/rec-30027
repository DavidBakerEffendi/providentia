I think this is my first 5-star review - this is because when polled, the girls all gave 5-5 for their meals, and I was scraping the bottom of my plate when I was done. Wife is still a vegetarian, one daughter is a semi-vegetarian and the other one is a voracious meat eater. We had Sat brunch here, 11am seating. I had - no one tell the kids - a hangover from the previous night which I tried to burn off by going for a run the the morning; that did not work. So I ordered a extra-spicy Bloody Mary to start. Not sure if it worked but while we were in the restaurant I had no headache. We ordered the Pickled Vegetable plate. Outstanding, esp with the exta-spicy Bloody Mary with even more bloody with tabasco added at the table. The carrots especially were fantastic. For mains, I had the Eggs Benedict. She had the quiche, after the first bite of which she said "OUTSTANDING". We looked around to see if others were staring at us. We all got a bite and it was, indeed, OUTSTANDING. The semi-veg ordered Sunny Side Up, which she gobbled up quietly without looking up. When polled, she said 6 out of 5. The voracious meat eater ordered the Beef Burger, which she ordered med-well, and was consumed with a Yum 5-5. Fries came with Beet Root ketchup - it was fantastic. We ordered another order of fries. To finish it all, we wanted to order the XL Sticky Bun, but even pure greediness did not win over the size of our tummies. So we ordered it to go, and just finished it a few mins ago. Gaaah. Thats what I'm having the next time I go.
