The worst middle Eastern food I've ever eaten!   My wife and I love a good middle Eastern meal. So when we found Sahara was only a short drive away and on our way to a night out with friends in Princeton, we decided to stop in From the outside and inside, Sahara looks like a dingy strip mall establishment. I understand there's. It much that can be done to the outside, but the inside looked like the dining hall of a ski lodge.  A half assed attempt to create the ambiance of a Lebanese restaurant. The restaurant was pretty much empty on this Wednesday night. My wife ordered the vegetarian combo ($9) and I ordered the meat combo ($16) The vegetarian combo had pretty good hummus and babaganous but that's about it. The meat combo came with lamb dish, chicken kebab, gyro meat, rice and tabouli. The meat was borderline inedible. I've never had gyro meat as dry and tasteless. The lamb sish was oily, tough, and had an odd oder and taste.  Something was definitely not right with the scraps of meat that was in front of me. Seemed like it was reheated about 5 times. I guess the rice was the only thing ok in the meat platter. After dinner we tried the baklava which everyone seemed to be raving about. The baklava was definitely not fresh...I'll give it a 3 out of 10. The servers were in the middle of eating their own meal so bussing the two tables near us didn't seem like a priority for them. Both my wife and I woke up the next morning feeling sick to our stomachs.
