Had the fish and chips... or at least I thought I did. For me it looked more like beer batter and chips. Once I found the fish hidden in the beer batter, I tried to eat it and it was very tasteless. All the malt vinegar wouldn't have helped it. They should get rid of the kids cooking in the kitchen and place someone there who knows how add seasoning to food.
