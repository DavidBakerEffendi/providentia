Unfortunately it is a chain...and you can tell..... Decor, vibe, atmosphere (including the cute little fire pits they give you to roast your marshmallows) are "festive" but seem to compensate for average desserts (only had dessert so cannot comment on anything else). We had the "Sharing" - a sampling of items for two. Some were hits (a solid single, no home runs), and others on the plate were, well....like watching most pitchers trying to hit...a little unfulfilling, boarding on disturbing. First the good - the "bark" was interesting and maybe the best thing on the plate, the chocolate crispies (individual rice krispies coated in chocolate) looked neat and tasted OK too, and the fondue (strawberries, bananas, and marshmallows you can roast, which is a neat idea) was OK, but nothing special. OK, now up steps the pitchers to the plate....the brownie...a little dry (really, a brownie at a chocolate place dry? Yes, sad but true), the chocolate egg roll (banana and chocolate inside), forgettable, and the banana split waffle...yikes! Somebody needs to take "waffle making class"...wholly crap was that thing tough. The chocolate was just simple sweet milk chocolate not much variety on the plate. Lastly, can we be a little more inventive about the fruits with which you pair chocolate? I get it, bananas and chocolate go well but banana with the fondue, banana waffle, and banana in the egg roll...but c'mon, somebody toss a raspberry in their somewhere at least..... All in all there has got to be better desserts places in Philly
