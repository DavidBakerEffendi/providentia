Slow service, bad food, and such small portions! Yelp, you let me down.  We ordered the spring rolls to start.  They were encased in an incredibly heavy, greasy dough that took some work to get through.  The accompanying "sauce" was an orange-tinted karo syrup.   My dining companion ordered pineapple-fried rice; I ordered the vegetable soup.  First, it took forever to get our food.  Tables all around us were sitting down, ordering, eating, and leaving while we sat peeling labels off our (hideously overpriced) bottles of beer.  When my friend's food finally came, it was basically a nine-dollar bowl of rice, and not a large bowl at that.  I had to wait another fifteen minutes for my soup, which was lukewarm at best.  Worse, I could FEEL I was eating, and SEE the level in my vowel going down, but darned if I could TASTE a thing.   Oh, except for the one tiny mushroom dumpling, which had a distinct glue overtone. Got to get a bagel or something now--$45 after we sat down I am starving. Blech.  Stay away.
