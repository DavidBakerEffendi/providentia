Had two beers - the dark IPA and the standard IPA.  The dark IPA was interesting, but too intense after a while.  There other traditional IPA (can't remember it's exact name) was tasty and well balanced.  The seafood chowder hit the spot on the cold rainy day, although the wings were unremarkable. The service was good and the crowd quite friendly. Would definitely go again for the beer.
