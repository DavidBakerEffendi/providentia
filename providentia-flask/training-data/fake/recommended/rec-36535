I finally came here after nearly a year of reading the review in New York Times. Its in Long Island City, but I came last Sunday for brunch and it was well worth the trip from the Upper West Side. Their brunch menu is small and I wasn't familiar with the cuisine, but it was my first time having lentils but I believe my dish was called "smorshed eggs" ... something that started with an s and was a blend of eggs baked in lentils, squash, other small veggies, grated cheese on top and a side of wheat toast. AMAZING. I went around three so peolpe were just leaving, but I absolutely loved the decor and the DIY feel it has. I can only imagine how busy it would have been if I would have went during traditional brunch hours, but I was happy to catch brunch before it ended (4pm). Its so worth the trip and LIC Market is just about in every magazine that I've read this month for a good bite to eat in the city and queens.
