On a humbug decided to come out and head to Chavellas. I have passed it a million and one times, so it was time! The wait was pretty good for a Sat night, 15 mins for a party of two. I ordered the Guac, cojito corn, steak and pork tacos. They brought the Guac out likity split, which means it wasn't handmade. We had about three bites a piece and sent it back into the kitchen. I have had much better Guac. Actually trader joes makes a better version. I prefer had made Guac, like from Fonda or Dos Caminos. The corn was luke warm and slathered in the mayo/cojito cheese combo. Â So if you don't like mayo, stay away. Besides the temp they left a lot of those stringy pieces of husk, annoying and nasty. The tacos were ok, I have definitely had better by the local taco truck. Overall, I would go back for the tacos if I was in the area, but I wouldn't suggest people travel for Chavelas. If you want good Mexican, hit Fonda or dos on Park. My two go to spots!!
