My friends and I tried this place last night.  My friend recommended this place after seeing the chef on the food network.  We wanted to try something different and were so glad we went!! The food is really great here and nothing like we had ever had before.  My favorite items here were the zucchini hummus pizza and the vegetarian version of the graffiti burger (similar to pav baji).  The green mango paneer and pickled ginger scallops were also great.  The best was the desert!! The hazelnut chocolate caviar was SO freeking good.  The chef also offered us coconut cake not on the menu which was even better.  I think the Chef Mehta should open a bakery too!  :)   We will be returning!! Awesome experience! Just be prepared that the place is tiny but the food is worth it!
