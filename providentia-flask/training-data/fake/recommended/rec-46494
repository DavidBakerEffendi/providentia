Would have been five stars except we had to wait 20 minutes for our table. The hostesses were pretty rude but all the other food and service was top notch. We (4 people) ate: Oysters - not my favorite out of everything we ate but a very interesting flavor and preparation Clams and sausage - this was the special appetizer and was so great. They give you Texas toast to sop up the rich broth. I think the broth was the best part Chili lobster - great flavor and very generous portion. Best appetizer Chicken under a brick for two - best chicken ever. They brought out extra broccoli rabe unprompted which was very appreciated. Â This was my favorite dish of the night Steak - also very good. I didn't get this but tasted it and it was a solid dish Pork tenderloin and sausage - tenderloin was very flavorful. The sausage wasn't really a sausage but an ear. It was the only thing left on the plate during the evening Dessert was the mini ice creams and something else which i can't remember. Chef and pastry chef both came out to deliver food and check on us. Wine list was great, had a couple bottles of the copain syrah. Finished the meal with banana infused Jameson which everyone enjoyed, even those that don't love whiskey. We will definitely be back
