Everytime I go here I have a great meal. I have been here from brunch, lunch, and dinner. Some of my favorites are the Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Salad, fries with Gorgonzola Fondue, and the Atlantic Salmon. I also love their drinks, their hot apple cider rum is perfect for a cold day. I also love the atmosphere, in the west village you can't go wrong with food, but this is definitely the best in the neighborhood!!!!
