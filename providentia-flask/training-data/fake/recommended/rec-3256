A touch disappointing after reading all the hype about how great this place was.  We were out for a family dinner, and the first thing that struck us was the harsh rock n roll music that was playing really loud.  It was really difficult to talk, and certainly not appropriate dinner music!  The music, along with general loudness of the crowded place was really distracting from the whole experience.  The food was pretty good, but not quite the Italian food we hoped for, more like nouveau Italian.  Probably won't go back, there are much better choices in Philly!
