Can I just say...NOW THIS IS A SANDWICH! Warm hoagie bun, roasted pork, provolone, topped with jus (which defies science and doesn't sog the bun!) and green peppers and collard greens. DELICIOUS! The sandwich is a nice large size but with my petite frame I gobbled it up because it was way too delicious. My boyfriend's pulled pork sandwich was also just as yummy but I have to bow down to the roasted pork. Wash it down with a soda...perfection!
