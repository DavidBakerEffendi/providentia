This review is for the beer only. I did not have the food, though it looked good. Being from NJ and in Philly for the weekend, I was psyched that this place was right around the corner from where I was staying. I was looking forward to loading up on some beers that you can't get in NJ. The selection was indeed very good, and they had a lot of cool stuff. Problem was that maybe only 10% (or less) of what they had actually had prices on it (and it was just the stuff in the coolers that was marked). So when I brought 8 bottles of beer up to the register, I was floored to find it was going to run me $120. I had to ask the cashier which was the most expensive (I put that one back), and the second most expensive (that went back too), until I got down to "only" $50 for a mixed six pack. The process was not only somewhat humiliating but also annoying, as she seemed to be the only one working at the time and had to manage the phone lines too. Moral of the story - if you go in knowing you will be (blindly) paying north of upscale bar prices at what appears to be a trendy deli, you'll do fine. My last bit of advice for The Corner Foodery would be to add some kind of 3D signage outside that hangs off the building - its easy to miss if you aren't specifically looking for the place.
