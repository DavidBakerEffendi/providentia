Best gastropub in Montclair.. perhaps NJ; great bartenders; great service; great setting; outdoor seating (but no food allowed); great customers-- strike up a conversation with anyone.. and I mean anyone, and it will make the experience that much more enjoyable.  One drawback: they have a policy against baseball caps being worn sideways or backwards.  My hope is they dropped it, since it hints at something unsavory but, knowing the owner, unintended. BTW... want quality seafood instead?  Go right next door to the Egan's owner other fine fare: Halcyon.
