Came here for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. Arrived at 8pm on a Wednesday and it was packed (and it's a pretty huge restaurant). We were a party of 3 with a table for 2 open, so they squeezed a chair in to fit us all. The decor is very posh, with chandeliers and fancy mirrors. Dim lighting and such makes it look swanky. Top it off with the dressed up staff. Ambiance is good but it is very loud inside, so if you're looking to hold a conversation, it'll be pretty difficult. We ordered family style even though I'm pretty sure the plates are meant to be for individuals. We all wanted to try a bit of each thing. We ordered: Corn spring rolls- nothing special. The rolls were dunked already in the sauce as they were served, which I thought would just make them soggy. Panang Curry- one of the faves of the night. Delicious. Pineapple Fried Rice- the best thing ever! I would definitely come back for this alone. Sweet and savory. Beef was juicy and tender. Room Service Pad Thai- we were confused as to what it was when served. The noodles were wrapped in an egg omelette. Noodles were pretty bland, lacked the peanut taste, and the seafood wasn't that fresh. Would not order again. I prefer a more authentic pad thai. Overall not a bad place. Our total including tip was $48, and everyone was full. I'll definitely be back for the pineapple fried rice...
