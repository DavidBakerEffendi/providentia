My boyfriend stumbled upon this gem while browsing yelp on our short but sweet trip to NY. Talk about delicious! The Peruvian chicken and Camarones Cuzco were absolutely amazing. The beans and rice were also some of the best we've tasted. Last but not least, the ambiance of this particular location was gorgeous! Perfect lighting and great for a date night! We'll definitely make another trip to NY for round 2!
