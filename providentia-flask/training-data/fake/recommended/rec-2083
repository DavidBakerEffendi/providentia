Totally NOT the best cheese steak sandwich in Philly. If this is what Philly calls the best, then well...I feel sorry for people here, for I've had a better cheese steak sandwich from Charley's at any military base. The attitude of employees was horrible! They did have a sticker saying you are in america, order in English or something like that. Well I don't know what wiz or wit is. I know what "wit" is but I'm sure that's not what you use to describe a sandwich. I don't care if you support law enforcement or u.s. military. I am in the Army and I felt not only ripped off for the amount of meat they put in the sandwich but also abused for their rude attitude. I'm sorry, I don't know what wit or wiz or whatever it is. I'm not from South Philly. I'm from Boston and we treat Yankees fans better than they treated me or my friend there. And cash only? Serious? This is 2010. Get with the program. I'm going to try Tony Luke's tomorrow. Hopefully it's alot better than this place. No wonder why Pats had a longer line.
