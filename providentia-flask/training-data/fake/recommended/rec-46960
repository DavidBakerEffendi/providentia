So I came here because all of my Philly friends said that I "MUST" go to El Vez before I departed, and I can't say I was blown away. The place is identical in decor and menu to every other upscale Mexican restaurant I've been to in Miami (Rosa Mexicano, El Vato, Cinco, etc.) Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious and the service was WAY better than anywhere in Miami (surprise) but I wouldn't necessarily write home about it. I do have to say, however, that the Bazooka guacamole was outrageously delicious and I really enjoyed the variety of guacamoles on the menu. The other "fancy" Mexican places usually only have classic guacamole. Also, the service was stellar. The hostesses, waitress, and manager all came by multiple times to check on us and I definitely felt like I was being waited on hand and foot.
