Deeelicious! Make the trip out there. Yes, it's further out than the normal hipster would travel but it is worth it. The hot chicken is amazing. The crispy skin is packed with flavor and no oily mess. Careful because the hot really is hot. Also get the fried catfish nuggets. Soooo good. Crispy outside soft insides. Yum! Collard greens not worth it but the mac looked good. I'll have to get it next time. Dishes come with cornbread. If I wasn't full, I'd ask for seconds. Staff is friendly. No wait for me on a Saturday brunch time. Drinks are great, though a bit light.
