Food was meh. Rib tip appetizer was very good. We thought it was going to set the tone for the meal. But no one in my party thought much of the entrees. Fried chicken was greasy and without much flavor. Burgers were bland. Service was mediocre. Prices were very reasonable but you do get what you pay for. Don't think we'll be returning. Overall lukewarm feeling for this establishment.
