Maybe it was an off day, but I didn't think my brunch experience was anything special.  I ordered the pumpkin pancakes and thought the cinnamon yogurt was a bit too sweet for breakfast, however liked the fresh squeezed oj.  My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich with home fries which was tasty.  Sadly though, I was disappointed when the waitress informed us that there were no free coffee refills.  Who doesn't provide free refills on coffee for breakfast?  Maybe I'll try coming back for lunch or dinner, but wasn't blown away by brunch here.
