Showed up for lunch today and the place was half empty. The bar was almost completely empty. After the hostess ignored us for a few minutes, the bar tender told her to tell us we will have to wait if we wanted a table (as if she couldn't speak to us directly). So we asked if we could sit at one of the six empty tables in the bar area, the hostess replied - I kid you not - "sure, but she (the bar tender) probably won't serve you anything." Â So our party of four spent our $100 elsewhere...
