this is my new go-to business lunch spot. would totally come back for dinner any time too. between three of us, we shared four of the small plates which was more than enough food. starting with my favorite they were: - brussels sprouts - i'm still not tired of brussels, which i order pretty much anywhere they are offered (skip them at brassiere ruhlman if you ever go there). these were perfectly crispy and paired with grapes and walnuts which i've never tried before. loved loved loved. i could have used slightly less yogurt on them, but really i would have downed the whole order if i wasn't sharing. - hummus - i'm not a big fan of hummus in general, but this was a creamy wonderful dish. not grainy at all like store bought versions usually are. and the warm puffy bread they serve with it is delicious and light. next time i'll try the one with pinenuts. - pheonicia fries - not sure on the exact name or spelling, but their fries were pretty special, especially when paired with the sauce (spicy mayo?) it came with. - warm eggplant - thin circles of eggplant in tamarind molasses. pretty wow for eggplants. the atmosphere is lovely. simple, elegant but not stuffy at all. cool colored mirror in the bathroom too.
