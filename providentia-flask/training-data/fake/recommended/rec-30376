Great food, GREAT service.  And they're open 24 hours...what can be bad?   The prices were great.  Shared an omelette that came with french fries and pulled pork sandwich that came with tortilla chips and a great dip with my sister for a late lunch/brunch.  Got coffee and the staff continuously refilled.  Friendly waiter too.  Total came to about $30.   We saw the dinner menu and it looked amazing.  And of course, reasonably priced with really interesting entree options!  Can't wait to go back.
