Went there this morning with a friend of mine for brunch and hadthe burger. We both decided it was, without a doubt, one of the best burgers we've had in a long time. The flavors where fresh and clean. Service from the bartender Steve was perfect. Friendly and not at all too much.Would highly recommend brunch there for either a small group (4-8pp) or cozy 2pp. Perfect for both groups.
