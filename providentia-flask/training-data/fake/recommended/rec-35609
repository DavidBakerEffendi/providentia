I went around 2pm on sunday  with my friend and was told there would be an hour wait. It was maybe half an hr or so, but the food was meh. Not as good as i expected. The side salad to my eggs benedict tasted dry, like it was not washed... Their spinach came directly from a bag that i saw them just microwave. The eggs benedict was watery near the yolk (is that normal?)  and my boyfriends omelette was slightly better, but had a "plastic" texture similar to eggs you'll get from a DD breakfast sandwich. Service was friendly, but no one came to check on us after being seated by the window and served our food... Most likely wont be coming back.
