Love this amazing find! Love the building, love the setting. Love the food, love the drink, love the staff. . . ok. . . . Let me start with what I started with - the house-infused ginger/lemon-grass martini. Oh. Yes. Yes, it was amazing. And weird. And delicious. Everything is "meant to be shared" - which doesn't mean it's a huge dish, but it is definitely plenty! The dishes come out one at a time (or so, depending on how much you order) and placed on the massive Lazy Susan. My faves were the red oil dumplings and cross-cut zucchini. Also ordered the crispy scallops, which were HUGE and tender. Just like I like 'em. Melted in my mouth (insert Homer Simpson "aggggaggg/drool"). Loved our server, Becky! She was so adorable, and made recommendations on drinks and food, and was often back to check on us, despite how busy her section was. So. All this to say, if you are in Burlington, you must head to A Single Pebble. You must go with a group. Not a big group, just a hungry group. You must eat the dumplings with chopsticks. That was entertainment at my table for a few minutes, at least.
