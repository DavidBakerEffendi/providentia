I will be reviewing just the store portion. I felt like everything was a bit pricey, but I guess that's a given considering it's in SoHo and everything is imported. I also had issues with the customer service.  When I went to purchase something, I asked how much it was (in Spanish, so there was no language issue), and no one even responded until I asked several more times. To continue my customer service story, I bought 2 things of quince paste but ended up only using one.  The salesperson was very rude to me about wanting to return the unused, unopened quince paste I had purchased less than 24 hours ago, but they never mentioned a return policy when I bought it.  I did not see why it was a problem.  I wouldn't have had an issue if they wouldn't take it back if she had been more polite about the situation in general.  Maybe it's not that classy to return things in SoHo, but what can I say, I'm a college student.
