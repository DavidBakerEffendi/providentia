Went to this place for lunch last Sunday. Service was terrible. We standed there for 5 minutes and no one was asking us, although there were plenty of open seats. I ordered green curry and the rice was half-cooked...never had this before in a NY restaurant. Don't know how come this place can get such high reviews.. Will definitely pass this place.
