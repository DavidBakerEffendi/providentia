Standard Tap is my all time favorite bar / hang out. I used to live a few blocks away, and boy, do I miss it. Really laid back atmosphere. First floor has wood paneled walls and a dark wood bar. I prefer the second floor - there's another bar and an outdoor patio and a huge dining room on both sides of the staircase. There's no menu except for a blackboard with the day's specials. I especially love the fried oysters, but everything is good. If you're a vegetarian, you might feel like you have limited options, but every salad I've ever had here has been great. ST is really more than a bar, and while they have a "bar food" type menu, they also have more than the typical bar menu. Also, they have cider on tap - can't really beat that. Sunday brunches are also phenomenal.
