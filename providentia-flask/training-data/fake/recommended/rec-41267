The name and bad font on the sign made me completely overlook this place. I know, I know. But after my landlord insisted I check it out, the boyfriend and I went for dinner one night. We shared a few different ceviches and tapas dishes. The zappalitos (zucchini filled with crabmeat and goat cheese) and mahi mahi taquitos were the standout dishes and the ceviches were all fresh and flavorful. Great place to go on a hot summer night.
