I spent my anniversary discovering amazing new restaurants and places in the city, this is where we chose to celebrate our special night. The garden area in the back is so romantic with tall ceilings and colorful lanterns, a very beautiful space to celebrate with friends, family or on a romantic night. The menu is full of options, we tried the pesto lasagna and pizza with lamb sausage. Both were spectacular, along with the fruit of the forest cake and wines we both had. I was only concerned because the menu was not very traditionally italian, therefore dont go here looking for pasta, not your place. I had wonderful service, and a great time. I will definitely be back to try from the ample menu and bar options in the basement (which happens to be a jazz club.)
