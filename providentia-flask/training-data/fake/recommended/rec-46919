This is the best it gets (at least for breakfast food). Not gonna lie. Came here after July 4 on a friday afternoon and the place was packed with a 40 minute wait. It's a huge place though with two floors. My friends and I were a bit in a rush so we decided to get the TAKE OUT, which was an amazing idea, though clearly not many customers exploited this option because we were the only ones ordering there. However, there was absolutely no wait and the food came out in less than ten minutes. I'm not sure if the take out menu differs from sit down menu (it probably does), but they still had good signature items so we were happy with the choices. We were also able to eat by a nice take out area towards the the windows. Food: + I got the egg sandwich that came with potatoes. Pretty standard sandwich on multigrain toast and scrambled eggs. The potatoes were delicious. + My friend got the barking chihuahua which looked good. The marinara sauce that came with it was spot on. + My friend got the stuffed french toast. Excuse me, but it was LITERALLY THE BEST STUFFED FRENCH TOAST I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. The stuffing tasted a bit like sweet cream cheese frosting but a million times lighter and fluffier, so naturally I loved it, and the bread was extremely fluffy. Ambience: +Very friendly environment- loud, cheery, and great for groups. Lots of college students. Super nice bathrooms too. Service: +We went to the take out area but the she was extremely nice and helpful. I'm sure the other servers are as well. Let's just say that I wish I would visit Penn or Drexel more often to just eat at Sabrina's Cafe.... I just want their french toast. And potatoes.
