I went here with my wife to try a new breakfast spot and ended up pretty disappointed with the food. We ordered the Berry french toast and the classic English breakfast as well as two coffees. Â  First the coffee - this was pretty terrible coffee even by NYC diner standards. Most likely some sort of GFS coffee that had been sitting for over an hour. Berry french toast - $13 for two small pieces of french toast is fine for the neighborhood but the accompanying parts must be perfect and they were not. First no real maple syrup was available in the place and fake syrup wasn't even offered, although I did see it in the kitchen. The french toast was supposed to be a "berry french toast" but instead only had 4 strawberries next to a large pile of melon. Strawberries are currently in season and nobody wants melon with their "berry french toast" if they are going to serve it that way it should be "melon french toast". Classic English Breakfast - Where to begin? The sausage and bread were actually pretty good so no complaints there, but that is where the the good part ends. The tomato was tough and tasteless. The eggs that were ordered poached came out over easy. The mushrooms were overcooked. The beans were completely unseasoned, nothing like what you get in England. The bacon was the type of absurdly thin bacon that is cooked in the oven the night before and thrown on the griddle for 30 seconds to warm it up before its is served to you. Other than getting the egg order wrong the service was very attentive so they get a star for that.
