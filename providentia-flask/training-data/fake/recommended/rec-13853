I love french-toasts ... and i shall always remember Public because of its french-toasts. My friends took me there for brunch on a snowy morning in New York. The entrance did not seem spectacular ... we had to wait for a few minutes to be seated at our table in this rather sparsely decorated restaurant. My friend strongly recommended the brunch deal ... a cocktail, main course and tea/coffee for $22. However comparing this amount with the a-la-carte prices, i didn't notice any substantial difference. Two of us went for the Turkish eggs ... its two poached eggs on Greek yoghurt and butter. This was delicious (though i might have preferred a bit less of the yoghurt) ... runny egg-yolk mixed with yoghurt ... i was proud of my choice ... until i had had the lychee french toast. Without doubt that was the best brunch dish i have ever tasted. It was sweet ... not excessive ... exactly the right amount. Sadly i have now come to know that the Public has removed this wonderful preparation from their menu ... beats me why. Besides the standard offerings, the brunch menu consists of quite a few interesting alternatives ... like black pudding waffles. I can return a few times just to sample these. It was only after my meal there that i came to know that the Public was a michelin starred place. Its the only one that i have been to that offers a good breakfast ... which makes it unique among its peers. The brunch price is way below what one would expect from a restaurant of its league. Its surely not to be missed.
