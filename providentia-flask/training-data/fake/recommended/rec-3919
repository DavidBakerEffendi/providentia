I came here for a work function lunch.  this place is now on our permanent list of potential locations for good bye lunches, welcome lunches, and business meeting lunches.  we had zero problems making a reservation for 7 and there was something to suit every taste on the menu. i had the falafel which was...kind of amazing.  it was definitely one of the more tasty things i've had to eat in recent memory.  societal restrictions kept me from licking the plate, but i won't deny that the thought passed through my mind.  one day we'll free ourselves from these shackles of tyranny and lick plates with reckless abandon, but until that day...i'll limit myself to saying things like "mmmm" and "yum."
