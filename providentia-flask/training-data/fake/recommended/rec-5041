Three-and-a-half stars. Trekking along the treacherous Bedford strip, you find yourself in the market for a no-frills burger, baked mac 'n cheese or simply a delicious pulled pork sandwich. Having grown tired of the crowded establishments that litter this neighborhood, you just want to kick back with a few friends and grab some comfort food. That's when you take a turn towards Berry Street and happen upon Juniper. With no crowds to brave, Juniper is arguably as good as, if not better than, establishments like The Meatball Shop and DuMont Burger. Â  Of course, the execution is not perfect at Juniper and if you seek a restaurant with an alcohol license (Juniper is BYOB), refined service and the perfect ambiance, best you look elsewhere. That is not what you are seeking now though, is it? Perhaps you're just commencing your weekend festivities and require hearty sustenance for your forthcoming journey; perhaps a day of vintage clothes shopping has caused you to crave a catfish sandwich. Whatever the cause of said cravings, rest assured, your appetite should be satiated at Juniper. Having tried the pulled pork sandwich, I am a satisfied customer: served on a brioche bun this tender, juicy and flavorful concoction is served with your choice of sweet potato, regular or spicy fries. As far as pulled pork sandwiches go, this is as good a specimen as one could reasonably hope to find. That is not to say that it is the best in show, but there is very little about which to complain. Conclusion: This is not a destination restaurant by any means but, as a neighborhood spot, you can expect consistently delicious cuisine devoid of airs and graces. The only surprising element is that Juniper is not nearly as busy as it should be, relative to the over-hyped establishments around the corner.
