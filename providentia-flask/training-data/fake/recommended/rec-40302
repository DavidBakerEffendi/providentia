Cool sports bar in South Philly, not far from the stadiums. Pros: If you use their valet parking, you can catch a ride to whatever sporting event you're going to via their "Taxi Crab" bus. That being said, valet parking is $15 - which is the same as parking for a Phillies, Flyers or Sixers game, but it's cheaper than Eagles parking, which is $25. Service is usually very fast! Their crab fries & hot wings are really good. Sometimes they have some good beer specials. Cons: Their "dress code" consists of not wearing baseball caps backwards, so just be aware that if you walk in with a baseball cap on, turn it frontways. Seems a bit unnecessary, but the rules are rules.... For a place in South Philly, their bread isn't that good. So, if you get a cheesesteak, be advised that it's not the standard Philly bread you might be used to (nice crust on outside, soft on the inside), but rather a generic roll that tends to fall apart if you don't eat your cheesesteak immediately! Their cheesesteaks are good though otherwise.
