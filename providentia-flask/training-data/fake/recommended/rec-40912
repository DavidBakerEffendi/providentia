I want to be clear and fair so everyone can understand my review.   My 3 star rating is for customer service and not the food. My husband, myself and a friend ordered the St. Louis Ribs.  They were tasty and tender.  What bothered us is how long we had to wait for the meal.  What bothered me is when my friend had to get up to get me a spoon for my tea after I asked for one twice AND the restaurant was not full.  Again, in all fairness, I will say that the chef personally came out to speak with me (I liked that)  about how long the ribs were taking!  He said they cook them from scratch (I also liked that!).  When I suggested he put some kind of food on the table and/or tell people there would be a longer waiting time to get their meal, he said "we (the restaurant) would have to pay for that!"  Not the greatest response. This is the bottom line:  Would I go back to this restaurant?  Yes - because of the food.  Would I go expecting better service?  Not really.  Do I like the decor and the atmosphere of the place?  Yes.  Do I want them to succeed?  Yes.  They are in my neighborhood and I want a good restaurant that is located close by.  Would I tell anyone to not give this restaurant a chance?  No,  because they are just starting out. I feel confident that if they make a sincere effort, there is a way for them to work the customer service kinks out!  BUT THEY MUST MAKE A SINCERE EFFORT.  Other restaurants have better customer service and they can too!
