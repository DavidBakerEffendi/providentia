Holy shit! I got two dishes. I know it is a very small sample size of the menu, but this is the best Chinese food I've ever had in America. The service was not very great, and at times frankly confusing, but the food did come out quick, very affordable and it was amaze-balls! I came here solo very early after the Four Seasons 5k run. I thought the liang pi would help cool me down a bit. It was exactly the way I remember it from when I lived in Xi'an. I also got a dish, I'm not quite sure the name. It had pretty large chunks of peppers, potatoes, onions, and bone in with skin on chicken in a spicy sauce brown sauce served over top a bed of large, flat, wide noodles. It was out of this world... very traditional. I would have eaten here again the next day if I lived near by. I can't wait until the next time I find my self in center city and hungry!
