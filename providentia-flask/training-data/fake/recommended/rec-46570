I live right outside Philly, but I try to go here as much as possible. I always leave with a bag of Goshen Coffee. Some of the best coffee I've ever had. It's a great place to get coffee, eat a whoopie pie & unwind. The staff is nice, the music is not too loud and the food is great. A major plus is the vegan creamer options. It's not just store brand soy milk that's a couple days old in a dirty container. I think listening to metal while drinking coffee is awesome. Just made my plans for weekend coffee....
