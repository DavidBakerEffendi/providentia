After walking by this place for the past year or so, we finally decided to try it. A nice cozy environment with a welcoming feel. The onion soup was delicious and the flambes were so tasty. Not sure how people can eat so many. We each got our own and then shared one for dessert and were stuffed! The nutella/strawberry one is amazing.
