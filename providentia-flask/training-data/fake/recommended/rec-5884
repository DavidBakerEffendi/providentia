A very underwhelming experience. Pity! It was my birthday lunch :( Service was slow and inattentive. The biggest let down was the food - especially the entrees. The chicken kebab was dry but flavorful. The lamb skewers were chewy and flavorless. We had a bunch of mezze to start with that were ok but not out of this world. The highlight was the desert. The pastry chef knew what he was doing. The warm date cake and kanafe were among the best I've had. And oh the Brussel sprouts - phenomenal! Best I've ever had.
