Nice place. Modern pleasant restaurant with OK food and slow service. After seated we waited 15 minutes before we even met out server. We waited 45 minutes to an hour to be seated but as the night droned on (slow service, not the company) the place cleared out. Tip: dine after 9 if you can hold out. Â  We had: Really good bread / rolls BBQ shrimp App (really good) Wedge salad (good but come-on... it's a salad) Margarita pizza (thin dough but bland sauce) Tuna steak (cooked well but just OK flavor)
