Quite likely the best burger I've ever had.  Went with a group of 10, and that was the general consensus. We were in town from all over the country-- many from DC where there's a burger place on every other corner. I kept is basic-- bun, bread, cheese.  The beef truly melted in my mouth.  It was so good, I had a second (which I don't think I've ever done).  They're not huge, but so, so tasty.
