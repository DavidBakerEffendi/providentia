If my waitress was more attentive, maybe my experience and review of this place would've been better. It took entirely too long for our food to come out. Our waitress disappeared for at least 30 minutes. I ordered calamari and tandoori chicken kebab. The calamari was really good, but the paired sauce was bland. The chicken was edible, but the tzatziki sauce was better than everything else (basmati rice) on the plate. We ended up getting our bellies filled by the deli across the street!
