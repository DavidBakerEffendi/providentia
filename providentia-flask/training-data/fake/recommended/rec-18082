Excellent barritos (haven't had the tacos, but they look good), good service, and decent prices. This place is worth a visit if you're starving - the portions are huge - and just want good Mexican food. During summer months, the city installs a deck with chairs on the street, allowing for outdoor seating and lounging. My one complaint is that it occasionally gets crowded and orders get delayed as a result. Not a huge deal, but it might be worthwhile to avoid peak times.
