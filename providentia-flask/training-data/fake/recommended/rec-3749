service wasn't great. I overheard the day shift bartender/server talking to the night shift person loudly that they wanted to scream at everyone walking in and he can see the "a**holes coming from a mile away". We ordered the oyster special with the pint of beer and the east coast oysters were so small they were barely edible. The Mahi Mahi we ordered was greasy and flavorless. Also the front serves as a fish market which is cute but customers sign there receipts at the bar which is where I happened to be sitting. I was really excited to try this place but left feeling ripped off and disappointed.
