I would say it's a 3.5 star restaurant to me.  Maybe because the food was less delicious than I expected after reading all the raves about this restaurant.  I landed at Newark in the morning to see my then-fiancee and went to this place.  The omelet and egg benedict were good, but there was nothing spectacular.  I liked the ambience and service.  It's a shame that I had to give them 3 stars (yelp) because of my high pre-visit-expectation
