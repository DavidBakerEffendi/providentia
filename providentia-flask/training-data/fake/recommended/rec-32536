I just ordered from a catered lunch from Take Five, Vince. We had a super last minute order for the next day and a few places were not willing to help us. Â He was super friendly and helped me to quickly decide on a lunch order for over 100 people!!! I know the food will be great judging by the service :) - thanks again Vince!
