I been here many a times and it never disappoints. The Corner Bistro's burger is yummy, good, and tasty. It's not a mammoth burger like you'll find at other burger joints, but you won't leave here hungry either. Order a side of fried and stay close to the bartender for frequent refills of the house brew. Seating's a little tight at times, so come expecting a small wait.
