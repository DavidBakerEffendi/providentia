I've dined in Greece and Cyprus and had a Cypriot roommate so I know the food pretty well.  Stamna is as good as it gets and it saves me the trip of going all the way to Astoria too. Came here with a large party and it was unanimous, everyone enjoyed the food.  We ordered all the mixed platters - hot veggie platter which had yummy fried eggplant, zucchini, and peppers; assorted cold dips with caviar dip and eggplant dip as standouts.  Main course we ordered the mixed grilled platter and the beefteki (Greek burger) was really tasty; also had the mixed grilled seafood platter which had fresh delicious meaty octopus, calamari and giant shrimp.  This dish reminder me of Greece.  My mouth is watering just thinking of the octopus. To top off all the grilled food we ordered Moussaka as well.   I'm a big fan of Moussaka and theirs tasted homemade.  The béchamel sauce was so velvety!  Loved it!   We ended the meal with baklava (of course!) and that too tasted homemade.  (We also had the mini chocolate lava cake, which I would skip next time.) Besides the great authentic food, the waiters were so friendly and jolly guys.  They seemed like they enjoy working there.   This place is such a gem in this area.  I highly recommend.
