This place is a hidden treasure. Went for an early dinner before a theatre performance and had the $13.95 pre-fixe dinner. It's a no-frills walk-up restaurant that is clean and serves down-to-earth food. Ordered: Appetizer: Samosa (Vegetarian- potatoes/peas in a triangle). Entree: Chicken saag (all white meat, very moist, and nice spinach sauce). Dessert: Kheer (Rice pudding. Not too sweet and not too milky/soupy -- aka just the way I like it). Drink: Mango lassi (refreshing, fruity, and not too sweet). Very attentive wait staff who kept refilling water glasses and checked to make sure everything was good. Enjoyed the 10% discount on the bill after checking in on Yelp. Overall, will be back.
