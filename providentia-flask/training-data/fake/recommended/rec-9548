My partner and I tried Pio Pio and had high hopes for our first Peruvian meal. It was a fantastic evening ! Welcome was warm and service throughout was quick paced and friendly. Cocktails were great (Pisco Sour was very good) and cheap at around $10 each and food was really good. Felt like an authentic taste but then I guess we wouldn't know different. Either way we loved the calamari, the avocado and shrimp, Juanita's chicken and my filet in soy sauce was terrific.
