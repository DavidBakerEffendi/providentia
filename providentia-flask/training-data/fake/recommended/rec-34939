Growing up in the 80's we always called it the Punk Guy Bagel Shop because all the guys who worked there had different colored hair.  The bagels there are always fresh and the service is friendly.  When I am craving a real bagel I will drive 20 mins just to get their bagels!  Also you can order green bagels for St. Patricks Day!
