You Â know you're in the right place when you see that other Thai places within a couple of blocks are empty and Joya has a 40 minute wait. They do what they do, and they do it well. They have a full bar and the drinks are pretty good. we love love love the spicy noodles and its what we order about 90% of the time. I've had various specials and have never been disappointed. One think I've learned, there is a level of quality that Joya achieves on the regular and depending on who is making the food, it can be exceeded.
