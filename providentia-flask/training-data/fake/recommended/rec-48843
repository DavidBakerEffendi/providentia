Up Thai is one of the best restaurants i have ever been too. My friend and I were instantly enchanted by enticing and awe inducing atmosphere and decor. To top it off both the food and the service proved to be impeccable. The interior designer deserves an award, no detail was left unattended to. We sat at a table under gorgeous array of lamps. It took us forever to order because we could simply not choose from the delicious options on the menu. I can't wait to take everyone I care about to my new favorite restaurant.
