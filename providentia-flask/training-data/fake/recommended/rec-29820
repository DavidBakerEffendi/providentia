Wonderful spot for a light lunch on a hot day.  The food is a sophisticated combination of new twists on old favorites, all featuring the cheeses that are the centerpiece of the restaurant's fare. My wife had the "Modern Waldorf" salad, which ended up being a lighter, crisper version of the classic salad while I opted for the "Blue Fig" which consisted of fig preserves,  and proscuitto on pretzel bred. Both were outstanding and not too large.  The service, too, was excellent: very attentive without smothering.  All in all, a great lunch spot in Philly's Old City. Well worth seeking out next time you're visiting the City of Brotherly Love.
