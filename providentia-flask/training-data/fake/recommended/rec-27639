I love Barrio Chino! Positives: - Amazing food and margaritas. My favorites are the seafood stew (to die for!) and their mole is some of the best I've ever had. I also love the grapefruit margaritas. - Cozy atmosphere. Small place so it's an intimate setting. - Friendly staff Negatives: (not many) - Because it's small the wait can be long (45- 1 hour on a busy night).     No reservations. So just park yourself at the bar and order some margaritas! - It can be pretty pricey after you add drinks and everything into the bill, but its well worth it. - Not too good for groups because there is only one group table that can sit 6 people comfortably and 8 people cramped. They do take reservation for a large group though, so just make it pretty far in advance So basically try to go during the week with just two people and make sure you can afford to go all out and order drinks with dinner. Barrio Chino, by far, is one of my favorite restaurants. Enjoy!
