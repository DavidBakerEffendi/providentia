The food Â is very outstanding, but the service they provided aren't on the same level. Our birthday table wait for so long for our drinks and waitress seems very cloudy, felts like we have to please her in order to get our things. Not a recommended place for party or for dating, but if u don't mind the service it's a good place to try.
