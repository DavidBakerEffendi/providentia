Oh man this place was bad. Took my patents here for breakfast. My mother fairly commented at the end of the meal that it was "as if the owner and cook and waitstaff had taken the day off and left the place to their roommates." Service with a total of six people in the restaurant was abominable, and they were incapable of cooking an egg. (They also "did not have pancakes today" which is somewhat unusual for an American breakfast spot.
