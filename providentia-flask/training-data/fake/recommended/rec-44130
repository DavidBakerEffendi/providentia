For some reason I didn't think I'd try ethnic food on my trip out to Philly.  I was pleasantly surprised when my friend chose this place.  The food is yummy and the staff are so nice.  The place is located in this jenky street of Chinatown (though I've never been to a non-jenky Chinatown) and the decor and atmoshere is much better on the inside than the outside.   We had their award-winning fried tofu that was battered in lentils and dipped in a sweet/spicy sauce.  Surprisingly yummy, though a bit dense.  I had the chicken cocunut curry which is similar to a Thai curry, but much milder.  My friend had the beef and lemongrass stew, which was packed with flavor, though the beef was a bit dry.  The sweet icetea was delightful--fresh, mildly sweet, and with no milk. Overall, a good place.  I'd come here often if I lived here.
