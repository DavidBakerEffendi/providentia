This might be my new go-to spot for noodles in Chinatown. Â This was the first bowl of ramen that I've been happy with in Philadelphia - and it approaches the quality and presentation of ramen shops I've frequented in Taiwan and Japan. I ordered a bowl of miso ramen, accompanied by roast pork, a soft boiled egg, and the requisite vegetables as well as an order of takoyaki (octopus balls - excellent).
