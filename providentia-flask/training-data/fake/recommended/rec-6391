We went to Momofuku Ssam on Monday night at 7:30, waited ten minutes, sat side-by-side at the bar, ordered two OBs, an order of pork buns, chicken wrapped in rice dish, and the jarred muscles with toast. I was going to write this review earlier but David Chang's d*ck has been in my mouth, which says a great deal, considering the restaurant itself doesn't do a whole lot for those seeking "ambiance." Food as advertised.
