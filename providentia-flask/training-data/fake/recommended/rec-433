If you're looking for a great assortment of beers and some amazing finger food, this is the place to go. The servers make the place feel as if you've known them forever. They're the nicest at that bar. The crowd is definitely between 20's and early 30's. There's enough room for hanging at the bar, crowding around tables in the back, and even to dance a bit. It's nothing but a good time at Swifts. If you plan on going...GET THE SLIDERS. Those are one of the best sliders I have ever had in my entire life. No matter where I go, I always try to sample the sliders restaurants and bars have, and this place got it right on the first try.
