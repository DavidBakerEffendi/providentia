Good food, well priced. I enjoyed the Victoria Lac Salmon entree - the lemon grass curry sauce with sauteed onions was creamy yet a tad spicy, especially interesting when combined with grilled salmon. On the flip side, Â they don't include disposable flatware or bread with the take-out order...maybe I just expected more from a restaurant with a price point like this one.
