It was so good, I wish I got 2!  The lobster rolls MmMmm I don't know what people are complaining about when they say it is small and expensive.  I'd like to see where you can get a lobster roll of this quality and size for the same price.  Probably nowhere, unless you are in Maine or something. I had the Connecticut Style, which I loved. Served warm... of course I wish there was more butter on it lol.  We didn't know there was seating next door so we just sat outside on the bench since it was warm out. It'd be nice if the employees would inform people.
