I wandered by this the other day and was pleasantly surprised by the tasty lamb gyro (with extra feta), the prices, and the friendly guys working the cart. Nice to grab something from here and then sit enjoying it in the plaza across from St. Bart's while soaking up some sun. Too bad I discovered this place at the end of Summer...
