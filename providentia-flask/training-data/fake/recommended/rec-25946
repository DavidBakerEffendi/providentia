Came here for an anniversary with my girlfriend, and I can easily say that this is the best dining experience I've ever had. We ordered the chef's 8 course tasting menu, and every dish, every molecule on the plate was phenomenal. Service was great. The waiters are extremely knowledgeable about food + wine. Every part of that restaurant was meticulously thought out from the interior design to the waiter's presentations. We were thrilled. If you have a special occasion, Le Barricou will give you the perfect night.
