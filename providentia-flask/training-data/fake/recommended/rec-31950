Hands down, this is my official lunch spot and has been for about a year now. I usually get either a steak sub, chicken fingers or one of the many slice chooses that they offer. Prices are great and the food even better. Not to mention ownership is cool as a fan! Â Definitely stop through if you want something quick and good with quality!
