Tia Pol is small and obscure. If there weren't always a horde of people surrounding the entrance, you would probably walk by without noticing the place. They do not take reservations for a party less than 6 and the wait can be quite long but I have never minded because the tapas here are excellent. I usually give them my cell number to call me when the table is ready and go across the street for a martini. I just wish there were more decent places around to grab a drink while waiting. The times that I've been here, I've never bothered to look at the menu and just ask the waiter to decide on a bunch of dishes for us. I do this because I know whatever comes out of the kitchen will be sheer delight. Never fails. My favorites, of course, are the lamb skewers, txipirones en su tinta (squid in ink with rice), chorizo con chocolate, octupus and peppers stuffed with tuna. Mmm YUM! They also have an excellent selection of wine and the staff is uber friendly and knowledgeable. Five+ stars for Tia Pol!
