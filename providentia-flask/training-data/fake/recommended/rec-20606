Simply put this place is by far the best restaurant in the area. The food has a completely home cooked feel to it and is also amazing. Your meal will start off with Bruschetta. I would recommend the Hot Antipasto for an appetizer but you really can't go wrong with ordering anything here. Regarding meals I have tried almost every meal and they are all amazing. The desserts are also really good here and are made in house. This place is simply "as good as it gets"
