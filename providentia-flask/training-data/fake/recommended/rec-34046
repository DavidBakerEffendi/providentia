Alright, I don't give five stars unless a place blows my mind. This place did. Met here with friends. Had a tough time finding it, because the sign is from the old joint here before it. Says Indian, but so isn't. We started with five apps. Nachos, fois gras, peppers, steak tartare, & lamb. My fav was the steak tarte. It's shaped like a cow!!!! Amazing. I had duck. The duck was outstanding!!!! Â I was privileged to taste the chicken waffles, pork, & the tenderloin. All were outstanding. Come here now!!!! I high fived the chefs!!!
