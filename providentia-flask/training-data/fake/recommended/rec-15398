So delicious. A perfect spot for dinner after a walk on the High Line. Their tapas are wonderfully prepared and presented. The grilled octopus and potato salad is a favorite. The cheese plate is also lovely. Only suggestion is that they could stand to be a little flexible. We asked for some chorizo or ham as a side to be added to the cheese plate and they couldn't comply. Really?
