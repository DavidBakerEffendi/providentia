Really one of my favorite restaurants in New York. I've sampled a good majority of the menu items here and am consistently wowed by the food.  The prices are more than reasonable and the portions are just right-- no skimpy tiny plates and nothing obnoxiously huge.   I highly recommend starting off with the "selection of spreads" appetizer-- while all 4 are great, the eggplant and chickpea spreads really stood out to me-- lots of great, fresh flavor.  We wanted to make sure we wiped every last bit out from the bowl so we asked for extra pita bread, brought over to us free of charge. A favorite is the chicken souvlaki -- tender chicken with creamy tzatziki sauce wrapped in a warm, chewy pita.  Served with extra thin, crispy herb sweet potato fries and a classic greek salad, this dish makes for a great lunch or dinner.  The sheep's milk ravioli or dumplings are two other standout dishes-- tender handmade pasta which tastes like something my non-existent greek grandmother would make for me.   The wine selection is also plentiful with a wide range of prices.   The waiters are helpful and eager to share their knowledge, but service can be very, very slow.  Even during a weekday lunch when there were no crowds, it took me a while to get water, give my order and receive my check.  Waiting isn't too painful though since the decor is a beautiful, calming white and blue.  I absolutely adore the mosaic in the back by the stairwell leading to the bottom floor! Kefi, just pick up the service a notch to match the level of the food.  In the meantime, I'll continue spreading the word about how amazing this place really is.
