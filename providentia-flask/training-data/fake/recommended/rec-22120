Two words: Meatloaf Sandwich. It's just simply amazing!! As is the Mac and Cheese! Roasted chicken was pretty good and as was the Bone Marrow. The pig tails were kind of meh, so I would not recommend those. Overall very good comfort food that's good for dinner and late night. I wish it was a little cheaper, but what can you do. Def. a recommendable spot!
