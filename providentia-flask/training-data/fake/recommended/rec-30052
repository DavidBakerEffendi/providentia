Hmmmm. The food is nice enough. But at this price...not worth it quite frankly. Had the buffalo calamari which was good...but just calimari in a wings style sauce for $15. And then the Salmon and White fish combo. All local. Again, nice enough but nothing that would justify the very steep prices in here. I feel maybe they have aspirations to be more than they are. Bring prices down $5-$10 per dish and I would have given this a 4.
