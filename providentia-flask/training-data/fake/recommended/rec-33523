YAY!  MORE THAI! I thought Hyde Park had its problems with too much Thai Joints, but, well, they don't call Chicago the Second City for nothing, we again and again surmise. But, hey, this place is one of the better ones out there.  I can't even place it in my mind, in terms of its geographical location in the physical world, but it's definitely the best I've had in the BK.* If it weren't so popular that you didn't have to wait to be seated, and not in Cobble but Clinton Hill, I would give it a 4-Star. * I may add to this eventually, but Thai Restaurants I've tried in the BK are all on the same f'ing block (Myrtle).  Yes, Hyde Park and Clinton Hill share a secret bond that can only be interpersonally related to via the movie, Twin Falls Idaho.** ** Rent it on VHS to simulate the atmosphere of the 90's.
