I consider myself a regular here, one of many in the neighborhood. Cheryl seems to recognize a lot of people in her restaurant, which is telling of how addictive the food and atmosphere is. I've never had a dish here that was anything less than exceptional. My personal favorite is the jerk chicken wings, only available during dinner hours, so once in a while I treat myself (I'm not much of a dine-outer at night). Otherwise, I find myself dining in with my best friend on Thursdays for lunch. We tend to get the half sandwich/cup of soup special, a great way to get more bang for your buck. Or, I'll stop in on a weekend and get a sandwich to go, accompanied by my favorite soup special, the Cuban Black Bean. Sooo good! This is serious comfort food. Huge portions, everything is made to order, the ingredients are fresh and the dishes are well prepared. Brunch is very popular and while personally I'm not a big brunch person, the specials are undeniably amazing and again a great deal. Also, one of the only places where no matter how full I am, I always seem to have enough room for the delicious desserts. Espresso drinks are great, staff is warm and friendly and Cheryl of course is a doll. Not only is this place one of my favorites in the neighborhood, I would rank it on my list of top 5's in Brooklyn. Go Cheryl's!
