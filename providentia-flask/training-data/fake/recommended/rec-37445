Way overrated, way too expensive for what it is. Brick oven pizza doesn't need to be so outrageously costly. $13 is the cheapest pie you'll get here, and that's with minimal toppings -- and no, it's not enough to share. My vegan friend loves this place and is willing to pay $20 for a pie, so I always begrudgingly end up here. Last night I got the Regina -- the sauce and cheese are quality, I'll give it that, but the crust was soggy yet charred at the same time. I asked for some Parmesan on the side - the waitress forgot all about it, but added an extra dollar on the bill. The food runner that brought the pizzas out literally tossed them onto the table at us, and nearly burned me in the process. Then we didn't see anyone to refill our water for about 40 minutes. Although our servers were nice, albeit clearly rushed. It would have been nice not to have to shout over the loud Adele music playing also, since I was out with a friend I hadn't seen on a year and also since I can't fucking stand Adele. Maybe I don't get this whole New Brooklyn restaurant thing. I can name a million places where I could get a slice out of a brick oven that's filling, substantial and made of high quality ingredients without paying a premium for hipster mood lighting, repurposed wood and waiting an hour to be seated because Greenpoint is the new destination for bored yuppies from Connecticut looking for the next cool foodie thing.
