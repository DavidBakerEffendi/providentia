4 stars for the Taste! 3 stars for the price.  Ouch on the taste and the price left a pinch.  Something to remember.  The flavor is amazing.  Really this was an epic experience.  The flavors are awesome.  The super buttery bun sends you to heaven and then back down.  It hurts to think my gym workout went to garbage because of those 47842386 calories.   Is it worth it? Kinda.
