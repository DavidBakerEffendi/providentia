Disclaimer: I am not a professional food reviewer with a gifted palate, I'm a regular person who loves to eat. Reviewing the beer and atmosphere ONLY. I did not eat here. Its a brewery, but its a dive bar. It does not hold a candle to the atmosphere of some of the other breweries in Burlington. The one thing I will give them is their Milk Stout was epic. It gave my current favorite Left Hand Milk Stout a run for it's money!
