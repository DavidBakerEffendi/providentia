This place is FANTASTIC! We have been for breakfast twice and the red velvet pancakes are to die for. We had take out and the portions were huge. The clam chowder is delicious and the caribbean salad with grilled salmon with mango vinegrette is amazing. So worth it. Â If you dine in...be prepared to wait because there will be one because this is just how good this place is
