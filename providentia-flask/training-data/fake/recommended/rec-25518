If you are looking for a solid bbq place in the north this is not a bad option. Had the brisket, others had the pulled pork, and ribs. All the meet was delicious. But not quite the same as north carolina bbq. The fish was a dissappointment. But who goes to a bbq for fish. Would give this 3.5 stars but erred on 4. Would go back for bbq again.
