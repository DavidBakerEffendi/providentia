Phenomenal.  Treated myself to a birthday brunch here yesterday.  Walked into an absolutely adorable 'market' of fresh cheeses and meats and unconventional beverages (nope, you won't find Pepsi here).  I was pleasantly surprised to hear the wait would only be "a couple minutes".   Sure enough, 10 minutes later we were seated at a nice corner table with a great view of the street.  After much debate on my end, I went with the white bean & escarole soup.  My friend ordered the burger.  The food took a while, but honestly, the space is so cute and relaxing that I really didn't mind. And once we got our food, I could instantly tell the wait was worth it.  Friend's burger was GIGANTIC and soooo yummy (I would know, I stole half of it from him).  And the fries were so flavorful.  My soup was also good.  Very hearty - I can see why they charge $9 for it.  Just a tad on the salty side, so I probably won't order it again (plus that burger is just too good to pass up). Overall, an outstanding experience.  Our service was impeccable, the meal was delish, the people-watching was as interesting as ever, and I just felt so uber-cool inside the place. Can't wait to check it out for dinner.
