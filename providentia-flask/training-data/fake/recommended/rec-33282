The line goes fairly quickly since they will start taking your orders before you get to the cashier.  You can also opt to sit at the counter and be served your food.  We got the typical roast park with provolone and broccoli rabe.  Pork was fresh, but if I had to do it again I would have gotten it with spinach instead of broccoli rabe.  The broccoli rabe made the sandwich a little on the bitter side.
