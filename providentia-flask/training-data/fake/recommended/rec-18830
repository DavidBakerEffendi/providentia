The last three times I've gone in, I've had terrible service. I live in the area, and Devil's Den used to be our go-to place. The ambiance is cozy and fun, but it doesn't make up for the service. While the food is tasty, but the daytime service just sucks. I'm sorry to say this, but it's true. The service is slow, and the daytime guy bartender/waiter I've had the last few times I've been there is particularly cold and unfriendly. Once when we walked in--and would have been just the second group of people in the entire place--the waiter/bartender actually sighed audibly with frustration. The pace of service, even when the place is nearly empty, is painfully slow. This place shouldn't feel unfriendly, but it does.
