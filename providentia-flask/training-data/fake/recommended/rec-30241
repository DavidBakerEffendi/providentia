What a total disappointment. Please see the review before mine by Valerie V. Our reviews go hand-in-hand! As Val said, we stopped in here for lunch. I was pretty excited to try this place since I always see it on the Yelp homepage and I LOVED the hand pulled noodles I got from Xi'an Famous Foods. Well the verdict here is very "meh". The broth was boring, I'd prefer the pho broth at Nha Trang, the noodles were flavorless, the service was terrible. When our food came out we couldn't even locate a spoon. They served us at different times so I sat around twiddling my thumbs for about 10 minutes while watching Valerie eat. I asked when my food would be coming and they pretty much gave me a shrug and "it's coming". They could have at least tacked on a "sorry". Yeeeeaahh... I'm disappointed. I was hoping this might be a new hot spot for me to visit during lunch but now I have no plans to ever come back. ((sad face))
