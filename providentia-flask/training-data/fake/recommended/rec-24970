Started off with our usual...fried goat cheese in a wonton, delicious! Hubby had the lamb shank, meat was falling off the bone with a side of rissotto, good combo. I had the feta chicken with a side of mash, very good moist and tasty chicken (I try chicken everywhere and this was perfect). Â For dessert we had the daily special warm pecan pie with side of vanilla ice cream. Perfect way to end off a great meal. I'm so sick of Italian restaurants in SI, so I definitely thank Julian for bringing us this great option alongside Beso and Bayou! Came on a Friday night, good thing we got here b4 7, it was packed with a wait by the time we left. Waiting bar area is really nice though!
