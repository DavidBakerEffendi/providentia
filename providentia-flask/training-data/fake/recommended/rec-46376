Almond has tasty comfort food, great service, and is baby friendly. Â They even have baby food on the menu, which I thought was really cool. The manager stopped by to find out how we were doing which was a nice touch, and even escorted me to a 'special' bathroom with a changing table, a rare find in NYC restaurants from my recent dining experiences with le bebe. Our table enjoyed sharing the side of brussels sprouts with bacon and candied walnuts, and a very flavorful and tender marinated octopus. The mac and cheese with prosciutto and truffles really hit the spot for me on a cold night. There were many good options for a rich dessert, though after gorging on the mac dish I opted for ice cream - the pineapple sorbet was somehow creamy, while the blood orange creme fraiche sherbet and grapefruit sorbet were both great palate cleansers. Fair prices, not too loud, lots of space. I will come back next time in NYC.
