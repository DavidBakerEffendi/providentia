We live in the neighborhood and while we have mixed feelings about how quickly our neighborhood is changing, I can't say we complain about the convenience of having good food like Frankie's around the corner. There's normally a wait, but they accommodate people at the bar, or you can go next door, chill at prime meats (from the same owners) for a nice drink until your table is ready.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the staff, always friendly, and the food CONSISTENTLY good.  Whenever possible they like to use local, in season fare. The cavatelli is my favorite, but we've tried everything from the ravioli to the gnocchi - and it's always yummy! I probably shouldn't be promoting the popularity of this local favorite, but since it's too late for that - Go!
