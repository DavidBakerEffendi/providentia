Great brunch! Seating - varied. Some spacious round tables, some small 2 tops, a few booths which are great for small groups. Service -  inconsistent. Some of the servers are far more competent than others so it's luck of the draw really. Often have to chase them down for service. Many of them don't write the order down. This makes me nervous - I wish they'd just write it so I could relax! Drinks - They have a decent selection of thirst quenchers. I usually stick to regular coffee when I'm here. It's certainly not the best I've ever had and not the worst either. Food - I've only ever come here for brunch.  My top picks are eggs with perfectly toasted 7 grain bread, warm oatmeal if I'm feeling chilly or the fruit platter. There's an abundance to choose from. The portions are gigantic. Annoyingly so. Your plate is so filled with food there's no room for manoeuvre. Also, such overt waste is a shame. They could do with halving the portions,  literally. Toilets - an experience! Only if you must To me Bubby's is a morning only kind of place. I don't want to spoil it by coming here for dinner - I'm more critical after 5p.m. and I have a feeling it would be a let down. So for now it shall remain my hangover failsafe.
