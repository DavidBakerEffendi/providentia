Came for dinner on a Saturday night. Didn't have reservations so we asked if there was any first-come, first-serve space at the bar. We were told there was a separate list for seating at the bar, so we put our names down on both. Five minutes later 3 people came in and asked if there was anywhere they could sit and order food - they were immediately shown to a high table area across from the bar and told it was first-come, first-serve. They grabbed the last seats. After inquiring, we were told "oh, well you asked about the bar...that's different." Whatever. By the time we were finally seated, only the late-night menu was available. Appetizer of charred artichoke hearts was delicious, but both pasta dishes (tonarelli cacio e pepe and orecchiette with lamb sausage and broccoli rabe) were decent, but too salty. Maybe they put the "B" team in the kitchen for late night service. I wasn't impressed.
