Came here with a friend on a sunday at 5pm because i had a living social deal. Brought a few months back, used it two weeks ago. Apparently the establishment is under new management and the place was emptttyyyy! Food was wack and the only bartender there was also our waitress Â and dj. Gets two stars for their lychee martinis!
