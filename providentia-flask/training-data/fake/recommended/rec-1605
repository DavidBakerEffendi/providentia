Wish I could give it 0 stars. Visiting Philadelphia and Geno's/ Pat's was mentioned to me by several friends who were vaguely familiar with the area. Let me say this: SUBPAR. I could get better cheesesteaks in California. Geno's clearly uses their reputation to get away with using only cheap/ low quality ingredients. It was not made fresh and was ready and wrapped in less than 3 minutes- essentially cold. If it didn't have the name/history this would place would no longer be in business as far as I'm concerned. If you want a good cheesesteak: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. For Philadelphia's own sake, they better have some better cheesesteak joints.
