I had business on Canal Street in Chinatown, on the day of our second big snow storm (of many this winter). I knew The Meatball Shop was sort of in close proximity, so I trudged through the heavy blustery snow northbound on Allen Street. I can be fearless when I'm on a mission, like to eat someplace that's on my list. I got there at about 3:30 and there were a few patrons, but there were mostly empty tables. Since it was my first time there, I found the menu confusing, but my nice waitress, Rachel helped me out. I decided on the Naked Balls, pork flavor which were a special (not Spicy Pork, because I don't like spicy), with BBQ sauce. The sides I ordered were Mashed Potatoes, and Market Salad. I loved the Mashed Potatoes, and the Market Salad. And, I liked the BBQ sauce on the Pork Meatballs, but I did not love the Pork Meatballs, and I love pork. Yes, they were very tender and fluffy, but they did not taste anything like pork. These meatballs tasted like they had very little meat in them, and instead had a lot of filler in them. I spent $20, plus tip and still felt hungry, & unsatisfied. The ice cream sandwiches sounded good, but now I was not in the mood for it. Â  I was so disappointed, I had high expectations after reading the yelp reviews. Did I order the wrong flavor meatballs? I'll see, perhaps I'll give them another shot, the ice cream sandwiches alone could entice me.
