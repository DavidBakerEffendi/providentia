Their sangria is very tasty and so is their garlic bread. My family likes to dip the bread in the left over garlic sauce from their shrimp appetizer. The potato chips are great and so is their rice. I always go for the salmon and I can't say anything bad about it. I really like this place and it's great for family gatherings.
