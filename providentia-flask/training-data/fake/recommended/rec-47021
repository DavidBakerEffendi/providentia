The food was delicious. I got a Crisp African Falafel, and the sandwich literally got better as I kept eating it. The place was clean, but small, so there wasn't any room for many of the customers to sit. However, being located right next to Bryant Park, my friend and I easily got nice outside seating in the beautiful weather.  Not sure how I'd feel if it was winter though. The only blip was that they seemed to have forgot my friend's order.  I was 309 and she was 310. They called 309, I picked up my order. Then they called 311, 312, 313. And we got worried.  They said they thought someone else already picked up 310, which is definitely possible (other people walked up to the counter), but we were standing very closeby and listening for 310.  BUT, there was no fuss, and they made her the falafel right away. I would definitely come eat here again!
