Great place to sit outside on a weekend and have brunch. Be ready for a long wait and crowd but staff very nice, food was great great spot before seeing any theater in local area. Fringe film festival had some shows in area last weekend so maybe a bit more crowded than usual. Worth the wait. Specials always inventive!! Enjoy!!
