Really enjoyed the mac & cheese here. The combination of cheeses was delicious and the crunchy herb panko was the perfect textural touch! Had some of my boyfriend's french fries and they had a wonderful crisp bite to them without being overcooked. Mmm! The servers are all also very attentive and my water glass was never left empty. Will definitely come back for more!
