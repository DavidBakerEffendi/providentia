I revisited this place on 12/7/2010, and I have to tell you that I had the absolute worst experience here. We ordered a simple egg omelet with roast pork dish and it was seriously undercooked. We also experienced a lot or racism. The time before we got in, enjoyed our meal, then left, and experience only mild racism, but this time, the waiters were blatantly racist towards us!! We're both hispanic and there was no need for that.
