I just moved to bay ridge and was elated to find this bar is a walk away. A bar for the beer and hot dog connoisseur, this place goes through single kegs of delicious micro brews from all over the state and country in days, and you get to go on that journey with them. Helping you along the way are delicious customizable hot dogs! My favorite is the Bridgeview: Bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog with red onion sauce - sound good? Want to add chill, caramelized onions, peppers and siracha aioli? MmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMM WHY ARENT YOU HERE YET!?
