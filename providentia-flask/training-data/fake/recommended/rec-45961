Holy S'Mac!!!!! That was some of the best mac & cheese I've ever eaten. Hubby got the burger and even the aioli was fantastic. I was the opposite of judged for my want of the cheesiest cheesy mac on the menu WITH bacon and steak- Tori complimented my combo :D They had Lost Nation on tap, and we were even happier campers. Wowzers !!!!!!
