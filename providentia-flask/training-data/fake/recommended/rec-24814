I will say this about Umami Burger: The bun is an otherworldly, transcendent masterpiece of baking. You will dream about the bun - not just because of the "U" branded on it (how DO they do that anyway?) It is perfectly fresh, plump and toothsome - and not too big. I sort of wanted to eat just the bun. The rest of the experience can be summed up as follows: Things I liked: * Dipping sauces to accompany the fries (aioli, ketchup, yogurt sauce, etc). * Reasonably sized burgers. For once, the burger actually fits in your mouth and doesn't fall in your lap. * Hot, crispy fries, McDonald's-thin style. * The consistency of the burger - heavenly, dare I say. Things that were lame: * The parmesan crisp did nothing and tasted like nothing. * The classic umami burger had just the crisp and an insignificant smear of umami ketchup (bland), and a few smitherings of tomatoes, grilled onions and mushrooms. In other words, this burger was short on flavor despite all these toppings. Either step up the seasoning or put more stuff on there... but that would ruin the perfect size... problems, problems. * The truffle fries - they tasted good, but they needed more cheese sauce. Yes, sauce. The cheese was a borderline creepy queso-like consistency. * The fried pickles we got as an appetizer seriously were not pickled at all. They were still cucumbers, that had basically been fried, still retaining their cardboard-like flavor. NASTY. (Good spicy ranch accompanying sauce though.) * The d√©cor of the restaurant is sooooo 2002. And LA 2002, which is worse. Pink/red mood lighting, guys, really? This isn't a gay bar. Or VIrgin America. I totally appreciate all the care and research that went into this burger. But they would need to step up the seasoning a little for me to come back.
