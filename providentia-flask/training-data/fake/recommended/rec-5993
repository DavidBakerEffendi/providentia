I'm kind of confused, the address is the restaurant I want, but the picture definitely is NOT them, but whatever.  I am writing about the restaurant on 1600 Washington located inside the shopping complex that houses the supermarket. I've been here a few times, but this time I actually really enjoyed the food.  I was there with my parents and miss bellinda.  And between the 4 of us we shared the banh hoi with bbq'ed pork, banh hoi with grilled shrimp, and banh xio.  ALL was delicious.  The waiter we got was kind of on the dumb side, but a quick fix from the other guys, and the land was once again happy.   The food was great, but I'd have to say.  The decor, and all about feel of the place, kind of makes it ho-hum.  Definitely try the place out at least once.  Good food great price.   OH did I mention it ONLY cost us $28 ( tip included ) to feed the 4 us ?!
