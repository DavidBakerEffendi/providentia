This place is a killer deal. Downtown Philly. It's got some style but is mostly casual. I was there right at opening on a Sunday evening, and was second in a line of three -t he hostess took forever to get us seated - dealing with phone calls and such - the girl behind me threw a lot of attitude but I could also tell she comes there a lot. Service was a little distant and slow but killer deal! I got an appetizer that merged sushi with ceviche - delicious! And a great roll. Cheap wine too. I would eat here ALL THE TIME if I lived in Philly.
