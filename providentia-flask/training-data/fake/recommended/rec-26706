We went to Figs for our friends birthday party--reservations are recommended on the weekends. They were very accommodating for our large party (9!) in such a small space. They put a little candle in my friend's dessert, so much nicer than having 9 bored waiters at a chain restaurant come over with half-hearted birthday singing. We ordered several of the appetizers--they were all delicious. My favorite was the beet and haricot vert salad with goat cheese. I ordered the seafood mascarpone saffron risotto. I'm usually not a fan of scallops, but these were prepared just right. Even though the restaurant was small, you really weren't aware of all the other diners, it was very cozy. Everyone was super satisfied with their food--we can't wait to go back and try brunch.
