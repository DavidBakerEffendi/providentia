Came in for brunch today and left very impressed.  The pancakes were out of control good.  Their seasonal omelet was cheddar and sweet potato which was unique and delicious.  Washed all of this down with an awesome bloody mary.  Service was friendly.  Lots of competition on Smith St but this ranks high on the list.
