I came here today for a brunch/lunch and was extremely happy. I got the house (Barricou) sandwich and my date got the vegetarian frittata from the special menu. Both were excellent.   The chicken sandwich was almost too big, but not too heavy.   I ate up--as I was dreading my shift meal and willing to risk some lethargy--but I never felt sluggish. The fries were great. The frittata was perfect--not too much egg, not skimping on the veggies, the cheese stringy enough to not be heavy but actually interesting. The coffee was good, too.   It tasted like french press, but the waitress came out to freshen our cups and didn't charge for a second....so maybe it was just a good drip. And-regarding the waitress--me and my date are both servers and saw that she was busy (maybe "swamped"), but she did an excellent job of greeting new guests, running food, bussing tables, and keeping on top of her customers.   We pretty much decided that this is our new go-to spot for weekday lunch and brunch.   The server did a great job and the food was impeccable.   I always liked this place for dinner, but this is an extremely solid midday option...possibly the best in North Brooklyn.
