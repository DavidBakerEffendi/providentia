It's a nice place to gather and have beer. Food is just okay here. I like Belgium fries. BXL's is just okay. Mussels were not impressive. I had a cream bacon and onion mussels they were very, very salty. We also had a burger. It was over cooked and not juicy. I would suggest people go there just for the beer.
