Food: 5 stars. Ambiance: 2 Had dinner here while visiting the city for a couple of days based on a recommendation from a friend. Wow. Incredible food, drinks were outstanding, dessert was heavenly!!! Got right in and on a Friday night, no less. My only complaint, and it's a big one...we were given a great table by the front window & within 5 minutes a party of four women was seated ON TOP OF US. I'm still not sure why, but the server turned their two bistro tables long-ways before seating them, which more or less pinned me into my spot in the booth. It was a bit difficult to truly enjoy our romantic dinner as every dish that was brought to us was immediately oogled, smelled, and given a full review from these women. "What is THAT?!" "Oh you got the tuna?! I love that! Isn't it great? Don't you love it?" And "you should have gotten the fries and Gorgonzola, it's way better than the truffle Mac 'n cheese." Seriously? Go away. Between their critiques of our meal, they would then go back to openly discussing the extra-marital affair that one of them was engaged in. How nice. While I realize their behavior can't be blamed on the restaurant, I do think that perhaps our server should have noticed that there was a problem when she had to pass our drinks over to us via the table BEHIND us. Come on y'all, just use a bit of common sense. Most important point...I left with a full, happy tummy and an outstanding impression from the food. I wouldn't miss it my next time visiting NYC. And I guess that's what really counts in the restaurant biz!
