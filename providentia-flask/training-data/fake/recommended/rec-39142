What's not to love. I can be at The Tale, 3 different times during the day, and it will be 3 different places -- long way of saying, something for everyone. I can 3pm it:  Happy Hour -- woo hoo I can 6pm it:  Early bird special with my aged Mom who lives across the street I can 9pm it:  Rock on -- music or football or both !!! The best is the Lobster special...or the 1/2 rack of lamb.  Cheap, but top notch eats...gives meaning to good bar food. I always know at least 3 people in the joint,  which can either be a plus or a minus --
