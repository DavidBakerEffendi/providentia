I try to stop at Yuca whenever we're around Thompkin's Square Park, great mexican food.  Always good service, consistently good food and really good sangria and margaritas.  I'm a huge fan of this place, try the meat platter for two its SO good, the flavors are savory and the meat is fork tender.  If you're walking by I'd definitely suggest stopping in and checking this place out.
