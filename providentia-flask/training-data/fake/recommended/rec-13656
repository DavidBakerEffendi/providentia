We ordered the roast pork with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone after seeing it featured on Man Vs. Food. Service was fast and the sandwich was fairly large.  The bread was nice and soft, the broccoli rabe was interesting (reminds me a bit of mustard green, slightly bitter), and the sharp provolone was a great cheese but the the pork was not so hot. Though they do add a little au jus, it wasn't enough to save the sandwich from being quite dry.  I was honestly so disappointed because although the flavor was not bad, the sandwich was just unpleasant to eat after a while.  I was also bummed that the cheese wasn't melted.  Maybe if the provolone was more ooey-gooey, it would have helped make it gown down the hatch easier. I probably wouldn't go back.
