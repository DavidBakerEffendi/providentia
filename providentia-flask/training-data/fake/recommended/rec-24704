The place is wonderful. The service is fantastic and worthy of a very expensive restaurant - while this place isn't exactly cheap, it's not outrageous either. The food is good and nuanced, but the portions are a bit on the small side. The 3 course dinner I had left me desiring just a little bit more and I am not a big person who needs a lot. Nevertheless, the place is worth a visit. The bar area is also very nice, I have to say they have the most comfortable bar chairs I have ever sat in - I hate those high stools, but these were nice plush chairs!
