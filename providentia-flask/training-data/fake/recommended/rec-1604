I wanted to eat Chinese food in Chinatown and found this place with so many reviews, many of which were very positive. I put the address in my phone, pretty big sign, so it wasn't too hard to find. Our server was not too friendly, but I wouldn't call her rude. I have never had oxtail before, so I just had to order the oxtail noodle soup. Our food came out pretty quick. The soup was unlike anything I ever had before. I would compare it to Pho, but had less strong broth, different noodles, and lots of bones (meat was still attached to the bone, so I had to eat around it). As long as you are aware of the bones, they are big enough to easily eat around. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful. The noodles were a wonderful consistency. I liked it without adding any condiments, but did add chili paste, just because I like extra spicy (I think that's what it was). I remember it being somewhere around $8, so a great value for the price. My friend got a hot vegetable noodle dish and said it was very good. I had a wonderful experience here and would definitely be back if in the Chinatown area again.
