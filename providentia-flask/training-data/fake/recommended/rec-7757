Definitely a fan. Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles is a pretty authentic joint where you can get tasty Western China dishes for a very cheap price. You'll sit down at a table that's poorly kept by American standards, and you'll hear from the kitchen a loud pounding sound of dough being slammed onto the table, hence the name of the restaurant. The stir-fried noodles here are a tad oily, but they taste great nonetheless. I always go for the steamed dumplings and the cold cucumber dishes as an appetizer. The beef noodle soup here, as simple as it sounds, might just be my favorite in Manhattan. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and craving good Chinese food. Don't opt for dim sum -- dim sum sucks.
