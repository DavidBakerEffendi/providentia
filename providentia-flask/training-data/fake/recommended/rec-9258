Kefi is one of those neighborhood restaurants that is low-key and serves up generous portions of hearty, comforting food. I stopped by the other night when it was well below freezing and it was just what I needed. The place is bustling with locals and isn't packed full of ridiculously good looking people. The place is a far cry from cramped dinky restaurants in the West Village. When I first walked in, I thought it was just the front bar and tables, but then noticed a mezzanine level with additional seating. But turns out, we were seated in a pretty vast underground basement. We started with a white bean and spinach soup which tasted very home-made, freshing and tasty. Followed this with lamb chops, a special menu item. This came on a bed of lightly seasoned rice and spinach which worked well together. We also ordered the shrimp orzo, a light dish that hit the spot. I am always a bit skeptical of places with reasonable prices. Call me a cynic, but usually the portions are skimpy or the ingredients suspect. Not so here. You feel like you're getting your money's worth at Kefi and we left pretty full. So glad it's closeby home. I'll be visiting more often.
