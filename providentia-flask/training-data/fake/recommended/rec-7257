Sorry but these can't be the best burgers in the city... The only real flavor from this burger comes from the bacon, and you can't really mess bacon up.  We waited an hour only to be underwhelmed by both the burger and fries.  My search for a good burger place ever since the amazing Burger Shoppe closed down will continue... and no Shake Shack isn't it, they're mediocre burgers too.  Their shakes are awesome though... On the plus side, their beers are cheap (but small), and their burgers are relatively inexpensive (~$8 for the most expensive one).
