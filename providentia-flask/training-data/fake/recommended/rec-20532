Just got back from a study break, and Taboonette is mmmmm at a great price.  A freshly made sandwich for $5 plus tax - hard to beat! The place is cozy, with about 20 seats.  Nice interior, including a wall of firewood (it works).  And it's the real deal:  there's a little brick oven in the back of the kitchen.  Everything looks very clean in here too. I had the Israeli breakfast sandwich.  Nice and warm, the pita was perfectly fluffy, and not too much of any ingredient.  There was labneh (middle eastern spreadable yogurt cheese, it's basically thicker than "greek" yogurt, but a spreadable cheese), cucumbers, tomatoes, olive oil, and za'atar (sesame, salt, and a blend of herbs, including thyme).  A hearty, healthful snack that doesn't leave you too full. The honeydrop drink they were selling also looked interesting.  That I will try with another sandwich next time!
