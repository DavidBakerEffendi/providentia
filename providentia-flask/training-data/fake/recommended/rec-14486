5 stars for the stripes! They call that flatbread and cut it as straight stripes instead of slices, but to me it's one of the BEST pizza I had so far in this country, I mean, in the USA! I'm an European living in NYC and it's definitely very close to the best Neapolitan pizza you can find. Locally grown and organic, the toppings are incredibles. And it's a brewery too, excellent draft beers. Staff is super nice and helpful. A must go! Salad was good, but nothing to mention about... Go for the pizz....ops sorry, flatbread !!!!!
