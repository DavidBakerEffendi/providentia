Dover has the feel of a neighborhood restaurant - a very sophisticated one, for sure, but as inviting and welcoming as I always imagine the ideal neighborhood restaurant to be.  Even though our reservation was for a rather early hour, the restaurant already exuded a lively, excited atmosphere. Lingering over some interesting-sounding (and tasting) cocktails, we opted to order a la carte.  The hamachi appetizer was good but hamachi, as tatar, ceviche, in whatever form, has become a restaurant cliché, so it is hard to get excited even over a lovely version.  The oysters with choron sauce were really good, so much that I wished I had ordered them without the strong sauce and just enjoyed their briny excellence.   Squid Ink Tagliatelle with peekytoe crab was the star of the evening, beautifully cooked home made pasta, studded with sweet crab and nestling in a pool of Meyer lemon enhanced sauce.  It made for addictive eating.  We also loved the Octopus with butter beans, chorizo and Piquillo pepper.  The nicely charred pieces of octopus went beautifully with the rich beans, the very sweet pepper, and the spicy sausage.  A winner.   The same can be said of the broiled lobster with a small dish of delectable spinach.  The mackerel with broccoli de Cicco greens and chestnut pieces was another full-flavored, tasty dish, a bit on the heavy side, as is the case with a few of the offerings.  Because of that, we only managed one dessert, a "deconstructed" vacherin with two different ice creams.  Very good. I give the food 4.5 stars but factoring in the attentive and friendly service and the fun and homey atmosphere, it is an overall 5!
