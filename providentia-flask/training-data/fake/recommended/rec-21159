Been there on a Sunday for brunch with friends from Italy. The place is cosy and service is nice. Could be a bit more attentive and refill coffee or orange juice without being asked, but it's not a big deal. I liked almost all. My crocque madam was very good, rye benedict were delicious too, the salmon benedict too. I was not too fond of the donuts, made to order but too crumbly and with too cinnamon, for my personal taste. Mac and cheese very big portion, good but not wow. Or maybe I was fuul already.. Next time I'll order it again to re-try it! Considering the classy but ancient style of the restaurant, restroom was in line, but flush not working at its best. That, I would make it more modern!
