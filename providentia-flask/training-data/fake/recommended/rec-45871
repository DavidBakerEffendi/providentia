A friend of mine introduced me to this cafe. She said that Bayonne has a "healthy cafe." At first I didn't believe, and then went with her to have a meal. I ordered the veggie burger..and of my goodness, it was the best burger I have ever had. There falafel wrap..not sure if I spelled it right. It is stuff with avocados. Really great eating spot. Love it.
