Food was a C/C- at best. The burgers are offered with sauces I had never heard of nor could the waiter describe. I ordered the lamb burger which was very dry, tasted weird, and was served with the wrong sauce. Finally, we were served the food with the right sauce which did not improve the experience. The only good part of the meal were the Mongolian dumplings which probably came from the Trader Joe's frozen section. Cocktails were expensive. Decor was weird. Was the place trying to be a Parisian bistro or Mongolian cafe? Why was there a deer head on the wall? Was it a hunting lodge? The ladies lounge was a powder room/lounge. What the hell is Sassafras cafe? I dislike places that have no concept and aren't sure what they are trying to be. I would only suggest this place if every other place in Old City is swarming with people.
