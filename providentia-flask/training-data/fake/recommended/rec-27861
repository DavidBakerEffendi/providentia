Great cocktails, solid Cuban food, a few small suggestions to improve Pros: 1) The passionfruit cocktail will make you think you're back in the Caribbean. Delicious. 2) Great palomilla steak, hearty portions at a reasonable price 3) Good music and nice atmosphere Suggestions: 1) Went for lunch / brunch once. Tried to order the pan con bistec (my favorite), and was informed they couldn't make this at that time because the pan was being used to make eggs. Would suggest investing in another pan. 2) If you go with parents or anyone 50+, the music might be a touch too loud for this crowd. Acoustics make conversation hard to hear when music is blasting.
