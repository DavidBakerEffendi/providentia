This was the best meal I've had in CT since moving here a decade ago.  The ambience and decor match the cuisine and its easy to have a conversation without shouting.  The Smoked Duck Breast Nachos were outstanding with just the right amount of duck, spice and incredible flavor.  This is a must.  I also loved the Grilled Yellowfin Tuna with tamari and delicious deep fried spinach in chile-garlic sauce with yummy vegetable spring rolls.  I could have ended it there and been completely satisfied. Although the waiter recommended the Pot de Creme for dessert, I found it a bit much with peanut butter and wish I would have stuck with my gut and tried the Parfait.  Next time...
