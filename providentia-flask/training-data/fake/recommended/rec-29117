This is going to be a lame review. Beef chow fun was awesome.  5 stars. Pad thai, they were kind enough to substitute chicken for shrimp.  It was mad spicy, but something seemed to be missing.  I still thoroughly enjoyed it, but that 'yo no se que' kinda kept it in the 4 star region. Delivery was very fast.
