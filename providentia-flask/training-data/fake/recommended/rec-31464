4.5 Stars We had to wait around 30 minutes but all of our parties had to be there to be seated. They wouldn't let you go in not even if 3 out of 4 people are there. But the food is amazing! Savory, hence that what Umami means in Japanese, and delicious from the starters to the burger and even to their homemade ketchup. Â They have a secret menu but our server wouldn't tell us what it is but after looking it up I saw they serve cheesy tater tots. The truffle cheese french fries surprised me to be actually delicious. The fries looked like it would be so so but it actually was so freakin good. The cheese reminded me a little of shake shack but with the truffle flavor. We got the ketchup on the side and I think it's better than Heinz. Their ketchup has more texture and looked like it was organic of some kind of rare tomato. I got the original burger which is recommended to get medium rare that came with a crisp Parmesan cheese slice, caramelized onions, a little bit of shitake mushrooms and tomato. And the buns tasted like buttery hawaiin roll's in a burger bun form. It was so good and soft that eating it was pretty easy. I would bring my grandma here and tell her to leave the teeth at home. Each bite just melted in my mouth. For dessert I tried the goodwIich which was a salted cookie ice cream. Not too bad a little bit on the more saltier side than sweet but it was definitely savory cut into 4 pieces Totally worth coming back here. For reals for reals.
