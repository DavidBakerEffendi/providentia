I am giving two stars for now, but I am also going to give it a second chance on maybe a Monday because I'm not sure if the fact that today is Saturday might have contributed to our awful experience. I'm going to try to put these in order. 1. Upon being seated: some tables are too close to the door. Unpleasant in the winter months, but tolerable in the other seasons I'm sure. One of our tea cups was dirty. Pretty much never acceptable. For a table of two we had three chop sticks.....? The server took forever to get us one choptsick and a tea cup. The server actually took forever to do anything. I finished my water with my appetizers asked for another water the next time I saw him, which, was halfway through my main coarse. I asked him a second time when I stoop up to get his attention after my meal. I left without having my water refilled once. My meal came out before my husband's, we didn't think anything of that because we were warned each dish comes out as soon as it is ready so you can enjoy it at it's best. 20-40 minutes later my husband's meal comes out. I am long done with mine and his meal was cold. Very cold. At this point my husband gave up and we just focused on catching any waiter to get a check so we could leave. After waiting another 20 minutes. I just asked the hostess at the door. So the waiter finally comes back and offers to take things off the bill and we told him we didn't mind paying we just wanted to leave (mainly so I could stop by a corner store and buy a water cause obviously I wasn't getting any closer to getting one from my server.) We also asked for clean napkins, but those never showed either. The redeeming part was my meal was very tasty. (Sorry to my poor husband who's cold meal was also rubbery and gross) but mine was good. So, we are going to give it a second chance and hopefully I will edit this into a four or five star review. Long story short we were really disappointed.
