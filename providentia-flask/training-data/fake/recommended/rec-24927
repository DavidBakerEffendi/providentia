This place is built for kids ???! U mean parents pockets !!! Kids want everything under the sun !! These guys need better deal packages so these kids can have more fun .Totally not fair !! Came all the way from Spfld should or took my boy to chuck e cheese where all games r 1 token instead of 18 !!!! Smh !! The only deal they have is mon thru thur n it's like a dollar off ughh ready to go home came all this way for a b day party n they on give the kids 10 tokens !! Which amounts to two games ! Might sound grumpy but the big e tapped me out three times this week so I'm done
