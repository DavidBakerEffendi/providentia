Meh pretty much summarizes the experience here. Went with a large group for dinner and Â was underwelled by most of the experience other than finally learning about the joys of yelp from my fellow diner! (Hi Ari!) Large menu, but nothing particularly memorable. Mac & cheese was my favorite, and even that was not as cheesy, delicious, or fattening as I would have liked. My scallops were small and a bit fishy. Fig cake (who knew?!) was delicious. I wish I could have stole more bites, but clients might have been scared of my dessert stealing tendencies. Cute atmosphere, nice lightening, but nothing special.
