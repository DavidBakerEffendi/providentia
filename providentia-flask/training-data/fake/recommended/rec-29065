This was my first time trying Israeli food and I had a wonderful experience at Zahav! I really liked the interior--although the walls and tables were dark wood, the restaurant had plenty of natural light coming through large windows overlooking Society Hill. As the sun began to set, candles were lit at each table. All of the employees were friendly and helpful, and our waiter was very eager to answer any questions about the menu. I noticed that there were quite a few employees in general so there was no problem in getting our water refilled. As others have mentioned, the tasting menu is the way to go. You can share the salads, bread, and hummus, and then choose 2 small plates and 1 large plate. In addition, each person gets a dessert. This was a great way to try various items on the menu AND the price was fairly reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. Some of the highlights during our meal were the salatim (all of the salads were delicious), Turkish hummus, braised chicken, cardamom-vanilla custard, and the mint lemonade was the perfect drink to accompany the meal! I'd definitely recommend trying Zahav when you're in Philly
