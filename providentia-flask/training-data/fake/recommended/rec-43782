Good atmosphere. Interesting menu - ok wine selection, menu items add up fast. Decent portions for tapas. Flavor and prep could improve (our "crispy rice cake" was mushy risotto with charred mushrooms). Food went right through us (we made it to hotel-60 Thompson-just on time). Â Good atmosphere, wish the food was better.
