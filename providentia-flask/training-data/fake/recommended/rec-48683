delicious seafood pad see ew & seafood tom yum. so much flavor! i was happy cuz their tom yum broth was right unlike upthai's tom yum. coconut shrimp & thai iced tea was standard and good. service was quick. their portions are so generous btw. i realized that when i ate some leftovers the next day which filled me up completely.
