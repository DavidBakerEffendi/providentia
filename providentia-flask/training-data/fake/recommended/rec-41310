What should have been an easy night at the bar, ended up being a poor experience due to untrained and flat out rude staff. I came here with a group of friends after attending an event next-door. The table service was horrible. The drinks took forever to come and a friend's order was completely forgotten. Once we were FINALLY "allowed" by our waitress to order food it took over 45 minutes to get to our table. When we received our bill it was wrong. The real annoyance of the night was this bars "4square promo" which advertises a free shot of whiskey or tequila. When I tried to order the free shot, our waitress said that I could get it after our first round of drinks. After ordering the round I tried again, only to be told that I would need to walk up to the bar to get my shot. I went to the bar, where I had the pleasure of encountering the rudest Irish bar tender I have ever met. He aggressively refused to give me the shot and tried to start a screaming match with me, referring to the "fine print" on the offer. (Which by the way says nothing about the first round having to be bought at the bar).  I left unhappy and without my shot.  The bartender could have cared less. On the plus side.... This bar has good French fries.... That's about the only good thing about this place.
