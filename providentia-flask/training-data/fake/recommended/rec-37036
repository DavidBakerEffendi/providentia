Who doesn't like an empanada or three?! Empanada Mama is the mecca for empanadas in New York. They are the perfect little pocket treats with whatever filling you want. Not like other shops, this place has some really unique and special empanadas. They are crispy on the outside, and HOT in the center. My favorite was the Spinach and Cheese because it was hot and oozy. The other that I've tried were really good but slightly more dry in the middle. We also tried their Oxtail Soup and it came with huge generous chunks of meaty-ass oxtail and potatoes, as well as a side of white rice. The soup was sooooo savory, rich, and good. It was on the greasy side which makes it the IDEAL HANGOVER SOUP. + Seafood Nirvana + Spicy Chicken + Reggaeton + Philly Cheese Steak +++ Spinach & Cheese +++++ Oxtail Soup Oh and they freakin DELIVER. The delivery takes forever (50min to an hour) so schedule accordingly with consideration to the long wait. They package and label everything really well for delivery so that's awesome. Don't forget to try the Watermelon Lemonade! It's super tart and refreshing, and made with real lemons!
