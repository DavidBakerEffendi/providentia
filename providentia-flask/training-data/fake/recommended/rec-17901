This is a nice local place in hillside.  They have two bars and a large hall, if your just want to stop in for a drink and a little food you can eat at the one bar by the pool table.  If you go with a few friends the other side of the bar is a little classier and have a bunch of tables to sit down at. Food:  This food here is good, if you go you must try the shrimp in galic sauce appitizer, and the clams in green sauce, they are both amazing.  For luch they make a nice fish fillet sandwhich which is decently priced.  The last time i was in there i ordered the salmon off the special menu, and it was out of this world.  A large piece the size of a steak, well seasoned, that came with potatoes and greens. At the end of the meal i could not leave before having a little expresso and booze to bring the whole meal together. I come to this place often and would recommmend it, but warning i can be a little pricey, meals 15$ and a pitcher of wine will run you about 20$.
