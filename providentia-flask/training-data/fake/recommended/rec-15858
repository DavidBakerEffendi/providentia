Came here over the weekend with a couple of friends. Da Andrea is a quaint, casual Italian restaurant with surprisingly good food. The Le Tigelle was my favorite. They are little circular flat buns that you have with prosciutto and parmesan cheese. The buns come out fresh and very hot. Warm and soft on the inside; a little toasted and crunchy outside. Conceptually simple but tastes so good--a comfort food. They make their pasta in-house from what I understand. I had the squid ink tagliolini, which was good, but not particularly impressive. Â  The service was a little slow, but our server was friendly and gave us tiny complimentary cookies at the end.
