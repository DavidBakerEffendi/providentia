The worst experience ever. My husband and I went like a few weeks ago and we sat there for over an half hour with no service while the people that came in after us we're served. We were not hidden in a corner and we were visibly. They walked passed us several times and look at us and not bother to take our order. I started to think that maybe it's because we are a bi racial couple . I may be overthinking but that's how they made me feel. My husband and I got up and they watched us leave and they made no attempt to ask us to stay. I told my husband that we need to talk to the manager and all he could say is that this has never happen and that he would get to the bottom of this. Not once did the manager offer us anything to convince us to come again. I would never recommend this place to anyone not even a dog. They also need to give better lighting because it's very dark and gloomy.
