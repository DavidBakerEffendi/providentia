Wooo Hooo! Finally a breakfast place in Newington that we can even bicycle to to do a pre-breakfast calorie burn before we load up again! We LOVE Ciscos. First timers this AM, we started off with some tasty coffee, and then dug into our main courses. The juevos rancheros were delicious with authentic tasting refried beans and the green chile sauce! I had the 2-2-2 (2 eggs, 2 sausage and 2 french toast) - all SO yummy! The french toast, while at other places is little more than fried spongey wonder bread was thick, pillowy and savory! The home fries also tasted fresh and not frozen. The service was friendly and smiley, and the decor and ambience were adequate and comfy. Â Our only issue with this place is that it deserves to be in a far better and centralized location where other Newington-ites can call it home. Still that won't keep us away, not at all!
