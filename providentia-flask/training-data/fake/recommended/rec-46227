Pro: Food was super delicious and had a wide variety of choices. Cocktails were strong and the wait staff was very attentive. Con: Even though I had a reservation it still took over 25 mins to get seated. Arrived around brunch hour and the restaurant is fairly small so it's understandable. Most definitely will be back again! Great brunch spot with a cute and charming atmosphere.
