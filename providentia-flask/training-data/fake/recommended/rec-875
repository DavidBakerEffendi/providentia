For a little bit Johnny Brenda's was becoming hit or miss in the food department, but lately they've been amazing! Tonight I had one of the best sandwiches ever eaten in Philadelphia. A friggin' brisket sandwich with fried pickles, coleslaw, and horseradish on grilled texas toast?!?! Â Holy crap I wanted to order another for breakfast tomorrow!!!! And the guy was nice enough to make me a coffee to go even though they were closing up so that I could get cracked out on their in-house roasted brew while working all night. I will definitely be back this week to see if that sandwich is still available.
