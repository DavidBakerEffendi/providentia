Cafe Orlin is an eye opening delivery for brunch in the East Village. Im ashamed of myself for waiting as long as I did to try the breakfast. I had banana pancakes that were moist, tasteful, and perfectly balanced. I cleaned the plate, an unusual feat....and hungrily scanned the table for other food to gnosh. Everything here was just.....so.....damned.....delicious. My foodie companion had the millet pancakes; not a product I would have expected given the choice of ingredients. They were absolutely delicious! Nicely presented and rich in flavor, they were truly perfect. I wont go anywhere else in the neighborhood for breakfast eats ever again.
