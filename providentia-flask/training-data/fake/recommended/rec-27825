I lived in China for most of my childhood, AND my mom's favorite food is dumplings and makes it often, so I definitely know what a good, authentic dumpling tastes like. Prosperity Dumpling, you are a terrific bang for a buck, but I wouldn't say your potstickers are as good as my mom's, and the reasoning is mainly in the filling. You'd never find a potsticker in China with such a high content of fatty pork, especially when it's going to be pan-fried in oil! People there eat like, 20-30 dumplings or potstickers each for celebratory meals, and that can't happen when their potstickers have huge puddles of oil inside. I'm sure many customers find the high fat content PLUS what I detected was an extra splash of sesame oil super appetizing, but this factor made me full and a little nauseated by the third potsticker, when I could easily eat 6 of a leaner variety. Maybe the dumplings have different filling, but I wouldn't know/care; I crave the crunchy pan fried bottom of a potsticker and don't have near the same affinity for dumplings. I do love my dumplings and potstickers with thick, chewy yet steamy skin. It's an important indicator of a freshly home-kneaded dough, and Prosperity Dumpling obviously does this right. I also had some of the fried bun-shaped potstickers, and I call them potstickers rather than pork buns because the filling appears identical, which is another faux pas if I'm correct... OH WELL, it's really delicious nontheless, don't be swayed by my overly critical review, because this truly is way better than your average dumpling place!
