Came here for dinner on a weekday around 8p and was seated immediately after our entire party arrived. The lighting is dim and the decor is grandiose. There is this huge, closed off chandelier in the middle of the room. There are mirrors everywhere. The staff have cute outfits. The waitress wear these little hats (I'm not sure what they're called.) The tables either are or look like marble. Â  The food was delicious. We ate family style and ordered the pad see ew, basil sauce dish, and crispy duck salad. The pad see ew was my favorite. There was just the right amount of sauce and it wasn't too greasy. The crispy duck was great - also not that greasy (surprising for crispy duck!). The combination of cashew nuts, pineapple with chili lime sauce was tasty. The basil sauce dish was not bad. It wasn't as flavorful as the other two dishes. The modern Western atmosphere with a traditional take on Thai food was interesting. I don't think this is my scene, but I would probably come back. Afterall, the Thai food here is one of the best I've had in NYC.
