I ordered a tuna melt and it tasted and smelled like cheap dark tuna, or maybe it was cat food tuna.  I couldn't eat it.  A family owned diner as such, you never know what kind of quality of ingredients they are using in the food they serve you.  There is little to no outside control over it.  I would rather go to Panera or Cosi's where I know I am going to get good quality all the time.  The french fries were good, as was the dessert.  The service was from a woman who spoke jive and was from the ghetto.
