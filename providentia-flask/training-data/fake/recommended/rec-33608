Jack the Horse is a great restaurant and has a very cool story behind it.  Tim Oltmans is a chef who made a  big move in his life to leave the traditional career life and jump into his true love.  Ask him when you are there, pretty cool story.  The service has matured well and Tim's menu evolves and changes in tune with seasonal ingredients and several mainstay signature dishes.  The macaroni and cheese I would ask for all three courses!!  Presentation is outstanding and overall a wonderful experience....you cannot go wrong here!!
