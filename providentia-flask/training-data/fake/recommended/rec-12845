Stumbled upon this place with friends after dinner. Ordered the Love Affair and seriously, it was so acidic it gave me heartburn the whole way through. Â I have to hand it to the bartenders though, or shall I say, mixologists-- they do concentrate and carefully prepare each drink very meticulously. The ambiance is cool, love the darkened, lit-by-candles glow. $15/cocktails. The group all seemed to love what they ordered.
