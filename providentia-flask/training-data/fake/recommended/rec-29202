Simply the best in Philly! The place is small with outdoor seating available seasonally.  Best bet is to hit this place up off peak, hours is you want a seat. Their cheese steaks are almost of mythological proportions.  They are well worth the trip no matter where you are coming from. Jimmy Fallon likes this place! What more do you need? The steaks are generously portioned, juicy and delicious. This is one of those hidden gems that you would find out about on Food Network.
