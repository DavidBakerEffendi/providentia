Would get 5stars if it was bigger. If your super hungry pass your never getting in (unless of course it's empty) which won't happen. Ate here with my fiancee one day just walking around we were saw it was new and said what the heck. After waiting a while for a seat (for two, which doesn't really exist) we finally sit down (school cafeteria style) and look over all the food on their menu it was soo much to chose from (yea so that's sarcasm). We just ordered burgers I had a beer she had a juice I think. It was GREAT! Lol thought this would be a bad review? Well it is cuz although the food was scrumptious there is no way to really enjoy it. I recommend but don't make it a habit.
