What a gem of couple running this hidden Japanese Restaurant in the middle of nowhere! Â We had a grand feast at very reasonable price. The fish was exceptionally fresh and the tempura was outstanding. The only drawback is the very bright lighting that took away from the dining experience. I asked them to turn the lights down which helped a bit. Also: it's BYOB!
