I've been here twice in the passed 2 weeks and it's amazing.  First of all, Pho is the cure for whatever ales you, for me it's usually a hangover, but the broth, noodles and meats with the southeast asian aromatics is a magical combination that will make you feel better even if you already feel great.   The service here is fast, polite and efficient.  Just walk in and take a seat anywhere and you will be greeted promptly with a menu.   There is a wide selection of proteins to get with your pho here ranging from brisket, steak, tripe, tendon, fatty brisket, etc... I went with the works the first time and was very pleased. The for those who are beginners, skip the tripe, but for me, they do it pretty well here, they fine slice it into strips so that it's palatable (it's very tough and chewy so its best if you get a bite with a little tripe and a lotta soft rice noodles. The broth is clean, clear, and flavorful.  The brisket is by far the most satisfying of the proteins and has the most beef flavor.  be sure to be liberal with the "on the side fixins" (thai basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts, and lime. Pro tip: ask for your steak on the side if you get a Pho with steak.  they'll bring paper thin slices of raw steak that you can put into the piping hot broth as you eat them so they don't overcook, as the broth is REALLY hot and the steak is REALLY thin.  Its common practice amongst the vietnamese locals. Also, soft tendon sounds gross but it's delicious and melts in your mouth. Definitely my fav place on that strip of Washington street I've affectionately dubbed "Pho Alley"
