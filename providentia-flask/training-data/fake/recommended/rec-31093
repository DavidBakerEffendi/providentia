stopped in for dinner on 8/2/12, part of their soft open. food was fantastic. we ordered several of their appetizers as tapas, and a single entree. the popcorn shrimp was amazing. the wasabi flavoring is amazing without the burn. the fried calamari was presented really well, and was plentiful. wasnt your typical deep fried calamari with marinara sauce the lamb skewers could not have been cooked any better. the pan seared scallops with mango salsa was fantastic. great complimenting flavors. the lobster wasabi mashed was incredible. gotta love real potatoes getting mashed. the wasabi again was great and the lobster finishes the flavors out wonderfully. the tofu and asaparagus dish was a typical dish really, but with great sauce. and the salmon with green curry as an entree was great. the salmon was cooked to perfection, although the curry flavor wasnt as present as i would've liked. the salmon definitely outpowered the curry. the decor was fantastic as well as the friendly and helpful staff. kudos Jane G's, kudos
