3.5 stars. Good place for a quick cheap filling meal. The knife cut noodles are yummy. * Spicy beef tendon - $8.50 Our jaws dropped when the server brought out a huge pile of tendon. We learned 2/3 of the way through the pile that the center of the mound was actually shredded radish and carrot, so the pile was a bit smaller than we thought. Slightly misleading. However, it was still big enough for 4 people to share, unless you REALLY like tendon. My mouth was on fire after making a valiant attempt to finish it. * Pork sauce noodles - $6.50 * Beef brisket noodle soup - $6.95 We tried both the thin hand pulled noodles and thick knife cut noodles. I liked the knife cut noodles better, but both were good. The broth and sauce definitely played second fiddle to the noodles. The pork sauce noodles were served on a shallow plate and almost overflowing. They were difficult to eat gracefully. The brisket was chewy and not exactly high quality meat. The server missed one item we ordered, but we were secretly relieved. Finishing a fourth item would have been a struggle. We didn't bother reminding him.
