The food was amazing.  We had the Turista Menu which was great.  You think that the portions don't look big, but when you start eating, you don't know where you are going to put more, but you somehow figure it out. We went there for my girlfriend's birthday dinner.  The downside is that they didn't have any Saturday reservations (I called and left a message on Monday, and they called me back to let me know - but since she really wanted to go, I asked about Friday and Sunday and got a Friday spot.). It is cash only, so hit the mac before you get there. The staff was really personable, remembering your name and being really attentive and sweet the whole time.  We sat in between two other couples who were there for birthday dinners.  We split all of our dishes (8 in total) and it was almost too much - deliciously too much, but be ready to pace yourself, not drink too much water (which seem to never be emptied), and drink the alcohol you brought with you. The menu was different than the one online, but pleasantly so. When we were leaving a first date couple sat down near us, so it may be good for a first date.  I'm not sure how I feel about that because it may be weird to be slightly orgasmic at each bite if you are just "getting to know each other".  It may also be weird to leave the restaurant and ask your date to rub your tummy..... or not. Our menu highlights were: Sea Scallop first dish with a short rib ragoux The Skirt steak dish The fresh ricotta with the porcini infused oil was delightful, but if you are one of my friends that can't eat mushrooms, it's not for you.  It's really porcini-y.   So, make reservations, go there, eat and be happy - next time we'll try more things.
