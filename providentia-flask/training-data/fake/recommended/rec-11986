It would take me an hour to tell you how much I love TOJ.  Suffice to say, it's the warmest and most inviting place in the neighborhood, and I like to think I'm in the junior-regular crowd. To start, it is a great place to eat in groups or alone at the bar.  Same goes for drinking.  The weekend brings a good crowd that hangs around the back of the bar stools, but I often squeeze my way in and sit there late night and enjoy it on my own.   For the food, everything is comfort food, and it's all so good.  The tavern tacos, the Caesar salad, the turkey burger, the roast chicken, all great.  They have nightly specials too, salads, soups, entrees, but the greatest item on the menu IMO is their meat-heavy chilli.  Perfect for the winter. Lastly, perhaps the two best attributes of TOJ: crayons on the table (when you're friends and you are at a loss for a new dinner topic) and a fire place.   Try to top this place in the West Village.  You will have a hard time.
