I haven't eaten in here yet but I've ordered breakfast delivery on the weekends from them a few times. Their breakfast selection and quality is solid and tastes pretty good. As far as their other options due to the recent poor reviews I have not patronized them for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner yet. I won't give 4 stars because I can't say "Yay I'm a fan" just yet.
