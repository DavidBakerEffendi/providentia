I know people love this place, but I'm not a fan. If you read my other reviews, you know I love mussels so of course I had to try Eulogy. First of all, I have to quip about the height of the tables. What's up with this? I'm 5'6'' and the table was at chest level. Then I got a huge bowl of mussels and I Â was like reaching over my head to eat my dinner. Second of all, the service was lousy. They switched my order with my friends and we didn't really realized until we tried each other's. And to top it all off, the mussels weren't that great. I've had better. Nice selection of beer, though.
