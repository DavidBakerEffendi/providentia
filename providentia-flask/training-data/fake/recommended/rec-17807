I have been going to this place for years when I get the chance.  Its a great place to eat.  Its just unique enough that it makes it worth the trip.  I have tried a lot on the menu but my all time favorite is the ants on a tree.  I def recommend.  Priced fair,  casual, and consistently good food and service.
