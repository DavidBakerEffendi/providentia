First time here. Trying it because of a Livingsocial deal I bought. -Clams on the halfshell- you can't go wrong with anything on the halfshell -Roasted beet salad- undercooked and flavorless -Calamari w/ banana peppers- drenched in salt, barely edible -Lobster Mac n Cheese- I love gouda but didn't care for it much in mac n cheese Lobster Roll- Bland n could've used a softer roll Overall, I doubt I'll be back. Service was great but not good enough for me to return.
