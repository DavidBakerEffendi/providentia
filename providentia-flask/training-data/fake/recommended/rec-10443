i really can't say enough about the service at caffe linda - attentive and super-friendly without being over-baring or disingenuous. i always wonder why this place isnt more packed sometimes - but i suppose thts an upside for us.  the space isnt fancy but it's super cozy and inviting.  definitely a diamond in the rough - for the midtown tourist trap neighborhood. ive tasted other dishes, but ever since ive had the black linguine w lobster dish, i havent tried anything else.  also worth mentioning, the majority of their appetizers always impress - fresh and very yummy.
