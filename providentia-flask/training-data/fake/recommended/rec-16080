Why oh why can there not be a place like this in Atlanta? I could not wait to try this place after being directed here by the hotel concierge. I did a little Yelp research and we were on our way. I was happy to hear that the kitchen was open until 2 and they didn't take reservations. Already a good sign. My family and I were greeted by an incredibly nice hostess who chatted with my sister and I for a few minutes while we waited for my parents. She sat us at what I thought was the best table in the house-right in front of the adorable litlte fire place. The atmosphere in here is so romantic!!! Candlelight and all. Our server was awesome. The wine-incredible. The Argentinian Malbec was melt in your mouth delicious. We had the Coppa, Speck and Veal Meatballs to start with-all delicious. By the way, the olive oil they put on the table is like none I've ever tasted. So fresh and light. MMMM. I shared the Mezzalune and the Ricotta Gnocchi with my sister. It was a close competition, but truffle/cream always wins. It was soooo good. We had the fresh strawberries and marscapone for dessert and that as well, was exceptional. I would love to come here on a date, but it was a great place to eat with the fam as well. HIGHLY recommended!!!
