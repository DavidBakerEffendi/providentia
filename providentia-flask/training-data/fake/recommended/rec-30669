Three girls walk down a dark NYC alley... No, it's not the start of a horror movie, but rather the start of a great dinner and a fun new restaurant to try.  A friend recommended Freeman's when I was trying to find a restaurant that was both casual (aka walk in in jeans) and amazing for a business dinner, and while I didn't go there, I tried it tonight with friends instead. First off, the fact that it's down a dark alley on the LES means I'm already amused, and the taxidermy decor (think the dive bar nearest to the inn in 'The Shining' was highly entertaining as well.  For someone whose job is to talk to people, the host was awfully surly and didn't seem to want to seat us. (Given the no reservations, we were there at 6:00pm on a Monday evening. Needless to say, there were seats...) The artichoke dip is fabulous. My companions really liked the endive salad, the estonian meat pies and the trout as well. The wines are rather overpriced ($11 for a riesling), and the main dining room gets a bit loud, but otherwise I liked it.
