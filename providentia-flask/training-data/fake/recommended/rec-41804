In my initial review I had considered commenting on feeling as if I'd gotten bad service from a biased staff, but I didn't mention it for fear of sounding paranoid or like a whiner. But after looking at further negative reviews and especially the one from Tina C., I'm pretty sure the staff here give different service to different people. Hey, Petite Abeille, try treating all your customers the same.
