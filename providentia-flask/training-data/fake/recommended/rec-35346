I'm not sure I'd give this place the title of "Best Tonkatsu in NYC", but it's definitely up there. Go-Go Curry does a better one. This place is really nice, albeit a bit pricey for tonkatsu. Food is good, and like a real tonkatsu place in Japan they give you mortar and pestle to grind your sesame seeds and sauces to add in. All in all it's really solid, food-wise. Customer service is good too. I speak of experience. My partner, who is a bit of a spazz at time, managed to send his water and soda flying off the table and crashing onto the floor. Staff cleaned it with nary a blink and didn't give us any crap. Crowd/decor is fine. Times I've eaten there on the weekends there's usually a couple of Japanese families have their dinner there. I would say if you're coming here for KatsuCurry and decor is not a factor, I just haul it over farther to Go-Go Curry. Better katsu and curry and no need to leave a tip.
