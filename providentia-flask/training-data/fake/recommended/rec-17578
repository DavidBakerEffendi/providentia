Friends had recommended Cuban Petes numerous  and I never got the chance to go until recently. it was amazing.  The atmosphere drew me in even more then the smell of the food. The music is fun and just loud enough. The décor is vibrant and authentic. My food although took a bit to get to the table was well worth the wait and I got one of the best cappuccino I have had.
