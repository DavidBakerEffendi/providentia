My husband always insists that we eat at BIG WONG for lunch when we go to Chinatown.  The congee there is my favorite, it is the best within the tri-states. Roast pork is good but now-a-days you can find many places that serve up good roast pork.  The place is always packed during lunch so be parpared for only elbow room or sharing tables with other patrons. I always found it quite interesting that a lot of Americans eat there and they all seemed to have been there before and are accustomed to the hustle and bustle of the wait staff and seemed to really enjoy the food.  I also see different generations of Chinese folks who enjoy eating there.  BIG WONG has been there for a long long time and sure it's one that would be in the history book for NYC Chinatown.
