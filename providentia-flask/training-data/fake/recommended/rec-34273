Stage house is about 2 minutes from our house and we have been going there for almost 3 years. Whenever we go there we can expect a great meal. Their food is always exceptional, and if it's nice outside you can sit on the patio which is really nice. Went recently for Mother's Day brunch and they did a great job accommodating the massive amount of people who were there, and the dessert display was really impressive. There desserts on the menu are awesome as well and a favorite is the creme brûlée. The reason why I'm not giving stage house 5 stars is because recently I called to set up an event there and after playing phone tag for about a month and speaking to 4 different employees I was never able to officially set something up. Having previously had our wedding rehearsal dinner here I was thinking this would have been a lot easier since we had no trouble last time. One of the employes I spoke to even admitted that they were "all messed up" when it came to their banquets at the moment because an employee left. If you are going for brunch, lunch, dinner or there BBQ on the patio-you will probably have an enjoyable experience. However, I wouldn't recommend setting up any sort of function there until they get there act together.
