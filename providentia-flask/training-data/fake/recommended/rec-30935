This is the best burger in NYC.  It is a no frills kinda place though so be prepared to not get a shake on the side.  Be a man! Get a beer! It's best to go for lunch, before the crowds show up. Yeah, the burgers can be a little pricey but this is NYC and you pay for what you get. Lastly, be prepared, it's cash only.
