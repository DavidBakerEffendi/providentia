il Panino is truly my favorite Deli, you walk in there and you fell like you just went home for lunch! Everyone is friendly and happy and make you feel like Family! Although I get the chicken salad almost every time, all the salads are amazing! The wraps are sick! and the bread from calandra's compliments the sandwiches! It seems like you get addicted to this place very easily! The reason is! it truly is the best deli around!
