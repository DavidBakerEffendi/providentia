Acceptable but not special beer selection, cover charge on Saturday night to hear a cover band that you have to scream over for your friends to hear anything you say, and the icing on the cake is how abhorrently rude the staff by the front door are (including coat check). Some of the other patrons were definitely part of that incredibly annoying barely 21 crowd that cant take two steps without spilling everywhere. We went here for a friends birthday and I will be sure to never come here again. Additionally, the ladies room was absolutely atrocious. No thanks!
