The french fries here are better than what can be had across the street, but in two recent visits I was very disappointed by the amount of "gristle" in the steak meat.  In each case it was so bad that I had to remove the meat from my mouth because it felt like I was chewing on a rubber band.  The steak sandwich also fell apart as I ate it and my hands were covered in juices.
