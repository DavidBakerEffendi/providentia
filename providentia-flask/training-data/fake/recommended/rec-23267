We went for the Sunday prix fixe ($33 each) 5-course tasting menu.  The food was very, very good.  BUT, there were a number of issues.  In the 2 hours we were there, we must have spent 10-15 minutes actually eating.  How long would it take to eat course #2, after all--a pan-seared scallop?  That's right, a scallop. Preceded by a10-15 minute wait and followed by a 10-15 minute wait. Course #1 had been a skimpy salad.  Courses #3 and #4 were grilled octopus and sea bass, which was REALLY good, incidentally. Each plate had a teaspoon or two of something special on it, like pureed cauliflower or roasted potatoes.  Special but minuscule. The food was room temperature, as was the water in the water glass, which was refilled often by the attentive server.  Dessert was a ricotta-filled warm doughnut, about the size of a Dunkin' Donuts munchkin, and a "serving" of pumpkin toffee ice cream, which appeared to have been scooped with a melon baller.  Coffee or tea to wash it "all" down?  My wife had a cup of tea, for which we were charged "only" 3.50.  Truth be told, my wife enjoyed the experience because it was "different."  On the other hand, I wasn't thrilled by having spent just about $90, including tax, tip, and tea. And leaving hungry.
