This is one of my favorite Szechuan restaurants, and definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the New Haven area. I have been there countless times, and I have been extremely satisfied with almost everything. Here are some of the things that I've found myself ordering the most frequently: 1) Chengdu spicy chicken, which is fried with chilis, longhorn green peppers, and szechuan peppercorns. If you like flavorful, spicy food, this is the dish for you! 2) Szechuan (steamed) wontons as an appetizer-- the slightly sweet and spicy sauce is delicious. 3) Dry and spicy chicken-- very similar to Chengdu spicy chicken, but also delicious. The chicken with pickled chilis was good, but not amazing- the texture of the chicken dish was not my favorite. Also, the soup dumplings are very tasty but very small, so there really isn't much "soup" in them. The Bong Bong chicken is a boiled, shredded chicken appetizer, served cold, in a peanuty chili oil sauce-- the sauce was great, but the chicken was a little gristly. Overall, this is a great place with very reasonable prices, and I would recommend it to anyone!
