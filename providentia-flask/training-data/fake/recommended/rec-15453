We barely got reservations online for a Sunday night! This place was poppin' when we showed up at 8:30, which we definitely took as a good sign. We got seated fairly quickly on their back patio, which was really nice! Service was good...pretty quick and impersonal, but we weren't really looking for anything more so it was ok. We started with the procuitto and mozzarella which was fantastic and then I got the baked penne and my sister got the half-moon ravioli. The ravioli was amazingggggg....my penne was good, but just penne. Maybe you could add a protein to it which would make it a little more interesting, but still really tasty pasta. I would definitely come back here to indulge in a bottle of wine and try one of their cheese plates.
