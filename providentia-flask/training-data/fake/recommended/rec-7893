Best crepe I have ever had ! This is so good , its probably the best food truck at temple. I always get the buffalo chicken crepe with blue cheese on side . It's so good and so cheap and its really big too ! I've never tried their sweet crepes but I like to one day , if I could get over the temptation of ordering another buffalo chicken crepe. The lines are really line during lunch time but the service is great , the guys working on the truck are really nice.
