Eh.  Going to give it another try for brunch, but right now not feeling super enthusiastic.  Maybe it was an off night?   Decor is AWESOME, and I love the courtyard.  So relaxing and pretty.   So. My drink was pretty good.  Definitely strong, but a little unremarkable.   The guacamole was the big downer.  It had a super smooth (too smooth) texture that seemed off - maybe they added sour cream? - with chunks of unripe/chewy avocado throughout.  Too much lime juice, not enough salt - just my preference.  The chips were nothing special. The braised short rib tacos were tasty, but a little lukewarm-ish.  Corn tortillas were great! All in all - I felt cruddy spending $51 for a "meh" meal for the two of us.  Heard they have a good brunch, so I might try it again.  If the guacamole were better, I would go back for chips and guacamole and drinks. Service was GREAT.  Maybe a little bit too attentive.
