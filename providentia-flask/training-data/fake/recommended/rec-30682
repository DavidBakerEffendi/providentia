I've always wondered what the "little red place" was...and I finally had the opportunity to check it out.  I've been a big fan of tapas, ever since returning from my study abroad in Spain.  Tia Pol serves a number of dishes, so there's something to appease everyone's palate.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria to split between the two of us, which was just enough.  The tortilla espanola was delicious - something you can never go wrong with.  We had the croquettes of the day, which were shrimp - good, but would want to try the ham next time.  Stuffed peppers weren't anything great - probably not not order again.  Marinated seafood "salad" was good - refreshing flavor.  Cheese plate was delicious, as it came with small pieces of fruit and raisin/nut bread. Small place makes the setting cozy and intimate, which is great for catching up with a friend or a date.  The server was warm and friendly, and super patient with us, as he had to come back three times to take our order (oops!).
