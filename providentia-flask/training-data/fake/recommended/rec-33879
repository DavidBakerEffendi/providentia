I've never eaten here, just giving a bit of background on the name:  Do or Dine is a play on Bedford-Stuyvesant's nickname "Do or die Bedstuy" or "do or die", for short. I hope this place is owned by some locals. In the hip hop classic 'Top Billin', Milk D of the legendary Brooklyn crew Audio Two has a line that says,  "And if you're dumb, you'll ask why. I am from that do or die..."
