Delicious Â  We shared the large meze platter and the mixed grill. Bread was great but pales in comparison to the meal. Appetizers were well seasoned and very tasty. Baba g was superb. Then came the kabobs. Chicken lamb donor and shaved lamb. All perfectly cooked juicy and again delicious. A must visit if you like grilled meat and salads.
