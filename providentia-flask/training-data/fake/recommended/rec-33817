I go to Reading Terminal every week to grocery shop, mostly at Fair Food Farmstand and The Herbiary. My husband and I absolutely love the selection of local foods, including all the goodies and fresh produce the Amish have to offer! When friends from out of town are visiting, we are always sure to bring them here to show off all of the wonderful things it has to offer, including some great places to sit down and grab a bite. Metropolitan Bakery, Market Blooms, the spice shop, and kitchen store are also favorites of ours. Whether you live in the city, or are visiting, you should make it a point to check out this historic and awesome spot!
