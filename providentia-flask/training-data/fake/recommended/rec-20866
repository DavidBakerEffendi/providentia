The oysters we got with the six oysters or clams plus wine or beer deal were not worth eating (very small and lukewarm). (And the mignonette is one of the worst I've ever had.) The clams were pretty fresh and of a decent size. The steamed clams were gross and the jalapeño-spiked broth tasted mostly of salt and jalapeño. The six medium shrimp you get for $8.50 was a rip-off. The service was so-so; they needed at least one more waitperson. We were seated quickly on a Saturday evening...that was the best thing about this experience.
