Come here and order the grilled corn off the cob with whatever entree your order!!  It's sooo good!  I had the skate wing which I didn't realize also came with corn.  It was good but the side dish one is better!  The skate was well cooked and was well seasoned also.  I found it quite tasty and it was well complemented by the flavors of the bed of veggies.  But those at the table who ordered the sauteed local flounder thought it wasn't very flavorful and a bit tough.  The old bay fries are fine, but being a girl who grew up in MD, the supposed old bay flavoring was waaay too subtle!  Barely different than normal fries.  Overall, I would return again!
