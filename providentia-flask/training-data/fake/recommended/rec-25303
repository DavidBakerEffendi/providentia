Great service, amazing pancakes and waffles, cute decor and wifi! My friend and I stopped to check it out. We planned to get peanut waffles but the peanut waffle maker was down so we ended up with the Rose special waffle and fruit pancakes, both amazing. We'll be back to try the peanut waffles for sure!
