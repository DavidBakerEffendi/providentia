Absolutely stunning food and after trying almost everything on their menu I can say it's delicious as well. When walking in you can see their kitchen is pristine and the staff are professional. The menu is expansive and even people who aren't adventurous eaters can find something amazing to order. I go on a somewhat regular basis and often bring new people each time. My only complaint would be that they seem to be short staffed so getting a hold of a waitress can prove to be tricky. Especially if there is a party in the bar.
