It was about time I met you Tia Pol. I had heard about you. That you were tasty. Impossible to get with. Oh how I love an elusive challenge. Even on a Tuesday night you have no shortage of admirers. Everyone was clamoring for your attention and a front row seat with you. We had the salt cod, deviled eggs, crostini with fig and sheep's milk, and chorizo. Oh. And about two bottles of rose between the two of us. Oh. And some muscadet too. Oh. And some almond cake. Sheesh, we just couldn't say no to you. Playa.
