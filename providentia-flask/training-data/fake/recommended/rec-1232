I've been heading here instead of the other Vietnamese quickie stops and I do enjoy it but service has been really bad lately. I had to literally stand up and wave like an idiot to get a waiter to come by to refill my table's rice bowl as well as water. The food (or whatever they ACTUALLY have out of the expansive menu listing) and ambiance is what makes it tolerable. Bo luc lac is a favorite, as well as the sizzling beef and the boyfriend likes the Ca ko to (fish in a clay pot) but I don't... I feel as though it's bland and definitely get it better somewhere else. They never have the Banh Cuon so they should just take it off the menu and the Shrimp Pad Thai just tastes weird... kind of bitter but kind of like something else..? It's kind of like they have a universal dish and just put a different sauce on it to make it taste like it, but it's not fooling me. Anyway, better than the other South Philly Vietnamese food places since it's cleaner/bigger but if you have a favorite, stay there. If you're willing to try, you won't be terribly disappointed.
