My NYC entry in my national registry of great restaurants. Roasted chicken. There, I said it. Anyone that can make roasted chicken taste like the finest gourmet entree ever conceived is doing something very, very right. Insanely simple food made the way God had intended. (Or possibly the other guy!) Damn this was amazing. I can't spit off the menu cuz I go into a food coma remembering the many great meals I've had here. The celebrities that hid here want to be invisible. just so they can keep enjoying the fare. Every trip to New York, I stop here. I would suggest you will die sad and unfulfilled Â if you never do.
