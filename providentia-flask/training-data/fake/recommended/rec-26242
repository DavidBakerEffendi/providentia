Food: 5/5 I heard that the burgers were small, but when it came out it was a good sized classy burger. I ordered the umani burger and my friends ordered the slash burger and hatch burger along with some truffle fries. The burgers were well seasoned and rich in flavor, but not overwhelming. Â  Price: 3/5 It was a little more on the pricey side, but it was expected because truffle oil ain't cheap. Ambiance: 3/5 It has a nice bar. Customer service: 4/5 Our waiter was helpful with recommendations and was pretty prompt. They orders came out pretty quick Tip: It's typically very busy, but we went at 11am when they opened. There was no wait at that time.
