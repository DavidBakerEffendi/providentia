Thoroughly enjoyed this place during my first visit. Very nice, smallish space. We sat at the bar and sampled some great cocktails suggested by the bartender (kudos for not making us pay for the ones we did not enjoy but he suggested we try). The food was excellent.  We had the queso fundido with chorizo, which disappeared within minutes of its arrival is was so damn good.  The entrees were equally well done. We really enjoyed both the orange chipotle glazed fish ribs (yes, fish ribs), as well as the lobster tacos. Looking forward to going back to try the sangria short ribs, salmon brûlée and guacamole.
