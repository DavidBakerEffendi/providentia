***********avoid ***********avoid ***********avoid ***********avoid I would put zero stars if i was given the option. We went due to a fistful of good reviews on yelp, we love spanish food and was expecting some delicious food! We get to the unmarked front door, the entryway which was a blacked out bar. We stood there looking around trying to see if anyone was going to seat us, nope. The waiter shouts to just sit down. ok. we sit down, 5 minutes pass and we get a menu and he takes our drink order he says that they have a few margarita flavors--------- the menu says frozen available. We ask for a frozen margarita....... they don't have the flavor we want or frozen!... fine. we settle with something less. At this point the waiter informs us that the bartender didn't make the mix because they were cooking in the kitchen?.................. wat. This should have been the third red flag when we should have just given up, but we prevailed. Ten minutes go by and a table sat down after us had their order taken before us and had their apps given before we even were given the chance to order our main meal. double wat. THEN we finally order and was informed that the lady cooking doesn't know how to make steak?...... the cook wasn't there apparently, he said. At this point we said we would pay for the drink and leave. The server asked why we were going to leave- we mentioned all of the below- -poor service -no host -menu choices not available -bartender as the cook he still didn't get it. If i wanted an inexperience person to cook me authentic food i would jerry rig myself some spanish food from shoprite and call it a day. How can this place be in service for "30 years" and run a business like this. Â AVOID ***********avoid ***********avoid ***********avoid ***********avoid ***********avoid ***********avoid
