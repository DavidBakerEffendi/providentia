Cash only! My newest discovery..and one of the best too. The seating outside is perfect for the upcoming nice weather. I came here solely wanting crepes. I got the strawberry, banana & Nutella crepe with fresh apple juice while my bf got the same with the addition of grilled chicken sandwich which turned out to be delish! The salad that came with the sandwich was very good. I wld like to find out where they got their produce because everything was fresh. The service was quick, may be because we were the only customers at the time(around 4-5pm). The girl that took our order was extremely nice and courteous which made the experience even better. We ate outside even though it was a little breezy. She came out to check up on us twice during the 30-45 mins we dined there. I felt really comfortable and extremely satisfied post meal. Definitely will return again.
