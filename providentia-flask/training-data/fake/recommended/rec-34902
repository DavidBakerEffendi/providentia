Lovely location. I recommend the crispy tofu general tso's dish. The tofu is pillowy with a slight crunch on the outside and soft and fluffy inside. The sauce is delicious and underneath the tofu is crisp green beans. The cheesecake is a bit too sweet to y liking, but the tofu ice cream is out of bounds! Nice staff and they are very attentive!
