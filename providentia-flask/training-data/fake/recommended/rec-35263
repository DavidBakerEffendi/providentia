**funny update - agree with another commenter about how asian waitress snatches up your popcorn before you finish and crumples it up, marching away triumphantly! =( Story of how I discovered this place - I was having a mid-week dinner at Aryioshi, and while munching on salmon teriyaki, I looked up and lo & behold, across the street, right beyond the parking lot, in my direct view, there was SALT & FAT! I paused mid bite, mesmerized by the sign, almost hearing a silent voice say "Eat here now"....needless to say, the rest was foodie history... I'm surprised this place got bad reviews...food was beyond my expectations. Portions were like large sized tapas. Ideal for sharing with groups. We had the following: - Oxtail - perfectly cooked, & flavorful, great presentation, generous w/the sauce - Scallops - one of the smaller portions, but still delicious, never imagined it would go well with carrot sauce. - Caesar salad - love the hint of lemon in the dressing. Bacon could've been crispier, but that's just my personal opinion as I favor crispy bacon...maybe they can lighten up on the dressing next time? - Crack & cheese - my favorite! crispy gnocchi and soft inside with gooey cheese and bacon bits! cheese sauce alone is yummy too. - Short rib buns - hubby's favorite, although I thought the sweet "jam" was a bit too sweet for my taste. Tender cooked meat. - Bacon popcorn in place of bread - genius! just an idea, but would be fun if they rotate different flavors. - Pork Tacos - not a favorite...my portion was mostly fat so that took away from the overal experience. but my friend's taco had mostly meat and she enjoyed it. - Rice Krispies & Marshmallow ice cream - good, ice cream really tastes like marshmallows And loved the "probiotic yogurt" - it was slightly frozen, slushy and reminded me of my childhood! nice touch!
