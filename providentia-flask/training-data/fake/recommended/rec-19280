Come hungry and with a full wallet! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The buffet is great and the staff is very attentive. Maybe too attentive? If you are looking for a restaurant where you can have a quiet conversation or break up with your partner, this isn't the place for you because the waitstaff will interrupt you every minute, even if you have the red card on the table. If you want a fun meal and to try many different things, then definitely come. Oh, and I love the polenta fries.
