Its 2011. Do people still carry around "cash" anymore? Asking me to pay for my meal at a restaurant using cash would be akin to asking me to pay in rupees. I will most likely not have it. Odd remittance practices aside, I enjoyed the ambiance and my meal was good. I highly recommend the pork belly.
