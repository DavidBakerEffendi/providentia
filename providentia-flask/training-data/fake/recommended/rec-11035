I have been going to the Vietnam Restaurant since I was a tiny baby (I am now 22 years old). It is hands down my favorite restaurant I have been to anywhere! My family and I always order a large array appetizers to share as our meal! The crispy spring rolls are a must, along with the beef with grape leaves! The salt and pepper squid is another one of our all time favorites! This dish is not on the appetizer menu but is a great dish to share as an appetizer. The Vietnamese Restaurant is always my first choice restaurant for any occasion!
