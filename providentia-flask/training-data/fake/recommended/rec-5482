This place is pretty freakin' good. Cool lunch specials, even on the weekend. I always roll with the Pad See Ew since that's my favorite Thai dish. One big HOWEVER..which is it almost seems like the take out kitchen is different than the eat in kitchen. The food tastes almost completely different. The eat-in version is much better of course. Big fan..damn..I kinda want to eat there now...
