Visited based on Yelp reviews.  We were surprised to find a large, well lit, and pleasantly clean Cantonese seafood restaurant.  The wait staff was attentive and the food was very fresh.  We had three dishes... Panfried Noodles with Seafood, Tofu with Black Mushrooms, and Hong Kong Style Fried Shrimp.  All of it was very good.  I saw lots of other nice things at other tables.  Even the dessert they brought out was a surprise.  Not the normal orange slices, but a lightly sweet soup with tapioca pearls, taro, and pumpkin.  I don't often have reason to be in the area, but I will go back
