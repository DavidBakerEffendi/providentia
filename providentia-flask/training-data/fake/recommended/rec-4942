Arriving just as the pre theatre dinner crowd were leaving we were told our table would just be a few minutes. They were true to their word and we had a table in the window without a reservation on a Friday night ! We had the stuffed calamari and three dips for apps . Calamari was excellent and the dips and pita were obviously fresh. The tarasamalata was too salty for us . We had fish and a daily special with mussels , shrimp and calamari with fettuccini. The sauces for both were tomato based but totally different. I had 2 glasses of. prosecco  , which were obviously from different bottles , the second glass being much better quality. A nice upgrade for no extra. The waiter was very helpful although sometimes we waited a little for him. It is quite easy to hear the conversations all around you so not a date place maybe...the big noting lawyers next to us were quite irritating by the end of our meal... All in all a good place with nice food , on the pricy side but quality was there.We paid $150  for 2 .
