one of the best place to eat a kathi roll. even if you are veggie don't worry, they have plenty of options. I ordered achari paneer, chana masala and unda aloo roll. Chana masala was simply awesome. Even the location is right next to the biggest attraction of nyc, TIMES SQUARE! Don't get awed by the waiting line as it does not take much time for them to serve those and they are really quick. Even with so much of rush, they do not rush on food, being said, every roll will make you say yummy!!!
