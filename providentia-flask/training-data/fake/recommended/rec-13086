These noodles were so delicious!! I had the pork chop soup noodles; when the bowl arrived, the noodles were delightfully chewy and al dente. The soup was tasty; there was real flavor to it, besides just salt and MSG. The pork chop was pretty good too. The only real complaint I have is that there could have been more spinach and bok choy in the bowl, but I love a lot of vegetables with my soup noodles. When you sit down, all of your cups, chopsticks, and soup spoons are in dispensers on the table. The waitress brought out a pot of oolong tea and our dishes, but it was pretty much self-service after that. Fortunately, there are also condiments - spicy chili oil, soy, and cilantro - already on the table. I would definitely come back here again for soup noodles. I also want to try the pan fried noodles because the wok hei drifting from another customer's fried noodle dish was mouthwatering.
