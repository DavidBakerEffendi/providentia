The food here isn't bad, but it's no great shakes either. Still, this place is practically the only game in town in that neck of the woods (i.e., near Bell House), and it's a cute, pleasant place. Keep in mind that it's not very big and they don't take reservations, so if you're hoping for dinner before a big show at BH, go early.
