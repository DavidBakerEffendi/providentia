I laugh at those who complain that this place is too small.. Yes its small, we do live in NY.  Yes its cramed, but arent most of the hidden treasures?  You know its small when you look in the window from outside. If you are going to complain about how tight it is or having to scoot in when someone wants to get by, keep walking and dont come in. Nook is a neighboor hidden gem. The food is great, its BYOB so your bill is never ever expensive, and its just a cozy date spot or chill spot to go with a girl friend or coworker for lunch.  I have never been dissapointed in going there.  The one downfall, that I can say, is that in the winter, when its cold out, the place is tiny, so the draft can sometimes get ya if you are in a table that is right by the door.. but hey, again, its NYC for ya right?
