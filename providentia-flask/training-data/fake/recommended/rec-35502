Bistango - for people looking for excellent, gluten-free Italian food in a non-touristy, warm and friendly atmosphere. We tried this place on a trip to New York. It was our first night in the city - we had arrived at JFK at 3 that afternoon - and we were both exhausted. Not knowing what to expect, we arrived to find a half-full dining room with several tables obviously waiting for large parties. It turns out the large parties were coming later in the evening, which meant that groups of two and three without reservations were still able to grab quick dinners. We sat at the two person table right by the door, but it wasn't drafty or uncomfortable. Service was prompt and deft. Our water glasses never dropped below half-full, and our plates were cleared promptly, which is good as the table was a little small. The food - I have been gluten free for over a decade, and I can honestly say that their version of gluten-free pasta is the best I have ever eaten. I got the Wild Mushroom and Risotto Ravioli, and my husband got the Gnocchi. I couldn't try his Gnocchi, but he assured me it was excellent with creamy pesto and herby flavors. In my ravioli, the mushrooms and risotto were pureed together - the flavors were rich without being overpowering. And the pasta itself was delicate, not tough, chewy, or grainy like gluten-free pasta can often be. Dessert - we split the gluten free Red Velvet Cake. The cake is subtly flavored but still has a good cocoa flavor, and the cream cheese frosting was thick and tangy, the perfect compliment to the sweet cake. We will definitely return!
