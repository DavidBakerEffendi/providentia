Really disappointed by my experience. Went to a birthday dinner last night and had the celebrant not decided upon the restaurant I would have suggested we go somewhere else in the first place. Blue Ribbon is one of the most expensive restaurants in the neighborhood but the food doesn't match the price at all. Go to applewood, al di la, rosewater, talde, or thistle hill if you're looking for a good meal in the slope. Â The service was awful and embarrassing - the waiter was tentative and would disappear, we nearly had to beg for condiments and water refills, and appetizers were not delivered before the entree. The food was terrible, and the seating for a large party was cramped. It's really disappointing and you should really go somewhere else.
