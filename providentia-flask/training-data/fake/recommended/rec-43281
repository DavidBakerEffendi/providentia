Not a fancy place, but perfect for a college town, especially since it's open late! There isn't seating indoors, but there are benches outside. Their sandwiches are savory, greasy, and delicious!!! The Phat Lady and (extra) Dirty Sanchez hoagies are my two favorites! They also have a wide selection of drinks. Don't come here if you're not in the mood for heavy, junk food. I always come back here when I visit Princeton.
