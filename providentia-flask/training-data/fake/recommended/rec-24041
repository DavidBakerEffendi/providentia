This place had some of the best chicken and waffles and some of the best biscuits in Manhattan. After only one meal here, I will definitely have this place towards the top of my list. During this most recent visit, I wasn't drinking, so I didn't take part in the $4.00 Mimosas....but I definitely will next time.
