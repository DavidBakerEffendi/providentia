Went to Dante and Luigi's tonight.  We wanted real Italian tonight and selected this place based  on fellow yelpers.  Well sad to report that I can not agree with the 4 star reviews.  Things did not start well when we pulled up to the $10 valet parking and no one came out to open my wife's door.  He just stood on the steps, I guess since he did not want to get we from the RAIN. So I get out and say "what's up"  he says "sorry some people just stop here"  I will just leave it at that.   When we get inside no one greets us.   Finally Frank comes and I tell him what happened with the valet and he says "we do not own the valet and that is a separate company". Poor excuse since they obviously hire the company.  I hate $10 valet anyway no matter where I am.  Frank decides to seat us in the bar with a party with babies.  Now we had a reservation and the place was not busy.  We got seated in the dining area and Frank brought two glasses of champagne to make us feel better. No appetizers since already not feeling good about the place. We ordered the special which was a wide ribbon seafood pasta and the veal saltimbocca.  The pasta came out mushy.  Not  even close to al dente. The veal  was average.  Pretty  bland, not much inspiration for a real Italian meal.  Overall the ambiance is good but I felt the overall experience lacking.  You could just tell that overall the restaurant is run in an average way with no passion.  Should have known that something was not right when we were able to get a reservation any time we wanted.  For a friday night the place was half empty.   Sorry for such a poor review.  I really was looking for a great meal, but it was not to be.  In addition I do not think it was just bad luck.  I do not have a good feeling about   Dante and Luigi's,  just too old school.
