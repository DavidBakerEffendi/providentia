Myself and my significant other went to The Redhead on Saturday. I had the low country shrimp it was amazing. The grits were awesome. They were light and filling. We also had the homemade pretzels and there beer cheese we both enjoyed it. If you haven't been to The RedHead definitely worth going to it. I heard about The Redhead through Diners, Drives, & Dives.
