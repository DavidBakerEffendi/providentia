So this place is so good you don't even stand a chance. My friend ordered the Country Breakfast, I ordered the Biscuit Egg Sandwich with tomato jam. Â We also had heard how amazing their pancakes were so we ordered the Banana Walnut Pancakes to share. It was the quietest meal I have ever shared with this friend, because we were so astounded by the amazingness of this food that we had no words. You'll never have another pancake or biscuit again without comparing it to the wonderful creation here. Cash only. Which is a pain. Also an hour wait on Monday at 12:30 but I had heard it was worth it. And it was.
