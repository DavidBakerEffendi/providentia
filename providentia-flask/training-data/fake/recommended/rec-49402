A friend of mine brought me here out of the blue because he considered me his healthiest friend and therefore this place lined up with my preferences (I would have been happy to eat anywhere with this friend because he's hilarious). We were first a little daunted at the small size of the place but then after one of the three tables opened up very quickly, I picked Combo 3 for $10.79 (not bad esp. considering I was pleasantly full afterward) with 8 pieces of La Fiesta Roll and the Nutty Wrap in which both looked like edible art.  I was happy we came at least for the experience.  La fiesta wrap was better than I expected, but the Nutty wrap was a disappointment because I expected to really taste the jalepeños in the peanut butter, which sounded really peculiar to begin with but I also tried it because it was a suggestion. It ended up just tasting like an ordinary Japanese peanut vegetable wrap; it needed some flare. My friend ordered the Mighty Mushroom which was more savory than La Fiesta with it's sweet mango. I still preferred my roll. But the real crowd pleaser was the watermelon lemonade (supposedly fresh and made from real fruit) - it was so thirst- quenching and refreshing - I felt it clearing my head- I would never think this combo would work so well! I will be back and hopefully I'll find more rolls and food I like and then my rating will go up.
