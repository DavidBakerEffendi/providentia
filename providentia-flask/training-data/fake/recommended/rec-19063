I've been here three times, and I feel like I've done myself a disservice by not going more! I have friends who live in Staten Island who make the trip to Park Slope to try Bogota's great dishes. My personal favorites is the Salmon Tropical and the Plantain Fried Chicken. Friend's favorites include the "bistec" (beef steak) and seafood stew. Dessert is a must! Try the cheesecake taquitos. My boyfriend had to literally pull the plate away from me to get a bite in edgewise!
