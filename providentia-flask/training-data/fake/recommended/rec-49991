I took my Pakistani friend from NJ, we drove 2 hours one way to try food in this place which we picked based on numerous positive reviews. So friendly, I felt like owner knows us and he tried his best to please us. I just wanted to say thank you and also my friend told his desserts are very authentic. I would suggest to try Rasmalai.
