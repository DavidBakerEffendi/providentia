Pho 501 is just what you expect from a Vietnamese noodle place. I have read many negatives things about it on other sites around the net but I think people are just whining about this and that and not really enjoying the great food they make here. Typically, most people already know what they are going to order in a place like this and that is exactly how it goes here. I also expect to get my bowl of pho, then leave me alone while I slurp away! If I want something, I'll call you. Staff is friendly. Service is fast. Eat your pho. Have cash on hand and leave a small tip in the basket on the counter when you pay. Enough said.
