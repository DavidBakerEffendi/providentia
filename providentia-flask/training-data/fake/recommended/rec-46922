Happy out-of-towner due to Happy Hour. A buck a shuck happy hour and so much more! $1 an oyster and even clams! $5 cocktails for me (although it's just one specific house cocktail of the night, not all cocktails), and a $3 beer that a friend thoroughly enjoyed. My 3 friends and I started off with a shrimp cocktail to share, and the shrimps are HUGE and perfectly cooked and chilled. Actually, we started off the night with some oyster crackers that are placed at all the tables and bars in a large vase/glass goblet. A little too large and dry for my liking, but it goes great with the brininess of the raw oysters and clams. Great quality seafood (I didn't get sick!) and an amazing happy hour experience. If there was an oyster house like this with a happy hour here in North Carolina, I reckon I'd be a regular. Minus one star because one particular female server was snappy and unfriendly, but after we moved to the bar, everyone who helped served us was great!
