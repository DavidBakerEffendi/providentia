AMAZING!!! People come for the chicken - but the file mignon dinner is AMAZING. Its called Lomo Saltado... Â It's strips of steak (cooked perfectly) with veggies and fries!! One of the best things I have ever eaten in my life.. When I ordered the waiter said it was his favorite and then the guy that brought said I ordered the best thing on the menu.. DO NOT MISS IT!! :)
