SOO good Disclaimer: I've somehow only ever eaten here when drunk, but from what I always recall the day after, their fried chicken is amazing. Perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful on the inside, and not at all greasy.  Aside from the fact that I love fried chicken and the Redhead's happens to be really freaking good, I think what sets it apart are the accompanying cornbread (so delicious/addicting) and the side salad, which are unexpectedly good.  Instead of your typical fried chicken + coleslaw combo, theirs comes with a refreshing, lightly-dressed arugula and strawberry salad.  I think they change up the salad, and I don't remember what kind they've served the other times, but it's always very good.  My only complaint would be that $19 is def a little pricey, but I guess it hasn't stopped me from coming back yet!
