I recently was in Greece and since I have been back to the states I have looked for an authentic restaurant. This cosy spot is packed on the weekends and for good reason. The food is wonderful and I have always received good service. The best way to start your meal is to start with the Gyro platter even thought it is a meal, it is the perfect size to share. Whatever meal you end up going with I highly suggest getting the lemon potatoes as your side. Best part is this place is BYOB so you can bring whatever you like to go with your meal.
