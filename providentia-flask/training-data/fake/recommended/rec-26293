Besides the fact that they don't take reservations and the lines can be insane on any given night of any week, there's literally nothing bad to say of Paulie Gee's! A true Greenpoint gem and luckily just a few blocks from our apartment. They have the most innovative changing seasonal menu, high quality ingredients, and a whole VEGAN pizza menu (cashew ricotta is the best)! Sincerely delicious Neapolitan style pizza that you can watch them make in the back. Every pizza I've tried I would recommend, favorites being the grapeful dead made vegan (pickled grapes on pizza, what?!), and one of the vegan kale seasonal options. My boyfriends favorite is still just the original Regina. They also have these awesome hot honey and hot chili oils to dip or drizzle on the pizza. The owner is often walking around telling stories and asking customers how the food is - really nice dude. They also sell Ovenly desserts, although I would suggest Â to walk a block to the actual bakery and go eat dessert at transmitter park on the water with amazing views of the skyline! Definitely won't be disappointed, can't wait to go again soon to check out the spring/summer menu.
