I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here, considering we drive from lancaster to eat here and often. Although we always get a double order of veggie wings and Mac and cheese. We may venture onto a new menu item one day but we haven't yet because they are so good. We don't eat any meat so this place is heaven for my wing loving fianc√©! To top it off the margaritas are perfect! I've tried them all and I'm quite picky when it comes to a fresh margarita. Again, you can't go wrong! PLUS outdoor setting, picnic style! and in the perfect Philly neighborhood. GO! NOW!
