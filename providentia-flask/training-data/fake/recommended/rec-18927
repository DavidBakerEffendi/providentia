This was my second time visiting Cafe Orlin, I previously visited in the fall - try their pumpkin pancakes (if available) they are a seasonal must!! It's a solid brunch spot that actually has significant indoor seating compared to their outdoor seating. The omelets are all great and they graciously accommodated my friend's request for extra crispy home fries. Also - even though their brunch menu reads 'no substitutions' you can definitely make substitutions.
