This was a fantastic find. My father, my sister and I went here for lunch during the work day (we all work in close proximity to each other and the financial district) and I for one was caught off guard. My father knew of the place through recommendation from one of his clients. I was expecting a simple stone street lunch affair and instead was greeted by a man in a bow tie. I thought oh god, here we go, an over dressed, under impressive basement dining scenario. Which I have had one to many of in NY. But dont let the tuxedo fool you, its not a gimmick nor is it fully appropriate for the restaurant, the lunch time crowd was dressed in business casual (even though it was a Wednesday) but the tuxedo was in a way appropriate because they try really hard with the service and succeed. They succeed even if i had to hide a slight smile i had at the kinda silliness of lunch time tuxedo clad table-side dining in the basement of an old building. They were attentive and personal. The lobster bisque was average to average plus. The soft shell crab I ate was alright. The cheese, peppers, fried zucchini and roasted potatoes were a great starter/accompaniment. I think I gave this place 4 stars bc it was like a facsimile and pale copy of il mulino (which i adore beyond words). I think further it got 4 stars from me because I had such a nice time with my father and sister on the eve of my sisters birthday. It seemed the place is packed full of regulars and long time patrons, and seems they are usually filled by reservations though we got in without a reservation. All in all worth a try if your in the area and want some well prepared though not exceptional Italian food. (Bill for 3 at lunch was $212 with only 2 glasses of scotch and water as the drinks)
