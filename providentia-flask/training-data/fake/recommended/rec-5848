What a rockin' venue! I went here last night to see a show and was really pleasantly surprised by this place. The bartenders were really nice. I always love places that serve local beer so I was super happy the the selection. I liked the old school theatre feeling and liked being on the less crowded top floor looking down to the bands (also a great vantage point for people watching). Very fairly priced too!
