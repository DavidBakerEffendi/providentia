Gustaio Sandwich- House-made Lamb sausage, Sun-dried Cherry Mustarda, Gorgonzola Spread, Roasted Fennel, & Arugula.  All I have to say is that I think it may have been the best sandwich I ever had in my entire life.  Ekta may now have some competition as my favorite place to eat in this hood.  I'm going back.  Tomorrow!
