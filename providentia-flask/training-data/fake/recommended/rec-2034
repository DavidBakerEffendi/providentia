BEST. COCHINILLO. EVER!!! no self respecting pork-lover should miss this. it comes as a special, so if its there, order it. just close your eyes and dont think about the $29 price tag. it is so worth it, i wouldnt be surprised if you start pork-whoreing yourself. the sangria is good, and the other tapas are good too. props to the lamb skewers, since i dont like lamb but their lamb rocks. with the crusty bread.
