My wife and I eat here at least twice/yr (anniversaries etc. - we were engaged here). The food is always well prepared and there are usually new choices to try. Regardless of other's experience - service has always been exceptional, just what I would expect from a higher-end, destination restaurant. Example:  My wife did not finish her meal and had it packed to go - we forgot it at the table.  We got home and called the restaurant and they saved it in the cooler for her to pick up the next day. Moral of the story... 1)  the food was good enough to go back for day-old left overs, 2)  that was exceptional service.
