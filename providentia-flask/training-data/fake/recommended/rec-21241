We decided to go to Galli for dinner after seeing it on Scoutmob. It was a little hard to find because it's not very big and on a side street in SoHo, but once inside the decor is pretty nice. The front half has a unique industrial feel to it, and in the back it's almost diner style cushy booths. We were pretty hungry so we decided to skip the cocktails and go straight for the pasta. The waiter was super accomodating and was able to switch out escarole for broccoli for my dish (Integrale), and make the vodka sauce light on cream for my friend's. Everything was really tasty and I'd say the portions were just right. It did get a little loud because by the time we left (8 PM on a Wednesday, the bar area was pretty full). But I'd definitely come here again, and hopefully next time try out the cocktail menu too - they have some creative drinks on there!
