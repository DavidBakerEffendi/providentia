This is just your basic American food place with a bar. It's kind of like a TGI Fridays but more expensive. Covered in old skool Princeton memorabilia, unique forks (3 prongs... very medieval looking), decent service. The portions are large, but even still the prices are high for such basic, unremarkable food. The menu isn't very exciting or exhaustive. I've never gone there because I had a craving for it, I've gone because it's convenient, and slightly less expensive than the better restaurants around. I've never been there later in the night for the bar scene though.
