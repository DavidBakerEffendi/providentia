The seafood is some of the best that you can get in this area. Entrees average in the $20-25. They offer a gluten free menu too. You will not be disappointed in the food. The large wait staff is attentive. The bar is always packed and lively. I would stick to straight alcohol, wine and beer though because our mixed drinks were watered down. If I am paying for my one (alcoholic) mixed drink, I want to be able to taste it.
