My fiancee and I were sitting home on a rainy Saturday night watching TV. We were watching some restaurant makeover-type show about a BBQ restaurant. Got us all in the mood for some BBQ. We did a little web search in our area and came across the Woodpit BBQ. We ordered the Ala Cart 3 Meat Combo (ribs, chicken and brisket) and also a half slab of ribs. We wanted to take it home and had to wait about 20 or so, however, let me tell you it was worth the wait! I highly suggest your phone in your order if you plan to do takeout. We did not follow previous reviewers suggestions. The chicken was just good to me and not great. Tasted like a standard routissiere chicken. The ribs were dry rubbed and the sauce they give you is amazing. The brisket was delicious and I couldn't get enough of it. We also got a side of cornbread and well, all I can say is I wish we got 2 cornbreads as we were both fighting over it. Don't expect too much of the decor. A basic divey place with just wood tables and chairs and rolls of paper towels on tables. A large TV to keep you entertained while you wait. Â What it lacks in decor, they make up for it in taste. Enjoy!!
