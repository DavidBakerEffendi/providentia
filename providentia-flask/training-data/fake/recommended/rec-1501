Came here with a girl. Ordered some lassi's and a veggie chaat. I loved the rose and mango lassi drinks (smoothies). The chaat was interesting with some strong spicy flavors even though it was on the lower end of the spiciness level but I really enjoyed it. Very healthy choices and Hasan was very helpful, friendly and very generous. Something you do not find a whole lot of, so I appreciated that about this place. There's only enough seats (along the storefront window) for about 4 people + chairs and they bring out the outdoor patio tables and chairs in May (after winter) so it'd be nice to eat outdoors. This place did seem like an order-to-go spot. Saw a lot of people come in and take their orders to-go. I'd definitely go back and try out the other lassi's. It does contain yogurt so if you're lactose intolerant, you might want to take that into consideration. Also, this is not just a vegetarian/vegan spot, though that is what they primarily have, they also serve certain chaat dishes with different kinds of meats. It's neighborhood street parking here so it's best if you took pub transportation or if you're close enough, walk (it didn't seem too ghetto). Oh yeah, West Philly. Parking: Street Price: $4-$8 Wait: 5 mins after ordering
