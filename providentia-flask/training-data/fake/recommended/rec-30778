I don't like frozen yogurt generally, but I like Red Mango -- no, I love Red Mango!  The fruit flavors are so delicious, especially peach and mango.  This stuff is amazingly flavorful and refreshing, not cloyingly sweet.  The store is always clean and the staff is polite and helpful. What's not to love?
