Its a breath of fresh air in trenton. It has a weird social vibe- from socialites, to hipsters, to gangster wannabes,  students and other strange people-- which i personally enjoyed. It also seemed like this place gets a lot of regulars. The inside ( when i was there) had a strange valentines day theme ( or decorations they forgot to take down). The room in the front is the main bar with a few tall tables and chairs surrounding it. The bartender seemed to cater to the people sitting at the bar while our server took care of us . The back was a wanna-be club- but the dj was playing techno that no one was drunk enough to dance to. I enjoyed the music. It had a large projector which at one point was playing softcore porn lol. The 'dance floor' also had tables and chairs, so we spent most of our time, drinking, talking and watching the  3 people who were dancing. Drinks seemed kinda expensive, but not horrible. I think  i had 3 drinks + 1 appy for about 40$. Speaking of appetizers- not good. Our mac n cheese balls were kinda gross. But it  is walking distance from a nice pizza shop that was open late night. Bonus points for having parking in the back.  Trenton social has a nice vibe, and i will definitely return !
