I went back to In Riva in early November and was so SO glad I gave them another shot. We sat at the pizza bar in the back and were greeted with kind and thoughtful service the entire night. I went to Italy over the summer and I can honestly say this is the best pizza I have had since. It's fantastic! We shared the margherita and the cippolini- both amazing. I actually left a comment on the suggestion card saying that I was glad that I gave them another shot and the owner's sister came over to talk to me while we were sitting at the bar after eating. She was so nice and appreciative of my comments. I highly recommend this restaurant. Would love to host a party here!
