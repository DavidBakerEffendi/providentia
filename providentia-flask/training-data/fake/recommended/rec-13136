came by on a Wed around noon in Feb w/2 co-workers to try this place out.  We attempted to go here in Jan but the line was so long.  So we got lucky in Feb-- when we go there we were seated immediately.  Yes this place is tiny and you may have to share a bench w/someone but the food is great and so is the service. I wish I could tell you exactly what we ordered... but i forgot.  (probably why i should write reviews right after i go to a place lol).  i know we got 3 pastas and it was all diff and all yummy.  the sauces were tasty and not heavy nor oily at all. we will be going back there 1 day for lunch again.
