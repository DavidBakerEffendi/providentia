Let me just throw out there first that I did enjoy my time here. A group of my friends and I had a birthday dinner here. At first, they had given away our reserved table, because the person who reserved had not answered the confirmation call. However, they were very quick in getting us another table. So good service there. I tried the ever recommended curry puffs and the corn spring rolls. They were good portions and good, but not anything special. The curry puffs were not as crispy as I had wanted them, but tasty. The corn spring rolls had a lot of corn in it, but for some reason, I could not taste any of the corn. It tasted like a regular egg roll. Both appetizers I liked, but not to the point that I would order them again. For entree, I got the spicy basil noodles. It was good, but too salty for my taste. My friend, who always orders this dish, thought this was the best spicy basil noodles that she's had, so it's all personal preference. I also tasted the roadside noodles. The sauce is delicious, but it doesn't exactly sink into the noodles. They kind of "play" separately, if you know what I mean. The lychee sangria is basically really good lychee juice. I doubt there's much alcohol in it, because alcohol usually hits me hard and I go bright red even with the littlest amount, and this time, I felt nothing. Great ambience. Great decor and the outfits for the servers are very cute. Service is great. Food is good, but might be a one time experience for me.
