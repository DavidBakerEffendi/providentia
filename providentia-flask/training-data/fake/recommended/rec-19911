Needed to find a restaurant to take my wife to on our anivesary prior to going our 7 pm Book of Mormon Show.  The other location I chose did not open in time for us to eat and then make it to the theater in time.   My and I like Thai so I chose Room Service.  We arrived at 4 pm, so we did not have any issues with crowds.  The food was great. I had the tuna tar tar, and steamed mussels. My wife had the curry puffs and calamari. All of it was excellent, not overly salty.  Drinks were good and strong (as strong as manhattan drinks can get, other than going to the waldrof astoria). My wife had the Duck as her main entree I had the their authentic seafood, chicken dish. All of it was good, service was nice.
