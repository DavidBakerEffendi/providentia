I love this place! My family of 3 can eat for under 12 bucks and be stuffed! Great pasta slice, I love the original cheese, and they always offer to cut up my toddler's slice, which she thinks is cool. Good selection of sodas and fountain drinks. i will have to try a sub soon....or a salad...I can't stay away from the pizza.
