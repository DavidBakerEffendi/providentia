This place is GOOD! Recommended to us by a local and it was worth the try. The only downside is the host wouldn't let us sit until we have the full party. When I say full party, I mean there were a total of 3 and 2 of us (girls) are here waiting in the cold. That was a bit of a downer. So when we finally got inside, they seat us in the basement which was kind of cool, somewhat of a cellar feel. I had the butter squash ravioli and it was good. The texture were just perfect and it was not drowning in the sauce. I had the privileged to try my friends dish which I can't really remember what it was this moment, but it was something like a pear and mushroom risotto. It was so creamy and the rice was cooked to perfection. The price was decent...oh, they only accept cash. If you're planning to order bottles of wine, remember to bring a bundle of cash in your wallet.
