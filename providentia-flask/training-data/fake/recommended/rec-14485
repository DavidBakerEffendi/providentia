Went to Kefi on a wednesday night for a casual dinner... Ill say this about the place, for the price and the quality its about as good of restaurant as i have been to in my short 2 months living in NYC. Â  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because the food didnt blow me away, but i will definitely be back and think its a fantastic place to catch a casual meal at very affordable prices.
