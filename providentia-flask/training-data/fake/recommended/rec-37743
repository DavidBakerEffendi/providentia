Amazing food and ambiance. Enjoyed the Kennett pizza, the statche pizza and the spaghetti squash. All very good. The statche has a delicious wheat crust, pistachio pasta, mozzarella, baby arugula and lemon vinaigrette. Absolutely delicious. The spaghetti squash is an amazing starter. They have a ton of super delicious vegetarian options. Would definitely recommend it to friends. And look forward to coming back to try other dishes. Would
