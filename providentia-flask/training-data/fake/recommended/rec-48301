Wow!!  We just went for lunch this weekend, our first time there.  We had the amazing cheese and charcuterie plate (a great deal for $12).  It included 3 different kinds of cheese (couldn't decide which was my favorite), pastrami, pickles, red cabbage, a bread basket and a large pretzel with mustard. We also had the mussels, schnitzel, and the salad plate - all were excellent. The waitress suggested the elderblossom spritzer and said the juice was made by the owner, who grows elderblossom at his farm upstate.  We used to live in Hungary and this is the first time I've had elderblossom juice in the US - it brought back wonderful memories...... The wonderful ambiance and charming atmosphere give the café a wonderful old world meets Brooklyn vibe.  Perfect for a weekend brunch, it couldn't have been better! I wish we had a café like this in the city where we live.
