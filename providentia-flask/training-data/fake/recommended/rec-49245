The food here is delicious; my mom and I shared a "Fat Boy" plate with blackened catfish, pulled pork, mac and cheese, green beans, fried okra, and dirty rice. The portion was very generous but we still ended up having an entire portion left over, which is great because we look forward to the leftovers! The service was good, our server was really really nice, welcoming, and energetic! For the quality and amount of food you get it's very reasonably priced. Â It's a little bit of a "dive" atmosphere but totally worth your time! Seems like a family business so definitely support them! We left very happy!
