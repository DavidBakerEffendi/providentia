I understand this is supposed to be upscale for Burlington...but if that is their goal, they are failing miserably.  Friendly service and items on the menu look inspired and beautiful...if only the dishes came out that way. We ordered a mushroom-type bruschetta.  The "bread" it came on was burnt, i mean charred. The bread looked like a burn victim in a 5 alarm fire. I was scrapping burnt sections off, trying to enjoy it as presented.  I ended up just eating what was on top (which was very good).  When I showed the waitress, she grimaced, as if to agree with us it was completely burnt, but said that is how it is served. When both of our entrees came they completely underwhelmed us.  My raviolis were swimming in sauce and my fiancee's "balsamic infused onions" over his steak were drenched..it definitely appeared to be just a rushed meal. If the meal tasted as good as it read on the menu, I would have been A-OK paying the high bill...but after dealing with burnt app, and asking for napkins to blot off my ravioli I was really let down.
