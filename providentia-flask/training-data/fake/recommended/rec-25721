Maybe I had unreasonable expectations after seeing the 4.5-star Yelp average, but I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The pizza sauce was watery and bland, and the "heirloom" tomatoes on the caprese salad tasted no better than the supermarket variety. The atmosphere is perfect for an intimate date, but it doesn't really outweigh the mediocre food.
