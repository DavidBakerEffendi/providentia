So great, and the cost is perfectly reasonable. I've had some of all of the varieties of ramen they offer and the best is the Spicy Tan-Tan, followed by the Terakawa. With the tan-tan you should make sure to ask for some of the chili oil they keep behind the counter--it's got a great, slow-burning quality to it. The pork buns are surprisingly large for an appetizer, and they're pretty tasty! The octopus puffs are amazing but the octopus inside is a bit rubbery. I go back once every two weeks or so and our friends ate there for two nights in a row. If there's any higher praise I can give, I don't know what it is.
