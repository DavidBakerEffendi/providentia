Well, what can I say. I ordered a sazerac, and neither the bartender nor the server knew what one was. The Manhattan I got instead had a hair in it. My friends martini had seeds in it and tasted of water and pure grain alcohol. No olive. I realize it's not a bar-centric spot, but the bar area looks really nice, they really should hire a proper bartender. It's NYC ffs.
