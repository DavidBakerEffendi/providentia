Ate here for dinner with my husband.  Arrived at 7:40, had a 20 minute wait.   Service was okay.  Nothing outstanding, but not horrible either.  Food was good, but not great.  Ordered Rad Nah; which is basically starch soup gravy over flat rice noodle.  Also also ordered Nauh Pad Kra Praow; which is beef basil.   Both dishes had beef and had the beef been more tender it would have taste really good.  After a few bites it started hurting my teeth.   So overall, it was okay.  Better than a lot of other Thai places, but I still like Nusara in Queens more.
