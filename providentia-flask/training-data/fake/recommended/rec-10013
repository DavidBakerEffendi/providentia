Came here with a coworker for lunch and we split the vegetarian pho noodle soup and the crabcake bahn mi. It was our first bahn mi experience (and probably not that authentic because it's a crabcake in the bahn mi!) but we both loved the sandwich! Also the vegetarian pho soup was delicious too. It had plenty of veggies in it (also dont be alarmed at the soy protein they put in it, it looks like meat but isn't!) The portions are huge and I recommend splitting the soup and sandwich with a friend so you get to try more stuff here. Also, I have to give it 5 stars because they use vegetable broth and NO MSG!
