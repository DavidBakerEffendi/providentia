Went there last night for the second time.  It's been great both times with excellent food, done with a lot of locally sourced food.  Very nicely put together with interesting dishes, each delicious and unique.  The service can be spotty but they a,re pretty new at this I think.  Definitely worth a try.  Oh, it's Byob.
