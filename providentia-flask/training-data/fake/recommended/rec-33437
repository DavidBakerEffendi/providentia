Oh lobster, why do I love you so, even though if you were like a twelfth the size and crawling out of my sink or up my wall I would run from you in such screaming, flailing, limp-wristed fashion that I would immediately sprout pigtails and/or a skirt? If nothing else, our friend the Giant Cockroach of the Sea teaches us that we shouldn't judge an ugly alien-looking miniature sea monster by its cover, because maybe if you murder it and crack it open its insides it will be delicious. Valuable life lessons aside, Red Hook Lobster Pound serves up heaping mounds of delicious monster flesh at fair (well, lobster-fair) prices. The traditional, Maine-style roll is as good as you'd expect a sandwich made almost entirely out of lobster to be, but the Connecticut roll, served on toasted bread and swapping out mayo for juuuuust enough melted butter, is king. It is totally satisfying, comfortingly warm, and yet, despite appearing to have an entire lobster family piled on there, is surprisingly light. At #16 on NYMag's Top 51 Sandwiches in NY list, the Connecticut roll heartily earns its spot, and in doing so teaches us another valuable life lesson: Whenever you can have something toasted and drenched in melted butter, you totally should.
