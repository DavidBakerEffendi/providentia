Pretty damn good. I went today (Tues) at 6:30pm and they were on the SE corner without a line (lucky me)! But by 7pm, a line of 15 ppl started to form. The rice isn't anything special, and I've had waaaay better rice at a Halal cart near my place in Queens. But the lamb is nicely charred and the chicken flavorful. The lamb is by far better than the chicken, but I still get the combo. The red sauce is hooooot! I can handle really spicy foods but this is not for the faint of heart. The pita bread is super soft and delicious. The hefty portion that you get for $6 is a steal! Overall, solid meal but not good enough to warrant waiting in line for more than 10 minutes.
