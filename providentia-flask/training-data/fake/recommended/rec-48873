Awesome new Thai place in UES - we've lived in the area for 2 years and this place is one of the BEST!  Food is really good and fresh with a lot of selection (noodles, rice, sautéed entrees, apps, etc).  Staff is very friendly and fast.  Atmosphere is great and very clean.  Overall, great food and atmosphere at very very reasonable prices!!  Love it!!
