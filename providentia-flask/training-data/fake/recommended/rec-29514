I think their food is good..but their customer service can use some work. I guess my major issue with them is that they are slow. I had placed an order once for something about $20 or so..leaving my job in Parsippany. By the time, I got to the restaurant, my food wasn't ready yet. I had to wait another 10 minutes. I've gone back, but only if I have plenty of time on my hands.
