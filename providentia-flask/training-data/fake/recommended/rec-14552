I wanted to love this place. Bangalore, the city I grew up in, has the best dosas that one can find. So, imagine my excitement when i saw, on Yelp, that Manhattan had a highly well rated Dosa cart. The last time I was in Manhattan, I walked around the park a few times hoping to find the cart, but it wasn't around then. I did find it this time, and I was disappointed with the food. Here's why: 1. The filling for the masala dosa was boiled potatoes, with turmeric, chilli powder and salt. A proper filling for a masala dosa is oil+mustard seeds, tempered + 2 types of lentils, tempered + curry leaves, tempered + ginger + turmeric + green chillies + salt + lime juice + cilantro. I hope you can understand how lacking the filling was in flavor. 2. The chutney he serves it with wasn't good. There are many variations of a coconut chutney that is served with a dosa, with the green chilli + cilantro variant being the most popular. He serves what seemed to be a red chilli chutney, but this chutney did not cut it. What was good, was: 1. The dosa itself. Well flavored and crisped batter. 2. The sambar. Spicy and well seasoned. Good stuff. Thiru runs the cart very efficiently. I absolutely loved his enthusiasm, what with his thick south indian accent and all. I am South Indian, and more importantly, a Bangalorean. Dosa is an art that we take much pride in having perfected. We know a good masala dosa when we see, smell and eat one. Had the filling and chutney been good, this would've been a fantastic cart to eat at every single day. Unfortunately, it fell short of those finishing touches that would've made the A-OK masala dosa, a fantastic one.
