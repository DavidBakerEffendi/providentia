FAVORITES: Beef brisket noodle soup - 4 stars - have ordered this soup multiple times and tried with both the hand drawn (thin egg noodles) and thick (wider knife-shaved noodles (yelp.com/biz_photos/nan-…)).  I prefer the soup with thinner noodles, although both are fresh and good.  The broth is okay, but I mostly order this dish for the beef and noodles.  The cilantro in the dish works well, and adding an egg to this soup makes a great combination.   Noodles with pork soy sauce - 4 stars - another great option is this traditional Chinese noodle dish  (non-soup).  The pork is very flavorful and the hand drawn noodles go well with the ground pork. APPETIZERS: Cold shredded potatoes - 4.5 stars -  great option.  The vinegar flavoring is really good the dish comes with carrots and cucumbers.  You can't even tell you're eating potatoes.   Chicken dumplings with curry and coconut - 4 stars (fried version), 3 stars (boiled version).  Definitely go with the fried (unhealthy) version if you order this.  Chicken is not optimal for dumplings but with the curry it was pretty good.  You can't really tell that there's coconut in the dumplings though.   Diced cucumbers in sauce - 3 stars - typical cucumbers with minced garlic.  I think this dish was a bit too salty and as a result the cucumber flavor was somewhat lost. OVERALL Expect to pay ~$12/person for a large bowl of noodles along with a few shared appetizers.  Good portion sizes and definitely a very affordable and good option in Chinatown.
