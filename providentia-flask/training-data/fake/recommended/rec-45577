Awesome place to drink some beer, especially during the summer.  Tons of outdoor tables --- even the indoor area is open and there's a nice breeze.  Good set up in that you go to the bar to get everything yourself and bring it to your table so you never have to sit around waiting for a waitress.  We were there on a packed Friday night and the lines at the bar / food area never got really long. 4 Stars.  Loses a star because the beer selection is a little more limited than I would expect at a place like this.  There were about 8-10 beers on tap, with another 10-15 selections in bottles.  Still, tasty beers.  Highly recommended.
