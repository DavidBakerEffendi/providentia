This is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in manhattan, for brunch AND for dinner. clinton st is phenomenal. Although the wait can be 1-2 hours on the weekend, it is totally worth it. Definitely recommend the banana pancakes and the eggs benedict. I love pretty much everything on the menu but the eggs benedict are addictive. Dinner is also great here, much quieter than brunch but service and food are both still fantastic.
