Every night, before I go to sleep, I say a little prayer... Thank you Lord for truffles. Thank you for tater tots. Thank you for Umami burger. Overall one of the best burgers I've ever had. Shake Shack is in the past as far as I'm concerned. Get the cheesy tots (not on the menu) and truffle fries. The wifi pw is: cheesytots!
