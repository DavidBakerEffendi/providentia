I cannot say enough about this place-- One word may sum up why our experience was so pleasant... ENRIQUE. I originally made reservations for 12 people for my boyfriend's  birthday and called on the day of to change it to reservations for 14 people-- Ciccio (specifically Enrique) accommodated me without any issues.  My reservations were for 8pm, but I arrived early (7:20pm) and my table was ready and they allowed me to sit down at the table and order drinks.  (Most restaurants will not seat you, or allow you to sit until your entire party is there). Enrique was very personable.  He took his time to speak to me and ask about the occasion we were celebrating.  He explained the dishes and the wines to us very well what food dishes went well with what wine. Ambiance:  very intimate setting- cozy Food:  Amazing parpadelle pasta dish (my favorite here)-- the appetizers were all very well portioned and everyone of us loved our dishes (octopus, meatballs, linguini, lasagna, snapper fish).  The desserts were delicious-- we had the tiramisu, panna cotta and creme brulee-- all were great, creme brulee was my favorite. Service: I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH-- excellent excellent service.  Thank you Enrique!! The staff was very patient and allowed us use multiple (about 8) credit cards on the bill. Thank you Ciccio for a wonderful experience.
