After one visit, I'm addicted. I had the Shrimp Masala roll & the Achari Paneer roll. The Shrimp Masala may just be the most deeeelish thing I've had in ages. Shrimp marinated in coconut milk & spices, it was like heaven wrapped in flatbread. The Achari Paneer was a solid roll, full of cheese & flavor, obviously blander than the Shrimp Masala. Made it a good companion roll. One roll may not be enough, but two will certainly fill you up. Great in and out for lunch, will cost you about 15 bucks.
