Mrs.: Unique cocktails and a warm atmosphere drew us in on a rainy Friday evening. I tried the gourmet Macaroni and Cheese, and the Mr. tried the burger. The Mr. wanted to try something out of his comfort zone and went for the Bloody BLT cocktail, and unfortunately did not enjoy it and had to order something else. I, on the other hand, tried the Rum & Root Beer, which was fantastic. While it was a fun visit, I don't know if it is a place that we would have to go back to in the future.
