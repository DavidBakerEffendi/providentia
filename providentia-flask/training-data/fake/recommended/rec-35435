I finally gave in and decided to check it out.  I must admit the line does move very fast and since it was a cold today it wasn't too long.  I was gonna get the chicken and rice platter but it seemed like everyone was ordering lamb meat and when I got to the front the chicken looked like it's been sitting there for awhile.  I went ahead with the lamb platter which came with rice, salad, pita bread and I added both the white and red hot sauce.  I mixed it all together and took a bite and it was very good.  The lamb meat was very flavorful but really greasy but what would you expect from street food.  The hot sauce had a good kick to it but it complimented the white rather nicely.  The only thing I wish was that it had more salad cuz it was refreshing after eating so much grease.  Why not 5 stars?  Cuz too much of this food will kill you!  =P UPDATE:  After having this for another 2 times I have to say, "I SURRENDER TO YOU HOTSAUCE!!!"
