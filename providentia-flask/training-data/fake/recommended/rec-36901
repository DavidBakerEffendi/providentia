I was living on pate, foie gras and liver this whole weekend.  This place has the best service ever...this really is a 5 star.  If you asked them to, they  would have hand fed you.  My 2nd course was duck breast and it had so much flavor and super juicy.  It was smokey, sweet, savory, tender....just yummmyyy. I also LOVE cheese and they had a huge cheeseboard...it was just plain fantastic.  Our waiter was great..i love it when you can have just have decent conversation with them....it makes the dinner so much more pleasant.  I really wanted a glass of wine, but i was soo exhausted.  NEXT TIME.
