I want to say that I've been to Luca's many times but this last visit was one of the best.  First of all, the other couple we were waiting for called last minute to tell us they'd be 45 minutes late.  We called Luca's and they accommodated us even though they were completely booked. Now to the food.  The bruschetta was amazing as always.  The entire table LOVED their meals and mine was especially amazing,  The sushi grade tuna special was by far one of the best fish dishes I have ever had.  The portion was huge (as always) and the fish was amazingly fresh.  Chef Andrea out did himself on that dish.  As usual, the service was great.  Byron is always attentive and quite entertaining.   If there was a rating for 4 and a half stars, I would have gone for that.  Luca's needs a slighlty bigger space with a BAR.  But, based on the food (which was and always is phenomenal) I went with the full 5.
