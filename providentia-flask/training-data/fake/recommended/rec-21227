Amazing. I would never imagine giving a food truck five stars but today I have met the one. She was popular as tens of people lined up in an unorderly fashion and waited halves of hours to sample her goods. But good things come to those that wait my friends. Order to the right wait to the left, or as I prefer the wallflower approach. Just dont stand around, "no chicken for you!" not really but it's annoying. Unlike other "street meat" establishments, 4-C's lemon chicken isn't stacked up on the side of the grill, poaching in the sun. Here they serve it up fresh and fast and the turnover tells you that you'll never be a doubt whether this was on yesterday's menu. The spices on the chicken were excellent Moroccan spices liberally and unfastidiously applied. The basmati rice was perfectly cooked and a generous helping. A variety of spicy and tangy sauces gave this bowl more bite than a horny vampire and more kick than an angry mule. I loved it. Best part: chicken and rice price --$7. I can't wait until the next time 4-C's is in my neighborhood, we're going steady.
