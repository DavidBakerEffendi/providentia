Nice locale, good service. We had an arugula salad, very good, charred octopus, very good, pappardelle with lamb ragu, good, fried artichokes, OK. We also had a margherita pizza. The initial impression of the pizza was excellent. As it got colder the flavor of the dough changed, it felt greasy, disappointing. It needs another visit.
