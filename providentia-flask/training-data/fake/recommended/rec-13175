Everything I've ever had here was amazing. From the food to the service. I can cosign on the fried chicken, shrimp & grits, biscuits (YUMMY), grilled corn and 6 out of their 7 daily free cookies. My only complaint is that the portion of the shrimp and grits has changed. The $12 bowl is laughably a snack. It's barely an appetizer. BUT....it's still a damn good for Â 5 tablespoon of grits and 3 shrimp dish.
