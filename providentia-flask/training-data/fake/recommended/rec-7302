LOVE this place.  Super friendly, fast service and the crepes are consistently delicious.  My favorite is the truffled egg white with spinach crepe - great for breakfast, lunch or snack on-the-go, and it tastes even better than it looks (which is great!)!  I also kind of love how it seems super healthy - I believe the crepes themselves are made of tofu/soy rather than white flour... but I could be wrong.  Consistently made well, and the packaging is so convenient!  Can't wait to try the other menu items.
