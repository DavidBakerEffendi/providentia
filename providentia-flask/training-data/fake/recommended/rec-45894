I love small take out and eat in Chinese Food restaurants, and have eaten in many across the country. Huna has excellent food. All dishes are prepared well, and not greasy. Â Eat in portions are smaller than take out, so if you take out prepare to share or for leftovers. Take it from a regular for years, you can't go wrong with Huna China in a small town like Lincoln Park.
