If youre from the North Jersey area then you know there's Italian food everywhere. If you've traveled the country much youd know North Jersey has the best Italian food available. When it comes deli, catering and REAL Italian specialties this is the best stop you can make. I have never been so satisfied with a sandwich in my life!! They use nothing but fresh mozzarella that they make multiple times a day. It sells that quickly, which should tell you enough. Their bread is fresh daily and will leave you wondering why you buy that cheap stuff from the supermarket. Their selection of imported gourmet deli meats and cheeses alone will make you a dedicated customer. The provolone is perfect! I never even liked provolone until I tried there's. Their marinara will rival your old Italian grandmother's. If all that wasn't enough they have some of the friendliest staff that will make you feel right at home. Dont think twice next time you want Italian food in North Jersey.
