Fantastic apps! We had the Ahi Tuna Tartar Stack and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The stack, though only two wonton wrappers high, was stuffed with fresh, flavorful tuna, perfectly ripe avocado and mango, and drizzled in a sauce I wanted to lick off the plate. The fries were hearty steak fries- perfectly crisp, not too soft nor burnt- with great flavor on their own. Paired with the sauces, they were fantastic! I recommend the black pepper mayo to compliment the sharp cheese. Service was quick and super friendly, and the server/bartender was not shy to help on any hard decisions with the menu. I will definitely be coming back!
