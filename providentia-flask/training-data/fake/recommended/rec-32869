This place is absolutely amazing.  Very creative menu and extremely well-executed.  Duck breast - perfectly cooked to medium rare, perfectly seasoned, and amazing sauce.  Even the stupid red cabbage side, that i normally would not bother with, was awesome!   That's how you know a place is great.  When the sides are as good as the main dish.  Also, I had the most perfectly cooked piece of halibut I've ever had in my life.  Beautiful sear and so moist inside.  The only problem was that is was extremely underseasoned, like the chef forgot to season it all.  What a sin because it may have otherwise been the best peice of fish I've ever had, AND I'VE HAD THEM ALL OVER THE WORLD! (Godfather reference).  I took one star away for the seasoning mistake.  I'm sure it was totally a fluke, so I highly recommend this spot.
