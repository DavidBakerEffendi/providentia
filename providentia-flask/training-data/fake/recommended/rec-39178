Okay, my love affair with Joya has cooled a bit. Two things: 1.) They never answer their phone, or you get a busy signal when you call, forcing you to call back repeatedly for about 20 minutes before getting through or giving up, and 2.) The food is hit-or-miss much of the time. Like, one night the woon sen will be light and stir-fried to perfection and overflowing with delicious veggies and meat...and then the next time it will be super heavy and dripping with grease and scanty on the veggies and meat and just generally sort of bad. We still call them when we're up for a night of sodium-induced unquenchable thirst, but there's other comparable Thai in the neighborhood...and most of the other restaurants answer their phone, too. Still pretty okay but not as good as it could be.
