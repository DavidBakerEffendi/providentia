Went here for the first time for lunch on a Saturday. I was not impressed. But I'll start by saying that the service was great for the most part, and the place is much bigger and nicer inside than I thought. We ordered the antipasto platter to split, and then a burger and a salad for main courses. Bread was brought to us with no butter or oil, but a bowl of parm cheese and hot pepper.???? Not sure what it was for, because she took it away when we got our antipasto appetizer....Very weird. Antipasto was big disappointment. Tiny portion and the salami was just deli salami rolled up on a plate. No bread or toast points or anything to dip or eat the stuff on, and definitely not enought to share. I didn't care for it at all. I got the latin salad and added salmon, asked for dressing on the side. Salad came, smothered in salad dressing. The salmon was a generous portion but soooo dry. The avocado was not even close to ripe - it was crunchy like apple pieces. I had to pick it out. The salad itself was small and there was just sooo much dressing. I didn't say anything about it because I knew they would have to remake the whole thing and by that time my date would be finished with his burger (which, by the way, was huge and he really liked). So maybe I should have spoken up, but oh well. When we got the check, we saw that we were charged 50 cents per refill on soda. I mean, 50 cents is not that big of a deal but that just seems cheap of them...also, when the server asked if we wanted refills, there was no mention that they weren't free. No big deal to us, but if you go there with a family of kids and each has a few refills, it can add up. It just seemed weird to me. I might give this place another chance for dinner, or at least to hang at the bar, which was big and had nice TVs. But I really wasn't impressed, and I really wanted to like it because I live so close by.
