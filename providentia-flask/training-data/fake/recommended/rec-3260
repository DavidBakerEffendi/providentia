We've been coming here regularly since they opened. We love the ambiance with the beautiful bar, mystery mansion effect, old movie playing on the back wall. The food is consistently good. We like the mac-n-cheese and the chicken the best and they update the menu every few months. Lou, the bartender, is very knowledgeable and can make anything. Heather, the general manager, is wonderful and will help you with anything. Their wine list is pretty limited and obscure but we were recently told that Rex is also a BYO, which thrilled us but they do charge a $35 per bottle corkage fee. Nice to have great management, consistent quality fare, and amazingly creative cocktails. So glad they are in our neighborhood! We love sitting at the bar, watching the old movies play on the tv (no sound, which is perfect), catch up with the staff, and try Lou's new concoctions. Would like to see a couple of lower calorie options (grilled chicken, beef filet, steamed vegetables) but everything they serve is very tasty.
