Every time I eat here I think I will branch out and try another of the fantastic sounding things on the menu, but then I think of how sad I will be to not get my Souvlaki wrap. Seriously, it is amazing. Maybe next time I should order it to go and try the meatballs, or the pizza, or the special . . . or maybe I'll just get two souvlaki wraps.
