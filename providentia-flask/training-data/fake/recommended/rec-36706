This place alone is reason why I drool when I think of NY. Chicken n Rice combo platter for $6. BEST MEAL on EARTH! Yes, the wait can be annoying but just think about what's at the end of that rainbow..better than a pot of gold. Plus the line moves pretty fast. Best way to spend $6 and the perfect late night snack! I'm drooling now as I write this review. I wish I lived in NY :(
