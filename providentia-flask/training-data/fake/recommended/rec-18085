Chaat is basically a taste-free-for-all. Do you want a sort of South Asian spicy/sweet/savory/tangy explosion in your mouth? If you do, then you should check this place out. It wasn't what I was looking for on a cold, Sunday afternoon but it was super delightful. I was glad to have found it. You know how sometimes you eat something and it's so healthful that you feel your cells rejoicing? That's this place. Also, everyone is right about Hassan. He is so helpful and so happy to introduce you to Chaat. I'd go back just for him. Also they can make their lassis vegan? Whaaaaat!
