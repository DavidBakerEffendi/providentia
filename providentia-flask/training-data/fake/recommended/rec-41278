Really nice place to go to. Â The atmosphere is lovely, the tall ceilings, the blues, the lights, the communal table are relaxing and inviting. The food is very good. The shaken beef is just amazing. And the okra with shrimp was such a wonderful surprise. They are partnering with a sommelier and the wine choices are really good with the food and the staff is very knowledgable and accommodating. If you are in Bushwick, I can't recommend it enough.
