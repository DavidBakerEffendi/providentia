I love the Old City Continental. The price is right and the food is great. The Cheesesteak Eggroll is a must. Some decent food/drink happy hour specials too. Must Have's: Cheesesteak Eggroll, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Lobster Mac & Cheese, Calamari Salad, Hummus and Pita (in that order) Stay away from the Korean Pork Taco, Mexican Pizza.
