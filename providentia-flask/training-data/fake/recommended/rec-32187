Went there last night for a groupon. It was pretty dead for a friday night. the decor is nice. The place is clean.   The sangria was tasteless. My guess is they went light on the liquor as it mostly tasted like wine.  We tried tried 4 small plates. Ham croquettesadditionalot very good. Beef carpachio which was ok. Sirloin caps which was the best of the 4 but still just ok and the hamburgers were 2 large hamburgers but had a funny taste. Most likely the burgers were just meat with no additional ingredients and just tasted blah.  Its not like it sucked but I dont see any reason to return.
