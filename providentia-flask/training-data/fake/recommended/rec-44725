I really wanted to like this place, but our waitress was so incredibly rude it ruined the experience. Came in here later on in the evening, around 10:30 for some snacks with friends. Got seated at a table and once the waitress realized we weren't ordering a full dinner, she became visibly agitated with us to the point where we felt uncomfortable. To speak to the food- everything we tried was quite good and the cookies with the bill was a nice touch. The fried chicken and burgers looked really good- but not worth dealing with the rude service to go back for.
