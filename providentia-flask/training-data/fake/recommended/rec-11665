It will amaze you how dismissive the staff is. The food is decent but you definitely have to see how terrible a staff can be. We waited a hour which wouldnt bother too much for brunch but there were numerous open tables. Waited 10 minutes til a server came over and said "you ready". Asked for water and was given a tank face. When i said thanks the host rolled his eyes and walked off. Our server NEVER came to the table. Foods not worth coming. Â Seeing that people actually act this way is.
