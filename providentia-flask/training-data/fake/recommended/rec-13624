this is the perfect place for a date- its so cozy and a great way to share food with ur loved one- i loved this pizza- the crust was thin- the pizza sauce was flavorful and the meatballs were tasty- we ordered a mushroom pizza with meat balls. i really enjoyed everything- they're sangria is very good too ;)
