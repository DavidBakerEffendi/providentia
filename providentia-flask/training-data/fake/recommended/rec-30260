Although this is not a spot that I would normally visit, I happened to stop in for breakfast after staying at the Highline hotel next door. While the menu was a bit obscure, the service was delightful. My server, Spencer was exceptional in every way. Attentive, kind, and... happy! Now a days we settle for mediocrity when it comes to waitstaff ... not here though. I could see the other servers on the floor were great too! Â  Also, the homemade strawberry Jam is so freakin' good! KuDos, Cookshop staff !! .. I am impressed!
