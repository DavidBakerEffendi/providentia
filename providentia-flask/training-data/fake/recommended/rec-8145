Glad that a Tex-mex style place has come to Philadelphia. Kind of made me feel like I was in Austin again... One very important note, a BBQ/Mexican establishment will probably only excel in one arena. ECR's expertise is clearly (and surprisingly) the BBQ. I don't even like BBQ and preferred my boyfriend's brisket sandwich to my burrito ("Can I have another bite, please?"). Now, the nachos did look great but if they are as overridden with beans as my burrito was, then I'll have to pass. I liked this place, I liked the new outdoor shopping area they've created in Northern Liberties. The staff was nice and we will definitely be back.
