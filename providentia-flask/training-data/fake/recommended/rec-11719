Such high hopes were dashed...everything was way too salty-I couldn't even finish my meal.  We ordered two salad appetizers: a special for the day with apples and the pole bean salad  The bean one was the only thing that was good...even the apple salad was salty. For dinner we had the pork belly and roast chicken -both were just not what was expected...the chicken was on a bed of beans that should have tasted like ham, and they did which was good but the chicken itself was crazy salty.  The staff was super friendly though and offered to take it back..but I just didn't think it would help. We did also have the much talked about pork sticky bun. I found it far too meaty tasting for my taste, and super rich..but that may not be a turn off for some folks-I'd try it at their remote stand at the High Line if I were you. So they get 2.5 stars overall.
