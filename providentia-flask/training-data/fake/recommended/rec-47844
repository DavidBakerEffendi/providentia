Best Clam Pizza! Went to Bar last night.  It was great!  The best clam pizza I've ever had.  It was BUSY!  We were told we would have to wait an hour (party of two), so we just grabbed a seat at the bar, and ate there.  The crust is paper thin, almost translucent.  We split a small white pie with clams, mozz, bacon and a medium red pie half sausage half pepperoni.  Both were excellent.  Some people recommend the mashed potato pie, but I was not adventurous enough. The beer was good, not great.  They were out of their blond ale, but I had a pale ale followed by a 5 oz tasting of each of the others on tap; chocolate stout, espresso porter, red ale, and two pales.  The pale was not very bitter (I would have preferred a higher IBU). We will be back again, often.
