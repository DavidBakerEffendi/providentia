Geno's is better!! Sure sure some people will want to kill me for this but.. sorrt Pat's.. your steak was gross. It was my first time in Philly and as a huge foodie (I hate when people say that but...it gets the point across) I had to take the Cheesesteak challenge. One night we went out and had half of each, pats and Geno's. Pat's failed epically: the bun was dry, the meat was not flavorful or juicy. basically it can be summed up as such: Bleh
