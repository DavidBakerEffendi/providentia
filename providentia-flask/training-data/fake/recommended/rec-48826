If you're looking for a relaxing, quiet meal, this is not the place to go. Chinese restaurants are not known for their service (which can be off putting for people who don't understand that); rather, Chinese restaurants they are known for delivering quick and efficient service. Joe's Shanghai is no exception to this rule. Guests sit at communal tables with other parties, which I personally don't mind. It's interesting to interact with all the tourists who are confused at what they're supposed to order and Â how they're supposed to eat what they've ordered. Joe's Shanghai delivers quality food. The xiao long bao soup dumplings do not disappoint. I would definitely pick the pork ones over the crab ones, not just because the pork ones are cheaper, but because the the pork ones taste better. We also got green beans which were cooked to just the right crunchiness. I love this place, but allot time in your schedule to wait for a seat! It is crowded most of the time with waits of at least 20 minutes.
