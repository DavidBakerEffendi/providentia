The Umami in LA was much much better. It was hands down the best burger I've ever had. However, the burgers here in NY are a bit different. They were good but it wasn't the best. I also tried the duck burger on their special menu. It was something different but it wasn't good. I only ate half of it. The service here was outstanding though!
