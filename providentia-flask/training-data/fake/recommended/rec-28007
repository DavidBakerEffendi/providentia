Heath Ledger, may you live on forever in those delicious Thai spiced mussels. This place is man bun heaven. The food was pretty good, albeit a bit spicey - big ups to that celery root mash, mussels and broccolini. Unfortunately our squid was overdone, and it was one of those situation where it took a couple of bites to realize that it was way chewy and in fact not supposed to be that way. By the time we realized, the small portion already looked devoured. Not sure about that ink sauce either. That whole dish was just kinda meh. Other than that though, cocktails and service were way up there.
