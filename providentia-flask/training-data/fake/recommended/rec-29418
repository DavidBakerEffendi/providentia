Read the great reviews so during day trip for Jets vs Eagles game drove out especially to try this spot.  I had high cheesesteak expectations.  Had one with mushrooms and provi, ok but not fantastic.  Think provi tasted strange, meat was ok and bread was good.  My 7 year old liked the hamburger which is more home made looking so that was cool.  Very little seating both inside and out.  We had seats at counter but 5 minutes later folks were having standing meals. Was 2 hot to eat outdoors.  Liked sonny's better, tried that last year.  Next time, Tony Luke's.  Don't feel it was worth the extra drive out of city.
