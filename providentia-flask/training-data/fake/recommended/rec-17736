I lived in Lawrenceville for 4 years and though I ate at many places in the area, I had never tried Penang. What a shame that I missed out! Boyfriend and I were in the area and were hungry and indecisive, as usual. We weren't so hungry for a buffet or a diner but we are picky enough not to settle for fast food or whatnot. So, we decided to try Penang, despite a few unfavorable reviews on Yelp. The inside is large and has nice ambiance. The waiters were nice but not totally attentive. The menu has many options but isn't overwhelming. Some items seem really expensive while others very inexpensive. I chose Captain's Noodles with a side of coconut rice, which I mixed into my dish. The meal was great, portion huge and it was Â hot, fresh, and very very yummy. The coconut rice blew my mind and I'm suddenly addicted to it. Boyf got pad thai with chicken and he said it was pretty tasty. We were too full to try anything else. I knocked a star for not having the most attentive wait staff and also for $3 unsweetened iced tea and $2 for a can of diet coke. For the two entrees, two sides of rice and the two drinks, our bill was $28. Not bad and we both have leftovers.
