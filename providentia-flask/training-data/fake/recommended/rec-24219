A Laos/Thai restaurant in the South Philly area where many Vietnamese restaurants thrive? Say whaaaa??? I frequent this place a lot and I have also ordered take out. My favorites are: Laos papaya salad, laab duck, and the Laos beef appetizer. I am Cambodian and papaya salad is a favorite for us. I really like how they add green beans in the salad. Gives it a nice crunch. BYOB...need I say more? The place is decorated with lots of beautiful Thai art and sculptures and there are candles on every table. Would be a great date spot. I really wish they would play thai or laos music instead of songs I can hear when I turn on the radio. I just think it would add to the experience and atmosphere of the restaurant.
