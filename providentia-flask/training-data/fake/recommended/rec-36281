TimeOut Shortlist New York 2012 recommended this restaurant, so we had brunch on Father's Day.  It's MICHELIN guide 2011 Recommended so our expectations were appropriately based.  The wait staff at our table had no idea how to interact with customers apparently, because we were treated as if we were peasants who had no idea of what the simple menu items were.  This person overstepped the boundaries of a waitperson and even patted me on the back on one point!  The food is WAY over priced and severely lacked sophistication.  Lastly, it's almost impossible to have a conversation with the deafening level of noise with sound with everyone's voices reverberating off all the hard services. If you're in the mood for French food, do yourself a favor and visit Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro in NYC instead.
