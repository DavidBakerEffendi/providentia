Not the holy grail pizza I was expecting, with the way people rave. I was excited for a crispy thin "cracker" crust, as another Yelper called it. It was much more soupy. The dough was so wet it was translucent, but that can be pretty good sometimes too. I couldn't believe the amount of toppings The Italian Bomb had. It was decent pizza. What made this four stars was the slice I had off of my fianc√©e's side, which was some of the most phenomenal pizza I've ever had. It was essentially the Italian Bomb with no peppers, onions or mushrooms- just sausage, pepperoni, bacon and garlic. Sometimes less is more.
