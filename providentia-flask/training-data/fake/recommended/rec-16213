Everyone's favorite place on the Upper East Side. Just hang out in the bar area for a few drinks or try the delicious food. Weather permitting, back patio is lovely! I'm trying to kick the gnocchi and black truffle habit, very addictive! I always take out-of-town visitors here for a bite to eat locally and they always love it. Can get very busy, just try your luck, it's worth it.
