wow what a find!! wanted a place to have a light meal before going to the theatre. the atmosphere was lively, filled with after-work groups, the wait service quite attentive, BUT the FOOD!!! was the BIG HIT!! having only 45 min., we ordered the bruchetta(yum yum) toasted just right and ooh th goat cheese amid the fresh tomatoes was... well let's i almost hated to share it. then came the "lollipops". they did not skimp out on the meat and oooh wow these i would if i could have everyday..i'd tell you more about them but you have to go enjoy these for yourself. wish this place was in my hometown...you lucky phillie-ites!
