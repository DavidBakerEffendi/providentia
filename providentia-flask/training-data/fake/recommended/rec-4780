I went out of my way to come here and eat when I visited Philly based on great memories I had from first trying the restaurant circa 5 years ago.  At the time, I thought it was outstanding.  I also visited last year for happy hour and thought they had decent margaritas.  This time though I must say I prefer the food at Chipotle and could not comprehend why they would ruin a drink by adding sour mix to my drink which was clearly listed on the menu as mezcal, St. Germain and lime.  Definitely would not go back!
