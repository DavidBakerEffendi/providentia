I've been in this neighborhood now for more than 15 years. This is my new favorite spot. There. I said it. The secret is out. I go for the food (great for sharing with a small group of 2-5 in my opinion so you can order one of everything and try more!), the funky and chill atmosphere, the quality sourced ingredients (I did the research!) and the friendliness of the staff. I went when it first opened and have been back more than 6 times (trying to taste everything and I STILL have things to try!) Tonight I had my go-to Seared Cauliflower- I'm ADDICTED- and the salmon sandwich. Delicious. Every time! I guess I was holding off writing this review in part because I don't want it too become TOO popular.... especially come summer with the backyard outdoor picnic tables, but..... secrets this good aren't meant to be kept! Plus I want the owners to be successful and stick around.
