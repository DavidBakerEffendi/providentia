The best Vietnamese sandwich shop in the city!! Very reasonably priced, about $7-8/sandwich. I suggest the chicken (#4 I believe.) Very intimate little sandwich shop with limited seating. The owner is very nice and the woman who makes the sandwiches always has a heartwarming smile. Great Vietnamese soda selection as well. Only downside is that they always seem to sell out of chicken, in which case I would recommend the classic "banh mi" sandwich (#1?)
