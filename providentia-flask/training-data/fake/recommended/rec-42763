I'm so in Love with this place. I went there Sunday for brunch with some friends. They quoted us an hour wait but we  were called back 15 minutes later. The food and drinks were absolutely amazing!!! The best part was we found a drawer at our table that housed all these notes that people left from years back. Of course we left our note, so we could be apart of the tradition. The only thing was our server really didn't have  that great of a personality, but everything else was wonderful!
