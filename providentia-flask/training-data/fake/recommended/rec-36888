my favorite restaurant in all of new york city.  the raw bar (i love kumamotos) has a great selection for not being mccormick's.  escargot is a MUST.  the waitstaff all speak french.  we usually go for dinner, but the restaurant opens at 7:00am for breakfast.  after your meal, head over to its bakery for a cup of cafe. make reservations at LEAST 1.5 weeks in advance.
