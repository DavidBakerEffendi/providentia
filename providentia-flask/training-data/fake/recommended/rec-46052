i've never actually dined in the restaurant, so i have no comment on the service (other than the fact that i've never had an issue while calling in or picking up an order). this is probably the best thai restaurant in the area, but that may not be saying much since there are so few. with that said, the ingredients are fresh and the food is tasty. the chicken is always a bit on the dry side, but it's fine. the curry puffs, satay, papaya salad, spring rolls, summer rolls, lemongrass chicken, all good. the only thing i dislike on the menu is the tom yum soup. i love tom yum, so that's a pretty big disappointment for me. they DO do deliver, but it takes them FOREVER, so i recommend take out. also, their delivery seems erratic sometimes; like it's not always available.
