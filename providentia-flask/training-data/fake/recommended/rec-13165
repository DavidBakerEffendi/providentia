this place has satisfied the 3 P's for me, price, portion and palate (taste).  the place is quite small and very casual.  the tables can get pretty grimmy but really what do you expect from a place that can satisfy the 3p's???  the menu so many varieties that it tends to be very overwhelming but everything is pretty much good (trying to go through the whole menu and trying a new dish each time i go).  the waitress speaks minimal english so if all else fails just point.  the hand pulled noodle soup is hearty but not greasy.  the portion is huge so be prepared to come hungry.  the best part of course is that its ridiculously cheap.  its nice to find places like this in nyc...it kind of keeps the balance with those pretentious, over-priced places :-)
