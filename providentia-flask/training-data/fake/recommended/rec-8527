If you are looking for a REAL Philly breakfast, this is the place. The food is always cooked perfectly (I have been coming here for years and it's been consistent). The home fries are among the best in the city. The omelettes are also delicious. Lee's now has a Veggie Steak and a Black Bean Burger to become more veg-friendly. It's always a risky move, considering a lot of places can't seem to pull of making a solid fake-meat hoagie. Lee's GOT IT RIGHT: -The veggie steak was made with seitan (wheat meat) and was smothered with cheese and the right amount of seasoning. It was filling and not too salty. -The black bean burger was also delicious, and I'm kinda a veggie burger snob. -The 16 bean soup is flavorful and creamy. Definitely get it if it's available. The environment is great for watching people walk by on 47th street. You MUST go to Lee's Deli NOW!!!!
