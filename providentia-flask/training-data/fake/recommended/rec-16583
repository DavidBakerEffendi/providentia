This place is unbelievable: my best meal in Manhattan so far. The restaurant itself has lots of atmosphere, it's quiet so you can actually have a conversation and the service is great. But the highlight is definitely the highlight. Those duck meatballs everybody is raving about? OMG -- the single best meatballs I have ever had, and one of my top three appetizers ever. The roast duck was equally delicious -- and leave some space for the delicious sorbets at the end. This food is just stunning and the prices are reasonable so I will definitely be back. Love it.
