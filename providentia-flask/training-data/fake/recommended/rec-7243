Last night was my second time visiting Malatesta, and was just as pleased as my first visit. Sometimes places are great the first time around, but lose their charm the second time around. Well not for me at Malatesta. The food is fantastic and the staff is amazing. Last night I went with one of my friends. We shared the grilled calamari over arugula. Light, healthy and delicious! For my dinner I had the spaghetti ala chitarra. It is a simple homemade (yes homemade) spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella. Delicious. My friend had the the spinach gnocchi (homemade gnocchi) with a gorgonzola cream sauce. I took and taste and enjoyed. We skipped desert this time. The total with tax and tip was $22 each. You cannot beat the price point. Best of all the food is amazing. The staff is also attentive and helpful. The waiters seemed to be all men that are easy on the eyes! Please note they do not accept cash. Also they only accept reservations for parties of 4 or more. So if you get there with only 2 or 3 people and have a bit of a wait don't get frustrated. Great place and gets 5 stars.
