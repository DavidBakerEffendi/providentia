Lovely, amazing meal in a cozy and soft (read: candles, quiet, romantic) atmosphere. The hostess was so welcoming and friendly. The rest of the staff was also on their A-game- I had everything I needed throughout the dinner without feeling smothered. Food: absolutely delicious. The fried chicken is a must. If you or someone if your party doesn't order it, you'll simply have to watch everyone around you get an order of the beautiful fried chicken. It's seasoned just right, crisp, and manages to stay moist. Their burger is also great, cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy, and the accompaniments (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickle, etc) were all fresh. Mac and cheese was a well executed side- nice charred top with plenty of cheesiness. When we got our check, we were given complimentary lemon cookies. A sweet (but totally unnecessary- the food and service speaks for itself) gesture that just clinched our next return.
