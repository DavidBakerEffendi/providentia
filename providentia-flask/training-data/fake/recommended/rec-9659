My review of Clinton Street Baking Company was in comparison to this place. This place is better, food, prices, and less wait. I'm only afraid that the people across Houston will get more hip and then my trek across the Brooklyn Bridge to go to this gem will be longer (usually 15 minutes). 1. There Pancakes are the best I've had in NYC; if you know a better place please suggest. 2. Their French toast might be better, they use Texas toast. 3. Their eggs taste fresh and their greens are really mixed greens.
