Wow. I was not expecting much when I walked through the door, but this place has the BEST hamburger I have had in Manhattan. That Bronte burger is absolutely delicious... Better than the burgers I have had at Shake Shack, Pop Burger, Corner, etc... It may even be one of the top five menu items I have had in Manhattan period.
