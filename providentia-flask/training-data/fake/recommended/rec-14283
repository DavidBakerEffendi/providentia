Loved it, loved it, loved it! I'm from San Francisco and am used to fabulous restaurants. This one joins my list of "Oh-My-Gawd-You-Must-Go Eateries of America."  I was visiting NYC recently staying at the Hotel Rivington, about 3 blocks away and discovered Clinton Street Bakery through Yelp.  It recently got voted the #1 place for breakfast in TimeOut New York.  So, I decided to check it out by myself. My partner was working, so I grabbed a newspaper and walked from my hotel to the restaurant to enjoy a tasty breakfast alone. I went on a Monday morning about 10 a.m  So, there was no line and I got seated at the best table in the restaurant next to the window.   The interior reminded me of a vintage bakery with classic fixtures - kind of like a 50's soda fountain.  The lighting and furniture looked like it was from Restoration Hardware. And there was a VERY CUTE guy from New Zealand sitting right next to me - icing on the cake. The food - simply perfect!  It was fresh, very well prepared and tasty.  I had the Autumn Scramble with goat cheese and sauteed mushrooms with a dash of fresh cut Thyme sprinkled on top. The eggs were cooked to perfection - fluffy, bright and light and the toast tasted like fresh baked bread (it probably was since this restaurant also a bakery). Highly recommended - and try to go during the week to avoid the long line I keep hearing about. Oh - and they only take cash. If you don't have cash, there's a corner store next to the restaurant with an ATM. It charges $1.95 transaction fee.
