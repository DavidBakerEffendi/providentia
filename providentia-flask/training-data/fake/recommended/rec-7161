First of all, this place is huge.   I really don't expect Manhattan to have restaurants this big. To help pay for the space, this place is also overpriced. I really wasn't a huge fan of this place, as I found it to be similar to the traditional Mediterranean places I often inhabit.  Because in the end, it doesn't take that much to make good hummus or dip - just the freshest ingredients and the right ratio of  spices The Brussels Sprouts in yogurt was actually quite original and delicious, with a creamy exterior covering crisp Brussels sprouts and sweet dried fruit in between.   But that's just one of too many overpriced dishes. Still, if you're looking for a good atmosphere and easy to get reservation for a large group, this is the place.  Though obviously there's a reason why...
