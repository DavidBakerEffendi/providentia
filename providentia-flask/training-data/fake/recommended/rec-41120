Love their pastas! I've tried almost every pasta and loved them all, bu I usually go with the most basic one that is garlic and oil. I also get the salad with red onions and walnut, and seafood appetizer plate. I wish they have a big cheese selection like Otto. It's packed and hard to get a table, and a hostess is rude. There are too many people hanging out at the bar and it's annoying.
