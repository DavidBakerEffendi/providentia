5 stars all around. From the waiter, to the food and drinks , to the owner. Always packed but what do you expect from a fantastic restaurant! Appetizers are fantastic, main dishes are delicious whether its the cod fish or steaks, and the desserts are to die for. If you haven't gone yet you are Missing Out on fantastic meal and service! Only one negative and thats the Steak on the Stone. The reason why is that the customers don't know how to cook it , yes the steak comes to you raw and you have to cook it to your liking. This brings out a white smoke, that looks like fog, so imagine if your sitting there and 4 or more people order this. But its only temporarily.
