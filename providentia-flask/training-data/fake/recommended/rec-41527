While strolling along the west side I stumbled across a cute little thai place. I would call it sweet and petite. like the name connotes, simple and good! Try the Yen Ta Pho if your a vegetarian, most other dishes make me want to try meat, but I wont, hehe. Excellent yuzu lemonaide, very yummy to the tummy.
