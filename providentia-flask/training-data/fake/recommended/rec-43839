I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I've been coming to Chavela's for years and have never been disappointed. The brunch is AMAZING. Get the Chilaquiles. Just do it. Oh, and you will deeply regret it if you don't get a Don Pepino. That is the cocktail of the gods. Happy hour deals are awesome, service is great. There's honestly nothing to dislike about this place, except for the fact that the tables are so crammed in there that they have to physically move the table before you can get up from your seat. But this is NYC, I guess that's to be expected.
