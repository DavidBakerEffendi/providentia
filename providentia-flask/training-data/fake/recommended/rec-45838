Back when I drank beer (a lot), this place had the best.  For a girl, that raspberry infused one is awesome.  All of their other ones are delicious as well.  If you like beer, get the sampler.  It's a really nice idea and enables you to try them out.  If you're feeling a little wild, order your favorite in a pint afterwards. For food, I tended to hail back to my British roots and get the Ploughman's Lunch.  Yummy cheeses with good bread and a delicious chutney.  And I remember it being very, very cheap.  Not cheap.  Cheap is negative.  Affordable! Their sandwiches are great too.  I never ate anything here I didn't enjoy.  Fries are the BOMB.
