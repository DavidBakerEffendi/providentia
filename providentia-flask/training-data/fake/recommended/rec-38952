two words... overrated and racist... I was visitng UVM and i wanted to try Bove's, I was really excited but my experience there was horrible. My friend who is a student at UVM and I are asian, walking in everyone turned to not look but stare at us. I expected it, being where I was, but it was extreme. We waited to be seated but instead we were yelled at to take a seat where we wanted after standing at the entrance for over 8 minutes. We sat and looked at the menu and continued to get stared at, not only from the patrons but from the people who worked there. the only person not to give us weird looks was our server, I didnt get her name but she was sweet. We order our food and i have to say it wasnt that good. it was nothing like the reviews nor what everyone rant about. we got the raviolis with the vodka sauce. It was like a tomato gravy with a slight kick... but the kick was SALTY, at first its not that bad but it adds up after a couple of bites. The water glasses were small and i mean small, its smaller then a 8oz kid size glass. I got a large soda and it wasnt any larger then the glass of water. With the salty pasta, we could us all the water we could get and the refils didnt come too fast. We also got bread with out meal, but it wasnt anything special, it was slice white sandwich bread. The place is pretentious too i think, they play the episode of throwdown with Bobby flay on loop, over and over again on a little TV next to their bottle sauces. Dear i say it, but i rather go to olive garden over this place. Oh, remember to seat yourself and bring cash, cause they dont take card.
