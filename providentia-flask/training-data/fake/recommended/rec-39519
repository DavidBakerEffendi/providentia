The empenadas were 3 diffrent kinds, so u have your choice of meat poultry vegy, very good..the service was a bit slow, and since I am originally from NYC, the atmosphere was comfortable, but for sunday brunch I dont want to sit next to drunk people, that was the only down fall...I will try it again
