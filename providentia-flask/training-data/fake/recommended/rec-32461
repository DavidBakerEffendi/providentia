Tiny hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese soup - the BEST around. We have now tried pho at many other places and nothing else compares. Not many choices, but you don't need them! Beef noodle pho with the Vietnamese iced coffee or the iced tea is a perfect combo. Prices are fine for the HUGE amount of soup you get. a must-have!
