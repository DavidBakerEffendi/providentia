If you're looking for consistently amazing food this is the place to go. The food is a perfect mix between eclectic dishes like Ox Tail Bone Marrow to simple like good ol' Fried Chicken, the best of both worlds. The service rocks as well. Very attentive, polite and knowledgeable staff. If you have any questons on the food/drinks and suggestions they are on point, and I was happy with the suggestions made by my server on both of my visits. The restaurant is a little small so dinner could be tight on a busy day or night but it gives a very quaint feel and I wouldnt have it any other way. Â  If youre into trying non-conventional food and cocktails this is a wonderful place to try. The Spicy Fish soup and the Duck soup are super tasty and the escargot was beyond delish. Even the coffee smells like heaven. I would go back over and over agian!
