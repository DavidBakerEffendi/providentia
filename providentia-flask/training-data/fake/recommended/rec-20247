This is my favorite brunch spot. I have been here a total of 5 times, 2 of which were this month. Buttermilk channel never dissappoints. Their prices are beyond reasonable. I highly recommend visiting them for.brunch, but be prepared to wait for about 30-45 mins if you arrive after 10am. I always get the bourbon pecan pie French toast. I wish I could make it at home. I guarantee your plate will not have a single pecan or piece of bread left on it. As a side dish I recommend the house made sausage. I also must give high mention to the hostess. She makes my experience there that much more enjoyable. One Sunday I waited over an hour for a friend of mine that was running late outside in the cold and she provided me with a seat at the bad and free coffee, which she didn't have to do. I will say that this place is worth leaving whatever borough in which you live.
