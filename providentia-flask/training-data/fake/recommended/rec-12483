Super touristy but great food. Eataly has many restaurants within its walls and I have only had the pleasure of eating at the Fish restaurant. My family loved it! The only problem is that if you go to a specialized restaurant (such as fish) you can only eat fish. As in, it won't come with a pasta or side dish, literally just the fish. The wait can be long but I found it to be worth it. Â The dessert bar and bread are also fantastic!
