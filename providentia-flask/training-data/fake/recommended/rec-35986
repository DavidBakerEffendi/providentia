I love this restaurant . I used to live up the block and came here all the time Â . I unfortunately had a terrible experience today . The bartender was super rude . I ordered a drink and he forgot . He was bro- ing down with the dudes next to me and served them water and drinks while I was waiting and they came after me . His personality was annoying and he was singing terribly while working . His vibe was lame , not sophisticated . He forget to give me a pen . I was there around 4:30 on a Monday . My first bad experience at this place
