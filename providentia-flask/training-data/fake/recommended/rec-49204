Loved Delaware & Hudson!!! We had brunch here on Sunday -- spring vegie omlet, baltimore crab cakes, scones and biscuits, fresh berries with famers cheese, and a couple drinks. Everything was excellent, the potatoes that came with the omlet were the best we've had in a loong loong time. Crab cakes and the scones were the other highlights for us. Everything was super good, though. Atmosphere is famer chic to go with the farm-to-table style, service was super attentive. Having a toddler with us wasn't an issue, he ate most of the scones. Will be back.
