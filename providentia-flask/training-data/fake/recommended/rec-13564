I came here last week and my friend made a reservation for a party of 4 on Savored for 7pm. We all arrive at 7pm and told the hostess that our party was all here but she said the reservation was actually for 7:30pm, which you would think they would just seat us first since we were the only party there waiting and there was a table of 4 available. However, another party (same size party) came in without a reservation and got seated before us. We were so confused and wondering how and why they would be seated first when we had a reservation. To make matters worse, we didn't get seated until 8pm. We were very frustrated with the whole situation especially since the hostess never even apologized for her mess-up. The food here was good though and the waiters were very friendly and nice. Unfortunately, we had that experience in the beginning, which might cause us to never come back here again.
