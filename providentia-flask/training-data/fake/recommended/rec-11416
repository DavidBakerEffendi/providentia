Nevada Diner was the ultimate diner experience!  Let me set the stage for you here:  there were 11 of us together after visiting my boyfriend's Grandmother in the hospital.  We spent all day with her, and by the time we all made our way to Nevada Diner, we would have eaten pretty much anything!  I was a little nervous as it was prime-dinner time on Saturday night, and it's hard to find a place for that large of a group to walk in.  Well the staff here seated us right away, and they had us laughing because they were thrilled there were no small children in our party! Michelle, our server, should earn her place in heaven for her service.  She was patient while we all figured out what we wanted to eat or drink, and she joked back and forth with us the whole time.  She had been there since 9 that morning, and stayed late with our table.  I'm usually prepared for a surly teenager as a server when eating at a diner, so Michelle (who is by the way in law school right now!) was a breath of fresh air. The menu is extensive, you can get anything from salmon stuffed with crab to sweet potato fries to fried chicken.  I got the gyro plate, which came with zucchini sticks (the zucchini's answer to french fries).  It was delicious, and a huge portion.  I won't go through the 10 other entrees we ordered, but some notables include their chili, which is served with a pile of tortilla chips, and their grilled chicken with pasta. The desserts looked amazing, but we were so stuffed we couldn't quite get there.   We had such a nice time at Nevada Diner, and I appreciate how accommodating they were to a large (and noisy!) group.  If I'm ever in the area again, I would definitely go back!
