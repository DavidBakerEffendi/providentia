I had dinner here with two friends and It was the perfect number for this place.  Most of  menu items are plated with three servings so sharing was easy.  The service made some great recommendations for things "not to miss" -- so don't be shy about asking.  There's no waiting area or bar area so we waited for our table at a bar down the street -- no biggie.  And the wait was well worth it!!! Great addition to the Sunnyside foodies. Thanks SNF.
