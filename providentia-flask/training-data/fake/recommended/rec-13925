I've walked past ilili a number of times and was never really sure what it was (or how to pronounce the name) but finally swung in for a bite with a few friends the other night and was very impressed. For the three of us we ordered five of the starter "mezza" dishes and each chose one "meshweh" entrée as recommended to do by our server.  This was a lot of food and we left stuffed.  Next time I will recommend to the table we skip the entrée and just order two additional mezza dishes as the starters were the most memorable dishes.  The following dishes are highly recommended: Lamb Makloubeh and Duck Shawarma are a must, the Black Iron Shrimp was also very tasty and no Middle Eastern meal would be complete without the Hommus w/ some nice puffy pita. Service was excellent.  We were seated promptly, our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations, the sommelier came over right as we sat down to ask about wine, and all of the food came out in a timely manner.  Given the ammount of food we ordered plus wine, $65/person including tip felt very reasonable. Major thumbs up for the décor, the spacious high ceilings and classy modern wood interior was a great choice.
