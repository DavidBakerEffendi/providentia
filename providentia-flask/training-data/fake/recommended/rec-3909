This is really my favorite restaurant in all of New York City. I can't believe I haven't written a review until now. I can't imagine anything I say actually justifying the experience of eating at Rose Water. I would recommend anything on the menu. Everything you eat here will be an experience that you won't forget. The lines for brunch are long, but I would wait hours if necessary. Rose Water really represents the calibre of food in New York for me. There just isn't anything quite like it, and it's really the best. I've had multiple best-meals-of-my-life at Rose Water, and I will be living off the memories of this place forever.
