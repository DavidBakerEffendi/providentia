My trusty Yelp iPhone app lead me to this place while I was bopping around Soho. I was looking for something American/traditional that I could get to go and hopefully wouldn't pay too much for. I decided on Ruby's and chose the Blueys chicken sandwich. All the raves about the sweet chili sauce sold me. While I was waiting, I realized I hadn't specified what kind of cheese I wanted. To my chagrin, I found out it was Swiss (bane of my existence), the only cheese they offer, and it was too late to change (boo). Considering that I paid ~$12 for it, I just assumed as seemed to be the case in other NYC restaurants, that it came with a side of some sort. When I got my order, lo and behold, at the bottom of my white handled bag was a lonely sandwich. Let me qualify this by saying: I'm from Chicago (new transplant), I don't pay a lot of money to get decent food. So not only did I pay $12 for a sandwich alone, it was a sandwich with Swiss cheese on it (epic fail). So I was bit apprehensive with the first taste, but I was surprised. The sandwich was damned good. That sweet chili sauce is pretty fab. Almost enough to make up for the lack of sides and $12 price. Almost. (The woman working there was nice, nonetheless.)
