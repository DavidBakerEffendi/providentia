Delicious rolls but AWFUL wait and service - the cashier, Scott, did nothing but bark and me, the other customers, and the poor guy in charge of calling people's numbers/handing out orders.  With waiting in line, and then waiting for my order it took a full 30 minutes until I had my rolls.   also you have to order two rolls for it to be a meal
