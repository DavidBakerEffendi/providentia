Oh my gosh. My soup was so good, I'm still thinking about it days later. Broth was good. Dumplings were excellent - no, sublime. And the hand pulled noodles were really something else. If you are lucky - and it's not super busy -you can grab one of the spots that has a view of the kitchen. Watch in delight as they expertly pull the noodles from dough in the back. Minutes later, you are slurping your soup. And it's pure joy. I will be back. 5 effing stars!
