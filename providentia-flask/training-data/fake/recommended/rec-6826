A friend and I wandered here for a light dinner after a day at the beach, and started our meals with refreshing cocktails. I ordered the Summer Sangria, and it was decent enough. To eat we each ordered a salad. I ordered the apricot salad; he ordered the kale salad. Much to my disappointment, the apricot salad contained maybe a quarter of an apricot, way too much salt, and was too small for the price ($13). While I didn't try any of his kale salad, he said that it contained too many raisins and peanuts, and that he wouldn't order it again. Everything seemed fresh though, and the ambiance was nice. But I can't say that I'll go back.
