okay, so I'm docking a star for the priciness, but this place ROCKED. as a dive bar, it was everything I was looking for, with the added bonus of a *stellar* beer selection. bottles, draft, craft brews, micro brews, Belgian, you name it. the bartender was patient and helpful; he had us try several different brews before we finally came to a decision, which was super :) we ended up heading a couple of doors down to play some billiards, but I came running back to Eulogy before 2am, to buy a few bottles for home.
