The service was great. My friend and I ordered 6/7 dishes to split. Definitely recommend ordering and trying a lot and then sharing. Portions are more satisfying than you would think and reasonably priced. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the pork belly. It was melt in your mouth good! It's pork heaven, ok?
