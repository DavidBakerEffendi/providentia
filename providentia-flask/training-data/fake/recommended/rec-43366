Ate here during a one day visit of Princeton University and seeing that it was so highly rated on yelp. The full sandwiches are huge! My wife got a half chicken parm hoagie and I got a full chicken cheese steak. They were both good but we both agreed the chicken parm was much better. The place looks decent and was full of college kids. The only downside would be that there is no searing available. Prices were reasonable.
