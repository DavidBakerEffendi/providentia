I could not believe the interior of Room Service - it is so swanky with chandeliers, statues, dim lighting, lots of glass everywhere.  I thought for sure that dinner was going to set us back quite a bit.  The food is decently priced though, as are the drinks, which was a huge surprise.  The cocktail list is impressive - who thought there were more than 5 ways to make a mojito? My chili tofu was so spicy, I loved it!  They were not playing around.  I was also surprised by the amount of tofu I got because most of the time Thai restaurants will go long on veggies and short on tofu. I wish I could have befriended the group of trannies who were there that night.
