There is nothing like the spicy burn of basil fried noodles and the cool, fishball texture of a bubble tea to satisfy your soul. Really, this place is always consistently fast, quality, and cheap.  The restaurant consists of two "chambers," and sitting in the upper room is definitely preferable to the harsh, fluorescent lighting, undecorated, lower room, where you usually sit with another couple awkwardly staring at a flat screen TV on mute, patiently waiting for the waiter to come down the stairs with a tray of waters. If you're looking for a cheap but cozy date night, go here and sit in the upper room, which clearly has decorations from cafes that had occupied the venue prior...but it's steamy, open kitchen, dim lighting, and some nice candles. I heartily recommend the snow pea crisps salad with avocado dressing, and the noodle soups are nose-runningly good and big enough to share (If you're a 5'2 girl with an appetite like me).  Also the veggie dim sum sampler is very affordable and filling.
