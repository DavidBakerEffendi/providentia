I went for late brunch with a friend.  The food was solid but what I really liked was the super cute interior, attentive wait staff and lack of crowd!  I liked that they have a wide range of typical "brunch" plus more lunch type items.  The neighborhood, of course, can't be beat so I was happy to walk off my brunch while doing some window shopping.
