Wonderful pizza. Crunchy, fresh, the dough, and the quality ingredients are why this is the "best I've ever had" feels weird saying it but it is really good stuff. This was the second time we came here, only complaint is the service was slow as snails today. Soo, sooo slow. My husband and daughter had to leave while I waited an extra 15 minutes alone, for the check. I just left cash on the table and bolted, didn't want to waste another 15/20 mins for her to return. Its still a pizza joint, and i watched the waitress hang out at the front. Tsk tsk.
