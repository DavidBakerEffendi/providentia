I went there with three friends before Christmas, because one of them rated this as his favorite burger. First the burger is not a hamburger, it's a hot burger sandwich. Good, but definitely not a burger. Second, the service was AWFUL. We ordered our Bronte burgers with a bottle of wine, and the guy forgot about it. We got our burgers after about 15 minutes, and still not wine. So after 10 minutes, we ask him about the wine, and we saw him take it out and put in on the bar, but he didn't uncork it. By that time we had finished the food, so we just told him we didn't want it anymore. Throughout the whole meal, we kept asking for glasses of water, and after asking twice, he came with only one glass, when the four of us were empty. Anyway, I don't think I'm going back anytime soon///
