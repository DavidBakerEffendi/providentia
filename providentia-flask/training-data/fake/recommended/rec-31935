This restaurant is simply AMAZING!  I waited till after my birthday to write this review. Why?  Because so then I had the chance to try all the specials they had!  It was so mouth-watering. This is a fusion restaurant, so don't bother ordering traditional japanese sushi (not that they are bad, but there are places which are better).  You're here for the appetizers and the rolls!  I'm talking about the tuna dumpling (cooked tuna, avocado, & crabmeat wrapped together with raw tuna glazed with spicy red wine sauce), the monster (raw fish chunks over crispy thin pancake drizzled with seven different sauces), the lotus rook, the roti, the 2009, the monkey roll, hmmmm. Of course, not everything is amazing.  The presentation were amazing but they could do without some dishes like the Brooklyn or the 2005.  Their specialty is frying.  Anything with a fried ingredient is for sure to taste good.  I seriously believe they have this little asian guy making 100K a year from just frying. This place is small so it is always cramp.  That means you can hear everything everyone else is saying.  That also mean the wait.  OMG, since it gained popularity you are lucky if a seat opens up bc someone was just leaving.  Saying that, make sure you reserve or come in a small group (you and someone else).
