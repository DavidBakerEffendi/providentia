How can I describe Beana's in one word?  Lets see, terrible, overpriced, overproccesed and flat out gross, spring to mind.  I know thats more than one, but the awful experience I just had defies a brief description.  If you were to get a burrito from a vending machine, in an airport bathroom, I imagine it would be tastier than Beana's. First off the salsa doesn't even resemble salsa and tastes like Ragu brand tomato sauce with chili sauce added for spice.  I don't think this establishment knows you can buy fresh tomatoes.  Second, Tamales are technically supposed to be made with masa, not frozen chicken pieces and small amounts of flavorless corn mud.  Finally, the food is simply lazy, no fresh ingredients and plasticine textures are the norm here.   Avoid like the plague.   Oh and one more thing, its really expensive.  I probably could have paid someone to punch me in the stomach and got the same results.
