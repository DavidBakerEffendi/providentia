Very glad we tried Uva!  Terrific efficient yet thoughtful service, and interesting well-prepared, delicious food.  Good wine selections at reasonable prices.  3-glass flight deals before 7 pm probably accounted for early crowds.  Very cute decor, with outside enclosed patio and street tables.  Only downside was the extremely LOUD noise -- maybe the tile flooring, but  everyone was shouting to be heard.  Otherwise, very pleased. Entree of red beet fingerling gnoccchi with gorgonzola sauce and yellow tomatoes absolutely divine.
