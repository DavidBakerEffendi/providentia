Yummy yummy yummy! Tia Pol is great. The service is warm and welcoming, the options are a-plenty, and the food is fabulous. I've heard from others that their sangria is really good, but did not have a chance to sample it myself. I will say that of all their offerings, my favorite was the croquetas de jamón y croqueta del día. It's basically a little packet of ham wrapped around manchego cheese and artichoke heart - so its savory and creamy on the inside and the ham is delicious. Additionally, would highly recommend the pan con tomate y tres salsas. This is basically a crostini, but elevated. The bread is buttery and salty and amazing, and the spreads are unbelievable. Everything else is really good, although I'd stay away from the gambas al ajillo and patatas bravas. Even though they're two of my favorite tapas dishes, they weren't executed super well at tia pol. They patatas were a little too goopy with the sauce (and the sauce was a little to mayonnaise-y for my taste), and the gambas were a touch overcooked and dry. Overall, this is a great place, for a great value, with wonderful service. I'll definitely be back.
