I loved the whole atmosphere of Alta, very relaxed - even though the place is pretty large, it felt pretty intimate. Definitely would suggest making reservations. Also I would suggest asking the server (or food runner) to explain what the tapas were as they dropped them at our table. That was the only complaint we had, they would drop off the food and we would have no idea what it was. Good Wine List, but the Sangria tasted like a Mai Tai, kinda strange. We ordered over 15 tapas but here are my recos: Shrimp Risotta Pork Belly Skewers (BLT) Deviled Eggs (Truffle Oil is amazing on it) Short Ribs Lamb Meatballs and of course...the Brussel Sprouts - amazing! Amazing Desserts, must have: Chocolate Molten Cake Pop Rock Chocolates (with Makers Mark Gummies) Enjoy!
