My goal is to leave the card on green as long as I can when I come here. I love the parade of people and choices of rareness. I've been 3 other brazilian steakhouses and I love Fogo's meat the BEST!! Their salad bar has great choicest, but not as much as Chima's. My faves are the top sirloin and the beef ribs! I think I've sat around just waiting for my beef ribs to come out on that platter, then tell the guy to keep cutting it onto my plate.
