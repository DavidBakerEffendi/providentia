Peaches is the kind of place that makes me smile. Granted, not good when I'm watching my Weight Watchers points, but the food is undeniably awesome! Ambiance is chill, the people are fab, and the spot is tucked in right in nearby Bed-Stuy. I sing the praises of the catfish and grits, and the collards were something to tell mama'nem about. Thank you Peaches, for being right where I need ya:)
