Went here on business and was enthusiastic after checking it out on Yelp. The food & decor was every bit as good as suggested but the service was beyond slow. Over 20 minutes to get the first round of drinks!!! And it got no better from there... I am not hard to get along with but there were no more than 10 people dining while I was there and everybody was nice enough but obviously not in a rush. Our having to repeatedly ask for every drink, app. & entree is a deal breaker for me. Dessert may have been good but was afraid to order it.... Too bad.
