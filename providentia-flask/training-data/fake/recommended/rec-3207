I came here to use the bathroom. This place has a lot of heart though. There seemed to be a whole puerto rican family here. I got some sort of strange chicken dish. It was good except for the red beans. I was served food by like a ninety year old grandmother. Got to love it. I felt like part of the family. Note: There were a bunch of copies of the financial times here for the customers. This was pretty heavy reading lol.
