I feel bad for giving a three because I rarely give 3s. But anywho on to my review. The restaurant: very beautiful space. A bit cramped but beautiful the ambiance and lighting is wonderful. The old school glasses they use for the water so beautiful. The bathroom is beautiful. So the setting gets a 5 for me. The downside: the food. From all the reviews I read, I figure maybe I came here on an off day. I am a lover of mexican food ( no tex-mex yuck lol) So the tacos are decently priced. Average price for tacos anywhere in the city. However, they lacked something : the taste was way off. I compare my mexican food to the mexican food i eat off the mexican carts in the city or at my new fav restaurant in east harlem. These tacos were so bland. The quesadilla - I liked the presentation because it didn't look like the quesadillas that im use to seeing. However, the taste of these quesadillas were good but still lacking something in its savoriness of it in regards to the meat. The drinks: Only had a sangria and it was delicios. I really loved the fact that the sangria was on tap. I thought that was so DOPE! So maybe next time when I come to Chavelas I will have an entree and see if my opinion changes regarding the taste of the food which wasn't up to my standards. I did hear that others who went to chavelas before they moved saying that the food was much better at the old place than the new place.
