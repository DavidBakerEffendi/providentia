Wow!! This places was so good!! I think tapas are my new flavors! ( i guess kinda like dim sum--small plates) Between the four of us, we ordered: 1) A bottle of 2002 Malbec, Catena, Mendoza: 4.5/5!! (Malbec is my favorite red at the moment!) 2) Lemongrass shrimp skewers: 3/5 3) Quail Egg toast: 5/5 (soo good--my favorite dish of the night!) 4) Lamb skewers 3/5 (not much of a lamb person) 5) Seared flank steak 4/5 6) Duck banh mi 2/5 (disappointing if you're Vietnamese/Asian) 7) Butter lettuce salad: 3/5 8) Pulled pork slider: 3.5/5 9) Country pate:3/5 (not a pate person as well) 10) Some special on the menu that had avocado: 4/5 (pretty good, too bad i dont' remember the name) Overall good food!! The ambiance and service were great too. After dinner, we just walked around the corner to my friend's place, so that was convenient.
