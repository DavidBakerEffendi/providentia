Great food! Highlights: - Calamari: 1 Whole calamari with many grilled portions in hearty tomato sauce. Great start to the meal. - Riesling: Loved it. The only Riesling option on the menu. The waiter patronized us for getting the German wine choice at an italian restaurant. - Filetto Fettucini: MMMMMMM...damn good! Get it. - Caprese Salad: Just okay...mozzarella was not that flavorful an the tomatoes were fairly average. - Gelatto: Huge portions. We were seated in the "room to the right"...essentially it is the bar area. Our experience was in this room only; upon venturing to the bathroom after diiner, I noticed that the restaurant is actually gorgeous! I would DEFINITELY make sure you sit in the main dining room...and not the CELLAR to the right of the lobby entrance.
