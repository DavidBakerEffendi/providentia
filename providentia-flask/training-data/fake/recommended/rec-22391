I'm surprised to see lower ratings on yelp for this place. Went there last night (stumbled upon it as we were buying wine at the wine thief next door). Although we were dressed a bit slackerish (had been laying in bed all day, rolled out for a stroll, ended up getting hungry), they were incredibly friendly. The decor is nice. I thought the food was very solid - we got caldo gallego, lobster risotto, drunken goat cheese, warm pumpkin and pomegranate salad, and gambas sauteed in garlic. The lobster risotto and the shrimp were the best, with the goat cheese close behind. The bread is also warm when it comes to the table, which I like. The dessert was ok - not fabulous (we got the crepes). The service was wonderful. We brought our own bottle of wine, which was a good call since the wines are expensive and the corkage fee is $15.
