So excited to have this charming spot in my new neighborhood! Previously, I picked up coffees to go (they have milk alternatives for lactose intolerant folks like me), but today, I needed internet for a project (mine was down). Not only were they open on a holiday, they were so lovely and the food was so delicious. Looking forward to bringing my friend's here for brunch!
