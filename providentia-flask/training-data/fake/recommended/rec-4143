I would love to give this place 5 stars, but I can recommend it as a "good" seafood house not a great one- 3 1/2 to 4 stars. I live in the neighborhood and have dined here three times so far. It's the best seafood house in West Philly, but there are better ones in Center City. The service was fantastic. Last time I had lunch here my waiter was the most friendly attentive - but not too much - and charming guy: a short 60ish balding man with a great personality and very professional. The food ranges from good to excellent. The Lobster Bisque is out of this world. The oyster selection will please the connoisseur. I had the seared Ahi Tuna with wasabi cream - really good. The decor is nice, it's a converted pair of mid-19th Century townhouses converted into a rustic seafood place with antique oyster plates on the walls. One disappointment is that they tend to run out of the best dishes. For example, when I was there on May 20, 2014, they were out of four of the eleven appetizers. The other thing is that the place is pricey. Lunch, without any kind of alcoholic beverage set me back $30. Dinner can easily be double that, and if you have a cocktail with your meal, triple that. You are warned!
