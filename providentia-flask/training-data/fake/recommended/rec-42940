I really, really wanted to like this place. The reviews are so great and I love the "in the know" aspect of the hidden door. But at the end of the day the food was under seasoned and underwhelming. We shared several apps, sides, mains and a dessert. Not one of them was good. They were just ok. Sorely lacking in salt and overall flavor. Again, too many good options in NYC to waste calories on this crap. I was a nice day and I heard that they had a lovely garden. Wow - that was an over promise. It's actually tiny with a few uncomfortable looking metal tables & chairs. The cocktails were nice. I might come back to sit at the bar and have one. But the bar scene was kind of d-baggy. So probably not.
