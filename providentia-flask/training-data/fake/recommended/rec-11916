I wish there were more places like this in San Francisco - top notch food at a great price, without all the pomp.  It's a pretty small, casual, and loud sort of place, but that all gives Northern Spy a neighborhoody character.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu - everything we had was cooked perfectly with just the right textures and flavors.  We had the catch of the day and the meatballs, and both were excellent! The only downside:I wouldn't recommend eating here if you need to have a quiet/private conversation.  All of the tables are bunched pretty close together and the noise level does require you to shout a bit.
