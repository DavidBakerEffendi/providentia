I was hoping to find a new spot by my house to have brunch since the rating and reviews were so high but was disappointed. The Eggs Benedict are only available with the fixed price menu and they wouldn't compromise, there was nothing else I really wanted so I settled with the chicken burger which was ok, I didn't like the potato bread roll or chicken...but the fries were great! I think we must have bad luck this time round.
