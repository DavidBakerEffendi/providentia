Although I've stop coming here years ago because of many item on their menu wasn't at the same level as other local Vietnamese restaurant in the areas.   However due to unforeseenable delay in my appointment,  I wander in to have a quick bowl of pho instead of sitting in my car in south Philly.  I wad expected a bland broth like pho ha but instead the broth was rich & flavorful.   It was definitely made from scratch.  Will be back for pho.
