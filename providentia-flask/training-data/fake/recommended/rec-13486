Sad to see Salmon Benedict was not on their brunch menu. Their omellete Maison (smoked salmon & sour cream) Â was nothing exciting. Scones were on the dry side. They have a great beer selection . Very limited seating at this location. Service could've been better. Will come back again to give their Leige waffles a shot. Heard their yummy.
