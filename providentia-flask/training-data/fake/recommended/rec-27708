Growing up in Alabama and having lived in CT for the last 7 years I get homesick for some real country cooking. You can find it here! Best food I have eaten since I have been up here. Potato Salad just like I and my family make! Fried Catfish that will make you slap yo' momma! I will definitely go back! Beautiful interior! Great food! Pleasing service!
