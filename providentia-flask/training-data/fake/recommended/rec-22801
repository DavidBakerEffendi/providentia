I was excited to see a new Korean place in West Hartford after many years of going to other Korean places nearby. I lived in NYC for 6 years and loved going to Korea town for all the traditional Korean food. I am Asian so I am very picky about Asian food in general. Food: I have to say food was great! Love the side dishes! We were given 17 side dishes for 3 of us. We ordered BBQ beef, BBQ pork and some tofu soup, everything was delicious. I will not recommend ordering the combo, my cousin did that last time she was there and there was less food than if you were to order individually (not sure why, but that is what she experienced) Service: The service could be improved a bit. No, actually A LOT! The waitress we had was great, but the waiter was just okay (didn't even say hi, the first thing asked us was "Are you ready to order?" after we sat down for just a minute). There was something odd too - just right after we sat down, the hostess asked us to move to another table opposite from the table we were sitting at (the two tables were identical). The hostess said that the table we sat down was reserved? They didn't sit anybody until more than 30 minutes later. I give food 4 stars, but service 1 star - it really needs to be a lot better. Also, it is very noisy on a busy Saturday.
