We were just here this past Sunday for our final food stop before heading back to Boston, making a point of it to have some authentic NY pizza. It was raining cats and dogs, so to ensure that we did not have to deal some ridiculous queue like the day before at Grimaldi's in Brooklyn (which we ended up not dining at due to time constraint), we arrived at 11:10- 20 mins before the pizzeria opened. My review for this place mainly reflects my appreciation for how SO SO SWEET the staff was to let us wait inside for the place to open. They ended up seating us at 11:20.. another THUMBS UP!! Â Super friendly service and really tasty pizza. It's in a very practical location, in proximity to tons of retail shops and other diners/restaurants. Really great closure to our NYC trip!!!!
