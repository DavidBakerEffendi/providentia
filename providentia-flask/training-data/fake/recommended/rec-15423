2.5 rounding down. One word - overpriced.  The ambiance is very nice, and the staff is good. However.  Though the food was pretty good, relative to what you are getting, it is very overpriced.  I understand this is the Upper East Side.  Yet even so, $20 for what is essentially a small appetizer without gourmet ingredients is a bit much.  The appetizers are not samples of foie gras or caviar.  They are three small lamb meatballs and a little bit of polenta. Our group purchased two tapas, two glasses of basic pinot grigio, and a skirt steak, that ran a total bill of nearly $100.  My friend paid $29 for a pretty small skirt steak, which he described as 'the least filling steak I have ever had'.  There are plenty of high-end Manhattan restaurants where a large high-quality Filet and sides would be maybe $5 or $10 more. I do not mean to speak ill of the establishment or the employees, and I cannot speak for the happy hour or brunch.  However for a dinner, you can definitely get comparable quality for a much better price at many other restaurants in the area.
