I am on a BYOB kick... in comes Himalayan Cafe... 5 friends 3 bottles of wine and a 40... pure class... without a corking fee.. Lentil soup, not what I was expecting but still good... Corn soup... Â my friend described it as "cornbread in a bowl"... everyone else got the dumplings because they had read how good they were... and they loved them. I had seen someone else's plate walking in so I got that... number 29 with chicken... fan-freaking-tabulous... they serve the food with a spicy chutney which is tasty and great on or in anything... When the 3 bottles of wine and 40 were gone we were out 50 dollars... 5 people everyone with an app and meal... 50 bucks... I love NY
