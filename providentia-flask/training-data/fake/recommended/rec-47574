This is a fun, colorful, eclectic place to get some good Mexican food in a relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere. First of all, you walk into a dining room that is just a big space filled with hodge-podge mis-matchy stuff.  It's literally like misfit pieces of a flea market have been nailed on the wall, but it adds a ton of character to the place. The salsa is pretty good and the chips are fresh.  The servings are HUGE and they give you plenty of sauce and cheese on everything! You can definitely eat enough to get you full and still have enough for at least 2 more leftover meals. They serve up a pretty great tamale - which is my favorite on a Mexican restaurant's menu. Take Note that it is BYOB (as most places are in NJ) but there is a liquor store a few doors down. There is usually a line out the door to eat here, so that says something, too!
