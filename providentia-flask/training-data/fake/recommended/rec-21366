Terrific brunch! I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was definitely something I would order again. I also shared the macaroni stuffed corn bread ... which had just the right amount of mac n cheese! The service was great as well. My friends and I sat in the lounge, but it was a cool environment to chill and enjoy a good meal.
