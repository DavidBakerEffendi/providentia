Dear Artichoke, I know we talked about doing the long-distance thing, but don't you think that NYC to LA is a bit of a stretch? I realized that if I had your delicious, cheesiness to myself every night, I might die of a heart attack...so I think it's better if we part our ways to our respective coasts. It's not me, it's you...and your orgasmic sauce and perfectly sized crust that fills my mouth with so much joy and ecstasy. I'll miss you so much, but I definitely won't miss those drunken nights waiting outside your place in the cold. It was great knowing you. Maybe we can grab a bite next time I'm in town. Love Always, Kandice ferosh.net
