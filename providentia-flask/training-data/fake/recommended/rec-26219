Lunch is great value with the full banchan and soondooboo for about 14 dollars with tip. The soondooboo is best in k-town in my opinion. Tip:  don't wait outside and listen closely.  The hosts aren't good at calling our names and will cross you off the list of you don't respond within a few seconds
