My absolute favorite Italian restaurant in the area. Love supporting small businesses rather than the chains in the area, and this is definitely the best place to do that! Everything I've eaten there is delicious, and the bread is AMAZING! I dream about this bread. My boyfriend and I try to come here at least once a month. Friendly staff and owners. Small dining area, but I've never had to wait. Not open on Mondays.
