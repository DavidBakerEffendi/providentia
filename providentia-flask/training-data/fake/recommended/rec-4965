Anytime a restaurant tries to be everything it ends up doing nothing good. That is the problem with Concerto Fusion. They try to make Chinese, Thai, and Japanese food. The sushi is expensive and the fish doesn't look the freshest. The food overall is mediocre at best, Â but the service is just plain horrible.
