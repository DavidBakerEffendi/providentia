If you're looking for something quick, relatively cheap, and tasty, this place fits. The tokayaki(sp?) is delicious, and I highly recommend ordering a side of the rice bowl. I thought the ramen was good, too. Not sure about the previous reviews, but I thought the service was very friendly and quick. Had our order and food on the table in a few minutes.
