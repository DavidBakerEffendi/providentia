(1.50 stars)  The Nevada is, by virtual default, the best diner in my old hometown; whether the competition is called Willie's or The State Street Grill, the food has never been good.  Everything from this point forward depends upon common sense.  Unless it is billed as being scratch-made, anything which resembles a fine dining dish (e.g.- chicken cordon bleu, veal Oscar, etc.) arrives at the diner (almost any diner) frozen.  A diner which can't reliably defrost, heat, plate and serve defines a particular category of bad.  On the other hand, breakfasts, burgers, salads and sandwiches are pretty hard to screw-up (although some diners do).  Discussion to this point defines both the classic Jersey diner, and the current state of the Nevada.  This level of mediocrity, coupled with "new" prices which are much higher than local diner fare, pegs the Nevada as a bad diner.  The Nevada of a few years ago could competently roast beef or turkey, grill chicken or fish, make soup (without a canned starter) and generally serve good food; sad, but true.  The staff is often just "going through the motions."
