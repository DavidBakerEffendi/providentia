I grew up in this area and have mixed emotions about how the neighborhood has changed. One of the happy editions is Chevelas. I've been coming here for a few years and it has become a go to for happy hour especially. Their tacos are very simple and delicious. The fish tacos aren't part of the happy hour but are only $4. Favorite dishes include the mole enchiladas and chilé relleño.  If you come with a crew order the sampler, its like a Mexican poo poo plater, you'll love it. The drinks are OK. Good value for happy hour but the Es mi poli is my favorite by a long shot. They always have very creative and adventurous specials and they don't disappoint.
