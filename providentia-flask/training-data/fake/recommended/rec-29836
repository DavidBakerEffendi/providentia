The food is good and prepared to order.  This was our first visit to this restaurant.   We are visitors from South Jersey.   This is a self service business.  Be prepared to pay cash for your food.  Signs are all over the registers informing customers that they are a mom and pop store and they would appreciate cash.  Seatting is limited on the first floor, for about 12 to 14 people. More seating is available on their second floor, but the staircase is accessible from the outside.   We did not go upstairs so no report can be given. Service is friendly.
