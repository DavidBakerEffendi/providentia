Been coming here for over 30 years.  While any restaurant has ups and downs, MOTR has always been an enjoyable experience.  From having our wedding reception back in the early 80's to most recently our class reunion, it is a wonderful place to hold an event.  There has been a lot of nice upgrades over the years, but I think they need to invest in rest room upgrades.  Other than that, the bar area is very nice, and we enjoy the outdoor patio as well.  Food is always very well prepared.  Deserts are very good as well.
