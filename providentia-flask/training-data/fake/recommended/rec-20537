Fan freakin tastic. Went here last week with my sister before a concert and used a Gilt City voucher for 2 orders of chicken fingers, 2 sides, 2 sodas, and 2 cole slaws (the waitress gave us all 3 types just for kicks though). First, that is a HUGE amount of food for 2 people. We easily could've had at least one, maybe two more people join us. The chicken fingers were perfectly cooked and juicy (I think they use free-range, antibiotic-free chicken too, so cool!). We ordered the buffalo ones and the salted caramel ones (see my photo, but they're covered in pretzel crumbs and then drizzled with salted caramel). Both were amazing and I can't wait to go back. The salted caramel ones were definitely very different and very heavy, but too interesting to not eat. The slaws were good, but that's not why you come here so that doesn't really matter. The fries were also very good - we got the truffle ones and the purple sweet potato fries. The truffle ones were good - a bit sour (vinegar-y?) and the sweet potato ones were awesome. They were made with purple sweet potatoes, drizzled with some sort of sweet glaze and then topped with coconut flakes. Even without the voucher (I think we got all that food for $20 on the voucher), I'd return soon and often. It was a fun/different/cheap/fast dinner option and I'm hoping they open more spots throughout the city!
