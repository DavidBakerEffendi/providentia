No more Seattle Grunge or Big Kahuna dogs? Those were my favorite! I haven't been to Hot Diggity in a year or more so I wasn't privy to the menu changes! (Burgers?!) Interesting... Since neither of my "Go to" items were available I settled on a Mexi-Cali burger. It was tasty, but at 1/4 lb it was fairly small and left me wanting more! I guess I can't really complain - for the same $6 you'd spend at a fast food joint you're getting a much higher quality product and gourmet fixings to boot! I rounded out my meal with hand cut fries. I usually don't like French fries, but there is something about their good, thick, lightly fried potato wedge that keeps me coming back for more! I try a different dipping sauce every time and tonight the lucky winner was HD Special Sauce. It was reminiscent of Russian dressing, but a little sweeter and VERY garlicky! I enjoyed it, but it is definitely not for the faint of heart! Bring your own mint! Overall Hot Diggity is all about good food fast, with an ultra casual atmosphere and a healthy serving of nostalgia. It's a Philly must in my mind!
