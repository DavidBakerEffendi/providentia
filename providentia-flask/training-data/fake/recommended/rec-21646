OK, I'm not a local, but the two times I have visited Phillie, I have always had fun at Silk City. The diner itself has good food, beautiful tables, great view, and the waitresses are sassy and actually good at their job. Casual, hip, kinda hipsterish, but good ambience and open late. Fun fun fun. AND it connects to the lounge, a velvety red lounge with comfy places to sit and pass out on. The bar is smaller and the bartender is great and the drinks on tap were well poured and one can SMOKE in there...yippie!
