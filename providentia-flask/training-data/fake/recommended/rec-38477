This is a very tasty nice little place that I would highly recommend. A large space, simply, but very nicely, designed mostly with made-by-hand wood from Brooklyn. The food is exquisite with secretive recipes. Large amount of healthy choices with natural fresh ingredients. "Enjoy the flavors of Mediterranean" Igor
