OMG. Now that was excellent chicken , moist , flavor was out if this world! We had the whole chicken which was clearly one of excellent quality, no hormones or anti-biotics as you could tell from the size and taste. It was well flavored with many aromatic herbs . We also had the roasted potatoes and saut√©ed spinach , both were excellent. The woman I spoke to placing the delivery was so pleasant and personable , even the delivery guy was personable! So glad to have them in the neighborhood ..nothing compares in Murray Hill for delivery.
