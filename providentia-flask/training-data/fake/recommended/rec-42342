I am a native Park Sloper and had heard all the rumblings in regard to this spot. I decided to check it out.  I ordered the paella and was so disappointed.  The serving size was good the seafood looked fresh but the authentic spanish flavoring was missing(no saffron and other key ingredients missing).   My son ordered steak with mash potatoes and said it was ok.  He summed it up the best,"it is over rated".
