really great spot that I have been going steadily since they first opened.  what has it been now?  almost 9-10 years?  amazing how time flies, non?  the chicken is obviously a go to dish.  had the gnocci, kale salad recently, always delish.  not much more to say that hasn't been said.  this place is w.village staple year round and better than anything mepa ever could offer.
