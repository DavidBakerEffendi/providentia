Food was good, service was good.  But, the music was loud, and they sat us right in front of the music area, which took away from our evening.  Our server did a good job, but people kept coming to the table next to us to use their phones, and text messaging.  Bothersome.  The management doesn't stop this practice, so I probably won't go back.  They have all sorts of entertainment nights, so you cannot come here for a quite BBQ meal.  Also, they push the alcohol. BUT, if you can put up with all the annoyances, the food is very good.
