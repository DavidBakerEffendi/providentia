I LOVE THEIR PHILLY CHEESESTEAK! The thing between the two rivalry joints of Pats and Genos, is that this place doesn't scream out when you first look at the place. Its more relaxed and chilled to dine into compare to the very flashy Geno's. If I were to visit Philadelphia again in the future, I definitely won't be choosing side because I love both spots. They just have their own specific style of cooking and presenting their own philly cheesesteak. Pat's KIng of Steaks Philly Cheesesteak was just perfection. The bread was simple and tasty. The steak was cooked and sliced to perfection, it was juicy just the way it should be. The cheese wasn't too overwhelming but it had that ooey gooey feeling right when you first bite into it. *drool Gosh, reviewing these two philly cheesesteak makes me crave it even more. Too bad I have not found a good Philly Cheesesteak here in Los Angeles, CA. If anyone knows a place, please do recommend.
