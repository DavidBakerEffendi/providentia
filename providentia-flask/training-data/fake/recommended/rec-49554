The Artichoke slice is divine. The best I've had in America. It is as if the cheese and entire pizza has been artichoke infused. It is $4.50 a slice but once you have a bite you don't even care. It is open late, especially on weekends. 5am I think. And at 2am on party nights there is always a line.
