Totally agree with another reviewer that this place is a weird microcosm of gentrification in the neighborhood. Nonetheless, I love coming here. Great bread and sandwiches, moderately priced. Always playing old-school hip hop too which adds a half-star (though it is odd---hipster staff playing music that came from the neighborhood but serving mostly non-native Brooklynites). Really friendly, quirky staff too. One guy earnestly said my buddy had "great customer-staff interaction skills", whatever that means. Only negative is that the napkins, lids, silverware, etc. are stored in covered tubs which are difficult to access when balancing 19 bags of baked goods. Being nit-picky though.
