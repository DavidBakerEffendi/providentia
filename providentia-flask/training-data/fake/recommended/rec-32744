My wife and I didn't take part in the bar part of this place, which seems like the focal point given it's name and layout. Also, we went in the middle of the day during a snowstorm so it was pretty desolate. The food tasted great, but it is definitely tapas style. Not meant for large meals. The food menu is relatively small and doesn't quite give you the options that you would get at a larger Mexican restaurant. That was really disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it's good for what it's meant to be. I just wouldn't recommend it for if you're looking to fill up. Other than that, seem like a great place to hang with friends, have some tasty food, and probably better drinks in a fun atmosphere.
