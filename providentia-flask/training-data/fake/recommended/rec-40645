I brought my cousin here for her birthday a few weeks ago and overall, we had a good time. She ordered the crab cake dinner, another friend ordered the thanksgiving dinner and I had the Tandoori Chicken Kebabs (which were surprisingly good). We had the nachos as an appetizer and they were the best I ever had at a restaurant. The drinks were decent BUT for the price they definitely could have been in a larger glass. We were all disappointed about that. The only other gripe I had was being told at the front door that I'd have to pay $10 in order to bring the red velvet cupcakes into their restaurant to consume. I've never had to pay to bring a birthday cake or sweets into a restaurant when going out to eat to celebrate a birthday. Needless to say, I didn't pay because I guess the expression on my face told them that we'd be happy to celebrate my cousin's birthday at another restaurant. Unfortunately that kind of set the tone for the evening but we did enjoy ourselves and the food is absolutely delicious.
