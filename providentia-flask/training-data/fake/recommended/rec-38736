IndeBleu is a great little Indian restaurant in the heart of Philly. This is a place you can't go wrong if you want to impress your date. We went pretty late at night about their closing time but still got great unrushed service and excellent food..chicken tikka masala as well as the vegetarian options. Makhani Daal was perfectly slow cooked and appropriately spiced. My vegetarian partner loved it. CTM was cooked in tomato sauce which was a welcome and healthier choice and tasted really nice. Will definitely repeat next time we are in Philly. Missed the live music this time because we went so late.
