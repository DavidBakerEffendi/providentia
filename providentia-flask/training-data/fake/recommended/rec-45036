I stood in the looong line here 2 days ago and got a pork, provolone, and sweet pepper sandwich. It was good, but didn't blow me away. When I gave my husband a bite of my sandwich, he didn't care for it at all and said he much preferred the gyro he got at a different vendor. If I ever return to Terminal Market, I'd try a different food vendor too. All the people in line around me had never eaten here before either. To me this place is overrated.
