My friend who is a regular here managed to get us a table for 8 at 8 on a screamin Saturday night. I was impressed with that alone. But then the food came. and came. and came. And the wine arrived. and arrived. and arrived. We impressively managed to consume the wine supply, but not the food. Quite a shame because it was so authentic. My only regret of the night was the mounds of food we wasted. Unfortunately it's just not fashionable to carry doggy bags to bars. What a splendid way to spend my visit to the Big App with friends! Bravo.
