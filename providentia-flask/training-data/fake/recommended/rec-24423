Nice ambiance, OK service (waiters act like it's a chore to serve you, but they did keep our wine and water glasses full), and decent food. I had the Virginia surryano ham, potato Parmesan cakes, and poached eggs. Overall, the place didn't stand out in a positive or negative way. My date had heard great things, so was a tad underwhelming.
