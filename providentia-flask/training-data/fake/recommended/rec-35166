Call me crazy but I would never want to wait in line for more than, let's say, an hour for food, when I'm pretty sure a restaurant one street over is also making pizza. Unless you want to bask in the glow of saying you ate at Grimaldi's or you get a kick out of munching away while people outside look on longingly, I would 1) avoid the place like the plague anytime between 11:30-3 and 5-8, or 2) if you must go during those times, eyeball the line first and ask yourself whether you want to stand in the hot boiling sun for a few pies and sodas. Keep in mind that the service is not rude and sometimes even borders on friendly, but they do make a point of keeping things moving, so don't expect to spend a few hours catching up with friends. Also ... not to start a riot, but when we left at around 1 on a Sunday (and the line outside was ridiculous), there were several empty spots at the bar and tables which could have easily seated a two-person party. Now for the star of the show: this is not your overpuffed, Pizza Hut/Dominos deep pan pizza. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the thin crust, because I like eating more of the toppings than the actual dough. The mozzarella is delicious, though I wish they wouldn't skimp on the basil leaves. Get the italian sausage topping (or don't, if you're a vegetarian or just loathe sausage, but that means we can't be friends). Grimaldi's does one thing right - the dough should form huge bubbles near the crust. Wash it all down with a black cherry Olde Brooklyn Soda, grab some cash from the in-store ATM, and kindly open up a table for the next party.
