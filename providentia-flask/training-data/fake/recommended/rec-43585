There is something about Boqueria that always makes me want to go back. I think they have the perfect combination between ambiance, food and drinks. I've been going there for the last three years and trying to taste something different every time, but I have to say that they haven't changed the menu since the first time I was there, which does not bothers me, but it would be nice to find something new from time to time, when you don't get the chance to catch the special of the day. Patatas bravas, pintxos morunos, txipirones, butifarra, tortilla española, paella, gambas al ajillo, shishito peppers, croquetas, bocatas calientes, cojonudo, their selection of cheeses and embutidos are just amazing. Everything that I have mentioned above are some of the tapas that I have tasted and enjoyed, they are so well made and perfectly seasoned and what I really like is that  I get the same flavor/presentation everytime, which means they are constant and there is a great job going on in that kitchen. Service is pretty good, the drinks are also great, the bartender is very knowledgeable and helpful, I mention this because he has helped me out a couple of times to remember and made me a cocktail that I tasted before somewhere else and I couldn't remember the name. I also enjoy the fact that you can see the kitchen staff making your food right in front of you and how they manipulate everything so quickly  and neatly. The reason that is holding me of giving them 5 stars is that the tables are extremely too close to each other and it is pretty uncomfortable to move around and their desserts could be much better, I know this is not what they are focused on, but still, they could go way far from crema Catalana, yogurt with fruits, chocolate cake and churros. Even though they wouldn't like to improve the dessert menu, they could improve their desserts' recipes. But besides those two little things I will always come back to Boqueria. I really love it and recommend it.
