I gave Peaches Hothouse another chance recently and I am happy I did.  The wait for brunch around 2pm on a Sunday was long, but it gave me ample time to catch up with my good friend.   Eventually we were seated at the bar, and decided to order the chicken and share some sides.  She got an order of regular fried chicken and I got the medium spicy chicken.  The chicken was fried perfectly!  The right amount of crisp on the outside with tender, seasoned meat on the inside.  I even enjoyed the breast piece, which I don't usually prefer, but this piece was moist and delicious as well.  perfect.   For sides, we shared the kale, fries,  and potato salad.  The kale was well seasoned and tasty, the fries didn't look like much but were quite good and the potato salad with bits of bacon was amazing!  I forget the name of the drink we had, everyone at the bar was drinking it, but I enjoyed it as well.  It was potent and a little sweet, pretty good. Peaches HotHouse is a small spot with good food.  It is perfect for brunch or a dinner with a small group of friends or even a date.  There's a bar, so I would definitely return solo for some good eats and a drink.
