On a quick trip to NYC and stumbled upon this little gem.  We had a hard time deciding on a few things so Mario had the staff set us up with a sampler of a few dishes and even the wine selection the waitstaff chose for us was top notch.  I highly recommend the Lasagna bolognese and everything else here.  Great food for a great value.
