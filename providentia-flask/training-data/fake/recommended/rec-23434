Ok, I'm allowed to bitch because I grew up on cajun/southern food. If you just think cooter is another word for lady parts, you don't know southern food. heh heh cooter I've had the food a couple of times. I'm honestly disappointed and I'm sad because I really want a good cajun place in the city. Nothing has hit the mark yet. 1. the gumbo comes in the tiniest serving I've ever seen. The point of stews/gumbo is that it's usually cheap to make. Give a little 2. You need jambalaya. and maybe some crayfish etouffee. If you're going southern, let's do it. 3. I got the deviled egg. so two halves of an egg completely covered in salt. I have never experienced so much salt. It's the easiest dish and it somehow managed to get f*cked up. Calm the salt-hand. (ps, I covered it in crystal to try to cover the salt. I could barely eat the things) 4. A pulled pork po'boy. Awesome. but again, so much salt! CALM THE SALT HAND. and I LOVE salt. I'm usually adding it but I have never had so much salt. Let the food speak for itself. If you need to douse salt, that means your flavors are off. Revamp. So the salt factor...I left there with my stomach literally hanging over my jeans. Muffin-top alert. I had to waddle home, I was so bloated with salt. Please please please learn to cook good cajun food without the salt. I will love you forever for some good jambalaya...or I'll make it and bring it over. Merci beaucoup
