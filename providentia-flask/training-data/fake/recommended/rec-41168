There's a reason why this place is famous. I had a Shiromaru Hakata Classic few weeks ago. When I tasted a broth, I felt "this is it" There was a very deep pork flavor with silky, milky texture, which is almost close to beef-bone broth. (It means they nailed the broth.) And I could taste the hint of ginger, garlic and the other ingredients inside of the broth. It's a harmony. This is why they don't have any extra seasonings on the table. The noodle was perfectly cooked and soaked little bit of the broth. Cha-shu was melting down on the tongue. However, my missing star goes for Nitamago which have to pay extra 2 dollars and not too special comparing to the broth and noodle. The atmosphere was superb. Little bit fancy,authentic Japanese fusion, beautiful interior.
