We started with a nice jamon cerrano appetizer and cheese and a great white wine from Spain. Then we went ahead and tried the tortilla espanola which i haven't had it since i was a little kid and it was very good. We also tried the shrimp in garlic sauce and the famous rice they had perfectly prepared. I have to say that this place has a great env great decor and great service, i will def come back....oh i almost forgot the Red sangria Stunning....
