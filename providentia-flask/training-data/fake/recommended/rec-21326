This review is only for brunch/lunch. Went here with my husband and in-laws this weekend for a 12 pm brunch and it was absolutely lovely in every way. The airy Â decor, the friendly service, and the fantastic and clean food. Highly, highly recommend. Especially delicious were the fish sandwich and the eggs benedict. Oh, and the coffee was superb!
