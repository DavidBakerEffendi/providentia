Six of us had dinner there on a Saturday night.  We were able to make a reservation and sat down the minute we got there.    The service was very attentive, but not intrusive.  We were blown away by the food.  I had a shrimp dish that was really out of this world.  I ate every bite after 2 cheese rolls (indescribably good) and a cup of potato soup with chorizo.  The drinks were great, mine was mulled fruit,  sugar and vodka, and the desserts were fabulous.  I loved the guava mousse with cheese.  We can't wait to go back.
