I love the Steven Starr dining experience. You gotta hit this place up, for the exceptional cuisine, and decor . A fun dining experience , great food , good service, and the drinks are flowing. Great place to sit at the bar, sip on a drink and enjoy the fresh guac. And if you're feeling froggy, don't forget to egg a pic in the photo booth. Fun fun fun...... And a full satisfied tummy. Enjoy diners!! Oh and thanks again Mr. Starr keep doin what you do best!!!
