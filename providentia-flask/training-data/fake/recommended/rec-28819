I had hoped for traditional Indian chaat - given my cravings one weekend. But the chaat severely disappointed me. It was definitely more Americanized (which I'll accept) but even the different chaat we had ordered ended up as pretty much the same mix of stuff with one/two variations. I wish they had proper samosa-chana chaat and pav bhaaji. Lassis are a good fare - but not worth venturing all he way there for it. Have one when you are in the area, that;s all. I hate that this place has such rave reviews. It is not worth it, I'm sure. The owner, to me, comes off as a little over friendly, and I had hoped the chaat would be as good as he said - but I won't go back for it. I'd much rather not spend on what seems an awful imitation of real chaat.
