Not sure what all the hoopla is about this restaurant, but it was fine and price is good.  Typical one star on service and decor as most Chinese restaurant.  Shaved noodles are definitely better than the long noodles which were soft and too long so it was difficult when trying to scoop out a portion.  Menu is very limited, only two items did not come in soup.  And soup was nothing special.  Would go again, but would not wait if there's a line since there are plenty of other good restaurant next door and across the street.  Also, tables are crowded together so seating is tight.
