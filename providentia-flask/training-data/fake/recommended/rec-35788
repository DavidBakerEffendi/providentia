Had a one night stay in Philly recently and was able to reserve about and hour and a half prior for a Saturday night.   We ordered 6 plates (one of which was roasted almonds)  for two.  With the complimentary mahon crisps, I think we had one too many dishes for a moderate appetite and budget. Raved over chestnut soup with quail egg,  roasted duck and almost over green beans. Other dishes were well prepared but not as amazing.   White Sangria pitcher was extreeeemely watered down.   Perhaps cocktails would have been a better choice. Our waiter was great.   The have 3-4 tables in the basement,  which felt weird at first but such is the long, thin shape of the building.  We sat in a grouping of two tables for two that basically force the couples to share their experience, luckily the folks seated next to us were great,   but no very private moments there.
