While Yelp triumphantly declares that "vegetarians go nuts for this spot," I'd advise the herbivores out there to hold their tongues before singing Woorijip's praises (haha- tongues -- get it?!). The hot buffet area has numerous dishes that are clearly marked as vegetarian, including kimchi pancakes, kimchi rice, and tteokbokki (rice cakes in a spicy sauce). There is little doubt it my mind that, true to the typical Korean recipe, Woorijip's tteokbokki are enhanced with some kind of fish flavoring (perhaps fish sauce, cakes, anchovies, etc.). In my own cooking I've frequently substituted seaweed for "fish" flavoring, but this was nothing of the sort. As for the kimchi - according to the containers sold by the check out, these also contain derivatives of fish (though I don't remember in what form). So unless they are making special kimchi for their pancakes and rice, I'm assuming that they, too, are not actually vegetarian. Sincerely, Non-vegetarian fish-hater
