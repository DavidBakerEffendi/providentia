The drink who carries signature title perilla is delicious Duck meatballs - spicy but good, still nothing to rave about although the quail egg added an interesting twist perhaps a second egg and a sweet bread would have made it perfect. Gnocchi and bone marrow - salty for my taste- but the bf seemed to like it. It reminded me of moms goulash sans potatoes replaced with gnocchi Ricotta crustini - suprisingly delicious with a deep fried topping goodness better suited for brunch or dessert still made me happy mid meal. Spicy popcorn was spicy but made for a nice side. House special tuna - amazing and interesting combination topped with greens mini pickles toasted garlic and accompanied  with a soaked toast covered in some sort of fatty goodness. Some of the best brussel sprouts I've ever had! They mix them with house made trail mix and you get something sweet+crunchy and healthy :) Steak is yum! Cooked to perfection a nice medium over spinach served with oyster mushrooms and it comes precut for you, what more can a girl ask for? Whereas the duck I'm not impressed with despite the rave reviews. The duck breast was cooked medium and it reminded me of my moms liver. It was tender and tasty just not memorable or impressive to my pallate.   Lastly the dessert which you had to order before dinner was the chocolate souffle and it was very good but I was too full to truly enjoy it by the time it came out.
