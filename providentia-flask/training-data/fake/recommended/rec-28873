Alta has a great atmosphere, and the service was quick. Be sure to confirm your reservation when they call the day of the reservation. We had several dishes and they were all excellent. the lamb meatballs are great, and there were probably two dozen mussels in the serving or more. The brussel sprouts are one of my favorites, and even someone who doesn't normally like them might as they are very good. We ended up getting two of those they were so good. The skirt steak with chimichuri sauce was prepared to perfection, and was the perfect size, even if you split it. I would definitely recommend the place.
