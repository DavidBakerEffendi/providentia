Very charming little restaurant near Rittenhouse Square.  We got there at 6:00 pm on a Thursday, and the place was empty - by 7:00 the place was full. Had the calamari appetizer - VERY different, not fried, and in a mix with tomatoes, beans and a VERY good broth, all of which sort of overpowered the calamari.  We also split an artichoke heart which was perfectly tender and very flavorful. I had the special pasta which was in some kind of pesto-lemon (?) sauce with grilled octopus.  Loved it and nearly licked the plate.  Carol had the shrimp pasta dish - not nearly so flavorful -neither the shrimp nor the pasta.  Might have gone five stars had she liked her food a bit more. In any event, Melograno goes into the rotation, I think.  Nice ambiance, good food, and best of all  - BYOB!!!!   P.S. (the one size fits all stemware was a little disappointing.  We brought a BIG Italian read; they had small generic wine glasses.  Thought that peculiar.)
