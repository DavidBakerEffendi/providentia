I'm not even sure where I should begin, this place is my heaven.  I have dreamed of such a place in existence.   We follow a Paleo diet and wow, I was in food heaven. Not inexpensive, but real, whole food is never inexpensive, it shouldn't be. Give this place a try for take out or eat in, expect it to be busy because the food is great.  I'm not a huge dessert fan so I can't rave about the desserts but everything I tried was fantastic including the buns.
