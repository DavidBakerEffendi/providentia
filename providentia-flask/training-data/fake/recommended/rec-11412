I love this place! I doubt you can get a meal as comforting and delicious as a bowl of their noodle soup anywhere for $5. And not only is the food superb and the prices rock-bottom, but the service is crazy-fast! It's like they know what you are going to order before you sit down. My first visit to Nanzhou was on a first date; the relationship didn't work out, but my love for hand-drawn noodles lives on.
