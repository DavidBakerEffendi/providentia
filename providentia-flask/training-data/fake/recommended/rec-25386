Been here twice so far... First time for lunch buffet and it was great. My favorite so far.. Everything was fresh and delicious... My second time I went for dinner and I had my favorite lamb tikka masala.. Delicious.. The drinks were great as well.. This place opened at 6pm and it was packed already.. Everything is super fresh and very tasty.. Best indian food for me so far!!
