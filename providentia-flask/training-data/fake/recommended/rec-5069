I have been here for brunch only and every time it was delightful. They do the basics very well. Very soft and creamy grits, potatoes that balance fluffy and crispy, too. Biscuits are a little dry and crumbly but worth eating nonetheless. Omlette specials are always fantastic (last week it was squash, roasted carrots and pickled mustard seeds). Delicious bacon! The environment is nice, not too loud and never feels rushed. It's homey without the kitsch. The service is very good; friendly but professional and often anticipates what we want before we even ask. The only down side is that dishes are vegetarian or pork laden. Not too much chicken. Excellent all around.
