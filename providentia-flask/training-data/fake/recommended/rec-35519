I heard great things and checked it out, but don't plan to go back. The atmosphere was nice, though the lighting a little odd - dim, but not in a romantic or suave way. We were there later in the evening when it was absolutely empty, which could have changed the mood a bit. The food was not memorable - extremely salty. I do recall that the seared tuna was completely bland to the point that none of the three people at the table ate more than one bite. The fish and chips were quite average; the winter salad rather plain; the veggie burger definitely nothing special. Added to the above, the service was really not good and on an empty night, inexplicable. We had to get up and find the server whenever we needed anything - rather odd. With all the tons of great food around, definitely skip it.
