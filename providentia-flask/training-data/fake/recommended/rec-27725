This may look like every other strip-mall Chinese take-out place in New Jersey, but it's anything but ordinary. The food is excellent and the service was wonderful. Tony, who has owned the place since late 2010, took time between running deliveries to sit and talk to us. He made a couple of recommendations and told us about the restaurant. He's primarily set up for take-out, but I HIGHLY recommend that you have a seat and eat your meal fresh from the wok. My wife and I had a certificate from a popular restaurant discount website, so we ordered a feast to sample the menu. Tony makes all the sauces himself, as well as a pretty mean freshly brewed sweet iced tea. I think we tried most of the sauces and there wasn't one of them we didn't love! General Tso's chicken was mildly spicy and tangy with enormous pieces (3 or 4 boneless breasts cut into halves) of perfectly fried white meat. The roast pork was succulent and perfectly seasoned. The Lo Mein was really good - not just a pile of greasy spaghetti like you usually get at other places. The Curry Beef was stir fried with plenty of onion and a tasty yellow curry sauce and the Treasure of the Sea came loaded with perfectly cooked, tender scallops and shrimp in a savory light garlic sauce. It's a short drive from the Woodbridge Center Mall or the Metropark. It's a 10 mile drive for us, but we're definitely going to be regular customers!
