Went this past weekend with my wife and sat outside. Â It was a great night to sit outdoors and their outdoors is beautiful and relaxing. We had mostly appetizers and they were remarkable. The mushroom carpaccio was probably my favorite. Then we split a dish called Love Letters, they must call it that because now I want to right the owners a Love Letter for having such a great and unique place. Service was spot on as well. We will definitely be back soon.
