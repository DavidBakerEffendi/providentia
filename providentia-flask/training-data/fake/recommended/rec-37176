Cha-An gets 5 stars for their great selections of teas, seriously delicious and original desserts, and impeccable service. I've been here a few times and honestly have nothing negative to rant about. I've never tried their actual entrees, but I've seen some dishes and they look great. I'll have to go back and order some. Also, it's an amazing date spot. The ambiance can be very romantic as you share a post meal conversation over tea and dessert. It never gets too noisy. This is quickly becoming a regular spot for me, especially now that F/W are rolling by.
