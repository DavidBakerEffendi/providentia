When it comes to brunch, I'm pretty much a monogamist. Once you find your neighborhood gem, why look further? It didn't take me long to find Tom's once I moved to Crown Heights, and when I did, it was Love at First Brunch. Here's why: -I actually want there to be a line outside when I get there. Why? Because Gus, the jolly and ever-smiling owner, brings you little treats to snack on while you wait. Coffee, yes, but also beef sausage with a hint of lemon juice, mini pancakes, turkey ham and more! -Pancakes! I'm generally a savory brunch kind of girl, but Tom's has turned me. Their pancakes are ridiculous good. And they do a great 2x2x2 combo that includes pancakes, scrambled eggs and your choice of breakfast meat. You can even order one pancake on the side if you're in more of an omelette mood (that's an insider tip, guys. Not on the menu.) -Hospitality. Did I mention Gus? The guy who hands you snacks in line? He's great, but so is the entire staff. They'll randomly bring you free things at your table every now and then, never leave you hanging, and always make sure your order comes out exactly right. -The decor is ridiculous, but it's so authentic and over-the-top that you can't help to feel transported to another era. Â  This is a place with soul. And really fantastic pancakes. Tom's, I'll love you forever.
