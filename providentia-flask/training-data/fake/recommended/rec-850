This is my first time to Philly and I've only been here for 45mins.  I already found Pat's King of Steaks down in the middle of all the neighborhood action.  Very authentic Philly vibe and ambience when you eat here.  There's even a plaque on the ground where Rocky once stood during the movie shoot.  The food was average but super quick.  You won't wait long here but make sure you bring cash.  I got the extra cheese steak.  It's basically cheese whiz, meat and bread served hot!  It was worth it.
