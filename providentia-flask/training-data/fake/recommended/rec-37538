Fine restaurant, love the 水煮肉片 (literally water-cooked meat). Only suggestion to any potential customers is to ask them not to add MSG; the first time I came here I made that mistake and didn't feel too well (pretty sure it wasn't the food, I just have a general reaction to MSG). But the next time I came by, I remembered to ask and haven't had any problem since. CASH ONLY!
