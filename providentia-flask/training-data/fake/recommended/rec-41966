Does italian food get any better?  This place is spectacular.  The waitstaff is attentive and knowledgeable.  The food is incredible.  The lasagna with an easy egg on top is amazing.  Been here twice and loved it.  Will keep going back again and again. Note: if you don't like noise, this isn't your place.  It's intimate and loud, but for my wife and I we don't care.  You also HAVE to have a reservation.  They are packed even mid week.  Call before 5 PM.
