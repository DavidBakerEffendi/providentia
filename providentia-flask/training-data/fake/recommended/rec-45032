If you walk by this place and there's no wait, jump at the chance to have perfectly executed simple food. Â We went on Halloween and the entire staff dressed up as characters from a film noir movie. If you like balls of meat, get their sliders. Rather than the typical beef Pattie, the little owl uses homemade meatballs straight out of the recipe book of a grandmother. Not your grandmother, but a grandmother who owns a 4 star michellan Italian restaurant. Simple pancakes were perfect and light with real syrup. Homefries with Brussel sprouts were unreal.
