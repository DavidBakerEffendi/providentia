Easily a 4 star place, on food quality alone. I've been all over the city scoping out good burger joints and this place is legit. The burgers and fries have been money every time I've hit the place up. The place is crowded with good reason...everybody is trying to bomb on the burgers. The crowd in the bar is older, the place serves beer and a lot of people probably just go to drink and chill with their friends, I probably wouldn't but whatever because the food, the main reason for attendance, is a blowout victory. Your doing yourself a disservice by not getting a burger from this place.
