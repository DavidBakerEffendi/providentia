"Tom's Â Restaurant" IS the Best Diner In Brooklyn! If you are near Prospect Heights make the trip; It is well worth it. Breakfast is their specialty with great flavored pancakes and waffles along with your basic eggs and bacon. No hash browns though. Home fries toast and grits are their sides. Ask for cheese on their grits and get two slices of American just like mom used to do! Read all the pictures and framed newspaper clippings on the walls and get a history lesson of the neighborhood. Get there early on the weekends if you don't want to wait in line. But if you are waiting in line they usually bring appeteasers out for the starving masses waiting. But don't fret, the line moves fast. Enjoy your meal!!!
