this pizza deserves 4 stars. i know people love to critique it so it would "live up to its name" but honestly this pizza is just really tasty , no i wouldnt make a special trip for it but if im in chinatown and i feel like having good pizza i would not miss this place. the wait can be long sometimes but worth it. the pizza is simply delicious new york style pizza with fresh mozzarella, perfectly balanced tomato sauce .... and great crust that just enough crunch on the outside and chewy on the inside.... also i love how when you fold your slice you get the olive oil or olive oil blend who cares its good when it drips down your fingers on to your plate. mmmmm thank heaven for lombardis !
