Stopped in here for a quick brew b4 going to see a movie at the Ritz East. Had a cask conditioned Yards. Yummy. Menu looked very appealing, and it's hard to believe what it looks like if you had ever been in that craphole to see a show - not that there's anything wrong with a grimy rock club sometimes. Anyhow, hope to eat here soon... Also, big props to Jeremy the bartender. He always does a nice job, even if it's a beer & a Scarlet O'Hara.
