Roast beef special and onion rings.  I've probably been to Nick's 100 times in my life and I've only ordered one thing every time- roast beef special and onion rings.   This place is as good as it gets in South Philly.  As legend goes they used to refuse to cut a guy's sandwich.  As long as I've been going however I get my roast beef special cut which is awesome because that makes it easier for me to put the complimentary horseradish and banana peppers on it.   Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives needs to stop by; this place is as authentic as it gets.
