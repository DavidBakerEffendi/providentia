Good prices. Good spicy meatballs with spicy sauce. Kind of bland special meatball...but the yummy sides made up for it. Fantastic ice cream sandwiches! Berry delicious berry w/brownie cookie! We were quoted 2 hours but hung out at the bar and seated ourselves 1/2 hr later. All in all a solid go to lower east side spot!
