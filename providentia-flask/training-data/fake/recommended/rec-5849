I love Jose's!  Reasonabally priced - nice diverse beer selection - kickass chicken burrito - yes please!  I like the upstairs better than the downstairs - it's more open and a little more resturanty feeling.  Also has flat screens if you want to catch a game and little tea-lighted tables if you just want to chat :) (Takes res. for 7+)
