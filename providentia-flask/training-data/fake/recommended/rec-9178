There's something to be said about a place that does one thing (or two) and does it really well. Banh Mi Saigon is such a place. Nestled in a back of a jewelry store in Chinatown, they crank out nothing but eponymous Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwiches, and boy are they good. And really, for $3.75 for a freaking huge sandwich (I often have leftovers!) the price is unbeatable. Unquestionably on of the best value-for-money places in Manhattan.
