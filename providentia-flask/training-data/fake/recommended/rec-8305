WOW WOW WOW!! Honestly ANYONE that writes a bad review on here, is from Mars. But then again, even the aliens are satisfied. The food here is phenomenal. I've had a couple of the simple wallace drinks (is that what is called? sorry they were so good, they temporarily effected my memory) The customer service was on point - and if you havent seen my profile yet, you would know i am very strict about customer service. The staff here definitely executed it well. My servers were both Taylor and Sherry (althought, taylor seemed to be the main one. Sherry was just very nice and also checked on our table as well). She was entertaining and very persuasive. Persuasive in that Â I DO NOT EAT HOT SAUCE....low and behold, i almost had a whole jar to myself (followed by pitcher amounts of water, of course lol). what did you guys put in there? lol. The manager was checking around the tables and took her time to talk to everyone - which i thought was very sweet and made everyone feel very welcomed. My bartender was a handsome man, named Ed. He was very talented and just, oh-so-charming. They definitely put Hill Fried Country chicken to shame and in the dirt and i will DEFINITELY be returning. thank you for the great experience. I think my momma now will be upset because i probably wont touch her chicken for a while (shhh, dont tell her that).
