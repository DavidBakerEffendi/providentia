Delicious beers, great service, small table selection for large groups, ok food. They serve an even selection of both vegetarian/non-veggie meals however, my friend had gotten food poisoning from a veggie meal from here last week. There are a variety of tasty apps that make it hard to chose from including fried pickles (that seems to be equivalent to an entire jar of pickles) are a necessity. Although they're Brisket empanadas taste like heaven, if I'm in the mood for a burger, I would look for other places.
