Good beer selection and I like the vibe. Went for a quick beer and some grub before a concert. Calamari was pretty good--just enough battering and cooked perfectly. I had a beef slider and a chicken slider. Both were good: beef with some onions (although I took off the greens) and the chicken sliders had some spice to them. The only thing is they seemed smaller than in the past.
