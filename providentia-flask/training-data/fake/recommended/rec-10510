Classic Burger, Bacon, Cheese, Fries and a Brew.  They have the ambience of a closet, but the burger is a sullen gift amidst the high strung crowds that flock to wait on a line for a good portion of an evening to see the main show: a Bistro Burger.  When I first came here, the long haired hippies and locals ruled supreme.  Now, we get loafers, North Face Jackets and fake highlights to stare at while we wait for that perfect table and perfect burger.  Sometimes I'm not in the mood, but more often than not, the Burger condemns those thoughts hastily.
