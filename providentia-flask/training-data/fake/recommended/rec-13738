When I lived in soho, this was my favorite place to grab a chicken sandwich. Really, the only place. It was amazing. I have gotten it take out, and also sat and had a meal there. The staff, when I frequented, no lie, was so hot and sexy I would get a little distracted. Was it the Aussie accent? Was it those jeans? I'm not sure. All things considered, that sweet chili, that cheese, that sandwich press? I still have dreams about the deliciousness that is that sandwhich. And those servers. And that salad. And those cute little beverages. Oh-Ruby's-how i wish you were in Brooklyn too! My mouth is watering just at the possibility of your amazingness in my stomach - and I'm not even hungry!
