Hands down, the best restaurant I've tried in years! I've tried 3 varieties of the empanadas, the best is the black bean, cheese, and pork trio.  Yes, I think the empanadas are a little pricey (at Casona, a Cuban place in Collingswood, you get 3 similar sized empanadas for the same price as one at Sazon).  Anyway, the fried yucca, plantains, and tostones are equally as delicious.   I've had the arepas a few times, the best being the pork pernil, absolutely delicious flavor.  I just tried the beef one and it was also seasoned well. My all time favorite dish and the reason for the 5 stars is the Patacon.  You have to try this for yourself!  It's two tostones with the pork pernil, avocado, cheese, some amazing sauce, and I can't remember what else at this point.  This will be a dish I get every time I go! I lied, the other reason for the 5 stars is the delicious hot chocolates.  They seem to be seasonal and I've had the Classico, one with pineapple, and one with a darker chocolate mix.  Exquisite!  The flan is also very good. I have to give a mention to the owners and servers...  Everyone is super friendly, helps you decide what to order, and great to talk to.   LOVE THIS PLACE!
