Wonderful!  From the setting, to the service, to the food, everything was great.  We ordered the flat bread with prosciutto for an appetizer, and $12 seemed a bit expensive, but when it came the plate was loaded with bread and meat.  The foccacia at the table was soft and not too salty, and the olive oil was also delicious.   For our main meal, we ordered the pappardelle with sausage and the stuffed chicken breast.  I really enjoyed the pasta, which was cooked perfectly and had a flavorful sauce, but the stuffed chicken breast was just OK.   We ordered a carafe of the house red wine and got 2 small glasses each out of it.  For $14, you could do a lot worse. I'll be back!
