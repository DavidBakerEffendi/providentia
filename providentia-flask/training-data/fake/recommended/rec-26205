I have been here many times but my experience yesterday (which was Saturday afternoon of Thanksgiving weekend around 1:30pm) reminded me why I like this place. We came in as a group of 9, they don't take reservations so I was a little worried. They did not bat an eye, and within 20 minutes we were seated at two tables next to each other. The food were delicious and our waitress made sure that my friend with Celiac's disease was not given any food with glutten in it. Of course the food was delicious, I had bimbimbap, while my friend with celiac's disease had the same, another friend had chicken teriyaki and I sadly did not see what my other friends got to eat. Everyone was happy with their meal though, and we all got to enjoy some Makgeolli and Sake. Would recommend!
