Hands down the ultimate chill spot! For starters it's has two floors, starting from the bottom full bar and seats in the back to eat or drink. The top floor, oh man. It has graffiti all over the walls, pool tables, bar stools, couches, a lounge in the back did I mention Graffiti all over the walls! Oh wait and the Location being Right on South st. Make it 10times better. If you just wanna drink, play some pool and kick it hipster style this is the place to be.
