Amazing food experience. Came here for Father's day with my parents, inlays and my wife and daughter. Food: Food was as fresh as can be. Had the platter for two which actually fed 4 of us to near capacity. Included snow crab, dungeness crab, king crab and a full lobster. So fresh, and flavorful, we were completely blown away. Â My mother-in law also got the fried cod (best I ever had) and my dad got the soft shell crabs which he raved all day about. Service: We were served promptly and courteously by the staff who was very attentive to our drinks and food. Very fun people! Ambiance: I felt like I was in some beach hut somewhere tropical with the reggae music playing, the cool breeze and the view of the ships in the water. Was a great experience all together!
