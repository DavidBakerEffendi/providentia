I was so excited when a new bar opened up right down the street from me, but that excitement fizzled the first night I spent there.  Don't get me wrong -- the drinks are a good price, food is okay, but the crowd and the music make it a no-go for me.  I've been numerous times b/c it's so close, and in the spring when the outdoor seating is open there have been patrons so drunk that they've come up to my table and hit on my in front of my husband.  The jukebox is WAY too loud most of the time, playing crappy music, and the crowd can be very sports-bar douchey.  It's a real shame, because on the nights where the jukebox isn't blaring bad music and the crowd is more chill I can see it's potential for being a great bar.  I prefer Prohibition for my local pub -- bartenders are awesome, fabulous beer and bar menu and a chill location.  They also have a jukebox and TVs but have figured out how to let them be in the background without overriding the ambiance.
