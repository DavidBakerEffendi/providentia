The wait staff was very friendly and seated us immediately for lunch even though we did not have a reservation. My husband and I were delighted with the quaint atmosphere. I I ordered the vanilla French toast with strawberries and it was excellent! My husband had the bacon cheeseburger, and thought that it was very good! This place was charming with great food reasonably priced. Highly recommend it!
