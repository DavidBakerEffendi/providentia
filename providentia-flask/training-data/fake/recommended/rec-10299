Food was delicious, but the service is AMAZING! Went there for a friend's birthday dinner and our table of 4 was treated like rock stars! Really wonderful experience. We had the cheesy garlic bread and sweet potato ravioli as our appetizers. These and our first round of drinks were comp'd by the resto since we had to wait a few extra minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. We all loved our entrees. We had the pork loin, short rib, tilapia (this was a special) and salmon. Decent size portions and good quality overall. We each had a different dessert, which were excellent as well. On the way out, we were given biscottis and a couple of loaves of the cheesy garlic bread to take home. So fabulous! We each remarked how we were definitely going back! The freebies were a pleasant surprise, but even without them, the whole meal and evening was a hit.
