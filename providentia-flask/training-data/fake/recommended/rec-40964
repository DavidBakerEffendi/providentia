Gourmet Heaven is a go-to place for good quality wraps, sandwiches, paninis, etc.  They have a nice selection of gourmet groceries such as tapenades, salsas, olive oils, etc.  Also, decent grab-and-go sushi.  This is one of the only quality grocery/convenience/deli stores open 24/7.  Reminiscent of WaWa in the Philly/NJ area, except much more expensive.  That is another thing.  The prices of some items are MUCH higher than you would pay in a chain supermarket.  Just be careful.
