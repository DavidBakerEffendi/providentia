A Superb Dining Experience! From the Maple Bacon Roasted Almonds through the Pecan Pie Sundae, everything was perfect! It was father's day and I went with my wife and Kids. "Thing One" smartly observed that since the last time she ate at Chez Panisse she had not enjoyed a complex meal where the original and unique flavors all worked as an ensemble, but stayed totally distinct. She had the mussels in green chili sauce and a salad. (I am so proud of her ability to articulate what makes a good meal special: a great Father's Day gift!) The warm lamb salad with soft boiled eggs, roasted cauliflower and olive-bread croutons was, simply sublime(See picture). The Eggs were so rich and fresh it makes me lament how base supermarket eggs are, even when cage free and all of the other marketing pablum I pay extra for is figured in. The fried chicken and cheddar waffles my partner and son enjoyed were sparkling: the sweet-savory syrup served with it brought everything to life. I was most impressed by the subtlety sweet-savory cheddar waffles, which were light, crispy and not overpowering: slightly sweet and mildly cheddary. We all loved everything (even Thing Three's kiddy meal of pasta with red-sauce was perfect). The deserts were amazing: strawberry icecream that tasted like farmer's market strawberries was amazing. Thing Three's cone clown sundae was good, as was the chocolate chip bread pudding. But special notice for the pecan pie sundae is demanded. It made my very good father's day perfect.
