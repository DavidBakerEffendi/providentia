This place wa great...sat outside on a warm Philadelphia night. Service was slow, but as I was celbrating being engaged, I had no qualms waiting an extra few minutes! Â Server was nice and appologetic as well. Got the gnocchi (melts in your mouth) and crab ravs (not as good, but not bad. Slightly fishy taste). All in all a great place to enjoy a fun night!
