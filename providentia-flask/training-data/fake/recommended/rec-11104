My personal favorite venue in Philadelphia. I have yet to see a show here that didn't sound terrific, and the food downstairs is pretty good too. The best surprise with Johnny Brenda's is that it often plays host to artists who could easily fill a larger venue. But instead, we get to see them in a comfortable, "miniature theater" (I say that because of the wrap-around balcony). I wish more bands I like would play Johnny Brenda's when they come to town.
