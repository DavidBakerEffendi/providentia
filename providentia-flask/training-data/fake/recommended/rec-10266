Fantastic experience! This was the only restaurant in the area that had reservations available for last night, New Years Eve... Ann (hostess) Â was extremely helpful in booking our reservation for the bar area. However, upon arrival (we arrived early), she was able to accommodate us in the dining room. Meals were spectacular. We started with the cheesy garlic bread (a must have) - I had linguine with clams and I am CERTAIN the pasta is homemade. Absolutely delicious. Martinis are not on the menu, however, when I asked for one the bartender was happy to make one - and made one of the best pomegranate Martinis I have ever had!!! Dessert - yum!!! Fried dough with a Nutella cream and a scoop of ice cream (not on the menu but the waitress was awesome). I would definitely go here again. Highly recommend. The ambiance was comfortable and relaxed. Looking forward to our next visit.
