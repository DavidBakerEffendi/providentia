It's very possible that you've heard the name Corner Bistro even if you're not from New York. If not, it's a place worth noting for... The burgers - outstanding. Juicy and cooked to perfection, they are exactly what you'd expect from a place often touted as the best burger in NYC. I recommend going for the Bistro Burger. The bacon is a nice touch. The beer - cheap! Five of the 9 beers on tap are $2.50/glass. That said, they are not huge glasses, but still a deal. The ambiance - old school. CB is unchanged and authentic. Carve your name into one of the wooden tables, return in 10 years, and unless the place burns down, I'm sure you're name will still be there (and they'll remember you as the jackass who wrote your name on a table). Of course, nobody is perfect. Possibly the only thing I don't love about CB is the fries. They tend to be a bit soggy and nothing to write home about. That said, I get them every time. I guess the burger makes them better.
