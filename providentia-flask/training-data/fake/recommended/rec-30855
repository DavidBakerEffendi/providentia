Listen, and I'm only going to post this once.   Get your butt down to Cheryl's for the single most delicious pancakes you'll  ever have in your life.  Fluffy, flavorful, and delicious. Honestly, I asked the bartender why they were so good and she said it was Cheryl's special recipe. Amazing. I also had awesome potatoes, crispy bacon, and yummy eggs. So real quick...this is a super duper tiny resto not far from the park. Blink and you'll miss it. The ambience is super cute..wood accents, little paintings here and there, and some black and white photos. The music is classic duwop/R&B and the atmosphere pleasant and special. As in...EVERYONE knows they are at the right place and in for a treat. It's almost part of the decor! Palpable. Although I've only been for brunch, I can honestly say I will be returning for dinner. If you like yourself and want to eat well, I'd say visit this place!
