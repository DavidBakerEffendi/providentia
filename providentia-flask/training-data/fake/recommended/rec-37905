The scallop and mozzarella di bufala wrapped with speck appetizers were the standouts of the night. Really really amazing. Our server Alexandra was a delight - very helpful in choosing dishes and wine pairing for our meal and great side conversations as well! The Mr. ordered the special Lamb Shank and asked for a side of pasta. He got the house-made fetuccine with spicy marinara - really delicious. My wild boar tagliatelle was good, but not great in terms of needing to come for that very dish. Nice space near the theater district and Carnegie Hall - definitely stop in!
