it's truly the little things that stop this place from being great. the ambiance is awesome, the mood is relaxed, the menu is diverse, and the food is delicious. what doesn't work for me, however, unfortunately held precedence. the music was too loud, which caused the larger tables to scream unnecessarily at each other. the menu is colorful enough to give you a seizure. and most importantly (and unacceptable but comprehensible when you take a relative look at the menu) I paid $7 for a cookie. a cookie...that cost me...seven whole dollar bills. it was an okay cookie, pretty good at best. it didn't have a price on it and I was excited to see how big the cajones of the dirty dog were going to be as soon as my receipt came -- and let me tell you something, I was not let down. look, I get it: bougie west village cafe bar shoppe terrarium blah blah is going to come with a cost. but a $7 cookie? I just can't get over it, which kills a small part of my soul because it could've been such a prime spot. I'll buy myself a gallon of ice cream and a pack of funfetti-filled-oreos next time and save myself the trip.
