I used to be a regular when I was a Bklyn resident but I wouldn't mind the trek to Park Slope for brunch. This is one of my go to restaurants, that serves up delicious Peruvian cuisine. If you enjoy a lot of spices, rich flavors, and delicious tapas Surfish is a great choice. As far as entrees I highly recommend the tacu tacu, tilapia, adobado, or paella. The entree portions are large and enough to share between two people. Overall it's a solid restaurant to take a date, entertain friends, or catch up with la familia. However it is on the cozy side so plan ahead if you're with a large group. Note that they also have outdoor seating during the warmer months, perfect during summer days or nights when you just want to sip on some red wine.
