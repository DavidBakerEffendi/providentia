I had to wait an hour to write this review because I was in such disbelief in what occurred! This is the BEST food I've tasted in my life thus far! There is no doubt in my mind how the chef won chopped. The customer service was also good. - Mussels (Tapas): THE BEST MUSSELS I've ever tasted! I had to start eating it slowly to savor every taste that was bursting in my mouth! They were tender and moist and absolutely delicious! -Pico de Gallo: Came with the plantain chips, and were in the mussel broth. So refreshing! One of the best I've tasted. - Pollada: The chicken was bursting with flavor and was very juicy. There was also a nice crisp seer on the outside. The chimicurri sauce was so delish and had a good consistency. - Entrana: I wanted to cry at how good the taco-tacu was! The plantains were ripe, but a little fried to much. The skirt stake was disappointing. The cooked it medium like I asked, however, it wasn't as tender as I expected. I'm not too sure what it was about the steak but i didn't like it too much. - Risotto de Camarones: The risotto was cooked perfectly! The dish had tons of shrimp which I love, and they all tasted good. - Sangria: Very well balanced. Not too much fruit. Not watery. Was nice and strong. Excellent! - Apple Crisp: My meal was so wonderful I was expecting something to go wrong with the desert, but NOPE! IT WAS TO DIE FOR!!!!! The apples were fresh, the crumble was nicely baked, and whatever ice cream they used was so soft and fluffy. I mean, this meal ..... so speechless! The only con - this restaurant is TOO DAMN SMALL!! However, I know that location is short-lived because this place has a fantastic future.
