This review should really be a 2 1/2, but I decided to be generous. i was suspicious of Parc even before going. I'm not into campy restaurants (unless they are self aware and over the top, obviously) and the faux French wall art, being the French snob that I am, made me feel like I was at a French Applebees. HOWEVER. The food and service was pretty alright. Ordered drinks at the bar before I joined the rest of my part for dinner. I ordered a Citron Glace, which was good, albeit not made with perfect form. The food was good, but not exceptional. While it is very French to have everything soaked in butter, I felt this place went a little overboard with that sentiment. The wine selection was great, though, and the charcuterie plate was AMAZING. The country pate and chicken liver mousse, both pieces of the plate, were the most interesting things on the menu, and the cured meats were delicious. ALSO: as I am one to often judge a restaurant on its bread: theirs really wasn't bad. Not the mouth-destroying baguettes of Paris that I crave and slightly moist, but very good to have been made in the US. The service was also quite pleasant and our Â waiter was friendly and informative. Really, this is the kind of place you take someone to if they think they want adventure, but really just want French Applebees camp.
