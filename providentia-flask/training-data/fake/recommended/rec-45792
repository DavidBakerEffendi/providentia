From the microwaveable safe rice container, the scorching hot soup and the most tender white meat chicken around, this place is hands down the best Chinese food I've ever eaten. Only place I'm more inclined to order a meat entree than seafood(probably anywhere) and by no fault of the seafood. Pork, chicken and beef, they're all fantastic. The dumplings are the best I've had(and I ordered them steamed, not fried). Have yet to eat in, only take out and delivery, but I'm eager to try.
