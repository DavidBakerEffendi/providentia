This place is good, but good enough to travel from the Upper East side and freeze our butts off waiting outside? No, it is not. It's pancakes . And bacon. And frankly, I've had far better bacon at home. Aside from the food, the whole wait and text and be back in 5 minutes when we tell you gave me anxiety. No breakfast is worth that kind of nonsense. Should have just dropped a hundred bucks on breakfast at the 5 star hotel we were staying at. Maybe give this place a go on a nice summer day when hanging around for an hour is no big deal. Otherwise, this place gets an eternal pass by me.
