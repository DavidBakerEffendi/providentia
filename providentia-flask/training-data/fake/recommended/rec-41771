This place. Man. I ate here on my first trip to Philly and my mind was blown. I had the large pork with sharp provolone, peppers on the side, which I repeated upon my second visit. I also tried the cheesesteak, which is fucking GREAT. This sandwich is so simple, so perfect, that my girlfriend and I walked from downtown and back just so I could grab one. It's not something you can find around NYC. Make the trip.
