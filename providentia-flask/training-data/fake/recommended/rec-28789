While walking to this place, we saw a lot of imitation lan zhou noodles along the way. Thankfully we knew which restaurant was the real one or we'd have gone to a knock off. We both chose shaved noodles and they came out piping hot. Simple yet filling and tasty. What more can you ask for? Also, don't make the mistake like the table next to us and not order the soup noodles. It was a hot day when we went but it's the only way to go.
