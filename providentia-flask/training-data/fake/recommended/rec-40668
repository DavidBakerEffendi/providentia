My friends' office is in this building, so I'm here a few times a month.  During the incredulously long wait for the elevator, I pop into HIT Deli.  It's my favorite part of visiting! They have great priced snacks, pretty good selection (any chance of getting Boylan's/MASH drinks?), and are all super friendly. When I'm here around meal times, I've had the chicken ramen (which is huge & amazing), and also the bacon egg & cheese.  I know random, but that's what a great deli does.  I wish they ran the deli in my building!
