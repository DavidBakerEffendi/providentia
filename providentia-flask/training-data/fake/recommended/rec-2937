Although totally empty when we went for an early dinner on Monday night, the food was all very good. Service was very friendly and attentive also. I had sushi for lunch that day so I opted for a ceviche appetizer, which was yum, fried shrimp dumplings which were so good I wished there were twice as many, and the mussels special which were good, but not great. There were two mussels I couldn't pry open so I let them be. The broth was pretty good but I wouldve turned the heat up a notch. Love the exposed brick and decor, but thought it bizarre that two large t.v.s are in the dining area within 4 feet of each other. I wouldn't want them in there if it were up to me. It distracts people when they should be paying attention to each other!
