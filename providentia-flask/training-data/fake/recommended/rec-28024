The brunch service was a little rough. Two people in our party got the Grits Eggs and Toast and asked for the side of bacon which you can add for $2. Instead we got a bacon sandwich with each order and were scolded for not being explicit enough that it was the side of bacon and not a bacon sandwich. They then brought out the bacon but charged us the normal price and not the price that's under the Grits because we messed up our order. It was an awkward experience but I think they're just kinda busy on the weekends. Food is all right.
