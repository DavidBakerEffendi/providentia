Unfortunately this is one of those situations where the place is so busy, the service level slips a bit. My biggest pet peeve of dining out is being rushed. And they will rush you here, big time. The food comes out way too fast, the busers will ask you at least 10 times if you are done and don't worry about asking for the check. Do not rush me, yo! It's rude. Also, the last time I was there, our waiter seemed overly concerned about our BYOB situation. Apparently, you are not allowed to bring anything that vaguely resembles sangria cause they will be all over this. (They want you to pay to buy their mix-in) And I guess a bottle of home made wine and a bottle of Fireball (yeah, Fireball. It was a birthday gift) look like sangria. We were questioned about this twice and actually asked to put the Fireball away though we never planned to open it. Look, your establishment is BYOB, so I can bring whatever the hell I want to bring to drink. This is half the reason your place is so popular, so don't harass your patrons with stupid questions about whether we are trying to make some sort of underground sangria or not. Dumb. So yeah, food pretty great, ambiance super fun but the service is pretty bummy.
