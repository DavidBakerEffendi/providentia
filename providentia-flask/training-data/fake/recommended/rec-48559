Um dollar tacos on Tuesdays and $2 cans of beer? Need I say more? Seriously though this place is amazing. Â From the old school pink couch that probably has a few stories to tell about it's past all the way to the adventure time figure hanging up above it. I love the feel of the place. (Side note there is a huge airplane up above that I want to fly right down south st haha). The food was good for the price. If you go on a Tuesday they got dollar tacos. Can't beat that. If you want a higher quality taco then go somewhere else and waste 2-3 dollars on one. I for one will not. The Mexican beer that is oh so cheap is good enough to wash down those taco too. I do think they need more servers because I did wait quite a while for the lovely young women to come take my order but I don't complain, there was a big crowd to feed that night. I'll definitely be frequenting this place. Seems to be the place to be. Especially the night I went.
