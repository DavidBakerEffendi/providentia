Everyone always says, "When you go to Philadelphia, you HAVE TO GO to Geno's and Pat's"   Well during  my trip to Philadelphia, I WENT TO Tony Luke's, Pat's, and Geno's so I can honnestly say I have had the "big 3" in Philadelphia! Pat's it DEFINATELY better then Geno's, but nothing fancy.  This place had friendly service, fresh meat, great cheese, and overall was a great expierance. HOWEVER, if you are in philadelphia DEFINATELY GO TO TONY LUKE'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - AMAZING!!!!!
