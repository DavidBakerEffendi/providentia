One of my favorite bars in the city--dimly lit with a cozy atmosphere--Irish bartenders who knows how to serve a Guinness, and drink prices aren't over the top. Their beer selection in general is very extensive, and you could spend hours with friends here just having craft after craft. Perfect place to hole up in during a cold wintry weekend night.
