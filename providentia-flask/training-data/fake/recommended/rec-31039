I took my dad and the rest of my family to In Riva as a gift for Father's Day. It was our first time dining at the restaurant, but after some excellent reviews on Yelp, we gave it a go. The restaurant itself looks amazing. It's pretty trendy and very clean, kind of setting it apart from the rest of the area. We ate out on the patio which was a good choice because we got to enjoy some great food with a great view of the river across the street. We ordered the wings and meatballs as our appetizers and shared a few pizzas for our meal. Everything came out relatively quick and tasted delicious. For my meal, I had the POLPETTE DIAVOLO pizza and I highly recommend it. Overall, In Riva provided a great experience for a very fair price. I'll definitely go back. Also, they have a little fenced in area with a sign "Pizza and Puppies"
