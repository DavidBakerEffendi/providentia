I really liked this place. We happened to pass by it after a tour of the penitentiary and decided to stop in for an early dinner. It is a small and quaint little place. The staff was very nice, attentive and knowledgeable. The prices are good as well. We got the pita and hummus, and i fell in love with it. The pita was so fresh. The artichokes constantinople was just delectable. The gyro were so delicious and juicy. Nothing was overdone or dry or undercooked for that matter. I definitely loved it!
