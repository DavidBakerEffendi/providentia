At first glance on a summer Saturday night, when we walked in and the front dining room was empty, we worried this place was going to be mistake. But once on the charming open-air back patio, which was filled, we had a great meal and a great experience. A reasonable extensive, reasonable (all Italian) wine list. Â All of the pasta entrees were raved on by our party: gnocchi, pomodoro, and 2 types of vegetarian raviolis. The service was low key, typical of Williamsburg's laid back vibe, but attentive as needed and informative. 5 diners, 3 bottles of wine, dessert wine 2 shared desserts, for $230. And we found a cab back to Manhattan.
