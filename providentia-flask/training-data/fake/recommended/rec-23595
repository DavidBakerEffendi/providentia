This was a fabulous dining experience recommended by some folks we met at a vineyard. The atmosphere is elegant but not inaccessible. The restaurant itself overlooks a waterfall which adds a nice soundtrack to lunch. Get the ravioli! They say that they have the restaurant so you can get the feel of their artistry in your hand. To that point, you eat and drink with the glassware and pottery which only makes you want to break the bank (or at least that was true for me.)
