6:30pm - Hop on the subway train. 6:50pm - Walk to 53rd & 6th. 7:00pm - Stand in line. 7:10pm - Take a whiff. Smell the goodness that is Halal Cart. 7:15pm - Turn around. Notice the all the hungry people in line. All 50 of them. 7:20pm - Try not to throw a hissy fit. Only 10 minutes left! 7:30pm - Listen to the sounds of Heaven's gates opening as they start serving dinner. I don't believe I've ever seen the line with less than 20 people at a time. It's mind-blowing how much lamb and chicken these guys cook up until the wee hours of every night. For $6, this is one of the most amazing meals in all of NYC. Whether it's dinner for 2 or the need to satisfy late night cravings, it'll leave you wanting more. (I think my guy secretly hated sharing with me, even though I was full after stealing only 4-5 bites. Should have known seconds were in order...) Toss on as much yogurt and red sauce as possible - this stuff rocks! Despite my low tolerance for anything spicy, it would be impossible to leave out the red sauce. It's an extremely simply crafted dish: dump on the sauces, mix thoroughly, rip off a slice of pita bread, & get ready to get messy! Have no shame eating utensil-free. Just bring wet naps. Of course, for sanitary purposes, forks are provided if you prefer to mosey on over to the benches in front of the Hilton to devour your meal. After trying both the chicken and the lamb, lamb is the way to go! Juicy, flavorful, and hits the spot every time. I'm so hooked. Sources have confirmed that the Halal cart one block away on 52nd & 6th is the exact same establishment as this one. Same owner, same food, same prices, WAY shorter line. Just look for the bright yellow bags and cooks in bright yellow shirts/hoodies.
