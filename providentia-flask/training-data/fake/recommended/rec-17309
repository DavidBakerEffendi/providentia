Delicious and cheap!  Possibly the best word combo ever, IMO.  We went to Nan Zhou on a Saturday around 7PM, and it was delightfully uncrowded.  I can see why: the food is ready minutes after you order (eat those apps fast!), so turnover is pretty quick (though they didn't mind that we lingered with our drinks for a bit).  I was the only one in my party who opted not to get a soup, and I heartily enjoyed my dish of veggie stir fried noodles.  (Bonus: no mushrooms to pick out.)  Chili oil on the table was a nice touch, as we could spice up our food to our liking. Reasons to go: BYO Super inexpensive (four meals plus one app was $34) Large portions Lightning fast
