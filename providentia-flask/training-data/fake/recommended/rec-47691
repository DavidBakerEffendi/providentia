The secret, put your name down. Immediately order pork buns at the bar while you wait. Get a sapporo. Finish that first sapporo. Check on your progress in line. Order your second sapporo. Check on the list Repeat until you get called up Delicious! (but yes, the lines can be crazy. If its over 90 minutes... then things get crazy. Like i love ramen, but that is too long. At that point, just go someplace else. This isnt your only source of sustenance, its just a good ramen place. This isnt the DMV, life should be fun. Go get pork katsu a couple blocks over and relax)
