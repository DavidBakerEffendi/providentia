Such innovative sandwiches! They got Pho #1, Pho #2, Bush, John "Carry", Obama, you name it! I was skeptical looking at the store front, but all the sandwiches pack hella punch of flavor and very fresh ingredients. I personally love the Pho #1, never knew bean sprouts could work so well in a sandwich before! Great bargain, minimal wait time. Wish they were close to work--would be a no-brainer lunch option! Also, not a badly stocked bodega either, they've even got Justin's nut butters
