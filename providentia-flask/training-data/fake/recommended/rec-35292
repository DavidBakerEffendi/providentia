Katsu-Hama is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I have been to. Considering the neighborhood it's in, I think the prices are very reasonable. Just from reading the name, one can already know that Katsu-Hana specializes in Katsu, which is just breaded vegetable, meat, etc. However, they also feature a lot of other selections such as curries, croquettes, beef tongue,etc. We ordered some of everything, and everything was 100% delicious! The curries were nice and thick, which is the consistency that I prefer. The Katsu and croquettes were very delicious and crispy, and the beef tongue was so juicy and succulent. I would give this place 5 stars, but the service department was kind of lacking. Our food came out quickly, but the waitress rarely came to check up on us or to refill our drinks.
