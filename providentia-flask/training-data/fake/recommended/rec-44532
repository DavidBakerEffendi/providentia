I came here last night - my first foray into Filipino food! I was quite impressed. We didn't get as much food as I would've liked (only 2 of us, boo) but we got the Crispy Pata and the Chicken Adobo, with garlic rice for the both of us. Let me just say that the Crispy Pata was heavenly. I immediately texted my friends pictures of it. It's just like the other reviews say: crispy and fatty and just amazing. The Chicken Adobo was alright - the sauce was good with the rice, but I thought the flavors were a little intense and I mostly stuck with the Crispy Pata. Definitely will be back to eat some of that porky, crunchy fatty goodness.
