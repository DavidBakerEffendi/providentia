Hoagie Haven has an outstanding reputation in the area. Finally decided to see what all the buzz is about. Holy. Overrated. Batman. Where do I even start? Place is kind of dingy.  But, hey, some of the best holes-in-the-wall are nothing to look at. In retrospect, that should have been the warning shot. So...the cold cuts.  Pre-sliced, sitting in a case. When did they cut them? An hour ago? This morning? Last night?  Or did they buy pre-sliced??  No question that cold cuts on a good sub should be sliced fresh to order. Then, with those pre-sliced cold cuts, at least put  a respectable amount on the bread.  No exaggeration, one layer of ham, one capicola, one cheese.  It's all bread and lettuce.  Same thing with the turkey sub. Even worse was the tuna.  My 3-year-old wouldn't eat it because of the overwhelming celery flavor.  I got past that, but not the sour taste underneath it.  Bread was stale on this one too.  My daughter got 3 scoops of ice cream for dessert as an apology. The Rutgers-style "fat" sandwiches, loaded with fries and mozzarella sticks, seemed to be popular with the rest of the customers, maybe that's what you are supposed to eat here.  I don't know, but I won't return...EVER... to find out. $15 life lesson.
