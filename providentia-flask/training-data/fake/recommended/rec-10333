I loved the Ramen - wasn't crazy about the panhandling. On my visit in 12/13 the entire staff looked on as a panhandler came into their restaurant and went from table to table to table.  They did NOTHING. If you are okay with someone standing over you asking for money while you eat Minca's delicious ramen, then go for it.  I want to go back for more but I will call ahead to make sure they have changed their pandhandling policy first. Also, cash only.
