We go to Il Cafone very often, and tonight we had a great meal.They have parking behind the restaurant and it's BYOB with a WinePro on the corner to help you choose a good wine. The homemade gnocchi is hands down the best I have ever had. The chef makes them fresh everyday. They are like little potatoe marshmellows and he prepares them with a vodka sauce mixed with crab meat, shrimps and scallops. I have also had the basil encrusted swordfish which is delicious as well. I had deep fried ice cream with coconut and caramel for dessert and Man Alive, that is delicious!! It is worth trying for yourself.
