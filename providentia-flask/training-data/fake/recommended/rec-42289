I had my birthday party here, and it couldn't have been a better experience.  I emailed a few weeks in advance to see if I could reserve a spot and got an answer back right away.  My friends and I had the front area all to ourselves.  Our server was super nice and the drinks were delicious and reasonably priced.  One of my friends made a homemade cake for me, and the kitchen was really nice about keeping it in the fridge while we were elsewhere at dinner.  They even cut and plated the cake for us.   I can't wait to come back for a quiet drink and to try some of the food.
