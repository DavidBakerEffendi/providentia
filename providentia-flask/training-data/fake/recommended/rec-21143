So good! I recommend you go with a lot of people who are open to sharing - that way, you can try a bunch of things at once. It won't be very cheap, but it will definitely be worth it. The host was kind of a jerk the last time we went, but we stayed anyway because the food is so good, if that's any sign of quality.
