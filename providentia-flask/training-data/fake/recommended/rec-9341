Coming back to my hometown, I had to check out Pio Pio.  This location was a first for me and the ambiance and decor was absolutely stunning! In comparison to all the other Pio pio's I've been to, this one definitely had a eloquent feel to it.  Although the music was rather loud, I was still able to hear  my family.   Food, come on its Pio Pio! Their food is absolutely amazing!!! Of coarse I had their roasted chicken with the fried plantains and finished it with the tres leches dessert that my waiter sold me on.  Although i After being sat at an upstairs balcony, my family and I were approached by Gabriel who was very informative on the menu and answered any questions we had.  For me, I like it when my server is attentive and he was!I definitely recommend anyone who goes to ask for him.i
