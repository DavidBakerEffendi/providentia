Before walking over the Brooklyn bridge on frigid day, me and a group of gfs decided to have a "pie" at Grimaldi's.  Place was jam packed with folks stuffing their pie holes.  We sat down and ordered a couple of pizzas and as soon as they hit the table we ladies threw down.  Till this day, I still salivate thinking about that pizza.
