I went to Tiam for a quick lunch last week and loved it! I had never been to Tiam before, so when I was ordering, I really liked that the cashier was very friendly and was able to suggest some great food! The food itself was great! I had a spicy falafel and really enjoyed the hummus and the overall flavor. My coworker order fries for a side and thought they were pretty good as well. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the food as an 8. The place is smaller than what I expected, but as long as you are not there during a rush, you should easily be able to find a place to sit.
