Every weekend I walk by and always see a bunch of people waiting outside around 11-2.  I decided to see what the fuss was about and came here for brunch with some friends.   The interior is nice - New England cottage feel.  Kindof warm and cozy like you might expect at if you were visiting your aunt's house.  Quarters are a bit cramped, but not too bad The prix frixe brunch menu is $13 which comes with the entree and either coffee/tea and juice or an apple cider mimosa.   I got the nutella french toast which was really good.  It's pretty sweet once you put the syrup on, so either use moderation or give it a taste before immediately drenching it in syrup.   One thing that I thought was odd was all the coffee cups were different.  It really looked like they were going into the cupboard and taking out a cup.  My friends cup had a calendar from 1990.   All in all, I think it was a nice place for brunch, but I don't think I'd wait 1-2 hours in the cold for it.  Maybe on a nice spring day I'd wait an hour...but not 2.
