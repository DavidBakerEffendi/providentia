The food was alright, not the best I've tasted for korean, but the concept is interesting. The food doesn't stay warm though since it is buffet style, and you never know how often they remake the food, so it could be from way earlier. It is really expensive since its $8 a pound for whatever you get, and all the food weighs a lot even with a small amount. I wouldn't come back here, but it was worth a try.
