Not what it use to be. Â Ive been going here for over 4 years and my recent visit was very disappointing. Service was terrible. We had to ask if there were any specials. It seem to be more about moving us in and out even though the place was empty. The food was just ok; not the same quality I remembered.. Sad, but I wont be returning.
