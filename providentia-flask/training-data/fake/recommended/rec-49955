Holy crapola granola sweet mother of Mary. Words cannot explain how incredible this place is. I literally asked the waiter if there were any jobs going so I could be paid in Tiramusa. We got the papadelle pasta and a simple basil and mozzarella pizza with spicy olive oil. Made with love by a singular Italian chef who not only makes ridiculously good food but also provides you with extremely informative advice on how to open the toilet door. This place is what dreams are made of. Like, not gonna lie ... I'd probably sell my soul for this s***.
