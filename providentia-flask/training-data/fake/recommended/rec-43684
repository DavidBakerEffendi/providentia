Best. Fries. Ever. The only downside to this fried potato mecca is that it is too small. The line regularly stretches out the door even in the middle of the night. Since I avoid standing on line, I often have to live without my precious fries. But that may a good thing. If I could get them whenever I wanted them, I might be 300 pounds by now. Go there and eat. Just don't hog up the line when I get there. Have fun. G
