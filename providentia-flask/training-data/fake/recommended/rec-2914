Really tasty flatbreads, $1.50 oysters, and fish tacos for happy hour (5-7 weekdays).  Though perhaps not as "happy" as other happy hours offering food ($8 for the flatbread probably could be the everyday price), and perhaps lacking a little character in the interior of the joint, you're getting food items made from quality local sources - and there's a helpful and knowledgable bar staff that make really good $6 cocktails and have a half-decent selection of $3 cans/bottles fo dat ass.  I shall be happy to continue to regulate Fare!
