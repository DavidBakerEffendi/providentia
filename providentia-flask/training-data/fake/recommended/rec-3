Hip City Veg is my FAVORITE place to eat in University City. (And that's saying a lot, because I can't imagine myself giving up my meat.) I usually order the Ziggy burger, which tastes almost exactly like In n Out, but the udon noodle salad is delicious as well. Actually, forget what I said earlier. EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS FREAKING YUMMY!!!!! You don't have to be a vegan to enjoy this restaurant.
