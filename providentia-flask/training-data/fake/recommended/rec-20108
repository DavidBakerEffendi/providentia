I can't give this spot enough kudos! I went here 2x last week and ate the same fried chicken entree. Simply fabulous and seasoned to perfection with collard greens (yes I said greens!) and mashed potatoes w yummy gravy. I don't eat fried chicken anywhere, so this was a treat. I'm going to have to take a break and order something else on the menu..
