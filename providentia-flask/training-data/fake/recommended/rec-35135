After an unexpected night out I needed a good hearty brunch. I knew there wasn't anything right in my neighborhood so I took a peek on yelp and saw Home Sweet Harlem wasn't too far. I'm so glad we ended up here because it was FABULOUS. The staff was attentive (if a little nervous/worried), the food was freshly made, came out warm, and was filling without being heavy. And of course I really appreciated that they had multiple dairy-free options (including soy and almond milk). They answered our questions patiently, including telling us that they've only been around for a few months. IT seems like they're still getting their rhythm down but it didn't impact our experience at all. I'm excited to come back and this is definitely my go/to brunch place from now on!
