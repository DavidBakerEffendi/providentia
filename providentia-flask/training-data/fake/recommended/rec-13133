This review will be very easy to write... EAT HERE NOW. Honestly, one of the best meals I've had in a while. Let the owner take care of you, he genuinely enjoys it. After I thought the night couldn't get any better, around 9pm, the owner turned on Missy Elliot Get Your Freak On. And the diners in this small intimate restaurant started clapping. It was a great environment and I will definitely be back. Key points: Great Malbec wine to enjoy with your meal, awesome appetizers like, Kinpira (braised lotus root) and Rice croquettes, fresh sushi like, I don't even remember the names but they were specials. The salmon was so delicious. Flavor explosion in your mouth. They also had the most tender mussels & the black cod entree was delicious! Go for the dessert. The only one they have: a chocolate mouse with some yummy ginger, lime & orange. Sounds weird but the flavors go magically together. Enjoy!!
