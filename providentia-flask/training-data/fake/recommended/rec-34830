Prosperity is amazing.  I like it.  Tiny storefront with $1 dumplings. Yum. I ate in the shop. I sampled pork and chive dumplings, sesame pancake (75 cents), and pork buns (4 for $1). I had one order to go and took the pork buns with me.  They have dumplings ready hot-in-the pot due to frequent customers stopping in. The dumplings were hot and crisp on the side. The filling is tasty. The potato pancake was hot and tasty too. I dipped it in soy sauce. Yum.   A student came in and kept saying "It's soo cheap. Soo cheap". lol.  The hot sauce and soy sauce had full flavored. I would definitely recommend you try Prosperity Dumplings. I've had been to Tasty Dumplings and to me, it's not as fresh as Prosperity.
