Paid a visit to Mood Cafe last night. Hassan treated us like family and provided a bevy of samples on the house! He was eager to get us to try new things and demonstrate the range of flavors he could accomplish with just a few ingredients. Although lassi are dense, the milkshakes, juice, and shaved ice are light. They are good alternatives on hot days as last night was. First, we had watermelon juice - fresh and pulpy. Next we sampled a vanilla and date milkshake which was delicious. The chewy dates at the bottom of the shake reminded me of bubble tea. He also served us a couple of variants of shaved ice which were not unlike parfait; there was cut fruit at the bottom of the cup along with crushed ice topped with light syrups. The syrup flavors were rose and sandalwood! He also provided a similar shaved ice with pineapple. NOTE: For all you vegans out there, Mood Cafe has stocked up on almond, soy, and coconut milk. Seems like most items are available in vegan form. You win, Hassan. Five stars. My stomach can't take any more.
