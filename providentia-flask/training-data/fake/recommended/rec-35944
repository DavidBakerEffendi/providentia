This place is small but nice. I started with the BBQ shrimp with crispy grits. It was really delicious. As a main, I had the fried chicken and butter beans. Again, absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy, juicy and flavorful. You can't beat the drink prices. The bartenders provide a generous pour for rock bottom prices.  My only complaint is with the service. The waitress basically forced us to order immediately (I had the menu less than a minute), then she disappeared. We had to use another customer to get her back to our table to order another round of drinks. However, when it was time to pay the bill the waitress came back to our table a good 4 times to see if we were "ready;" despite the fact the we had just received our second round of drinks. The food was a little slow to come out of the kitchen. I am willing to overlook these little service glitches to an extent because the food is so good.  I will definitely go back.
