I might have to say that this is the best Japanese ramen in philadelphia. Highly recommend the LARGE miso (ask for it to be spicy) with extra sprouts and shoots. The chashu isn't rolled here; it comes in rectangular slices. I would love it if philadelphia could get on board with grinding fresh garlic over your bowl but the dried garlic flakes they offer here are packed with flavor. Love that you can grind fresh sesame seeds here too. The broth is rich and full of flavor. Surprisingly, they have kimchi here. (Korean fermented cabbage) it is a must have accompaniment with your ramen. I also tried the signature terakawa ramen, the pork buns sans mayo, takoyaki, chicken karaage over curry, and chashu onigiri. Very very delicious. Will be back here again and again. Just don't have anything planned after because you're sure to slip Ito a food coma!!
