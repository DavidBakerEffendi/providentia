Solid West Village spot with an assortment of food and wine at a reasonable price. Shared the pasta, pizza, and burger. Pasta was better than the Pizza, which was better than the Burger. This won't be the best pasta or pizza you ever had, but it's a great value for the quality and there were plenty of tables available when we rolled in on a Friday night. Will come back if in the neighborhood without reservations.
