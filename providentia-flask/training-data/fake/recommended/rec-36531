Had dinner at Landmarc on 8/16.  My gf and I started with the roasted marrow bones, and enjoyed it. For entrees, she ordered mussels in white wine and I had the ribeye with a creamed spinach.  The steak was standard, but it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The creamed spinach, however, was the BEST I've ever had.  I've had it at The Palm, DelFrisco's, and most other steakhouses and Landmarc's was the best.  If that's not enough, my gf got into it by using it as a spread on her bread. I also discovered a fine Spanish rioja as recommended by our server.  He did a great job with explaining the wines, as well as the menu and was very attentive.  Note that I'm not a wine drinker, but I drank the half bottle by myself. Overall, will definitely go again and recommend to friends.
