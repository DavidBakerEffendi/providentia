I second and third and fourth all the ringing endorsements for the pancakes. These are not your average pancakes. They are fluffy and crispy, and I don't even need syrup with them. Tip: When the pancakes arrive (there are two), immediately separate them from each other so the bottom one doesn't get soggy. Enjoy! The rest of the brunch fare is good but basic. If you're looking for a fancy-pants brunch with ten Bloody Mary options and shade-grown coffee, this isn't it. If you're looking for some non-fussy egg dishes and amazing pancakes, Lul√∫c will not disappoint.
