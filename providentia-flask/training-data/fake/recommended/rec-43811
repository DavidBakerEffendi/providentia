I was heading to pho hong and stumbled upon this gem.  I know they're bahn mi sandwiches have been ragged on in other reviews, but maybe they've changed their style since then because this is the best bahn mi sandwich in the area hands down.  Most other places in town offering cheap bahn mi contain way too much bread for the amount of filling.  The pork was wonderfully fatty as belly meat is supposed to be and the forcemeat filling was phenomenal.  Plus a wonderful syle hot sauce and pickled vegetables.  You can't beat this sand which for the price either; subway ain't got anything on this $3.50 footlong! (it's funny how the going rate for a bahn mi sandwich anywhere in the burlington area is $3.50.  I wonder how long it'll be before these asian markets realize that most other american delis can get $7-10 for a sandwich of similar size)
