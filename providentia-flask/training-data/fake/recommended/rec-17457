A gem!  Delicious crepe style pancakes (thin), great breakfast sandwiches and awesome omelettes.  A welcome change to a typical diner breakfast.  Judging from my family's experience and the reviews here, this family will be going back and trying....lunch, dinner and maybe even the catering.  Give it a try!
