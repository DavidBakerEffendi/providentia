I gave this three stars due to the fact that we sat outside and it seemed that the outside seating area was the "forgotten" area.  The servers seemed defensive when asked where the food was and when the food was brought out, it wasn't the correct order. The salad was given without any silverware and no additional plates were given (even though it was requested).  Although the service wasn't up to par. This place has by far-- the most delicious Peruvian food I have ever tasted.  Sweet sangria, avocado salad that has avocado sooo soft...you will ask for more. The chicken was juicy and slid right off the bone and was simply delicious.  They provide a special sauce for the salad that is a bit spicy but if you are open to that than I'm sure you will love it. Great place as long as you do not sit outside.
