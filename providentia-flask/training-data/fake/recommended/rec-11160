Consistent food, good beer, instead of going to Sabrina's try this place out for a change! Every time I come here i'm surprised that the food is as good as it is.  It's kind of a weird location, and I think they get a lot of the overflow from Sabrina's, but I think they probably deserve a little more attention than they get.  The wings are really good, as is the brunch selection... I have yet to be disappointed.  I've really only been here for brunch/lunch so I have no idea what kind of crowd comes here in the evening. The only thing about this place that really bugs me is the lighting... it's dark and dreary... but not in a cool way like an english pub.  During nice days they have the doors up front open, but still something isn't right. Also, the jukebox is notable - They had me at the Walkmen, which had the #1 slot.  Cool.
