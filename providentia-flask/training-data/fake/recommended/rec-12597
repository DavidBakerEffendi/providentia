Beware of take out orders. Whenever I have a craving for some lobster rolls, this is the place to go.  It's convenient located just off the Gowans. During the summer times, lines can be long though so be prepared to wait.  I had to wait a good hour this past summer. The store front is small. When you walk in, to your right is a large chalk board with all the different items on the menu.  They have several kinds of lobster rolls available, but by far I like the Connecticut lobster roll and my husband likes the Bacon Lobster roll.  They are served on a buttery toasted hotdog bun with a side of pickle. Aside from the lobster rolls, they also have lobster mac & cheese, lobster bisque, fries, regular hotdogs, clam chowder, and corn on a cob just to name a few.  There's a lot more, but i just can't commit all of them to memory.  You can also order a whole steamed lobster.  In the store they have two holding tanks to the left of the door entrance.  I had the pleasure of seeing them fish out a lobster for me.  I took it home as a pet. LOL.  Just kidding, I had them steam it and bag it for me to take home and eat. Oh that poor lobster.   As much as I love the lobster rolls here, I only gave them 3 stars because of the following. 1. They forgot to put the seafood bisque in my To Go bag, and I had to run back and remind them that they forgot it. they never apologized. In fact they seemed annoyed. 2. The sizes of the lobster rolls are pretty minuscule relative to how much they cost IMHO. 3. They forgot to crack the lobster claws for me, and i specifically asked that they do that. When I got home I had to struggle to crack them open. I almost lost a finger and a tooth!! I don't know why they had to be so careless with my order.  I never had a sit-down meal here so I can't say if the experience will be different/better.  I hope they try to get their act together cause they will certainly loose customers this way.
