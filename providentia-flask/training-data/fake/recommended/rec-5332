I am a big fan of the Continental.. usually. I was there on Tuesday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. As I was signing my tab, a bartender knocked over a full glass of red wine and it spilled all over me. I was covered from my chest and down my shorts. The bartender looked and me and very flatly said "Sorry." I had to ask for napkins. After getting the napkins, she then "guessed" she could offer a glass of club soda. Thankfully, it is dark in there and the wine blended into my shirt. But when I got home and tried to wash the wine out of my clothes, my new shirt was ruined. Accidents happen. I'm okay with that. I'm not okay with the staff's attitude and how the situation was handled. I had to ask for something to clean myself off with and then was only reluctantly offered a glass of club soda? I am very disappointed in the service at the Continental.
