I've been to Olea at least half a dozen times, maybe closer to ten.  And I will continue returning.  It's my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, and one of the best I've ever been to.   I've tried most of the entrees and have yet to be disappointed.  All the tapas I've tried have been excellent (gotta get the almond-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates every time).  The food is just high quality. The waitstaff has always been kind, attentive, and prompt.  On one occasion they forgot to put in a side order, so after I reminded them later they apologized and comped it.  They're always very professional.     Finally, the atmosphere and decor is beautiful and comfortable.  It really makes me feel both at home and like I'm in a little tavern in Greece.   On top of everything, the menu is really reasonably priced.   I highly recommend it!
