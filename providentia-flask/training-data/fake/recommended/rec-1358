I love this place. An excellent beer selection, and friendly bartenders willing to offer a suggestion to fit your mood. Â The atmosphere manages to be very large, yet cozy due to separated areas both inside and out. Servers stopped by our outside table frequently, so we were never in need of a drink for long. A great neighborhood bar.
