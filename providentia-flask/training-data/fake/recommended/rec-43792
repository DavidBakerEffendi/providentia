Of course such an adorable and cozy restaurant is located on the outskirts of town blocks away from the trains and heavy foot traffic of the East Village. Nevertheless, I would come back here again just for the warm ambiance and home-cooked Serbian/Balkan dishes. Stay away from the spinach pie; order the lamb and spinach stew. Take it from a person who doesn't normally like lamb. Note: Cash only!
