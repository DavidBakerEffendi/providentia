On a recent day trip through Lower Manhattan, my fiance and I knew we had to try AT LEAST pizza place, and I left that very important decision of where that would be up to him. Let's just say he didn't let me down, and neither did Price St. Pizza. The decision of what kind of pizza to get here was maybe the most daunting task of the day, as I was drooling over all of them. Had we not had 10 different places to eat that day, I may have just ordered one slice of each! After much debating and talking with everybody that worked there, we decided on the Spicy Spring (pepperoni square). Little did I know I would be raving about a square cut thick crust piece of pizza- completely opposite of what NY is known for. It was heaven in my mouth. The crust was so tasty, as were the little crispy rounds of pepperoni on top of the perfectly browned fresh mozzarella cheese. Don't let this tiny restaurant with very few seats fool you- it comes with big flavors that will be doing the happy dance in your Â mouth!
