Amis' unique spin on traditional Italian will have me coming back. I live only a few blocks away so I pass by all the time, but this was my first time stopping in for dinner. Happily they were open on a Monday night, and getting a reservation was easy, although it probably wouldn't have been 100% necessary. The staff were all extremely nice, which should be a given, yet I'm always pleased when they are. The menu may seem a bit daunting at first, even though all the combinations of food I tasted were perfectly matched. The swordfish meatballs are a must-try with their homemade meatball taste and just enough of a 'fishy' kick to remind you that you are indeed eating swordfish. It may take a little bit of adventurousness to get past some of the food pairings on their dishes, but you should have faith in them. A very solid list of beers and wines with a varied enough selection on tap to keep pretty much any beer palate happy. I would recommend it.
