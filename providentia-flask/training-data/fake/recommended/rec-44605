My brother lives in the hills of Tennessee, an hour from Dollywood, so I've had FRIED CHICKEN, and the fried chicken here is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The bartender/owner was really nice, chatty, telling me about how they started and built the place. We were chatty back, hoping for freebies. They never came, so we ended up ordering the snacks - peanuts/bacon-bits jars, brussel sprouts, french fries - ourselves. Totally worth it. I've been here only twice, once at 6PM or drinks, and once on Halloween for dinner, so can't speak about its regular vibe, but so far so good.
