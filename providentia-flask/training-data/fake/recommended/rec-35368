If you go around 9:30pm on a weeknight the line is only about 10-15 minutes long! I would highly recommend this if you you a tourist and just visiting... that way you will be steering clear of sloppy drunk folks and instead be standing in line with people who are getting off of work in the midtown area/ families. DO NOT POUR THE RED SAUCE ALL OVER YOUR DISH! I'm an avid hot sauce lover but this stuff is more of an unrefined hot sauce...chunky and dry (yes, a sauce that is dry...). It's very unappetizing when it dries out on your food, which it does since it's not a very liquidy sauce to begin with. DO take extra white sauce with you. Seriously... you can never have enough white sauce. I ran out of white sauce and was very sad... Aside from those pointers the chicken and rice is all that everyone raves it to be!
