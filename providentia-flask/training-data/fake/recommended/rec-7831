My wife and I went for breakfast while we were in philly for a football game. The place was decorated amazing if you love your four legged friends. The paintings around the restaurant were awesome and would really like to get in touch with the artist actually. They said his name was jay Rodriguez bit no way to contact him. Oh yes, the food was fantastic as well. Would absolutely visit again.
