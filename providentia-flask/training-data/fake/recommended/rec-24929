Simply put, I love this place.  It gets busy, and you might not get a table on a Friday/Saturday without a reservation, but every time I manage to land a table I have a great meal.  The Managing Partner (James  "Cos" Cosgrove) is a pleasure, and always makes us feel very welcome.   The cheesy garlic bread is still as delicious as ever, and I have yet to try anything that I didn't really like.  That's the only downside, it's too hard to choose sometimes! As others have noted, the happy hour is worth a visit, as it goes until 7:30 and lands you some nice drinks and apps at a significantly discounted rate.   Do yourself a favor and check it out if you haven't already.  If you have, well you probably aren't reading this review...as you already know it deserves your patronage.
