Had a reservation, but didn't need one... Was hoping there would be more African influence in the dishes, but since I like French food it was still satisfying. The escargot was standard (delicious) but my friend got the foie gras which tasted fine, but resembled a giant square block of meat margarine. Â It had been raining off and on but it was so humid in the restaurant that we sat next to the street, where we were unfortunately frequently visited by a couple of fruit flies (one of which introduced himself by landing on the rim of my wine glass where I almost ate him). The servers were really attentive and pleasant.
