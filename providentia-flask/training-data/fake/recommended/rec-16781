Listen, you should go here. Â I'm so happy that Prohibition was too crowded to eat there! Bufad has fantastically delicious, reasonably priced pizzas. Whether you decide on the classic Margherita or a seemingly strange,but actually very tasty specialty pizza(Cacio e Pepe), you won't go wrong. Also, the waiters were so helpful and nice! It's a damn near perfect vibe for most everything: a hot date, dinner with your mom, dinner with your 6 best friends. Whatever. Just remember to grab a 6 pack or a bottle of wine before you go! It's BYOB, but the closest place to buy beer is Prohibition Taproom, which is way overpriced for carry out bottles.
