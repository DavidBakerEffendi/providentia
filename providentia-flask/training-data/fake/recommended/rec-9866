Lombardi's must be the husk of a once-great pizzeria. If you go today you'll find hostesses with walkie talkies, plastic table clothes, corporate-looking menus, and $30 souvenir wine bottles. Add an army of backpacked tourists and you can give yourself a mental picture of the place. We ordered a heavily topped pizza (similar to what we'd get at any other place) and it was good. Maybe even more than good but definitely not great. With so many truly great pizza options in NYC, personally I'd skip it...
