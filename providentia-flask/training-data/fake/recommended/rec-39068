Oh my god, Odeon is so good that my wife and I ate there two of the four nights we stayed in NYC (we were staying in TriBeCa so it was convenient). The hanger steak that I had was incredibly well prepared; a very memorable, crave able dish. We split a caesar salad that was crisp, bursted with flavor and truly standout. The service was excellent both nights, and a shout out to Ebony, who was very professional. I really like this place. Excellent, high quality food without even a drop of pretension. We'll be back.
