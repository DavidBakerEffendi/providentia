The food is here is pretty high quality for the price.  Even the rice is very good.  I had no problems with service, I speak enough Japanese to get by, but I noticed they had two Japanese guys who spoke both Japanese and English perfectly and had english names, I guess they managed to hire American Born Japanese waiters.  The only thing I'm afraid of this might be one of those cases where they send over a "A" team from Japan to run the kitchen and once this place gets really popular they staff with min waged locals and the quality goes down.
