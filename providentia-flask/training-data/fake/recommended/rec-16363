The pad Thai is pretty good here- not your traditional. I have had the papaya pad Thai and the zucchini pad Thai and both were great . I have also tried their brunch special which didn't impress me quite as much but was still good for the price of $25 bottomless mimosas or bloodies and an entree. The chile pomegranate mimosas were really great! I got the chicken and waffles which weren't the best. I will probably just stick go the pad Thais next time. Always love the atmosphere though!
