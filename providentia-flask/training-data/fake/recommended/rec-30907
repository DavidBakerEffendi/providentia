Best coffee in the neighborhood! I know a lot of places serve Stumptown but Scratch brews it most deliciously! I love the food here- such great quality. They lose one star for the fact that there is no awning so while you're waiting you are being painfully fried by the sun. Bedford/Lexington must be the hottest corner in Brooklyn. One day this summer a customer passed out from heat stroke- no lie! If Scratch loves their customers as much as we love them, they will get a bigger awning by summer 2013!
