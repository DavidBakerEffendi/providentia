Seems to me that NYC yelpers reviews are way better than Los Angeles.  I have some definite criterion for that but ... I'm not going to put it into writing. We were looking for a place that was near the apartment we were renting whilst in NYC and this place was very highly rated by yelp. Well ... I'm sure my gf got upset that I said, "Uva's still open" about four times in a a little over a week. I was upset about nothing.  The service was great.  The wine and the recommendations were amazing.  The food kicked-ass.  Definitely a place we'll come back to when we visit NYC again.
