Simply put, this place was amazing. From the spiked watermelon lemonade to the crispy potato pancakes, and let's not forget to mention the blueberry pancakes with maple butter syrup. Can't wait to come back for lunch. Definitely a must when you're looking for a breakfast spot to grub, I shall return.
