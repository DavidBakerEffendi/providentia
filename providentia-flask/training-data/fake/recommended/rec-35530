Picking the boy up from UVM for his junior year deserved a night of celebration. So we packed the friends into the Farmhouse Grill and Tap. Tried to make a reservation for 6 but they had nothing available. When we arrived we where told it would be an hour wait. Normally Dan does not wait but since we had a crowd we decided to hit the basement waiting area for a beer and some appetizers. The basement is cozy waiting area with darts, board games and a great selection of local brews along with a good selection of Belgian beers. We opted for the Olives, assorted nuts and brie on crispy toast. By the time we finished the buzzer was going off for our table. Painless. Now for the best part. We all ordered burgers which seem to be a house specialty. I tried the Lamb burger cooked medium rare with a small scoop of Chevre cheese. The boys had the Pork burger which was served with Vermont Cheddar, Fennel slaw and a sunny side up egg. The veggie burger was a home made burger served with Kimchi house pickled jalapenos and of course the ever present Vermont cheddar. All the burgers came with salad or fries The service was great throughout the organization and the pricing was very reasonable. We will return,
