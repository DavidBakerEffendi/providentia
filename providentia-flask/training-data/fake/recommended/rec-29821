I've only eaten here off peak so my experience reflects that factor. Food is decent at this price point. The wonton soup has french basil & rather salty but ok, the dan noodles are pretty good. Speed of service has always been very good. Given the Trader Joes next door this mall is very busy but evening time seems best to hit this place up.
