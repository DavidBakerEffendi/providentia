Loving this spot... Only odd thing was the feel of the place when I walked in. Â Lot of young guys looking around, nervously waiting for their blind dates. Apparently it is blind date central in there. It was a weird vibe, but it wasn't a deterrent to staying there. The bartender was awesome. Great veggie burger that I had here. Hearty & flavourful. The cocktails were strong, tasty, & dangerous. Decor of the spot is modern with a homemade feel. Music is okay. Got a little bit better as the night went on. Soccer and baseball on the big screens (yawn). No basketball???! Place is 7 weeks young. Check it out!
