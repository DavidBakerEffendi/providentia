Sunday brunch prix fixe menu is $13 with a drink - best value for a very delicious meal!  I had the smoked salmon with pouched eggs on a toast and it was tres excellente.  All this comes after a long wait of course - 4 of us arrived at 11am and waited 50min to get seated - which is why it gets four out of five stars.
