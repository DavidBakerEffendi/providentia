Pepe's, Sally's, Modern - most people don't know BAR actually has the best pizza in New Haven! The mashed potato pizza is carb-on-carb heaven. After going there all the time, I wasn't in the city for six years. Within an hour of returning, I made a beeline to BAR. The pizza tastes the same, the salad is just as good (although expensive!). It's good for my hips that I live on the other coast.
