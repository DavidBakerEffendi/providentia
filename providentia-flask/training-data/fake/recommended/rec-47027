Smallest "pitcher" of margaritas ever love love love the tres leches cake even though its not super traditional! the huge plate of Nachos are always good the carne asada tacos were fab the teensy plate of chorizo queso was super small for being 13 dollars, but tasted fab also who knows, maybe we're spoiled for living in both texas and california.
