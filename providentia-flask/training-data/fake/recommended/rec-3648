Ever since Bijan's opened up, happy days are here again. Literally: one time I walked in and Happy Days was playing on the TV. Fonzie aside, I'm so happy Bijan's is here. It's about a block away from me, and I can't imagine a better bar to have in the 'hood. The vibe is intimate, but casual. The music is always good, which makes it the perfect place to kick off your night with a quiet drink. As the hour gets later, the soul/funk gives way to more danceable tunes, so it's also a much better late-night spot than my apartment. And I'm definitely not just saying that because your drunk ass spilled wine on my carpet last time. It can get a little packed in the small space, but the service is always friendly and the drinks are always good. Larry seems to be behind the bar more often than not, and this is a good thing. He's one of the friendliest, funniest guys around, and spot on with his mixing of the medicinal cocktails on the menu. I love that each drink description tells you the therapeutic benefits of that pumpkin, mint, chili pepper, etc. It makes me feel that much better about having five of them in a sitting. Good music, good drinks, good vibe...I'm already in danger of spending entirely too much time here. And to top it off, the kitchen is opening in early February...at which point I won't even have to leave to go eat things so I can come back and drink more. Better get used to it, Larry, you're gonna see way more of me than anyone really wants to.
