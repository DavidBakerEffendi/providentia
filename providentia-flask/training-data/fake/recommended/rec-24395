I don't know the food but service was unbelievably unreasonable. My friends reserved table for 8, and I came as 9th person after they finished eating. When I asked to order, the waitress told me to order meal for 9 people, bcoz chef only prepares food for group people not only 1 person. So I said I order nothing, she told me they charge 65$ per person anyways whether I order or not. So I have to leave my friends! Bcoz I can't pay $65 just for sitting there not eating, also I can't order food for 9 people and eat all of them myself or force my friends to eat again and pay again!!! My friend also try to cancel the reservation, but they told my friend they gonna charge anyway even we don't show up, bcoz they have my friend's credit card information. I know it's my fault not reserving the place in advance but it's kind of fraudy!!! I am so disappointed. Shame on this place!
