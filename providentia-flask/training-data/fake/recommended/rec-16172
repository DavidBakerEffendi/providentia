The atmosphere is great (think wine cellar) but the wine and food pairings left something to be desired.  My friend and I planned to order different wine flights and then learned upon ordering that these were only offered from 5-7pm or something like that.  We later ordered a cheese plate which was good, but would have been better if it was a few different types of cheese rather that 2 (although we chose gorgonzola and they never told us what the other cheese was).  Also, it was a bit loud which made conversation somewhat difficult, though not impossible.
