I tried this restaurant last night and had one of the best meals of my life!  It came highly recommended by one of my friends and it was within walking distance of my Center City hotel.  I only had to wait for about 5 minutes before a seat at the bar opened up.  I asked the bartender about my vegetarian options and he told me that they could make any pizza meatless for me.  I ordered the prosciutto pizza (sans prosciutto) and it was amazing!!  I honestly don't think I've ever had pizza that good.  (And who knew you could put grapes on pizza??)  Everyone around me enjoyed their dinners as well, and every plate looked phenomenal.  I don't remember which pasta my friend had--he let the bartender choose his food and drinks for him--but he said both it and the wines he tried were excellent.  My beer was very good, the atmosphere was pleasant, the bartender was attentive...I could not have asked for a better introduction to Philly!  I will be back every time I'm in town.
