A group of 6 of us went here for our friend's birthday.  We were excited because we were craving Italian food and this place pretty good reviews.  First of all, our waitress was not so nice, often cutting us off when we were asking questions, barely smiled, so we opted to ask busboys and other waiters for help.  When we got our food, my husband actually sent his veal (recommended by the waitress) back because it looked and tasted like a TV dinner.  Another friend ordered the tagliatelle bolognese, which she mentioned was over-cooked.  I ordered the Priests Stranglers, which was the best order of the night.  After eating, I asked who I thought was the manager if they did anything for birthdays and he said, "I can bring out some desserts and we'll sing for you."  They came out with a tray of desserts and sang to our friend, which was great!  The desserts--- which I was under the impression were complimentary of the restaurant--- were indeed delicious--- but $30 was slapped on to our tab.  Don't plan on returning here.
