My favorite spot! A block from my place. Usually packed but thats because the food is to die for. Its byob which is great if you feel like having some fun. I would call this place hipster. It just has a friendly laid back ambience. I've had many meals here and never had a dislike. The portions are large, I always need a take home box. There is always new specials every week and some interesting combos that work great together. Overall one of my favorite spots.
