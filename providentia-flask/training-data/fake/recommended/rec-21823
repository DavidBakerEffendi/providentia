We had avoided this place because many things on their menu are too heavy for a late dinner, but we returned to enjoy what ended up being an absolutely delicious meal. We shared the cauliflower soup (special that evening) and it was a perfect texture and combination of cream, but not too thick with chunks of cauliflower in it.  We also shared the arugula salad which provides plentiful perfect bites combining fennel, apple, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola, all in a delicious honey vinaigrette. Venturing into the cocktail menu we ordered the Plum Pussy (does that mean something else in another language?!) and the Korzo Sazerac.  The PP tasted too much like a melted lollipop, but we absolutely loved the rye whiskey-based Sazerac and had repeats on that one. All in all, a great meal at a very nice price!
