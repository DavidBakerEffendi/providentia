Nice on the outside!dirty, Dark, dingy waste of space.. In need of a huge renovation. We stopped by for lunch (first timer) sat by the bar. We got burgers( safest route right?) wrong it was beyond greasy kinda cold worst part was that I got to watch a worker have a little make out session w/ her bf Long story short we left and I told my bf please don't tell anyone we came here (embarrassed)
