Ordered for delivery through DASH: Dumplings in chili oil Dan Dan Noodles Spicy cucumbers Bokchoy & mushrooms Dry Fried Pork Scallion chicken Scallops (garlic styled) Overall I thought that the food was delicious and had met my expectations (not exceed it) What was unfortunately disappointing was the dandan noodles that everyone here have been raving about.. perhaps its one of those dishes that should be reserved to be eaten AT the restaurant and shouldn't be on the online DASH menu... or perhaps they should simply  separate the sauce from the noodles when ordered for delivery... cuz it was allll MUSH by the time we got our food:( I would've given it a 4 but rated it a 3 only bc I felt that the food although delicious was way overpriced... (compared to what we can get from chinatown ex. shiao lan kung) PLUS the fact that they had forgotten to provide basic takeout necessities (plates/ napkins/ forks/ chopsticks... shouldnt these be given for take out??)  lastly DASH didn't have some of the main dishes like pork belly w/preserved veg avail. for delivery :( ***when they say spicey... its spicey***
