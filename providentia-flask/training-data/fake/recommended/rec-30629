Great pizza, great waitresses, great bar with a great jukebox. The calamari is top notch too. Anyplace that offers a broccoli rabe pizza is usually legit. I've gotten three different kinds of pizza here - a margherita, a broccoli rabe, a garlic and mushroom and they've all been great.  I also got the calimari becuase I'm a fat f'in pig that can't control myself.  That's ok though....this was worth it. Some other guy wrote a review criticizing the black edges on the pizza....give me a break!  That's how its supposed to be!  If you don't like that than stay in your house and microwave a pizza from Whole Foods you WASPY jerkoff!
