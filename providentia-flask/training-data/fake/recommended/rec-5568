Gotta love Mexican! Not sure why a lot of people are saying its over priced. It's quality food and it's Stephen Starr so your also paying for the atmosphere which, to me, is worth it. You must try one of the guacamole dishes as an app. I had the taco variety as my entree. A lot of food but great! They have a photo booth in the restaurant an a wall that you can stick the pictures on, kinda interesting and cool.
