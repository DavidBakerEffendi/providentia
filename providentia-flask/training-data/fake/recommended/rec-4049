Normally my palate is a bit overwhelmed by Brooklyn's Jamaican/Caribbean  food offerings. Normally the heavy use of seasonings leaves me choking for air or a careening into my kitchen for more water if I come across an especially bad cook who (all to often) tend to rely on pepper  to mask a horror show of a meal - but not today. Having made my commute in one piece I decided I was a bit too lazy to cook . I had passed The Islands on many a hot night , shamefully ducking my thrifty ass in the neighboring Chinese food store, but today with my twenty in hand I nervously entered and ordered some Curry Chicken with Plantains. The woman who ran the shop was friendly in that particularly Caribbean way ; that is, she is very kind but ultimately disinterested with strangers until they become regular faces I'm guessing . Used to Caribbean portions, I noticed my meal had a little bit of extra poundage on it; a definite sign of quality rice. My arm almost got tired carrying it and I got a small!The rice was nicely balanced by the meat, and everything was lush and frag rent. I was skeptical but after I put the first bite into my mouth all I could do was dance..dance and moan in delight!! The heat in the curry was just right, the rice was lighter then I expected and the chicken fell off the bone fresh! Anyone can make chicken fall off the bone, but a place that can do that FRESH at $8 while keeping that level of spice and quality they have is rare! I'm too new to give advice, but if you want standard Caribean fare at great prices, I'll meet you in The Islands,
