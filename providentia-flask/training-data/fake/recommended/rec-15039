Khyber Pass is what every other bar out there should aspire to be. Great ambiance, delectable beers, friendly bartenders, awesome music, great place for an out-of-towner pull up alone (me!) or for locals with a drinking partner, great happy hour specials (on good beer, not just crap domestics), and...I would be remiss if I did not mention the bacon grease popcorn. Swoooon... Khyber Pass, howest did thou achieve such perfection??
