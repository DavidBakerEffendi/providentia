Delicious food - everything we ordered was excellent. Only 6 tables, but worth the wait. Cash only. Lost a star due to being remarkably dirty, but I think that's an understaffing issue - our server was waiting tables, bussing them and prepping food, which meant she could barely wipe tables as they turned over.
