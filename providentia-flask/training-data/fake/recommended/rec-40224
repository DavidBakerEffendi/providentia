I have always loved this place all of the locals are great the original in the NE is the best. BUT......I just saw on Action News 6 that the owner has been taking tips from the servers. I had to find a public forum to say how disgusted I am. Pete the owner you are a horrible Human being....there is no one in the world that can put a positive spin on this. So don't bother with the " complex federal pay regulations". The public is not stupid. I think the readers of Yelp need to know this.
