We live around the corner and have only had good experiences here.  The refrigerators of beer are impressive and fun to discuss with the knowledgeable people who work here.   My husband is obsessed with the bacon.  Dinner is great too! I think they have a deal where if you buy 5 bottles to go you get the 6th free?
