This is a standard Indian restaurant, I love this place cause firstly they deliver to my house and secondly I know the owners very well and get great treatment when I go to the restaurant or order on the phone. They are very helpful in recommending food items and at times I order things which are not listed on their menu. Their buffet is extremely reasonably priced. I am a regular at this place and would recommend their tandoori chicken it is very tasty.
