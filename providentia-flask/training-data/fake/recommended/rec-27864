A hidden gem that we really enjoyed and would definitely recommend. Pros: -Atmosphere:  the place isn't very large, maybe 20-ish seats all seated around the kitchen in the middle (sort of like a sushi bar).  We went on a Sunday night so it wasn't very crowded at all.  Really inviting and comfortable atmosphere and love watching the action in the kitchen. -Service:  from the very beginning, having our coats taken, to the service throughout, they were very attentive. -Food:  Definitely unique dishes, some more Spanish than others.  We had the confit parsnip, mushroom croquetas, brussel sprouts, corvina/potatoes/beets, paella, and steak.  All dishes were either solid or good, and the best dish was dessert - the torrijas (bruleed french toast) - amazing.  We actually didn't order dessert; my husband had the steak and there was at least one piece that was incredibly tough.  I think the chefs saw him struggling to cut through some of the fat, so I think that's why they gave us dessert, which was very nice.  And coming from a non-dessert person, it was really really good. Cons: -As mentioned above, the steak was probably the dish that was just okay b/c it was too tough. -Seating isn't conducive for groups which was fine for us b/c it was just the two of us.
