I wish I could do 4.5 stars. The only draw back to this place was I believe the credit card machine was broken. Food was fantastic! I had fried chicken, yams and Mac and cheese, my bf had wings, greens and fries, his sister had catfish, greens, and potato salad. All raving about how good it was, like out of this world good! My friends and I chatted with the owner for a bit and it seems like their hard work has payed off in excellent food! Will definitely be back; sooner then later.
