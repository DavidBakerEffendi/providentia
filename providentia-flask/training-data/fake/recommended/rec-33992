I was impressed.  Heard about it through a friend and finally had a chance to try it.  We had a table for four and ordered the following: Aps - Cornbread Collard Greens Mussels Mac N Cheese Mains - Chicken and Waffles Flank Steak Butternut Ravioli Lobster and Grits Everything was really tasty but I have to say the most memorable was the broth they make for the mussels and the Lobster and Grits. Service and drinks were excellent too!
