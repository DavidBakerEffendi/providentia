Come for the burger, stay for the beer and the patio if you're lucky enough to find it open. I've never been disappointed with a burger from the Royale, no matter how many times I order the same thing or experiment with new toppings.  One of the better burgers in a city littered with good ones and that's really saying something.  I see a lot of people poo-pooing them but don't walk in here expecting something outrageous.  It's just a good solid beer bar burger and believe me, you'll want to come back and try the burger another way once you're done with your first visit. Good spot for groups, nothing remarkable in terms of beer or liquor (yes, they have Porkslap.  So do a million other bars.) Anyway, I like eating here but not hanging around for too long.
