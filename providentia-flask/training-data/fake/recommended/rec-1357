I promised myself to "almost never" rate a place 5 stars. This is one of the few. It's the best Mexican I've had in NYC. It's a great little spot with good atmosphere, good customers and great food. Their mole is top notch, and love their specials such as fish guacamole. Also, try their cocktails, the Pepino is one of my favorite cocktails I've ever had. It goes perfectly with the food too.
