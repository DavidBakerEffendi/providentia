Visited 4/12/13 Cute little place where fries are done right - double fried. Very friendly staff. We tried a couple of dipping sauces: mango chutney, garlic rosemary mayo, dill lemon mayo and black truffle mayo. This is definitely not a place for any mayo-haters. Way too many mayo dips for my liking but they have malt vinegar if you need to cut the richness.. lol.
