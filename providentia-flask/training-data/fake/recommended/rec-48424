My friend and I decided to have dinner here one Saturday night. I lived in Germany for several years and spent a lot of time in Vienna, so I was psyched to have some yummy Austrian food. The food was alright, but the service was really awful. When we got there, I asked the waitress (who, incidentally, was a man in drag with a really really bad wig. No joke) if the wiener  schnitzel were pork or veal. She bristled visibly at the question and told me that "real wiener schnitzel" is always pork. This, gentle readers, is most certainly not the case.  I don't eat pork, but I really had my heart set on a Jaegerschnitzel, so I asked if they could just put some Jaeger sauce on the chicken schnitzel for me. She said that that would be impossible, and went  off on some spiel about the Jaegerschnitzel being unbreaded and the chicken schnitzel being breaded and blah blah blah. So then I politely asked if I could just order a side of the jaeger sauce to eat with my chicken schnitzel, and she said "No... we don't do that... why don't you just order the pork one?" and then proceeded to walk away, not to return for another 10 minutes (with a chip on her shoulder and the aforementioned bad wig on her head) I just wanted some freakin' mushroom sauce on my chicken schnitzel, is that too much to ask?   I ended up getting the "Bread dumplings with wild mushroom fricasse".  Was actually pretty good, but the portion was a bit small and there wasn't enough sauce for all of the dumplings. Paying was also a hassle as after the check was delivered to us, our waitress went out to smoke, then plopped down at the bar and had a long conversation with a friend while I all but jumped up and down trying to get her to take my credit card. I ended up giving it to the bus boy. I won't be going back, which is a pity, because there were other things on the menu that I really wanted to try.
