I wouldn't say that this is my favorite pizza-by-the-slice joint in town (that honor belongs to Joe's), but it serves some darn tasty pizza nonetheless. Thin and crispy with a nice amount of chew, this is what New York style pizza is all about. Great crust, great cheese, a good assortment of toppings (for those so inclined), the perfect amount of grease = tasty pizza! Be warned, the place is tiny. It literally has only four or five stools lined up at a counter opposite the ovens, but if you're looking for something on the go or are not with a large group of people, it will suffice.
