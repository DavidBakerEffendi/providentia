Coffee's good, service is excellent. Pork Belly Benedict hit the stop. Good value brunch! Came here on Friday morning and there was no problem getting seated. Hip atmosphere. Just landed on a red eye from California and I feel like I never left. Vegan options, soy milk, etc are all cool things to have on the menu. Fair warning, it's cash only a la California. ATM inside.
