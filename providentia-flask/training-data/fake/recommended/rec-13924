Space:  It's a chill atmosphere and it's spacious so you never feel crowded.   Burger:  The burger is good as are the fries - actually, the fries are very good.   Brunch:  Their eggs benedict is good (simple, classic eggs benedict).  However, their almond hash could use work.  They give an entire plate of hash (most of it potatoes with a few pieces of duck) with ONE poached egg - it was so unbalanced. Either give less hash or give another egg - common sense because even just looking at the plate, you know something just doesn't look right.  And don't order the OJ - someone mentioned it previously but I'll say it again - it is from the carton and not fresh-squeezed.   Service:  Varies with the server but overall good.  The manager is friendly.
