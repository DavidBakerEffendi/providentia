Somehow "lets go to YogurtLand" turns into drinking tequilla at 11pm on a Tuesday night.  No complaints here. This was a spur of the moment "lets try this place" situation that had outdoor seating which was a must for that night.  No food had been order (we did eat the chips, guac, and bean dip that they gave us - very good)  - just drinks. Our first round consisted of the Ofrenda Margaritas and I have to say those had some fire to them.  The infused tequila was definitely a different taste and had a strong "smoke" taste to it that I liked, but would put some fire into every sip.     Second round was the El Diablos and honestly I could not drink it fast enough, thought it was excellent.  The lime juice definitely gave it a nice twist with some kick. As everyone else has mentioned, the service was outstanding.  Our server was cool and helped us with drinks.  Service was prompt however not intruding like some places can be.  All around a great place and they definitely have my vote.
