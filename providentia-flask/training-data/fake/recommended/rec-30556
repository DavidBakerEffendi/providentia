Amazing authentic italian. I'm not going to say if you're on a budget, because while it's a great value, it's just greatly authentic as well. Perfect spring and summer spot when the windows/doors open up and the cool breeze off the Hudson brings out the aromas and flavors of this decadent home-made pasta joint.
