Spicy is my favorite restaurant in Glastonbury! I truly have had only awesome meals and service here. I'm in love with the veggie burger! Literally the best veggie burger I've ever tasted. I have been trying to recreate it at home, but it just isn't the same! It is packed with so many goodies! They always surprise me with their monthly specials. I'm always up for trying one of their new creations! The tomato soup is always tasty. The cheesy croutons take it to a whole new level! Also - the breakfast options are always awesome. The omelets are gigantic and the homefries are tri-colored potatoes. I appreciate a local restaurant that gets creative. I always have an awesome experience and am looking forward to many more!
