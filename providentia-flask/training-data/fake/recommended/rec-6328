I really wanted to like the Meatball Shop, but really it was just ok.  I split the classic beef with classic tomato sauce and spicy pork with the sauce of the day (think it was some sort of salsa) as well as an order of sliders, rigatoni and steamed spinach.  The atmosphere is fun for friends and the menu / ordering system is cute, but I think I make a better meatball myself.  Based on other reviews maybe I'm missing something...I would give it another shot, but I'm certainly not craving to go again.
