This place has a great selection of caribbean food, love their fish, fried banana, the ambiance is really nice and the waiter are dressed with really typical clothes from "Cuba" or so they intent to look like caribbean but in a very good looking way.. The wait can be very long.. I guess it is a popular place.. But I do think it is too long. The people are overall nice and again the food is very good just a little on the  I heard the "Churrasco" is one of the best and I love their "empanadas". Their appetizer is a little $$ for the quantity.. so better get the main dish right away..  Overall I like it.. Just should reserve before going to avoid long waits...
