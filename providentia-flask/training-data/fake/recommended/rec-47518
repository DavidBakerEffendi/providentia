I finally got  a chance to come to craft house...if you are looking for some really good comfort food like  beef brisket...chicken&waffles.. mac& cheese etc..you definitely need to try it out. I don't drink but the company I was with said they was very happy with their drinks/ top beer selections.The place is amazing in/out with a nice ambience to it.
