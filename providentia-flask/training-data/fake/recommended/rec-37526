Maybe we are just used to Americanized Chinese food but everything tasted a little off. Egg drop soup had a puzzling flavor until we discovered the corn. Fried dumplings were larger than normal with a kind of fluffy meat filling but served with a tasteless oily sauce. Pork fried rice had too many peas and the pieces of pork tasted off - it was bland enough I was looking for the soy sauce that wasn't there. The hot tea was very nice. The service was good. Located in Chinatown town, it must be popular with the neighborhood because we were the only obvious tourists there. It would be worth a try if you are into a more authentic cuisine.
