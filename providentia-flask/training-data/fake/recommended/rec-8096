Unfamiliar with Philly sushi, wasn't sure what to expect.  Fiance had heard such rave things that I expected the classiest joint ever.  It was a little room with very informal furnishings.  Kinda thought "did we come to the right place"  Went here on night I proposed so at first a bit dissappointed with what I saw.   Couple joined us, and they brought a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate.  Staff had no problem with this and chilling it for us.  Did not get charged a corkage fee.  I like that. Our bill was expensive (about 150 bucks) but when I think about it, we ordered sooo much food that it was our own darn faults.  So, It wasn't expensive... we just weren't wise.   I thought the rolls were very good.  It took a while for them to take our order but when they did it came pretty quick and it was pretty good.  Very pretty presentation too.  I enjoyed it.   In short, I think this is a good place to come out with some friends for a quick grab of some decent sushi, but it isn't the mecca we were expecting.  No decor, no ambience, and pretty cramped.  If this were in California I would 3 star the food, but due to location I would 4 star it.  Unfortunately the crowded, lunch counter atmosphere would make me think 1 or 2 stars.  2+4 = 6.   The average is 3, so that is what I would say Zento is.
