What a pleasant surprise!  There is no shortage of Thai restaurants in the city, but most of them serve uninspired food, which I often suspect spent some time in a freezer.  Ngam provides an entirely different experience -- the food is really unusual and is prepared daily entirely from scratch.  The waiters are super-friendly and Chef Hong is usually around and visits the tables.  I have been to the restaurant 5 times and plan to visit it again soon. My favorite dish is the papaya salad - it is delicious, unusual, light and huge.  It's a great summer dish.   My other favorite is the ZUCCHINI PAD THAI . . . Great concept (who needs all those carbs?) and delicious.   If I could, I'd give Ngam 4.5 stars as there's a bit of room for improvement in consistency of preparation.  Overall, it's a gem at this price point and I've had great experiences.  It's closer to 5 starts than to 4, so I'm rounding up and giving it 5 stars.
