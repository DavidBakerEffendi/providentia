One of my favorites. It's unpretentious and doesn't cost a fortune. Dinner is great - if you like mayo and potatoes (if not, what the hell is wrong with you???) get the Patatas Bravas tapa - it's life changing. Try not to stick your face in it though, that tends to be frowned upon. Brunch is also on point here. The coffee is strong enough to make you want to talk to people before 1 PM on a Sunday, which is reason enough to make the trip.
