If you don't want to deliver food, that's fine. But don't offer delivery in that case. Ordered at 7pm, called at 8, 9, and 10 to check in on the order and was told each time that our order would arrive about 10-15 minutes later. Our food never arrived, and we were still charged for the order. Obviously, that's mildly unacceptable.
