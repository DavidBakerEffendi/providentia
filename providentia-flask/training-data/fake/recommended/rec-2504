i LOVEEE this place. Â i've been coming to this place for awhile! It's open 24 hours, so it's a great place to refuel... especially if you're out late! The rice dishes, noodle dishes, and the congee are all great! They have americanized choices, but also traditional stuff too. The food is delicious and it's so cheap! The service is mediocre, but the food makes up for it. This place gets pretty crowded, so if you go in a big group-- you're bound to have to wait for a table. I personally like this place better than WO-HOP.
