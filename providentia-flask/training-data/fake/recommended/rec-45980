How could you even compare this to another place in VT? For a vegetarian breakfast, I haven't found anything better! Sure you may have to wait a bit on some busy mornings, but with good company and delicious food that arrives within a reasonable time, who cares? It's such a cozy dining area that I don't mind hanging out for a while. My boyfriend and I have tried many menu items and all have been wonderful! The first time I went to Magnolia's I was actually overwhelmed by all of the things that sounded so good. But my favorite is the Philly Seitan sandwich when I'm craving something a little less sweet. Love love love Magnolia Bistro!
