Well my nephew as part of his birthday present wanted a cheesesteak. He is a bit of cheese steak Aficionado. Â My sister said let's try Dalessandro's. I said i always wanted to go there. The meat is so finely chopped its like a mush. The steaks had a musty order i said maybe it's the type of beef they using so i passed it up. Well when we got home an we all bit in neither of us liked it very much. Not saying it was horrible a notch under mediocre an the flavor just wasnt right at all. The counter people where nice an they where pretty quick seen there was a line of about 7 or 8 people. Other than that the steak is a C-. Im not sure why so many good reviews. I understand it has changed hands an isn't what it use to be
