I love bacon and beer but this place really doesn't warrant another visit. The hostess is very rude, the place has a two hour limit on the tables, and some of the bacon served tastes pretty awful. It was a waste of money to order the bacon tasting platter thing because half of those bacon selections were not eaten. Beer is what it is and not especially extraordinary. I was just expecting to have bacon heavenly beer time but I was terribly disappointed. Great concept, poor execution.
