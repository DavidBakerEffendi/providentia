Four of us went here for Thanksgiving and had the prix fixe menu.  The food was wonderful, but what really made our night was our excellent waiter.  He was truly passionate about the food and made great suggestions about what to order.  He made sure we got to try a little of everything on the menu, and was so proud of the food he was serving.  I'd love to go back here for a meal off the regular menu.
