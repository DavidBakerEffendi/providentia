We went here a while ago for Brooklyn Restaurant Week and it was fantastic.  We actually live right down the street, and would definitely go back more often if we could afford it.  As some others have noted, it's almost always completely empty, and I'm not even sure how they've stayed open this long.  Even though the food is delicious, the atmosphere is kind of a bummer because you're usually the only one there.  Maybe it's just too expensive for this part of the neighborhood.  But yeah, the food's great.
