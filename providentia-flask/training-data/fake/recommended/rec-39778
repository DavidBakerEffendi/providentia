Probably not best to go during weekend nights. It's always packed like sardines (sardines from Jersey of all places). But go on a weekday night. Dinner is amazing. Get the Â chips and guacamole appetizer. Not your regular chips too - there's taro and blue corn. It's the perfect meal starter. The mussels appetizer is awesome, so tasty, and big enough to be an entree, with a side of rice and beans. The fish entree specials are always fresh and have very unique tasty flavors. I've been here many times and the food has consistently impressed me.
