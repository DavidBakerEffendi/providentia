Had a great time here last night. The place is  casual, but the ambience was great. Came here on a Wednesday night, and it felt like I knew everyone that was here. The atmosphere was that friendly. We started with the mac and cheese for appetizers , it was so creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly!! Delicioso!! We then proceeded to the chicken and waffles...I ordered the classic which is basically a Belgian waffle with fried chicken. The chicken was perfectly crisped with a flavorful crunchy coating and the inside was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The waffles also had the perfect texture; crunchy outside with a melt in your mouth interior. Gosh, even the maple syrup was awesome! They also bring 3 flavored butters, but I liked berry the best, probably because I have a serious sweet tooth all the time. Not only was the food awesome, but the service was good too. We were served by Jason, he was very knowledgeable and super friendly throughout the whole night. He took his time to explain everything on the menu, being it was our first time.   The whole dining experience here was great. I will be coming back for brunch soon!!It was awesome!
