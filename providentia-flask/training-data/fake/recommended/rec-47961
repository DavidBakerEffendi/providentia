Came here for dinner on recommendation from a friend and L'Artusi did not disappoint. We had an early reservation for 5:45pm, but the restaurant was still almost full and the food was fantastic. After speaking with the waiter for a wine recommendation and ending up with something we both enjoyed, we ordered two main dishes and two sides to share. For the main dishes we chose the Hanger Steak and one of the evening's specials, Chicken Cavatelli. Both were delicious and cooked perfectly. The sides we had were the roasted cauliflower and the summer squash, both of these were also excellent and had lots of great flavor. Despite being fairly full, we went for dessert. On our waiter's recommendation (again, very helpful) we went with the bread pudding topped with a blueberry compote - it was a perfect end to this meal with an amazing balance of sweet and savory flavors. I would love to come back here and hope I get the chance sometime soon. For others' reference, our waiter said that if we come back we should absolutely try the stuffed mushrooms and the spaghetti.
