Oh, Sunny and Annie's.  Good times.  I would say the best thing about this place is its convenience -- you can pop in for a Red Bull and hit the ATM when you are on your way out for a good night, and you can call them the next morning hungover and ask them to deliver pretty much anything.   Their biggest business comes from their sandwich bar, which is -- as other reviewers have pointed out -- open 24 hours, really yummy and a great value for your money.  It's a wonderful thing to walk into a convenience store and walk out with an awesome sandwich.  The ingredients in Sunny and Annie's sandwiches are always fresh and they really pile them up high.  They make all the standard deli sandwiches but if you really don't know what to get, they have this hilarious menu of "house" specialty sandwiches named after political figures like "Mr. Bloomburga" and "The Obama" that are all pretty good. You can call Sunny & Annie's any time of the day or night and order any sandwich you can think of as well as other random household items.  Recently I ordered a swiss cheese sandwich with tomato and avocado, a coffee, a bag of Stacy's Pita Chips and a container of Sabra hummus, and they delivered. My only complaint about Sunny and Annie's is the inconsistency of their grocery items.  Sometimes, if you come in for some Tofu Dogs or a container of Fage yogurt, you need to check to see if they're expired.  Sunny and Annie's does not always check!  So when they deliver, check your grocery items to see if any are expired before the delivery guy walks away.  Other than that minor hazard though, Sunny and Annie's is a great little store and their convenience and selection cannot be beat compared to other small stores in the neighborhood.
