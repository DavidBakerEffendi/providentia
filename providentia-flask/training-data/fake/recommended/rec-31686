Reading the mixed reviews on here I was a little bit leary about going but I was not disappointed.  The decor inside is nice - dimly lit - with normal chairs on one side of the table and couches on the other side of the table with Spanish music playing in the background.  We went on a Wednesday night and they made the sangria for us which was tasty.  I ordered the tamal for an appetizer and it was just mashed up corn into a paste - no meat was inside it - it tasted ok.  I ordered the mofongo with roasted pork and it was divine.  The Mofongo was moist as well as the pork.  I just wished they had some kind of hot sauce to add some kick like Cholula other than Tabasco sauce.  My friends ordered the Caribbean Shrimp Fried Rice and it was great and the coconut sauce that came with it when poured on top made you feel like you were eating something out of the tropics.  They also ordered another shrimp entree and the shrimp were huge.  We didn't have any of the teas they offer - we all shared a small chocolate raspberry cake with vanilla ice cream that was really meant for one or two persons and topped it off with cappuccinos.  The servers were fairly attentive - but it seemed in addition to them dealing with tables they were also handling take-out orders so sometimes when we needed a server - no one was around.  All in all, we all were more than satisfied with our meals and would definitely go back again.
