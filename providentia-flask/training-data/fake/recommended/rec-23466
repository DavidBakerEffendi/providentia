this place gets CROWDED so def make a reservation.  kinda interesting..they bring you both sparkling and still water here and i don't believe they charge you extra.  also, the extra large carafe is apparently a glass and a half more than a bottle of wine, which makes it an awesome deal.  my friend had the mussels and fries which smelled amazing, and i chose the korean bim bim bop.  unfort, they didnt have all the condiments that go along with korean food, so i wasn't all that stoked on my entree.  however, the bacon and cream pizza appetizer was so good!  the staff here is really sweet, and they sent over a bowl of homemade chips when they noticed that our appetizer hadn't come out yet. an awesome replacement for the UNO that used to be here!
