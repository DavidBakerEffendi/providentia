My husband and I went here when they opened last year.   The food was delicious.   We finally got back there last night for Caldwell Restaurant Week and had selections from their pre fix menu:  3 tapas and dessert menu for $24.95 I had an egg & potato omelette, chicken empanadas & mussels with wine sauce. All were expertly prepared and the portions were quite large for tapas.  The only thing I would have to say is that the empanadas were a bit salty.   For dessert I had the coconut rice pudding which was slightly warm and melted in my mouth. This is a restaurant not to be missed in Caldwell.   Highly recommended.
