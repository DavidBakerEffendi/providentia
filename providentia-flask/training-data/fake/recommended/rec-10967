what he/she said. horribly run, 3 hour long wait. empty tables everywhere. rude hostess staff. and food was mediocre (crabs are tiny and overpriced, but clams were very good.) i give it one star because when we finally simply stole (yes, we stole one since about 1/2 were empty) a table, our waiter was amazing. Â One bright star in a very cloudy restaurant.
