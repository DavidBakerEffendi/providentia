I have been to Public a few times: 1.  I took friends from out of town & I loved it!  They had $6 menu, service was great & the crowd was interesting which = interesting conversations. 2.  I went to a baby shower which the setting was lovely.  My friend loved her shower HOWEVER, I felt that it was overpriced, portions were too big for brunch & the food was ok-good. 3.  Then I met my husband for a drink after an event last week and they charged me $17.00 for a glass of sancerre, which a bottle is $20. I was extremely upset with the service & over priced wines and cocktails. I would never go back unless invited to an event.
