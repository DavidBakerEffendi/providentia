Just tried this new place. It was very good. They were pretty busy when we came in but they offered to call us when a table was ready, so we killed some time at Jet Wine Bar across the street. I had the chicken, which was pretty good (even compared to the best chicken in town at Good Dog). Everyone enjoyed what they had, including the mussels and the crawfish pot pie. The service was also very good. The tap list was kind of small (lots of bottled beer), but they do sell growlers. 15th and South is really turning into a lively little block.
