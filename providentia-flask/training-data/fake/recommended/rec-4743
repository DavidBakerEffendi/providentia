Made it out here for brunch because they take reservations! Our server was pretty funny and checked on us just enough. I got the spring fling- which wasn't too much of my liking but the B&B bubbly was really refreshing! I got Â the veggie burger with tater tots. The chickpea burger was soft but well cooked! Everyone in the 6 person table enjoyed their food from the bash to the beet salad.
