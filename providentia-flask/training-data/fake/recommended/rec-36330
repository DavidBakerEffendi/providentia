Every b day of my family has been celebrated in Balthazar. My two sons and I we enjoy and talk about the food we had there forever all year round. Omg is it too much credit? I can t help it. Oysters to start is wonderfully . Salads are delish, steak au poivre is a " must have". I love duck confit as well so crispy and delicious. Share a chocolate desert to finish up. I am hungry all of a sudden.
