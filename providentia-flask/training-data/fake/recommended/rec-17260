Phenomenally good, excellent service and just an overall great place. The food is impeccable. It's diner fare with a bit of panache which is much appreciated. They have a very, very, very extensive menu. My suggestion is you stick to a category that you feel for and look within there (breakfast, burgers etc). The drinks are great and they do have a full bar where you can sit. The dessert options are to die for and might possible be one of the best places to get dessert in NJ. Try the peach cobbler with ice cream or the Tres Leche Cake and you definitely won't miss. The prices are a bit higher than standard diners but you didn't come here for a standard diner experience so you'll pay happily and enjoy. The portion sizes are huge by the way so bring your appetite.
