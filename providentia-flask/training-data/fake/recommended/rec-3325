DiNic's may have fallen victim to the curse that comes with a glowing review on MvF but its still a good sandwich. While in Reading terminal, I tried both the Roast Pork with broccoli rabe and the brisket with hot and sweet peppers. Both sandwiches were good, but not as great as one would think having seen them on tv. The Brisket was not standard BBQ, but more of an Italian take on the southern classic. I liked the flavor, and mixed with some sharp provolone and sweet peppers it was a good meal. The roast pork, which is their famous sandwich was another good offering by DiNics. The meat is succulent and well cut, with great seasoning. The sharp provolone and bitter broccoli rabe gave good contrast to each other for a clever culinary treat. Couple quick complaints. The sandwiches we had were not as full of meat as I would have liked. Not being protein greedy here, just a fact. The ends of the roll were bare and just bread on both sandwiches. Second, the bread is not as good as other breads in the Philly area. Despite these 2 shortcomings and the long wait to get the meal, DiNics is a great place for a bite. If you can grab a seat quickly at the counter, it will take a lot less time than waiting in line. The servers are friendly and nice, and always quick with a joke back at you. In the end, the sandwiches were a solid 6/10 for flavor and quality. But for quantity and service time, the points come off the board. If you really want to try a landmark sandwich, go to DiNic's but be prepared to wait for a bit if you go during a mealtime rush.
