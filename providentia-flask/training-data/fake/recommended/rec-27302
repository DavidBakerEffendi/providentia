Mini pies for dinner??  Damn yes!   My bestie and I have adopted this place like Seinfeld and his diner.... Place is always packed, so just be prepared to wait a bit, though absolutely worth it.  They have baked and fried wheat empanadas corn empanadas, pizza, Greek, broccoli, etc.  My friend loves the hamburger and my fave is the Greek. Oh, and the guacamole!  Simple but delicious, served with plantain chips....it can be very, very filling!  Haven't had the pitcher of sangria, however heard that it's the best.
