The food is excellent in here. It tastes as real home made. The best part about this joint is that they do on site catering i .e they bring the dosa making unit to your place or wherever you want them to come and they prepare the dosas on site i . nice piping hot dosas - you can even watch them being prepared! I definately recommend people to ask for on-site catering.. its really worth it
