I was told the line gets crazy, but we got a table right around normal dinner time, so didn't experience that madness.  The seating arrangement inside is interesting... long communal tables, small 2-seater tables, or at the bar.  It's very cramped, dark, and loud -- maybe it's a New York thing, I don't know. Service isn't very great.  I can't tell who the waiter is, and he doesn't exactly check up on us, so I can't remember who he is.  I'm not terribly picky, but I expect a little more from a place that regards itself in quality. Now onto the food!  Steamed pork belly bun -- AMAZING.  The pork belly is smoked beautifully, with just enough hoisin sauce and well steamed bun.  Good, great, amazing, spectacular.  Liver mousse, a strange dish, but oddly tasty.  It is literally liver paste in perfect mousse form, with bits and pieces of greens and bacon (I think).  The ham plates -- thinly sliced like prosciutto -- AMAZING.  You get a huge round plate of amazing ham and this interesting coffee based sauce. I would love to try the bo ssam one of these days, though it is outrageously expensive.  Which makes me wonder if it's really worth the money, so of course, I want to try it even more.
