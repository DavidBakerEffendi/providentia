Having just moved to the Philly area I craved pizza but didnt know of any good places to go. Myself along with my gf and a couple friends decided to get pizza at Zavino which came highly recommended. Great pizza! Fresh and tasty pizza at a very reasonable price I thought. I ordered the whole wheat fresh mozzarella and basil. It was awesome! The wait and fairly cramped atmosphere Â was definitely worth it.
