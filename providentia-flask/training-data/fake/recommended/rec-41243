Oh, Peaches, how I love thee! This place is really great. My husband and I live in the neighborhood and walk over at least once a month. Typical order: Share the Fried Green Tomato Salad, then Spicy Hot Fried Chicken, grilled broccoli, corn on the cob, collard greens. Two cocktails (usually the Slim Harpo, so GOOD!) and we are happy campers as we walk home, feeling full and a little buzzed (people keep saying the cocktails are weak...maybe they are ordering the wrong drink? The drinks we've ordered are plenty strong.) You won't regret waiting for a table here. It's my favorite place to bring out of town visitors to.
