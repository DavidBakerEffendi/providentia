Unique, classic French eatery in Soho.  We had breakfast and it was outstanding! The egg dishes were zesty and very tasty. The French Toast melted in your mouth. Service was excellent with a flair of French aloofness and efficiency.  Building was an old tannery and had high ceilings and inlay tile floors. I imagined Toulouse Lautrec or Renoir sitting at a table having Absinthe.
