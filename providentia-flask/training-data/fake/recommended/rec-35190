10% off your entire bill with a yelp check-in! Try to remember this because I forgot about it when it came time to pay the bill; whoops. I had the Chicken Pad Woon Sen and I really loved it. It was flavorful and very filling. My friends ordered the chicken green curry and the chicken pad see ew. The pad see ew was a bit too sweet for my liking. The green curry was delicious, a tad sweet and a bit spicy. The over all space of this restaurant has a very cozy feel to it. It is very small and it would be smart to call ahead of time and make a reservation. My table was ready as soon as I got there; and my party and I arrived 15 minutes early. It's not a place where you'd take a group of 15, maybe 4-6 at most.
