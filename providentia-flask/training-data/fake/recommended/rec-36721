This place is just alright in my books.  I had the Oysters which were amazing and Steak Tartar wich was also fabulous, the duck confit was a bit dry and flavorless wich made me sad as I love love love duck confit. They have a great wine and chanpange list but it is a bit pricey.  The staff was nice and very accomadation. I would go back the next time im in NYC, I'm dying to try their brunch.
