Great place to take a date If you're looking to impress someone with a nice dinner this is definitely the spot you're looking for. The atmosphere is top notch with great jazz music and dim lighting. I got the ribeye steak and it was definitely one of the top 5 steaks I've ever had. The food overall was excellent although I wish they brought bread or something to snack on with our beverages. Although it was a bit expensive the price was right for what you get. I'll definitely return to hillstone.
