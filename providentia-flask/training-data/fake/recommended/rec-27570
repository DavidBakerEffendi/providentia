I just moved to Bushburg a few weeks ago, and I think I just found my new favorite neighborhood joint.  Ordered the Bibb Lettuce Salad and the Axl Rosenberg w/ Speck added in for good measure.  The lettuce was green, fresh, crisp, and perfect really.  And the pizza was fantastic.  Rich falvors, nice texture, every single bite was delish--crust and all.  They have this massive wood-burning oven that does the trick--everything made by hand and with tender loving care.  The staff is super chill, the atmosphere is super laid back, and the back patio is the perfect spot to chillax. I see myself going to Roberta's many, many times during my time here in the Bush.
