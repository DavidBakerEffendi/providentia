Everyone needs a neighborhood restaurant where the people know your name, are happy to see you and anticipate what you're hungry for before you even know yourself. For me, that's L'amante. The staff at L'amante take great care of every guest and it's clear that they are well cared for too: the turnover is minimal, so there's a family feel from the hostess, to the bartenders, to the waitstaff and back in the kitchen. The food: in one word, Splendid. We've shared this restaurant with friends who've traveled to Italy and each one has commented on the authenticity of the food. The flavors, the pasta, the sauces -- it's clear that great care is taken with each dish. Must-have: Squash blossoms. It is pricey, but when you're looking to treat yourself and share a wonderful meal with friends and family, L'amante will deliver.
