yeah that's right--five stars and i didn't even eat the food. by far THE most impressive (overwhelmingly so) list of beers i've ever seen in my life.  likewise, our server pretty much knew everything about beer.  like, ever.  recommended some fantastic beers for us.  my friend ended up getting some beer that was like, aged in ancient wood casks that are made from now-extinct trees or some shit.  i'm pretty sure it was made from unicorn tears and stardust.  next time, must try the food.
