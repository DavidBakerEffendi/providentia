Damn near perfect. In each and every way. I had the pleasure of dining at The Little Owl on my 24th birthday in New York City with my sister. Before heading to the Big Apple, I consulted Yelp and found rave reviews for a little place with a similar name. The decor is comfortable and understated. With a healthy dose of natural light, quirky collectibles on the shelf and a staff dressed in jeans, you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. But there's something different about this home. It's the kind of place you can be yourself - heartedly laugh at a friend's joke, MMmm & ahhhh at the delicious food you're eating, and slurp your soup, if you so choose. I had a Fennel & Orange salad and Veal Sliders for my meal. My sister had an amazing roasted chicken. Both of which brought the conversation to a minimum due to the serious noshing (always a good sign at the dinner table, right?). For dessert, I enjoyed the homemade Nutella donuts with a single candle to make a wish for the coming year. Cheers to 24!
