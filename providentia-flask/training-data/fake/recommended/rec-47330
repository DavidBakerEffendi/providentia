Better Bites is located a block away from my office and is quickly becoming my go-to lunch spot. It is a nice change of pace from the other sub, Chinese, and pizza joints in the area. The space is clean, owners are friendly, and the food is fresh and probably the healthiest choice around. Bonus: They have bison & salmon burgers - I haven't tried either of them yet, but co-workers have raved about them.
