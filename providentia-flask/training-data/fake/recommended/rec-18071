Wow this place gets 5 stars in the category of cutsey 15y/o bedroom decor. My girlfriend and I  both got simple 2 egg breakfasts. Wait staff was nice and attentive. Food came out fast but for some reason was not warm. Toast and coffee were both burnt (think charcoal  taste). The $4.50 soy-sage was home made but I would have preferred store bought. Texture was chunky and a bad kind of savory (if you've had a freezer burned boca burger - think of that). Something was off in the taste as well, giving you an after taste that is one step before a gag reflex. I am not a picky eater and typically food gets better as the meal goes on - but that was not the case here.  If you're in the neighborhood there is a Dunkin Donuts down the street, you might be better off.  Did I mention that it looks like a Delia's?
