I went to IndeBlue during Happy Hour.  As another Yelper mentions, Indeblue's Happy Hour is restricted to only those who sit at the bar, which has limited seating.  So for Happy Hour here is sort of exclusive to smaller groups. Food: I thought the food was tastier than food served in regular Indian restaurants.  The food was fusion.  I wasn't a fan of the Spinach Chaat, however, the Naan Pizza with the Tamarind sauce was quite stellar.  The food is higher end than what are served in most other Indian venues. 4/5 Drinks: We only had two types of drinks, and both were delicious.  5/5 Setting: The ambiance was quite beautiful with great romantic lighting.  The venue is a little narrow (rectangular shaped).  Bar is quite small, however, the lighting and the decor overshadows any minor flaws.  5/5 Service:  The service from the waiters and bartender were phenomenal.  Some of the best service I've received in a while from servers.  However, the hostess (Monday evening) can be friendlier and less snappy.  In fact, we were quite satisfied with our experience at IndeBlue until we were about to depart.  It was a rainy evening, therefore, many had left umbrellas.  The hostess had left our umbrellas in a bucket, which mine was all the way underneath the other wet umbrellas.  As we were searching for my umbrella, we noticed the hostess had shoved an umbrella inside another umbrella, causing one of them to break.  In fact, mine was also damaged due to her umbrella handling.  It really was not a busy evening, was that necessary to handle the customers' umbrellas so carelessly?  Servers: 5/5.  Hostess: 1/5
