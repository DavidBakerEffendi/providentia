I love this place so much. Its crowded on the weekends so expect to wait about a 1/2 -1 hour for a table. Â  I come here for 1. Fruit, yogurt, & granola (my favorite!) 2. Sweet potato fries and 3. COFFEE! This is an Aussie-inspired joint so if you've ever been to Sydney, you can certainly appreciate this place and find tim-tams, cadbury chocolate, vegemite (maybe!), and "long black." Sorry, no meat pies or sausage rolls here :(
