We need more places like this in Bayonne. In the past, you always had to go to Hoboken or Downtown JC to eat at a decent place other than pizza joints and Chinese take-out. We are now starting to see more diverse places to eat at around town. The problem is, a lot of people are so used to the "same ol' same ol'" and not wanting to expand their dining options. So places like this face an uphill battle in Bayonne. It is frustrating when you see a new place open, only to have it close within a year. So whenever I come across a place like Volcano, I am happy to give my business as long as the quality is good. Prices here are decent, and I can only base my opinion off of their Bento Box lunches and Pad Thai since that's all I really had. Portions are good for the price, and the Bento Box lunch left me full. Very satisfied and will eventually get around to trying their dinner menu.
