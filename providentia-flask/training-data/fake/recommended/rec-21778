My husband and I are visiting from San Francisco (another great food City) and had this delightful restaurant recommended to us by a good friend that lives in the neighborhood.   Walking in and seeing some of my own cookbooks on the shelf along with the supply of french presses made me feel immediately like I would be in for a treat, and I was. The restaurant was cozy and although had tables close together, you never felt invaded or like you could easily eavesdrop  on your neighbor's conversation.  The low lighting and candles gave everything a perfect warm glow.  The special  touches(fresh wild flowers in the bathroom) along with the friendly and prompt service made you comfortable and feel like you were a guest coming for dinner. Now onto the food -  the toast points with roasted garlic, crispy sage, and nutmeg butter was a delightful surprise that made me just look forward to what else would come.  The cornmeal crusted oysters with their briny sweetness complemented the spinach so perfectly, even a child would eat his or her greens.  After our oysters, the waitress dropped off a little amuse-bouche of salted cod over lentils drizzled with truffle oil.  I wanted an entire meal made of this - it was just mouth watering.  For our main meal,   I had the softshell crab with homemade corn tortillas and salsa and my husband had the scallops.  Both dishes were unique in their flavors and had us both reluctant to even choose a favorite. The portion sizes were perfect rather than insultingly miniscule or hugely wasteful. Everything was just wonderful, and I must admit I haven't been able to say that about a meal out in quite a while.  We have friends and family that live in this neighborhood, so I know we will be guests again on future visits. Thank you to both the front and back of the house for a truly lovely experience :-)
