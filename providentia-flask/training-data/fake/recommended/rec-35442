Definetely a hidden gem. Excellent service, excellent food and a refreshing sangria to boot! I had the Bucatini which was delish and quite filling. There are specials every night so make sure to listen for them. Atmosphere is chic and sofisticated but not over the top. What a great way to start off a night!
