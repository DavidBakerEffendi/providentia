I really like this place something, about an eatery that only does a few things but does them right is just my pace.  I tend to order the meatball smash($8) and a slider($3) everything is juicy and delicious not too saucy the bread they use is soft and fresh holds up to the meatballs. the sliders have to be the cutest thing and are a great way to sample the menu and the salads super yummy!  they make both their cookies and ice cream for the ice cream sandwiches($4)  great place, definitely a stop for anyone coming in to town. super plus they accept credit cards and are open late
