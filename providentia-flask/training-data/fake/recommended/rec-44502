I'm a bit biased since I'm a lover of everything Filipino. However this small and unique restaurant combines some of the best Filipino food and a quaint, cozy atmosphere. Great prices for nyc coupled with an authentic atmosphere make for a great overall experience. I come here often...As should you.
