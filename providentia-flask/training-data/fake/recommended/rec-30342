The burgers are pretty cheap, however they're not as tasty as Burger Joint or even Shake Shack- they were just devoid of flavor and juiciness. The fries tasted good (and had probably been cooked in animal fat- vegetarians be warned) but they were chewy and excessively oily. Nothing wrong with this place, but don't go in expecting anything more than a regular dive bar burger.
