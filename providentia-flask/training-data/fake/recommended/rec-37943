grrr...why can't I give this place 5 stars? I don't know...all I know was the food was really tasty...simple delicious meals that were served way faster than I expected for the kind of place....I had the pork "head" pizza..with pistachios I think....it was really good....but it lacked..I can't say what it was but it just did....maybe some sort of refreshing ingredient...some crisp flavored herb or something...the pistachio was just lost in the pizza...it needed zest or something..I don't know..i had the gnocchi and it was really good too...the little gnocchis just melted in my mouth (not too much flour) and were seasoned just right...our server and the sommelier were also really helpful...also heads up, although i'm reviewing now...last time i was here was 2 or 3 months ago!
