They would not let me in because I was gay and dressed flamboyantly. The bouncer will say otherwise, perhaps b/c me and my group were singing as we walked down the street and he said we were "loud" but he let all of the girls in and said he wouldn't let me in. This is the face of modern homophobia and I will not support it.
