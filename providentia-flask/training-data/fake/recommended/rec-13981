Some places, especially restaurants, are not worth long lines and second chances - but I sure am glad I gave Tia Pol that second chance. Our first attempt at Tia Pol, we were told the wait was around 40 minutes. We stuck it out, sitting on the lonely little bench outside, and chatted until the time has passed, only to be told that it was going to be an additional 25 minutes wait. Pass. The second time, with a smaller party, we had more luck, and were seated promptly after about 40 minutes wait during which we celebrated (? just what were we celebrating?) over some delicious sangria. Our waiter was attentive and explained each dish pretty well. We went for a goat shank, which was one of the daily specials, the pork loin sandwich, chorizo with chocolate, razor clams and the lamb skewers. Personally, the razor clams and the goat shank were my favorites of the night. The broth of the razor clams was flavorful without being too heavy, it was so addictive that we requested bread so we could dip it in bread. HMM heaven. The goat shank was also very tasty - flavorful without being too heavy. The pumpkin puree on the side was a surprising yet very complimentary flavor to the dish. The food was wonderful, but I thought prices were a little steep - service was great, waiters were obviously knowledgeable about their food. Give Tia Pol a chance, or another chance and you won't regret it!
