Have only been here for brunch, so can only vouch for that - but definitely definitely come here for brunch. I came early to beat the brunch rush, but I would wait all day just to eat here if I had to. Fiance had the apple frittata, which I tried and was delish! Sister-in-law and I both had the Eggs Norwegian which was also quite good. The shining star of the brunch menu, which is a must have, are the pancakes. Mum ordered them, and I thought they were going to be ordinary pancakes with some strawberry butter, and berries. Oh no, these are GIANT cakes that have been baked in a pan so they get all browned and crispy on the outside, but are so fluffy and tender on the inside. Loved these so much, I went home and tried to make them myself (including the strawberry butter). If you're in the neighborhood, or looking to try a new brunch place, definitely do not miss out on these pancakes!
