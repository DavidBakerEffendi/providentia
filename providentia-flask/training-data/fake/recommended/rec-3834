Amazing food... horrible service. Â There's always a trade off. Really though... the food was great... the grilled octopus, sheep's milk dumplings, and the rabbit stand out as some of the best food I've had in recent memory. Not getting my club soda or even a refill on my tap water... well, that's another story.
