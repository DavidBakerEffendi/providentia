I have been coming here for the past few years and every time my experience has been great but recently I was very disappointed in the service.  After my sister and I placed our order, the waitress tells us 25 minutes later that neither of our entrees were available. So I decided on another entree and ten minutes later the waitress brings only my side orders (salad & avocado). The waitress then disappeared for some which I became really annoyed, subsequently the owner saw that I was visibly upset and apologized on behalf of the waitress which comes to find out left for the night. Since the waitress didn't relate to the cook my complete order, the owner  offered to give me anything I wanted on the house but after sitting there starving for an hour, my sister and I decided to leave. In addition, the staff appeared unorganized and the establishment gets smaller and smaller. I won't be coming back here anymore.
