Came here for a date: beware you desi dwellers, if you enjoy spicy food, this place is not the place! Regardless, the food wasn't too bad. I got the infamous gnocchi di ricotta. The texture was surprisingly Â very smooth, almost melts in your mouth kind of smooth. Also got the "eggplant involuntari" which was stuffed eggplant lasagna. That was very good too. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. Got really busy after 6, and by really busy, the restaurant was empty just 15 mins before and all of a sudden, people had to wait to get seated. Food was a little expensive but I suppose that's expected from an Italian restaurant! Their wine list is extensive, although since I'm no big fan of wine, I would have likes it if they had a cocktail menu. The service was astounding! Waiters were really nice and that always makes me happy.
