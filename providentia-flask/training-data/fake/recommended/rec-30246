What can i say about Peaches that has not already been said? This place is delicious. I love coming here for breakfast. I have eaten here at dinner but the Sausage omelet is delicious. Also the french toast are to die for. I always get both. My hubby gets the grits and I'm not a fan of grits in general but i sampled them from Peaches and they were good. Might make me rethink my stance. So why not 5 stars you ask? Although the vibe is amazing and the food is delightful the service is lack luster. Are their really good servers at Peaches? Hell yea! But their are really bad ones too. Such a shame because this place is top notch as far as cuisine is concerned. Also it is on the pricier side and when you charge that much the service better be right there along with it IMO. The other issue i have with Peaches is the speed in which they put the food out. I'm all about expeditious service but I'm going to need my food to be fully cooked thanks. A mess to bite into a delicious omelet to have raw egg coat your mouth. I wanted to vomit. This has happened twice. But the last time my hubby & I sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome. She took care of it. So the moral of the story is Peaches = yummy, service = hit & miss, food= good when cooked fully.
