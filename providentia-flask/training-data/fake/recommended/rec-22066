Decor: cool, cozy and pretty big. Service: we had a really sweet Irish girl who was friendly helpful and not in the least bit snooty. Food: The roast NZ venison was beautiful as was it's salsa Verdi on top, not 100% on the glubby dumplings things underneath. I would certainly have it again regardless. Watermelon and feta salad, wow! Who would have thought!? So summery and fresh. Finally the selection of sorbets... Firstly, I found 4 to be a little too many, though my friends couldn't stop eating hers until they were all gone. Each flavor is in an individual pot so it is easy to share. Banana: ok, it's sort of like cooked banana. Peach and lavender: suprising and tasty. Chocolate: oh my goodness! It knocked our socks off and turned us into giggling idiots. Possibly not for the milk chocolate lover, it's approx 75% dark and has more 'happiness' in it than any Cadbury Flake commercial. I have a feeling I may become a Public Chocolate Sorbet Junky. I just need people to help with the 3 other pots each time as one shot of pure happiness is enough.
