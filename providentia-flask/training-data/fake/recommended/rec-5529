This Northern Liberties hangout spot just drips cool. You can't help but like a mostly outdoor space designed for just hanging out and drinking with your friends. the layout is rows of picnic tables with mostly no covering. It's great for summer and fall nights. Beers come in half liter and full liter sizes, but there's no discount for the larger size. The food menu is small consisting of mostly German fare (brats, pretzel, etc). It's not bad, but the beer is the real star. Getting bored sitting around? Try some free ping pong. People are pretty friendly, and will let you in 2v2. Still not sure how I feel about the unisex washrooms, but they were cleaner than I expected. It's just a really mellow spot to lose track of time at.
