After hearing all the rave reviews for Umami Burger, some friends and I decided to come here for dinner last night. Being opening week, it was understandably busy, and they quoted a 1.5 hr wait to my friend. Their waiting system is pretty decent, which allows you to wander off while you wait. However, the 1.5 hour wait turned into a 2.5 hour wait (well, we were a table of 9), by which time we were all starving. Once we were seated, a waitress stopped by to explain the menu, how the burger is made, and to explain some of the drinks. I really wanted to try the new Duck Burger, but they apparently did not have anymore at the time. Boo! I settled for Â the truffle fries and a truffle burger ($12.50). I was also able to try my friend's manly fries and his manly burger. The wait for our food took a while, as I assume they wanted everyone's burger out at the same time. The first bite into the burger was so deliciously heavenly, that I immediately gobbled it all up. Definitely very flavorful, and the burger was surprisingly filling! We were all full after the meal. The truffle fries were good, but nothing terrible special.There was truffle cheese only on the top, so the bottom fries were regular plain fries. They did bring out some sauces to dip (ranch, truffle, and a chipotle sauce), which was nice. I liked the manly burger, but I definitely prefer the truffle burger. The manly fries were also pretty good. The service here is pretty good as well. I will definitely be back to try the duck burger, hopefully with a smaller group for a shorter wait. One of the best burgers I've ever had!
