Amazing place! Very busy for breakfast so I recommend calling ahead! I had blueberry pancakes and my family had a sandwich and omelet. All of the food was absolutely delicious! Fun atmosphere and fun people! We went at the very beginning of January and it was nice to get out of the stereotypical New York Times Square hustle and bustle restaurants!
