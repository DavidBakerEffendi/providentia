This is one of my favorite Stephen Starr restaurants in Philadelphia. It is affordable compare to others and is family-style so the portions are larger and you're able to try more things from the menu! I've been here for dinner a couple of times and my favorite dish is the Crispy Calamari salad. The dressing is delicious and there is tons of calamari thrown in, which makes it worth the price. My friends tend to enjoy the Grilled Thai Chicken Skewers. Make sure to save room for dessert! There are always fun options to choose from. My fave: the peanut butter and jelly ice cream sandwich! This restaurant--like all Stephen Starr restaurants-- has a great atmosphere.
