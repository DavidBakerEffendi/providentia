C'mon people - relax. This is a good pizza, but it is not a great pizza.   The pie I brought home was soggy and greasy, and looked like a mess.  Further, the pie was too large for the box they put it in, so they crushed some of the crust to fit it in the box. Then, as I'm looking at the pie, I notice that the mozzarella cheese appears to be a different color and texture in spots.  So, I call up and they confirm that they use a combination of both fresh and regular mozzarella on their pies.  That's weak, and inconsistent with a few things I've read about their pies - it's either a fresh mooz pie or it's not.
