ill be honest, i dont know what consitutes authentic thai cuisine...or is it tai....see, i cant even figure that out.  at the least its inventive thai, and uses very traditional ingrediants in wonderful ways...the chicken pumpkin coconut curry is by far my favorite, and while i do try everyone elses entree (if they let me) i order this same dish everytime, i cannot get enough of it (surprisingly, its not traditional pumpkin, but acorn squash that is served in the dish, and they leave the thick, green skin on the squash, it is just slightly hard, and actually, very, very tasty) it  is ultra chic inside, a little over the top, but that is what kinda makes it great..and the price is so affordable for the quality of great tasting food.  i bring just about everyone who visits to this restaurant, because its a little glamorous and very small, very new york, and the food is wonderful without being over priced and they sell 16 oz. sapporos...that makes me happy
