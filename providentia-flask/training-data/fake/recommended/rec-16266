I've eaten here more times than I can count now. It helps that they're right around the corner (score!) No matter if it's sit-down, delivery, or take out, their crostini and panini have never disappointed. Ever. My current go-to is the bacon panini with pesto/arugula/tomato because it's fairly simple and light. However, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. Everything's just ..awesome. Flavor's always there, bread's perfect, and they're always very filling. Desserts are good too, and if you're in the mood for a sweet drink on a cold day get the nutella hot chocolate. It's a huge mug of everything great in the world. Overall I just LOVELOVELOVE Il Bambino. Would marry it if I could so we could be together forever.
