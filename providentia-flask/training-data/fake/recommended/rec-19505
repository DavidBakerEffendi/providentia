Great authentic Italian BYO. I had homemade linguini with shrimp, garlic, olive oil. Simple yet delicious. My date had the veal which was perfect. The bread was fresh out of the oven with a yummy garlic dipping oil. The wait staff was very nice and friendly. Giorgio came by our table many times and asked about our meal. We went during memorial day weekend on a Sunday (made reservations just in case) and it wasn't too crowded. I would suggest making reservations just in case. Overall, great fresh ingredients and comfortable vibe. You feel like you're in Italy :) (bring cash just in case! when we were there the credit card machine broke down)
