This place is a regular hang out for me. Simply because the food is good and the prices are great. Huge portions and they make killer chicken wings. Daily beer specials. Great Sunday brunch til 2pm. The parking lot can get pretty full when it has its busy spells but it's not overly packed all the time. It is a bar but food is a big part of the place. The patrons don't give the place a typical bar atmosphere making it okay for families to enjoy.
