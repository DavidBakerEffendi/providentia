Cute brunch spot! Came here a couple times for brunch this summer, the outdoor seating is Iovely! I ordered a chicken biscuit which was amazing, and my sister had the prosciutto and spinach omelette which was okay. On another occasion, I was underwhelmed by my burger, so I'd pass on it. They have loose tea here which was great, the coffee was okay. There's a lot of great brunch spots around here, I'd give this one a shot!
