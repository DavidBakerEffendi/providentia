I love this place.  I was in Philly for 3 days and I loved this place so much that I made my friend take me here twice.  The second time I made us hobble here after a half-marathon just so I could drown the pain in my walking appendages in the sweet nectar of beer. Their selection of beer is great, the servers are fast and professional, the layout is fantastic for hanging out/people watching/chatting with strangers.  Their potato pancakes were delicious.   Go check it out.  Is it super-yuppie?  Yes, but so what?  Great beer, decent prices, amazing atmosphere.  The world needs more Frankford Halls.
