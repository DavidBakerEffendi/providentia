Big fan of Balthazar. We strolled in around 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night and the place was hopping. Since it was a 2-hour wait, we opted to have a drink at the bar and wait for a cafe table to open - and it did, in less than 20 minutes. The hostess was super sweet and attentive, as was the bartender. We ordered the brandade de morue and foie gras & chicken liver mousse for appetizers - outstanding. Allow me to state here that these are not items I would ever order on my own, but my husband was trying to make me try new things. Salted cod mixed with mashed potatoes and liver mousse do not sound good to me, however both were positively delicious and well-done, with fantastic presentation. I was so surprised and delighted. For dinner my husband and I split the steak au poivre. Another outstanding item. The French fries were crispy goodness, the spinach on the side perfectly cooked and the steak - delectable. We asked for medium and they delivered it medium rare, but it was perfection. This is on my list of favorite places in NYC.
