I was giving some of my family from out of town the grand tour of NYC when we stumbled upon this place.  We were a group of 7 so we had to wait a while to get seated, but the wait staff and owner were extremely welcoming and worked as quickly as they could to get us situated.   We shared the Traditional Guacamole and the Ceviche Mixto for appetizers, both of which were positively STELLAR!  The guacamole was freshly and simply seasoned while the ceviche was a tastefully tangy with a hint of spice.  I ordered the Sangria Braised Short Ribs for my entree and...I don't even have words.  It's the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.  The meat was sinfully tender and the sangria gave it a hint of sweetness that complemented the overall smokiness.  It was served with a side of sauteed mushrooms and mashed cauliflower that tasted like dreams and fulfilled wishes.  I can't find better descriptors than that. We finished the meal by sharing the Flan, the Tres Leches, and a chocolate/polenta dish, all of which was magical.   Aaaannd now I'm hungry again....
