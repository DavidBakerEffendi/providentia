Like many of the other reviewers, I was compelled to write a review both because the workers here were incredibly nice *and* because it's obvious that they put a ton of care into their food -- which makes it delicious. I'm always a little apprehensive about asian fusion-ish places, but Xe May does it right. I ordered a Super Cub Classic for lunch. The sandwich was tasty, perfectly portioned and came on extremely fresh bread. Crispy outside, soft inside and that distinct homemade taste. If you're a banh mi purist, you may find things to complain about, but this sandwich is delicious -- and at $6, it's a bargain. I also ordered a coconut curry lamb sandwich to go. They asked me how long I'd plan to wait before eating it. When I said a few hours, they offered to keep it disassembled and explained how to reassemble it later to prevent sogginess. Their drinks are good too. I tried the basil limeade soda, which was nice and not overly sweet.
