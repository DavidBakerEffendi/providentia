Had the pleasure of eating dinner here one night, and they do a great thing here. Cozy atmosphere, not too loud but not sleepy at all, great cocktails and fantastic food. I was able to make reservations the night before we wanted to go here, and we were seated in the little heated glass enclosed area in the back of the restaurant. Ordered the kale and squash salad, rabbit meatballs and butternut squash gnudi. Everything is executed well and flavorful. The best things all night were probably the vermouth cocktails, and I definitely recommend trying any of them. The habanero, balsamico and porcini are really, really interesting but definitely delicious. Totally recommend you checking out this spot for a nice little dinner. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
