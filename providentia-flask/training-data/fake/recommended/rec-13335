This is probably my favorite brunch place in the city so far and I've only been here once, which is testament to the amazing experience I had... foodwise. The wait is very long. I waited about 1.5 hours for a table of 2, but I've got to say it was worth it. Being a huge fan of brunch, I don't mind waiting a long time for good food and don't think the restaurant should be dinged for being so popular. My friend and I both ordered the prix-fixe brunch. It's a good deal at $14.50 for a main plus an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink. Being the value-driven consumers we are, we each ordered one of the two alcoholic drinks of choice - Apple Cider Mimosa and Pomegranate Bellini. Both drinks tasted SO good and weren't too strong for 1pm on a Sunday (I was happy to leave without looking like a cherry). Every dish on the menu looked so good! It was a difficult decision, but we ultimately decided on the Salmon Wrapped Poached Eggs and the Pumpkin' Waffles. What I loved about these dishes aside from them being absolutely delicious was that they were very unique options that I haven't seen anywhere else. The poached eggs were cooked just right and the yolk-soaked bread plus the salty smoked salmon was a perfect combination. To this day, I still dream about the Pumpkin' Waffles and I don't even like waffles. The plate was a perfect balance of salty & sweet, and I highly recommend this dish if you like pumpkin/apple pies. YUM! I have been recommending this place to my friends for over a year now and am waiting for the day when I feel like waiting 1-2 hours again. Maybe when the weather gets a little warmer...
