first of all, i loooove eating in restaurants where i can pretend i'm in paris (this place is concealed in velvet drapes and dimly lit chandeliers) whilst listening to hip hot chip music. this place was an unexpected find during an evening walk around rittenhouse square. vegetarian options were very scarce, but i was able to find a special; tomato soup with a mini grilled cheese made of challah bread and goat cheese. unexpectedly good; i hate ordering new foods when i'm grumpy and hungry. but this was a risk worth taking. husband ordered steak frites which he couldn't stop talking about. Â only complaint was the price but, we were on a vacation and it was an anniversary or something so we decided not to be cheapos.
