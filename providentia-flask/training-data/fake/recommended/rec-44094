This was my first time eating burmese food. It is a gem in Philly Chinatown. Many other locations can be loud with brash wait staff. Not at Rangoon. The staff was ever so polite and smiling. The helped us choose a mango salad, fried lotus root, and chicken satay. Some kitchen confusion resulted in a papaya salad as well as a mango salad brought to the table. Then entrees of a cold noodle dish and beef curry. The food was milder than both Thai and Indian, a surprise as the country is smack in between these cultures. I will gladly return to try new dishes at Rangoon.
