I can't believe I haven't reviewed this truck yet - the first time I ordered here was like 5 years ago. And they've been improving ever since! They now accept debit/credit so now I don't have to worry about pulling out cash during the lunch rush, and they're open later than they were when I was a freshman. They also have new items on the menu - today I tried the Enzo's avocado - not as much avocado as I would have liked, but still an awesome crepe nonetheless. My favorites are the Nicole's Southwestern (or Dozer, if you prefer rib meat), and the Mediterranean. For dessert, anything with nutella or honey is awesome. Fresh fruit in a warm crepe is a go. The wait does get a little long, but they are really systematic. If you do wait long, it's not for lack of trying. The truck is just that popular. But it's all worth it, 5$ for a delicious, filling meal.
