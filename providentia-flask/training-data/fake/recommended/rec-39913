I love Yuca Bar! It is my favorite Sunday brunch spot that my friends and i discovered while waiting 45 minutes to get into 7A.  The food at Yuca is so delicious. My favorites are the Crab Cake Benedictos and the Churrasco & Eggs.  The only problem is that the service is very slow, but the food is well worth it, especially if you are hung over!
