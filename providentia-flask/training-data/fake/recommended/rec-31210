I used to really enjoy this place in college but the food really went down hill. I went over there with my boyfriend a few days ago because I remember it was a pretty good place. We had the Calamari, Crab cake appetizer, and a margarita pizza. Everything was pretty mediocre. For what the charge the food is extremely low quality! The pizza is literally a tortia wrap with sauce and cheese sprinkled on... for 13 bucks I think they can do better!
