Quite a remarkable evening.  This was a dinner for my wife and me and our adult children plus significant others.  When I went on line I noticed that they offered to accomodate special parties.  I emailed saying that we were a very small party but would they be able to  provide us with a self-created tasting menu where we might all share.  The response was most agreable. The representative Kim was most affable. Osteria would create anything we wanted.  When we arrived a numerous staff greeted us.  They showed us to our table in the "private" section.  There on the table at each person's place was our menu, pre-printed. ( they also offered to title it in a special way - but that wasn't necessary)   Then came the dinner.  Exceptional on every count.  The lentil soup for all.  Various first courses: a meat board with the most delicate and sweet flavors, grilled octopus, squid and chick peas. coteghino with polenta and egg.  Each dish distinct and rich.  The primi followed: fazzoletti with pork, rigatoni with livers, candele with boar.   We might have finished there.   But the Secondi were to follow.  Rabbit, Lamb, duck, Tuscan fish stew. ( now, I must say, that here was the one flaw. They should have served us the fish stew before the other main courses.  But they did take the time to find some dishes to cover the other courses to keep  them from getting cold while we had the stew. Finally, the flight to the clouds with the choclate flan that exploded its hot fudge center to surround the pistachio gelato. At no moment was there  not someone attending to everything without being asked. Perfect service.  Perfect dinner.
