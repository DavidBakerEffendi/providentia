I stopped into Jimmy's Diner for breakfast on a rainy Saturday morning. I sat at the counter. I was impressed with the service (a fellow with facial hair). The waiter was quick, ready to crack a joke and seemed to know what my order was going to be before I said it. Â  My coffee came with a little doughnut treat. My huevos rancheros was delicious - hearty and just the right size. I will definitely at Jimmy's again.
