I came here for the first time my birthday, based on the recommendation of a couple of my friends. Honestly?  I thought this place was great.  The cornbread came wrapped in waxed paper, piping hot with soft sticks of butter.  Ordered just about every appetizer on the menu and I had the jambalaya for an entree.  By the end, I was totally stuffed!  I had a great time here, the food was good and the drinks were superb.  The waitstaff and bartender were really pleasant and I would call the service exceptional. This place just isn't for meat lovers, my BFF, who is a devout vegetarian, came along and there were enough selections on the menu for her to choose from and not feel left out.
