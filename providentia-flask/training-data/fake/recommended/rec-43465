Nice place....we brought our own wine as that's the way they do it here. The service was fantastic and we got really good recommendations from the server. The Grilled octopus appetizer was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. I had the mixed grill with Sea bass and another fish, both of which were perfectly cooked. My sister had the scallops which were super excellent. So succulent. The rice and potato were good, and the side of broccoli was good.
