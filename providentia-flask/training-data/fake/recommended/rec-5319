Went to dinner here with my wife.  Service was OK. The waitress kept screwing up our orders and it seemed like she didn't really know the menu that well.  The food delivery guy knew more about the food than the waitress.  Food was fantastic. I loved the fusion twist in Indian food.  Wife and I decided that we only go to Indian restaurants that are fusion (Indochinese, Thai-Indian, etc.) because the regular Indian restaurants are not fun and have the standard dishes.  Excellent food. Loved the desert options.
