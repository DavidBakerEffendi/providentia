Second time came here and we're denied a table. The first time we waited as longer than another party but they got the table first and we asked why the hostess told us another 30min after we already waited 45!! Then the second time I had a reservation for 8:00 and came in 8:11 but because I missed the 10 min grace period they gave my table Away! Then the hostess came back to tell me the wait would be half an hour. Instead of accommodating and giving us the next table Â made me think that the hostess is discriminating us because we are different. It was a minute!! It's not fair we are not that type of family to be treated horribly based on our differences is sad.
