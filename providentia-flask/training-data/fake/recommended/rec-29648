You don't go to Little Italy for an unbelievable foodie experience that breaks the boundaries of Italian as you know it.  You go to Little Italy for a cozy Italian meal of generic pasta in a dark little joint served by Italian men under christmas lights that snake the street back and forth. Benito One was a perfect choice for this.  There are bay window tables that you can sit at and people watch.  There's a HUGE portion of food in their pre fixe lunch menu.  They have a great house chianti that's cheap and the service is exceptional.   If you are looking for a joint in the area that fits the bill for a tourist wanting the LIttle Italy experience, this is a great choice.
