So you're a college student. You've got the munchies. Maybe had a little maui, but it's late at night and you don't want to walk too far from Drexel campus. Tucked away on a block including Ed's is Savas. You might walk past it thinking it was just a hole in a wall not worth trying, but you step in and see an array of pizzas on display to tempt even the most skeptical of foodies. Try the sausage pizza. You barely can hold it up as the individual slice is so big that it bend under the weight of the crust. The BBQ chicken is equally as delicious. Forget California Pizza Kitchen! You look to your left. A refrigerator full of beer. All types. You're the true college frat boy and had developed your taste for beer over your many weekends of pong and this is heaven for you after a hard day at the gym. Apparently they have more food than just pizza. You'll have to take a look at the menu. I never could look past the pizza! Takes forever to deliver, so just make the journey, step in and buy yourself a pie.
