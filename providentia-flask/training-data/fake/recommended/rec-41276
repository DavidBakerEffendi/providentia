My band was rehearsing around the corner so I decided to try this place because of all the good Yelp reviews.  I am now adding yet another 5-star experience!  Everything was perfect, from the greeting at the door, to the prompt seating and service, to the great ramen.  I had the miso with vegetable and ground pork, sooo good.  Can't wait to return.
