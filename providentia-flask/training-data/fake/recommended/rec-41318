This place is really cute!  I came here with my bf who complained thoroughly throughout the entire sitting (something about chick food not being satisfying.. haha, men). The bf does make a good point though, don't come here starving thinking that you're gonna pig out on tiny cookies, mini sandwiches and leave satisfied. However if you're craving a little bite, or some cute yummy desserts after lunch or dinner, this is the place to be.  I'm a big tea fanatic so most teas will put a smile on my face, but the choice I went with that day was the jasmine pearls (one of the green teas) which was pretty fantastic.
