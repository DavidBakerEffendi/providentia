God, I love Ardesia. My coworkers and I go here after work often. The patio seating is great because it isn't on a very busy street. I've had the ricotta crostini, the deviled eggs, and the homemade pretzels and all are amazing. I love their cocktails - really cute names and so tasty (and strong). The service is great.
