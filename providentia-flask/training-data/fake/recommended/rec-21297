Gotta love Restaurant Week, without it I may  not have tried Riverpark.  Not located in the most convenient area, the view is pretty.   I convinced hubby to drive in and it turns out  there is parking located in the building and the restaurant will validate your parking up to 3 hours and parking is free!  Great deal for Manhattan. The space is beautiful, modern and elegant without seeming pretentious.  The staff is super friendly, everyone from the hostess to the guy who poured us water.  Great service all around. Appetizers:  Lamb Skewers accompanied by some lovely yogurt sauce and a  bean, cucumber, olive salad. High quality lamb, super tender and tasty.  Cod Croquettes, served with a creamy lemon purée.  The croquettes were incredibly creamy and really good. The purée on its own seemed pretty sweet, almost dessert like, but when paired with the croquettes it added a wonderful freshness to the dish. Entrees: Steak Frites served with fries and a watercress salad.  The skirt steak was pretty perfect, wonderful flavor with the right amount of char. The watercress with horseradish was the perfect accompaniment.  The fries were a little too salty, but cooked well and the aioli dipping sauce was great.  The pork chop over brussels sprout-apple hash and parsnip purée was delicious.  I've never had a pork chop so tender and juicy and the hash went wonderfully with it.  The parsnip purée was very tasty, but I wish there was more of it. Dessert:  Apple Crisp with dried cherries and creme anglaise was heavenly, really some of the best I've ever had.  The molten chocolate cake with salted caramel and espresso ice cream was also very good. Service:  As mentioned above the staff was very friendly and they were just as accommodating.  The meal went at just the right pace, we were never left waiting for anything but at the same time we did not feel rushed. A solid meal + a beautiful space = a great evening.
