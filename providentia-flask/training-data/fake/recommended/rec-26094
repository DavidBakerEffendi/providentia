The oysters were excellent, service attentive and knowledgeable... Would definitely recommend as a good place for a informal meal... Lots of seafood options and a nice clean space with minimal decor... Gives that feeling of being down the shore mixed with a casually refined decadence... well maybe?! try it out...
