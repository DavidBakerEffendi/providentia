After a horrible experience with the Gaslight Brewery next door, my group of teacher friends and I landed here by accident on a Tuesday night to celebrate the end of the school year and the retirement of one of our teachers. We were greeted by the manager (Mario) who welcomed us with open arms and quickly set up about 10 tables for our large group (remember this was all last minute). Sean was our waiter, so patient, charismatic, and helpful! He served all of us with easy and made sure we were happy. So 5 stars for service! The food and drinks were also amazing! I had the calamari and a mudslide and I was happy, my friends had sushi, lobster Mac and cheese, and a few other items and every was very happy. So that's 5 stars for food quality! Lastly I have to say the place is NICE! The inside is beautifully decorated and it also has a rooftop eating area that easily accommodates 100+ people. So five stars for ambiance! Also, casual and a nice place to bring your family or significant other :) We will gladly make this our end of the year spot and as we left Mario (the manager) thanked us for our business and really appreciated having us there! We were so fortunate to find this place and we WILL BE BACK! Thanks Above Restaurant for having us :)
