If I have starved myself of the "fattiest of foods" during the week AND it's cheat day... Well, this is the place where you'll find me. I come here mainly for their special Breakroom Fries. The fries are lathered with a ton of cheese, bacon, bits of pork belly, slices of jalapeño peppers, a sunny side up and guess what, tater tots!!  Thank you for putting this piece of potato in your fries and bringing tater tots back into my life. Amaze balls!! This bowl of deliciousness satiates my hunger every time. I highly recommend the mint lemonade. Warning, it's extremely sweet!!! I love sweet, sugary drinks so it's fine to me. If you want it slightly sweetened, ask for less syrup. The only problem I found was that at times, they would fill up my entire cup with cubes of ice and I can really down* this drink in a few slurps.. You may want to order seconds or may be even thirds. I tried the breakroom burger, it didn't really didn't live up to the hype. I had the burger with the Breakroom fries and it was way too heavy. I wouldn't recommend ordering both orders together because it feels like you're eating the same thing (tons of cheese, egg, bacon). As for the tacos, I ordered the chipotle chicken, pork belly, and of course, the fish tacos. The fish taco is the only one that stood out, so I'll be ordering these my next time around.
