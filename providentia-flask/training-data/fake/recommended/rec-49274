I came here for lunch with the boyfriend not too long ago. I had been dying to try it for a really long time. There were only a couple of people in the restaurant as it was be beginning of lunch service. We were seated and ordered shortly after. I got the Salmon Marrakesh and my boyfriend got the meatball sandwich. After we ordered we were brought some delicious, warm, crusty bread to dip into some olive oil. Our food arrived promptly, and it was amazing! The salmon was seasoned and cooked perfectly, the flavor of the cous cous was incredible, it definitely included saffron, and the chopped salad was seasoned well also. the portion was pretty big for what I was expecting. My boyfriend liked his sandwich too, but noted that it vaguely reminded him of the meatball subs they serve for lunch in elementary school. The service was great when we went, which I was glad about because from some of the reviews it seems like it's ht or miss. I will definitely be back for dinner!
