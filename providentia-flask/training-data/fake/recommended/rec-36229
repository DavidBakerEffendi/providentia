Used to like this overrated place but the service today was so horrible that I will never bring my out of town guests here ever again! It all began in line where at least 2 parties ahead of us left when they got fed up with being ignored by the guy taking the numbers down. when seated it took 1/2 hour for the order to be taken and the place wasnt even packed. Had to ask 3x for my drink, the plate still had grease stuck on from whoever used Â it before and when I asked for a napkin our waiter was on his cellphone saying to hold on (10-15mins later got a napkin). Grimaldi's service is below what is acceptable. Would recommend visiting Lombardi's instead! On a side note: tried the pizza place next door and it is actually better than grimaldis as well! TIP: skip pizza here and walk down to the promenade and get ice cream from Brooklyn Ice Cream factory instead!
