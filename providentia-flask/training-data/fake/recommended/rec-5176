Frankford Hall is my favorite spot in Philly. Anyplace that has vegetarian sausage wins my love in a heartbeat, but Frankford Hall has a lot more going than just that. The beer list is impressive- to be expected- and not being a beer lover myself, I enjoy their selection of ciders. The food menu is big enough to please everyone and it's cooked quickly and delivered to your table with a smile. Weather permitting, the firepit is my favorite spot to relax, but indoors at the high-tops is just as fun. Grab a beer, a Jenga tower, order some food (get the red cabbage side!), and have a great time.
