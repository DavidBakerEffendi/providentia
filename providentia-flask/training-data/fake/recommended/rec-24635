This place was rather disappointing. We had a groupon and so maybe our service can be contributed to the staff thinking we were coupon cutters or something, but there really is no excuse for how inattentive they were. We waited about 20 minutes for our order to be taken- to the annoying point that all tables around us were being served and a fellow patron had to request a server come over to our table since he could see how stir crazy we were getting. I can't even pin point which server was mine since we were interacted with so frequently and never by the same person. The food was mediocre- my boyfriend said it tasted like something he could have found at a hot bar and any of the local bodegas. I did however like the penne vodka- especially the $4 price point! Meh. I've experienced better is right.
