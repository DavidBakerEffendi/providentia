Hai Street Kitchen not only looks, but makes food just like Chipotle as you can choose between either a roll or a bowl, and with various meat/fish/veggie entrees. My boyfriend and I opted for the "zilla" option, which lets you choose two different meat options for an extra charge. We recommend shrimp tempura and tataki salmon for the ultimate sushi experience and if you're willing to shell out get the wasabi guacamole for an extra charge as well. My only complaints about this place are one, there's not many seating options seeing as how the place itself is very small, and two, the prices are so pricey. For two Zilla rolls with guacamole we spent $25! Regardless, it was worth both the drive and the money especially if you're craving for a different sushi experience.
