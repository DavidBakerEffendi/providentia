I've been wanting to go to a Momofuku restaurant for about three years. I'm all the way across the nation, so it was at the top of my list on my first trip to New York. Nowww if you wait this long, you would hope that it would blow your mind. But I think I hyped it up too much in my head, so that when I actually got to come here with friends, it wasn't what I expected. First thing ordered was the steamed pork belly buns. Everyone says you have to try it right? I'm a big bao fan. If I see a new bao place anywhere near me, I have to try it. Soo the Pork Belly in the buns were great, with a nice amount of the fat, but the actual buns didn't seem fresh or soft as I hoped them to be. After eating at Ippudo the day before, and having their heavenly almost like marshmellow cloud steamed buns, I wasn't amazed with Momofuku's buns. They're pretty good, but not at the top of my list. Second thing ordered was a softshell crab salad. I feel like they were being stingy with the amount of soft shell crab pieces given. At least if you're going to be stingy  and pricey about it, make it taste amazing. But it wasn't like that. For the main lunch entree, ordered the rotisserie duck over rice (duck scallion, ssäm sauce, crispy shallot). This was pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. For dessert, ordered the whiskey thai tea cake truffles. Honestly, they can get rid of that. They should have added the crack pie to their menu. I had that at Milkbar, and would definitely eat that again! Yeah I'll come to Milkbar again, but I don't see any need to come to Ssam Bar.
