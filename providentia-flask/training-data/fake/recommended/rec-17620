This is the kind of place I really love in Montclair, small, personal, and high quality. I ate brunch here some time ago and while the menu selection is unique and the food high-quality, the thing I remember best was the COFFEE. Oh. My. God. The coffee is out of this world. I was told it's a blend of Jamaican Blue Mountain and other roasts. Whatever is in it, it's magical. I asked to buy some as he does bag and sell the blend, but he was sold out and I doubt he's able to keep it in stock for long. As a side note, I also purchased a bottle of jalepeno maple syrup there, so if you're into food oddities and uniquely spicy items, definitely give this place a look. *NOTE* I recently tried to return to Saveur Creole but found to my great disappointment that their hours have changed and they no longer serve breakfast. If the owner sees this I ask that he reconsider this, or at least open for brunch on Sundays. I would spread the word.
