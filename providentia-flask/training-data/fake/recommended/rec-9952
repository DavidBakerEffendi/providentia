I just had lunch at Room Service with my friend Lisa.  I saw the reviews online and had to pay a visit.  The decor is really nice.  It's way too nice for Hell's Kitchen thats for sure.   Their lunch special is a steal!  $6.90 for an app, entree, and rice!  Can't go wrong with that.   My friend and I ordered the Red Curry with Chicken, the Pad Kee Mao with Chicken.  For apps we had the Spring Rolls and the Vegetable Dumplings.  The food was pretty good.  Decent portions too.  The noodles in the Pad Kee Mao were a little overcooked for my liking but the flavors were on point.  The Red Curry was delicious.   I wouldnt say it's the best Thai food I've ever had but it was probably the best I've had in Hell's Kitchen (although I haven't been to Bam Real Thai or Wondee Siam).  I was very satisifed. The service was good.   Our total bill was $15.00.   Insane!
