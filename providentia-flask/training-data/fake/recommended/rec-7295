What a great burger. The quality of meat was fantastic, I had the truffle. Our waiter forgot to put our order in so it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food. Once the manager was notified, he came to apologize, they took a percentage off of our bill and gave a us a complimentary dessert. The waiter was awful, the only reason a star was deducted. But Management handled the situation wonderfully. I will go back, and would recommend.
