Great find on the Upper West Side. As a vegetarian I love that they label their dishes as vegetarian on the menu and have a nice variety of them. I got the homemade pasta with broccoli rabe, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes, which was delicious. Portions are moderate, so better to share an appetizer first, and overall prices were very reasonable. The decor was first-rate, a beautiful light-filled space that reminded me of my last visit to the Greek islands. There's also a huge downstairs area that would be great for a private party or a big group. Our server was friendly, and kept our water glasses filled constantly. There are few Greek places on the UWS and this one was excellent. I will definitely be coming back.
