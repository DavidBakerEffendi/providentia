Really solid brick oven pizza spot in this neighborhood. Good drinks and great cozy, romantic atmosphere. My roommate and I had the artichoke and smoked pancetta pizza which was our favorite. We also had the Anchovy pizza, which was definitely not your typical pizza, but was really good. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly and even though there was a 30 min wait to be seated there was plenty of space at the bar to sit and have a drink beforehand.
