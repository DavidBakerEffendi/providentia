My friends and I came here after US open. We wanted to find somewhere close to penn station to catch the train back to Jersey later but many restaurants around are known to be very touristy and pricey. So we decided to walk a bit further to hell's kitchen area and we found Tavola. It was a friday night and they were offering happy hour specials. All wine by the glass is half price!!! As a wine person this is just amazing and I immediately liked the place!! If you love pasta, you have to get their pappardelle! Trust me you won't get disappointed! I would certainly come here again next time I'm in the city!!
