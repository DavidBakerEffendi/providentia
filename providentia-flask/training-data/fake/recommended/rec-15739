Love this place! One of my go-tos for dinner, 2nd dinner, late night snack w/ drinks, whatever. Their tacos are to die for, especially the chorizo taco. You also get a free bowl of chips and salsa (salsa was probably the best/spiciest I've had at any restaurant), but you have to ask for it, and you only get one. They start charging if you ask for another round. Service is pretty great. The first time I went, we had to wait a few minutes for a table so they started us off at the bar. While we were waiting, the bartender accidentally spilled a drink on us, which he immediately apologized for, and he made sure to get us some drinks on the house. Then as we were walking out of the restaurant, the waiter came running out and told us not to leave yet since the bartender wanted to give us free flan to make up for the accident -- this was pretty unnecessary since the spill wasn't even that bad, but hey, I'm not complaining. It was definitely appreciated, and just goes to show that they know how to treat their customers.
