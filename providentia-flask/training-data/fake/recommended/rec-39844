I started coming here when they only had one cart and the combos were $5. Once the halal guys started getting more business they added a second one right across the street which I keep telling people to go to since the line is shorter and the food is the same. I went back a month ago, my go to guy Ramin who's hooked me up by never having to wait in line apparently no longer works there so I had to wait like everyone else. I probably won't be going back as much since the food is only bearable after a night drinking. Everyone that I've brought here has gotten hooked.. they say its like crack. The yogurt sauce is the best and the hot sauce is extremely spicy so lay off if you can't handle it.
