The bread isn't right, the vegetables aren't pickled properly, and the ratios are way, way off. Glance at any of the photos people post, and you'll see that there's way too much carrot. There's also too much mayo, and the cilantro is sometimes just thick stems. As others have noted, the meat is of the lowest possible quality, and it's often packed with gristle. Seriously: before eating here, I'd never finished a meal with a pile of inedible meat on my plate. And this from a person who honestly loves offal, always gets pho with tripe and tendon, loves the pate when it's good, and thinks lengua and tripe are some of the best taco meats. The issue is not the fat content or the texture; the issue is the quality. 2 stars because it's in a wasteland of decent food, and the price is cheap. Congrats on being the best of the worst.
