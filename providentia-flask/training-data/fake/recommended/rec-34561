Went on a Sunday.  Gave my number and waited about 25 minutes for text that our table was available.  Ordered the chicken n waffle, Mac n cheese, chicken sandwich and of course got some free cornbread.  The cornbread was yummy, chicken amazing, waffle was okay.  Mac n cheese, oh mama .  Our waiter "John" was very attentive and took good care of us.  I will be coming back!!!
