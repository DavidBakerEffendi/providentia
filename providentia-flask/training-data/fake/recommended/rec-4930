Came here for Sunday brunch around 1:30 - I called ahead so we got a table for 3 right away but the place was still quite busy so others were waiting 10-15 minutes.  Once we sat down, we waited a while for for a server to come take our orders, but after that we got our food pretty quickly. I got Viva la Revolution french toast which was loaded with fresh strawberries/bananas and chopped pecans - tasty but I couldn't really tell it was challah bread vs regular. One friend got blueberry buttermilk pancakes which also looked good, with lots of fresh fruit in the batter, and the other got a turkey burger which he said was "pretty good" but probably not worth the price.  Overall, a  nice cozy neighborhood spot with a wide range of options for that's not too noisy so you can sit and chat. FYI, if you can't find street parking, there's a small garage around the back where you can park, then walk through a short alley and turn left to get to the pancake house.
