So I looked on yelp and foursquare for a good burger place close to Port Richmond (BF lives there....and this place came up numerous times.... After looking at the pics and reading the reviews I decided to try it out.... Walked in and it's a messy/trendy little dive and the owner was the waitress/cashier and cook. For 8.50$ I had the best burger I have ever eaten in my entire life.....Well....it was in the top 3....and I'm a burger freak. The burger had the bacon, fried egg and cheese on it....and she didn't give me weird looks when I asked her to just leave the bun off of it. It was clearly a burger made by hand...and the bacon was ungodly amazing... I can't wait to eat here again.
