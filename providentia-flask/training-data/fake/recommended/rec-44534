After reading the yelp reviews, I definitely came here for dinner with high expectations but the food was just OK. I had the coffee brined pork tenderloin, which was tender but nothing that really wow-ed me. For dessert, we ordered the spumoni sundae and I'm a fan of spumoni but again, this wasn't anything special. Â I'll cross this off of my to do list of restaurants to try in Chelsea but probably wouldn't come back. FYI, The tables are pretty close together and it gets pretty loud.. so instead of talking, you're pretty much yelling across the table just to have a conversation... I wouldn't suggest going here on a date.
