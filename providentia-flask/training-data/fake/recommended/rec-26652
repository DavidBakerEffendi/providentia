The food was great. The place was beautiful. Â But the service was awful. The waiter was inattentive throughout the meal, and changed shift towards the end of our meal. We asked for water after we paid the check with tip, and the lady server looked at us and ignored us the first time. After waving her down the second time (10min later) she ran to the table and screamed: "you gotta give me a chance. I'm servicing all these tables!!!" All I wanted was water. I felt like I was trespassing in her house and she wanted to shoo me out!! We will never return. Too bad since the food was actually good. :(
