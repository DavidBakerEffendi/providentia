Have to give credit where credit is due.  Started going to ECR on a much more frequent basis since Sept. 2011, and there is no question that the service and food quality has been far more consistent in highly positive ways.  Also, I discovered the Pig Wings and the house-made jalapeno poppers, both of which I think I'm addicted to.  And a very satisfying beer selection; not the longest beer list, but what they do have is quality, and they have something for everyone, so that's always a positive.
