They fry chicken very, very well. The result: bone-in, tender, juicy pieces coated in a crispy, flavorful batter seasoned with black pepper and, I believe, celery salt. Were I really hungry I could probably have polished off two three-piece orders, but one was enough. Besides the chicken, my side of broccoli was unimpressive: wet, salty, with too many chunks of garlic stuck to it. Other pros: some very delicious hot sauce on the table, sort of reminiscent of Frank's Red Hot combined with a sweet barbecue flavor. Also, the servers are terrifically attractive. And the iced tea is nice. Other cons: The terrifically attractive servers did not bring us any water refills, which would have been great given the spicy food we were inhaling. Also, the hot chicken entree comes with Â a pretty boring single slice of white bread underneath it. I ate it as a consolation prize because I was sad there was no more chicken. I will go back, and I will order more chicken.
