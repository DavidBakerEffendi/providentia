I went here at 12 AM in need of beer after checking in to a hotel a few feet away.  Stumbled unknowingly into this place which surprised me with its selection of  fine Belgian beers. Lovely.  Had one beer and went on to the next place to get food because the kitchen had just closed. Came back the next day out of convenience for lunch and ordered a burger with Brie, fries and a pint of the house brew- Cuvee BXL, an amber ale brewed with curacao orange peel and coriander. Really enjoyed the burger and fries, LOVED  the beer and had an overall pleasant experience. I would say that this place is meant for small groups of 4 or less to eat and talk over a few beers but not conducive for socializing with others.  I would go back if I am in the area.
