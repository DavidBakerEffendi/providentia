Even though Becco is known for their amazing pasta prix fixe, we decided to eat a little lighter post-theatre. First off, the service was phenomenal.  Leighton made sure that we were taken care of at every turn.  Our bartender also took very good care of us.  The initial pour of my Manhattan was about 2 millimeters short (honestly, no big deal), and although it was fine, about a minute after the Manhattan was poured the bartender was out from behind the bar, muttering "not on my watch" as he topped off the Manhattan.  It was a wonderful show of top-notch service.   We started off with one of the specials, Smoked mozzarella burrata with broccoli rabe on Tuscan bread.  It was delicious - and after having a piece of Tuscan bread all by itself, I could see why it was the foundation of the starter.  Wonderful, chewy and crisped on the outside...yum! Next we enjoyed the pomegranate salad (it was one of those nights where ALL the specials sounded good, so that's what we went with) and while it was lovely, it didn't really overly excite the mouth.   For our entree we chose the grilled swordfish in a tomato-ey sauce that was fantastic.  We actually split everything and the swordfish came out on two plates - the portion was large enough to fill both of us and we were glad that we'd split it.  Great texture on the grilled fish, it was up there with the best swordfish I've had recently.
