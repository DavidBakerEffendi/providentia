I really enjoyed Wafa's and so did my best friend!  The food was flavorful and plentiful.  I will definitely return.   The restaurant itself was clean and the byob was great (liquor store next door).  It was affordable and the staff was friendly and accommodating.  I cannot wait to go back!!!  You must try it.
