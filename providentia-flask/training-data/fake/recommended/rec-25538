Had the brunch with my family I had one of the Benedict's which is currently escaping me. Awesome!  Four different dishes, hash, pancakes and an ommlette all excellent.  I'd probably go with the frites over homefries as they were just average.  They still have to get beer temperatures right though.  I know you want to serve some beers a little warmer but I think they are in the high 50s or maybe even 60 degrees F.  Shoot for 52-55 and put the 'Gansett at about 35.
