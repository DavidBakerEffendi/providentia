Visited the restaurant today. Was a little skeptical because of the initial greeting- seemed they were not used to African American diners. I'm glad to say I was wrong.... The meal was excellent, waiter was very attentive. Â I had the Carolina Grits (with ham, sausage and cheddar cheese)..YUMMM I would definitely return and recommend to others.
