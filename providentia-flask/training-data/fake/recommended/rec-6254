This is a great restaurant.  Unfortunately I haven't had the occasion to venture to Vermont of late, but the next time I do go to the Green Mountain state, Simon Pearce will be one of my first stops. This lovely restaurant is situated right on the waterfront, and we were fortunate enough to get a table with excellent views.  The service was attentive without being overbearing.  The meal was wonderful.  The Vermont cheddar soup is indeed phenomenal, and the entrees are nothing to sneeze at either.  But the highlight of the meal was the creme brulee for dessert - our waitress caramelized it tableside with one of those miniature blowtorches. It's a lovely dining experience.  Don't forget to pick up a hand blown glass vase on your way out!
