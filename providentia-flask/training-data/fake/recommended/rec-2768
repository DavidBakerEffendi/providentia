I really don't know what the hype is about Hoagie Haven. Went in for a late night bite with some friends and was very disappointed. We ordered a foot long buffalo chicken hoagie. They used whole fried chicken tenders which wasn't what I was expecting-- I thought we'd get some kind of unbreaded chicken either shredded or chopped-- but that was alright. The bread to chicken ratio was very off. There was entirely too much bread and maybe three chicken tenders. The person who made our hoagie also slathered on entirely too much ranch and not enough buffalo sauce so it was like eating a ranch soaked piece of bread. The only saving grace for this place was that the service was speedy and the servers very friendly. If you're in the Princeton area and need a hoagie just go to Wawa.
