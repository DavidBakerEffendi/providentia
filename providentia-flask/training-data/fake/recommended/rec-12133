A nice little surprise down in Old City. Loved their cocktails, delicious sushi and Japanese with some new twists. Staff (owners?) made us feel very well taken-care of, and as a bonus, there are a few outdoor tables, not so common for Asian restaurants, that make for great people-watching on a nice night.
