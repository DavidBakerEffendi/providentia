Contrary to Mikey, I loved Essex Grand Buffet and didn't want to leave!  Seven plates later, I found almost all the dishes to be fresh, the waitstaff helpful.  Their Shui Mai and standard dumplings are to die for, their soup amazing.  I was expecting to be charged twice as much as I was! My friend's kid is 9 years old - says this is his favorite restaurant.  Now it's mine as well.
