Best dining experience ever.. especially before my second time catching Sleep No More. Waiters and staff stay in character ( It took me  a few minutes to catch on...lol) and service is top notch. We mingled with Elizabeth, Alexander,Margaret and our server Edward went above and beyond. Even the bread and honey butter is worth five stars! We had the beef and ale pie and sorbet for dessert. Everything was outstanding and if you win the lottery.. you may get  a free drink or a one on one interaction with the staff.. all I"m saying is you may get a phone call!!! A beautiful dining experience.. think Great Gatsy, a bit of The Shining and  whole lot of fun!
