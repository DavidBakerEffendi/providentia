Zahav is amazing. Let me start with... I rarely write reviews. My spouse and I recently visited them for dinner Friday evening. It was definitely the best middle eastern food I've ever had. And my spouse, who frequently travels abroad and TO the middle east, agreed. The flavors and drinks were in such strong contrast to one another, each course was a roller coaster of new sensations Just go, get the humus, do a few mezze(the cheese n peaches rock), shipudim(chicken was great!), and finish with a couple desserts. If it sounds interesting but you've never tried it, just go for it! Throw in a couple drinks each, and end up with a ~$150 tab after tip. Obviously this is an "every night" place to eat due to cost, but it's so.. so worth it. We plan on going again soon!
