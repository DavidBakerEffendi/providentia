After seeing them on Throwdown with Bobby Flay, I knew I had to make a visit when I was in NY. Yes, it's true. The BLUEBERRY PANCAKES are INCREDIBLE! Anddd the MAPLE BUTTER that comes with them are INCREDIBLE! The maple butter itself is to die for! But the one thing that probably doesn't get enough attention here is their HOT BUTTERED CIDER....which is, you guessed it, INCREDIBLEEE!! Cider mixed with their maple butter?! OMG YES. MUST! You can also opt to add rum to your cider, if you're feeling dangerous at brunch. :) On my vacay in NY we went back two days in a row just to get their buttered cider to-go. Their servers, who although were relatively nice to us, generally did not seem at all happy to be there (hence the missing 5th star). Expect a wait, but the pancakes & maple butter & cider are well worth it.
