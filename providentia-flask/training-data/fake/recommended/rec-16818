The beer selection is constantly rotating, and the person choosing them has excellent taste. The menu rotates regularly too. I don't get to go that often due to its location, and every time I do there are new things to try. They really know their way around a deep-fryer. I recommend the okra if you see it on the menu or as a special. They also make my absolute favorite veggie "burger" in the whole city. It always tastes like it came off of someone's backyard grill, and is made out of lots of wholesome ingredients. Service can range from average to molasses-slow in the dining room, but the bartenders are always on top of their area, and generally awesome in many ways. If I somehow was forced to live in this neighborhood, Memphis Taproom would be the thing that would make it tolerable.
