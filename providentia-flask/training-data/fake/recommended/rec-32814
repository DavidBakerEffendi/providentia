Barbuto was one of if not the best meal I have had in the City. Every meal from appetizer, main course and dessert was fabulous. The tonno tuna tar tar was so fresh and clean with subtle spice. the bucatini carbonara was incredible. The apple tart dessert with the home made gellato was excellent. Their signature dish is the roast chicken with herbs. It was so juicy and tender. the atmosphere was very cool being in what used to be a old car garage. the bar is good for after work drinks. I have been to many places around the globe and Barbuto stands out in the top 5.
