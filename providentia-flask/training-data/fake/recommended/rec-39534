I went here with my mom and sister expecting a really good meal as all the reviews were pretty high. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in Hearth as our food was mediocre and the prices were quite high. Our server also completely forgot about us and we had to keep calling her over to clean up/ refill drinks. I ordered a salad and the halibut, which was very fresh, but I could've gotten the same quality somewhere else for cheaper. I probably won't return here unless for happy hour.
