Best cheesesteak in Philly. I usually get provo and wiz with but i've had other variations and Philips is consistently the best cheesesteak around. Forget Genos, Pats and Jims, they are mediocre. Steve's is good, but Philips is the best in the area (thought i'd say it one more time) Oh and one more thing, they're POLITE and COOL people. Unlike the guys at some other places (who i will not name) that have come close to getting smacked in the face with a baguette.
