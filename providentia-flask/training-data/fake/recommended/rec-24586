Soup Spot has me hooked because of three reasons: - Great tasting soups - Menu changes daily (variety) - Good pricing My favorites are the Lobster Bisque, Thai Chicken Coconut Curry and Jambalaya.  Each order comes with an apple and a piece of bread.  Soup prices range from $4.50-5.50 which is worth it.  They also serve half sandwiches that you can combo with your order.  However, the sandwiches are nothing special and very limited in selection - if you come to Soup Spot, it's only for the soup. Tips:  Get the large size soup because it's only $1 extra and you'll get fairly more.  For lunch, go before 12pm to avoid the line which can snake outside the door.  Tiny place with no seats - takeout only.
