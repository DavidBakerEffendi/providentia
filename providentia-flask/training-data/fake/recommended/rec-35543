Got meets and cheese plate - was awful! Crackers were moist, bread was not fresh. Don't even get me started on the waitress. We got no attention. Her hands were shaking and eyes looked glassy. She would sit down and attempt to talk to the people sitting down asking for money - what?! Wait I forgot to add that I got a massive food poisoning out of it as well. I guess that's one way to lose 5lbs. Stay away! Save yourself time and go to pizzeria right next door.
