The first time I went to this truck I was somberly walking out of beury hall after getting my chemistry exam. I needed to eat my feelings. I looked up and saw this glorious french food truck. The Creperie? In my mind crepes me one thing, NUTELLA. From that moment on, I was hooked. I must admit I have only had sweet crepes from this truck. Every time I would tell myself I was going to get a savory crepe. I did the irresponsible, unhealthy sweet crepe meal option. First off these crepes are huge, larger than some slices of pizza. They are stuffed with deliciousness. Seriously, whatever you want they will make it for you. The special ones are pretty delicious too. My personal favorite is nutella, peanut butter, and banana. Service is always fairly quick and friendly. They have combos of a sweet or savory crepe with a drink for $4 or $5 dollars, respectively. BONUS POINTS for being one of the only food trucks on campus open until 8pm.
