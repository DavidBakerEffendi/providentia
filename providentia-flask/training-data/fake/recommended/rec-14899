I have been here twice and everything was great both times! Best bar in the city. I went both times with my best friend and the first time, I had a lot of wine, Chardonnay, which was good. Met some cute guys too. The second time, last night, I had a couple of amaretto sours and a couple of glasses of reisling. The prices were a little high, especially for the wine...$8.80 per glass. My friend and I shared vegan pulled pork nachos with no sour cream and no cheese, and I didn't even miss the dairy and meat. (My friend is vegan so I eat vegan when I'm out with her.) We both met a guy we hit it off with too! (Tip: ask for Ritchie's vegan wings...haven't had em yet but they're supposed to be good, coming from the upstairs manager.) Enjoy! :)
