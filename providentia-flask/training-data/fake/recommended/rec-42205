I don't really understand the draw for Rose Water.  Let me preface this by saying that I've never been there for brunch--which seems to be its main draw--but I have been there for dinner.  The menu, while seasonal and farm-to-table and all that shit, is far too limited, the portions are way too small, and the prices are way too high.   There are so many great restaurants in Park Slope.  You can skip this one.
