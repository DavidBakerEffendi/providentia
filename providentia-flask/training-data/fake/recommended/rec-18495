Pros: Location, night owl friendly hours, adequate pricing, and the veggie tacos are filled to burst with food. Con: When I went for the first time this employee wouldn't relent in harassing this young lady ordering out who was ordering out. Verdict: 4/5 Reasoning: While ladies getting unwanted attention is nothing new, it's a shame such a great place has to have this kind of issue. Ladies, you have been advised.
