Love going to the La Petite France with my friends or just by myself.A very quaint, small Relaxing Cafe.Tried their Chocolate, Plain and Raspberry croissants,the Raspberry Definitely my Favourite.The macaroons are Good.Was looking for a Vegetarian type sandwich and the young lady, mentioned she was a pescovegatarian& Recommended a pesto, swiss cheese w/lettuce, shredded carrots and tomatoes was DELICIOUS!Tried the Savory crepes and Berries Chocolate my Favourite. The Manager and the Entire Staff are Friendly and NICE especially when it Seems so Busy and Hectic.I heard from someone the manager previously had it Another location, Glad it's in West Hartford center.Looking Forward for Jazz Night!
