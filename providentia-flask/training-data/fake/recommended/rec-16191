Oh PENELOPE! WHY DO YOU TEASE ME SO? What an amazing brunch spot! Food is amazing, decor is SO cute, people are so friendly BUT WHY WHY WHY WHY must your wait be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long? It hurts so much that I can't go here on a weekly basis because I will either have to wake up at 8am or anticipate an hour and half wait to be seated. This is the best brunch spot in all of Murray Hill and because of it's small and petite decor, there is not that much room to fill and serve people here fast enough to keep the line moving. Despite the ridiculously long wait, you always come out of Penelope very satisfied. Â Their food tastes fresh and healthy and DELICIOUS at the same time. Since I've endured the wait several times to be here, I have ordered a many number of things, ALL which were delicious! My favorite being the Pumpkin Waffles hands down for brunch and the nice chicken meatballs sandwich for lunch. Go here at least once. You'll want to come back!
