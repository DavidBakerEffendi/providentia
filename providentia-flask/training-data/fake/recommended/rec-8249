Family run atmosphere (including very well mannerd kids), waitstaff was amazing, never suffocated me while i was eating and at the same time i had all my questions and comments heard and answered. Open, Large area, very inesxpensive, HUGE portions on plates(Leftovers! yum!), good spice kick, and a very awesome carrot/yogurt secret sauce they make for spice wimps like me :) ... and by far the best indian food in Vermont!
