Thank god! This place is exactly what Point Breeze needed and it does not disappoint. I almost burst into song when I walked in here the other night. It was like I could finally feel good about owning a house in this neighborhood where, previously the only bar had a big sign out front reminding you that "'n'o" drugs are allowed. Anyway back to my new favorite place ever...food was delicious, huge portions, cute take out boxes, beer selection a little much for me but that's just me. Maybe next time I'll ask for a recommendation. Friendly staff, friendly patrons. This place rules.
