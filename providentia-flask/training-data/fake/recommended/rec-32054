Went here for restaurant week at 8pm on a Friday night. At first my date and I were a little hesitant as the tables are extremely close together and therefore the restaurant is very loud, but now I know to come back at a less busy time. This restaurant is fantastic. We BYOBd and started off with bruchetta and caesar salad. My bruchetta was wood fired and came in 3 different styles-a cheesy, pesto slice, a margherita slice, and a cheesy mushroom slice. it was fantastic and savory. the cheesy pesto one was my favorite-id consider getting that for all 3 next time! My date had the short rib gnocchi and i had the scallops risotto. we split them both. The short rib gnocchi was amazing. So much flavor from the broccoli rabe and Locatelli and the ricotta gnoccis were absolutely delightful and you could tell they were hand made. There was just enough truffle oil in the sauce to make my heart melt and the short rib meat was cooked to perfection. The scallops were pan seared and served over a cheesy pea and mushroom risotto that i couldn't get enough of. i couldn't see the mushrooms in there but i tasted the truffle oil and was again in heaven. for dessert i had a strawberry basil gelato that they make in house, it was again, amazing and my dates cheesecake came with a caramel drizzle and a nut crunch sprinkled on top. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone. service was phenomenal to top it all off. i'll be back
