This restaurant is a very unwelcoming place and the service is terrible. We were very badly treated and we were not able to pay by more than 2 credit cards. I don't know if the owner is aware of the technological progress, however yelling at us was not the best way to address the problem. The food was not even good to offset the very bad service.
