Haven't been here in a long time and wanted to return to try the gnocchi. Food overall pretty decent. Certainly nowhere close to the best Italian in the city but for the prices ok. Gnocchi bolognese was a special and although I make better bolognese sauce, I can't make gnocchi this good. Big deterrent for us was the noise level. Basically wrecked the evening. Will not return because of it, that' s how loud it was.
