It was okay.  I went there for breakfast.  The waitress was not very nice, I said hi and she just stared back at me blankly.  The waiter was cool though, very attentive and friendly.  I got a breakfast special, 2 eggs, potatoes, toast, and orange juice.  All for $6.75, pretty good deal.  Though the food is nothing special.  Its a fairly large cafe so you can bring a big group.  It seems to be a local stops for the business men and women and your local NYU or Cooper Union students. PS: I think they looks 24/hour on the weekends.
