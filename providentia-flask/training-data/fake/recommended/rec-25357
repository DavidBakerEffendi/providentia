We had a thoroughly pleasant experience at Rosa Blanca.   We ordered the $35 Para La Familia tasting menu so we could try lots of different things.  The best guacamole ever, with house-roasted pineapple.  A delicious, ultra-fresh frisee salad.  Fresh-baked cheese bread with guava butter.   Maybe a bit more fried food than was absolutely necessary, with both ham and bacalao croquettes, the latter served with a garlic aioli that would kill a vampire at 20 paces.  Two main dishes (!), a shrimp and rice combo and the best ropa vieja I've ever had. The shrimp themselves were so sweet and fresh, it made up for the fact that the dish was not especially interesting.   I might have forgotten one or two things, it felt as if the food would never stop flowing from the kitchen.  A spectacular custard dessert with layers of passion fruit and mango, and a mango sorbet.  We left with a shopping bag of food-- probably two more meals.  Service was excellent, though I don't know that the servers need to wear tuxedos in a casual, diner-style restaurant.  We will definitely return.
