I've been dining at little fish since it was a secret.  unfortunately, such a good thing was bound to catch on some time.  although i think over the last decade the portions have gotten a little smaller and the prices a little higher - its still one of my favorite places to eat. BYOB makes it more reasonable.  the new location is great - hasn't lost the feeling that you are in someone's home and they are cooking dinner just for you (which they basically are).  i even took my husband while we were dating who "did not do fish" and its now one of his favorites too!  we spend so many special occasions at little fish, its like the staff knows us.  its perfectly intimate and romantic.  service is always friendly and efficient.  best mussles in the world.  so grateful for this place!
