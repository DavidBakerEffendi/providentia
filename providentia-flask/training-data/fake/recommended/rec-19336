This is our favorite place to go for brunch, hands-down. Just a few highlights: The Oj is fresh and Sabrina's if BYOB, so mimosas... The specials are always fun and delicious, plus there is always a vegan option Sometimes in the winter, they bring hot chocolate out for everyone waiting outside. My favorite breakfast dish is always the eggs benedict, its perfectly runny and absolutely delicious. My husband loves the turkey bacon egg sandwich. The only downside is the wait on weekends, but they have call-ahead so its quite manageable. Â This is a wonderful place to go with out of town friends or family, or really any time ever.
