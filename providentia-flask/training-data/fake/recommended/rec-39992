We were exploring the city in the afternoon before going to a concert and walked past this building.  The place just looked historic, and being in a city full of history, we were intrigued and went inside.  The decor was very interesting and the inside had a very neat feel to it.   The bar had a good selection of draught beer.  Being from Alabama and exploring a new part of the country, I wanted to try some local beer.  The bartenders were knowledgable about their beer, and I was pleased with the selection they recommended. My girlfriend also wanted a recommendation of a drink, and had something suggested by a bartender featuring local gin made somewhere in the area.  She enjoyed her drink as well.   The atmosphere was great, as I was able to easily strike up a conversation with several people around me.   I didn't try the food, but everything else about this place comes highly recommended. I would definitely go back if I find myself in the area again.
