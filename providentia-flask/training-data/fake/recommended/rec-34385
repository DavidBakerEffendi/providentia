Coffee and drinks here are overpriced and OK. The quality of them is really inconsistent. The sandwiches and salads sound good on paper, but are often poorly made. The ingredients are rarely fresh. The salads are extremely overdressed. Worst of all, the rest of the staff are very friendly - the people doing the actual work, but the woman who seemingly manages it or perhaps owns it (older, blonde, short hair in sort of a bob cut) is just incredibly unfriendly and all she does is work the register. I've watched her just stand there and do nothing when her staff obviously could use an extra hand with basic things. It's very saddening for me to see a manager act like that because I feel bad for the employees and as much as I'd like to support them by buying things here, I've decided to no longer do it. Everyone else greets you with a smile, but this lady just has a chip on her shoulder and can't even muster up eye contact during a cash register transaction or even say "Thank You." Unfortunately, this place will probably always be busy because they have wifi and are always catering to the next round of fresh college students who go here until they eventually learn there are a number of other cafes and delis that are appreciate of their business.
