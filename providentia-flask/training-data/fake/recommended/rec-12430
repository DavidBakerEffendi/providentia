I love this place so much! Yes, it's small and yes there is a wait but it's overall a very nice establishment. The staff welcomes regulars and offers helpful menu-decision advice. I came here based off the rave reviews I found here on Yelp and I am super grateful! If you want to avoid waiting, I suggest coming at 8/8:30. Def try the pancakes!! Any flavor will do. Just enjoy a nice meal with your friends/family and chill out. I came here with my friend and we were SUPER excited to try the food. We practically ordered the whole menu! A couple sat next to us and admired our enthusiasm for the food. I simply thought they were amused by our Â first experience there. We were taking a bunch of photos and just constantly talking about how amazing the food would be. Throughout our meal, the wife and I shared polite and fleeting conversation about the amazing pancakes and so on and so forth. They left before my friend and I finished and we said goodbye. At the end of our meal, we asked the waitress for the bill only to find out that the couple that was sitting next to us, had paid for our check!! I was literally dumbstruck and stared in space for a few minutes. I wanted to run outside as fast as I could, try to catch them and give them their money back but they were long gone. Gah, I wanted to cry, rejoice and thank them with all my might. They made my first experience at Clinton St Baking Co absolutely unforgettable!!
