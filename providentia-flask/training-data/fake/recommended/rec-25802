Now that's a giant meatball!   The portion size of all the dishes are pretty hefty but I guess we're supposed to share.  Well, supposed to...  All the dishes were delicious.  I think they have several Italian grandma's back in the kitchen making these.   The place is small and gets full pretty quick so i suggest making reservations.  Even with that we had to wait for a bit.   Service is meh: We had to ask several times for the bottled wine ordered.
