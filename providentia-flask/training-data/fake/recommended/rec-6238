Dinner was nothing special. Chicken sandwich wasn't tasteful with tough bread and average fries. Would have preferred fast food sandwiches over this. Soup was decent and dessert red velvet cake was bland. Place is cute and service was good. Must be a better breakfast place. I'd skip Penelope for lunch or dinner.
