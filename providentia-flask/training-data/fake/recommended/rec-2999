Fare has a calming effect on me after a long week of work.  This is a great, relaxed happy hour spot and is conveniently close to home!  Now that they have a nice selection of tap beers, this has been added to our rotation.  The beer list is well thought out and always has a nice array of styles.   The food is consistently good here as well.  We like the fish tacos and the flatbreads, but ordering them other than during happy hour would burn the wallet for what you get.  Surprisingly, they have a fairly strong brunch menu.  The pancakes (any variety) are excellent.   My only gripes are that the hostesses can be hit-or-miss and the restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis.  They added a lot of reclaimed wood to the bar area to warm up the space, which was successful, but the rest of the place still feels a bit confused.  Great outdoor space here as well.
