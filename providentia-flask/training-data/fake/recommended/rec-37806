I have been here on multiple occasions, and each of my visits was excellent. I took a good friend out for a bite to eat, and Zavino's meat and cheese plate was stacked with some of the best cuts I've had in the city. I was very impressed, so my girlfriend and I decided to have our date night there the next week. She is gluten-free, and our waiter was not only kind enough to offer us gluten-free pizza options, but to let us know where the best GF eateries are located! I would wholeheartedly recommend their selection of Cabernets, meats, and cheeses. I can't wait to visit their new location- I believe they will be opening one near University City this year.
