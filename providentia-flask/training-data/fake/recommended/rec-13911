Two things keep this fabulaous foodie establishment from getting 5 stars. No credit cards taken and the service was average. Prices were a bit high for a breakfast place, but the food was really good. Yes, I was lured in by Bobby Flay's Throwdown episode on Blueberry pancakes. These are not to missed if you have not had them. We also had the breakfast biscuit sandwich. The eggs done perfectly, the biscuit had proper texture and the salsa was not overbearing.
