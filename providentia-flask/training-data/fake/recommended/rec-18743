Popped in on a Friday during the beginning of happy hour, and this review is for the downstairs cellar only. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. He explained the happy hour menu and the wine menu. We got the happy hour red and the happy hour cheese plate and they were both delicious. Can't wait to come back!
