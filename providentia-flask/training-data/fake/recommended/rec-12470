Holy crap this place is awesome. Visited NY from Texas and was looking for a great breakfast spot and decided to come here via Yelp reviews. This place definitely did not disappoint. We made sure we got here very early on a weekday so we didn't have to wait in line. Their blueberry pancakes, really, really, ridiculously good tasting bacon, and their eggs benedict were deeelicious and you must try them now, or you may never forgive yourself...
