Went for brunch on Sunday with a few friends and the food was very good. Staff was also pleasant, and made the experience even better. The drinks are good, and I understand it's a fixed price but the screwdriver did not taste like it had any alcohol. The other drinks were good and you can taste the alcohol in them. I prefer a place to charge more, but make sure that there is enough alcohol in the drinks. Overall, they still get a five star from me and I would definitely go back.
