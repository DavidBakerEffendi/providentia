On vacation in Philadelphia, this famous cheesesteak place was a must-visit for my wife and I.  Unfortunately, we were both very disappointed by both Pat's and Geno's.   We ate at Pat's first, got one with provolone and one with "whiz."  Surprisingly, the whiz was actually better than provolone.  Overall, though, both sandwiches were completely mediocre.  The bread was unremarkable, the meat was tough and flavorless.  The fries were quite soggy.  I was very pumped for this, so the experience was a huge letdown.   With lowered expectations, we next ventured to Geno's.  My wife and I opted to just split a sandwich with "whiz."  Geno's was slightly better, mostly due to somewhat more flavorful steak.  Otherwise, the experience was almost identical.  The steak is cut a bit thicker at Geno's, but the sandwich is similarly mediocre.   Sad fact: I have had better Philly Cheesesteaks at Texadelphia in Texas.  Also, Silver Dinner in Maryland has better cheesesteaks.   Side note:  While at Geno's, they were filming an interview with a guy who was presumably the owner/manager.  My wife and I were sitting behind him, likely on camera.  I literally laughed as the interviewer was asking, "what's your secret to making the best cheesesteak blah blah blah."  I was also prominently drinking a soda from a Pat's cup.  Oops!  I'm a jerk.
