Friends' recommendations for the roast pork were well noted but I went all renegade and got the pulled pork.  J/k.  I went by headlines on the news articles posted up near the countertop.  When I saw the juicy slab of roast beef on the meat slicing board, I was afraid I'd been led astray but the first bite melted away all second thoughts.   When making the sandwiches, they dash them off with a dollop of some sort of oil that probably contains butter because even if you unwrap it within the next 5 mins, the bread is a bit soggy but still exclamation-point good.  Provolone is not the seductively melted type but solid, extra sharp, and the broccoli rabe adds a powerful garlic mush on top of this densely packed footlong.  The pulled pork isn't sauced up with BBQ like I'm used to.  So there it was: soggy bread, unmelted cheese, mushy veggies and unsauced pulled pork.  And what do these things spell?  A time-tested, bewilderingly addictive combo that will have your taste buds begging for more. I finished 3/4 by myself without taking any breaks until I felt the stretch marks on my stomach walls start to boycott my mouth.  If I'd had a friend to share it with, portion size would have been perfect to thoroughly enjoy my brownie from the Flying Monkey afterwards. Do not flee the scary, long-seeming line.  You shall be duly rewarded within 10-15 mins max and have yourself a delicious Fatty McFatterson moment that you fervently hope to revel in again.
