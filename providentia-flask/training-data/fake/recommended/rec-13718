Oh man, this is one good sandwich. I tried the Italian pork sandwich with provolone and the broccoli slaw on it. Dripping with the juice and oil from the pork, I was, at first a tad skeptical of the $8 sandwich. One bite and MMMMM... that's good, flavorful sandwich. Later on, I tried a friend's beef brisket with peppers on it...that's AMAZING. If anything, I would love to go back to that place just for the beef brisket. Slightly overpriced, but definitely worth it. The sandwiches are so big!
