certainly this has been a long awaited opening and we even noticed a few food celebs dining, like the owner of hakkata ton ton.  so that got our hopes up high.  as with any new place there was lots of chaos and delays which is perfectly acceptable to me but that in general should not effect the quality of the food. miso soup with baby yam was excellent.  all the grilled vegetables were great: asparagus, onion, chili peppers, and portobella.  the baracuda was flaky and moist.  the grilled meats were just ok though.  the chicken thigh was decent.  the aussie kobe was surprisingly dry and tough.  the kamameshi rice was a real disappointment - completely bland and not very juicy. that said, nothing really would draw me out of the way here but i'd definitely come back a couple months later after they get all the kinks worked out.  maybe i'd bring a couple of vegan friends here, no kidding, the grilled veggies were that good.  for your info byob until they get a liquor license. the robata chefs are efficient and have good spirit.  they were extraordinarily tolerant of a group of drunken guys (probably right off the path train from hoboken).  in the typical roppongi fashion the servers shout the name of your dish as they deliver it on the end of that wooden paddle.  these guys would shout back some semi-audible obscenities.  couple of times i distinctly heard them bark back in unison "lick my balls!!!", "lick my hairy white balls!!!".  the chef would just smile back and chuckle as if he didn't know what they were saying.  i guess east asians just have that built into their blood, they could give you that big cheshire cat smile while all along saying to themselves "you're such a stupid asshole!!!"
