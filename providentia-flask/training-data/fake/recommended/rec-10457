Yum! This is a cute place with normal Italian fare. It's not gourmet, but I think it's a million times more delicious than the Olive Garden. They bring you a poofy fresh loaf of bread with a dish of olive oil and cracked black pepper to start. The bread is really good, flavored with rosemary and pepper; really chewy and yummy. Cute thing about this place is that the tablecloths are just giant pieces of paper so the servers learn to write their names upside down so they can write their names on the tables for the customers to read. There are two colored crayons sitting on the table so it's fun to doodle while you eat, which deems it a fun atmosphere for children. The portions are generous and they have a decent wine list.
