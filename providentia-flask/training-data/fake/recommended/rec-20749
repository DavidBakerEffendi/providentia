Really really really good pastrami on decent rye bread with just OK coleslaw. Pastrami...just the right amount of fat and spice. Shared a large ($13) sandwich...enough to satisfy the craving...but I so wanted more!. Bread was decent but crust was softer than I'd like. Coleslaw lacked personality. Pickles....tiny little slivers of sour pickles...were tasty but unsatisfying in such tiny pieces. Walkable (about 20 minutes) from Brooklyn Museum/Botanical Gardens. A little further (about 30 minutes) from the Barclay Center.
