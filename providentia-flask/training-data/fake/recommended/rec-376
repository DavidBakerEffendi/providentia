Very decent Thai place. The decor and atmosphere give it a very club/lounge-type feel, so the place is absolutely packed late at night on the weekends. Unfortunately, they only take reservations if you have a large group, and the hostess when we went did not have a great system in place for taking names down...we ended up waiting over an hour for a table for three, but that's probably atypical (we were told the wait would be 30-45 min though). The place is pretty crowded, but that's just a testament to its popularity. The tuna tartare appetizer was amazing; probably the best I've had. The entrees themselves are all fairly interesting and moreover tasted authentically Thai; they're not going to wow you with food you've never tasted before, but the presentation and the quality are generally top-notch. Â I personally had the pad-noh-mai, a spicy saute/curry combo (wasn't as spicy as the menu claimed!), which was pretty good. Also, the cocktails are all pretty unique! Price-wise, definitely on the higher end for Thai food, but still reasonable given the kind of atmosphere they're going for. Overall: very solid and cool place to go for dinner, but a bit unreliable as a destination because of the wait. (Take-out/delivery note: I've also ordered this place on Seamless, and it's definitely not quite as appetizing when it comes in a box. Go to the actual restaurant for the atmosphere!)
