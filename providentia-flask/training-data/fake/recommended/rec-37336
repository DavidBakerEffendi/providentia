This is where I go to be alone and weep silently over a porchetta panini. Am I kidding? You'd probably hope I'm not, mostly for entertainment value. There's nothing I don't like from here, honestly. Even their coffee is great. Oh, you might find me in here, close to closing time, eating tear laced nutella-strawberry crepes. Look for me. I'll be the one covered in cat hair in my "forever alone" zipup.
