Food is excellent, one of the best omelettes I've ever had, hands down (and I really like omelettes) ...and, do not leave without an almond croissant. DO NOT. very lovable, very charming. The only problem was that I added an extra seat to our little table outside, and it unexpectedly fell into oncoming pedestrian traffic before I could sit down. But then again, that was my problem, not Tartines.
