Review 1642. Boy, I feel special. Question: Is a two hour wait really worth all that jazz. Probably Not. Noodle soup is all about the broth and the noodles. If based on those two variables alone, this joint is LETHAL. My pork broth was sooo divine. I licked every last drop out of that bowl like no otha. However, the wait was simply way too long and I would have liked to have more treats in my ramen without having to sell the family cow. Not being cheap here, who me?!! Nah-uh. I'm just so use to ramen or any other noodle soup that comes with heaps of fun stuff- meat, fresh veggies, artificial crab, egg, fish balls and so forth. Otherwise, this place is pretty sweet, especially with the random tourette outbursts from staff. I just love to yell random gibberish- Â love it!
