Came here on a first date with my now-fiancé and fell in love with this tiny hole in the wall. Since then I have come back numerous times and have brought many out-of-towner friends to dinner here--they always love it!!! Everything is great-- from the empanadas to the fried yucca and guacamole. My personal favorites are the spicy chicken, reggaeton, & cuban empanadas. The red sangria is a MUST!! Might possibly be the best sangria in NYC!!   Fresh food and great service. The place may be tiny and the wait might be over 30 minutes at times but it is so worth it!!!
