It was a good time but I definitely wasn't impressed with the food. In my opinion, small plates should be extra delicious, since you're only getting a bite or two... You should finish the dish dying for one more bite... But they were only mildly delicious. Plus, communal dining = not my scene. Cheap wine, tho. And it's extremely "cozy."
