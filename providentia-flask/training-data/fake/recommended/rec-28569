Hu Kitchen is the ideal place to eat. Lots of variety, delicious food and good Â portion size. A little on the pricey side but you pay for organic. I had a garden vegetable medley dish that was like lasagna with marinara sauce but no pasta. The roasted veggies were equally good. I had a absolutely delicious paleo blond brownie and good coffee too. The homemade almond milk is truly bear bones- almonds and milk. Not sweet at all. I highly recommend this place. You will eat well and feel good.
