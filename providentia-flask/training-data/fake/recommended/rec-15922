This place is a great spot for grabbing some delicious brunch. 4.5 stars. The Good: -Challa french toast was extremely good. Had fresh fruit on it as well (bananas, strawberries, blueberries). Highly recommend. -Customer service is friendly and very helpful. -Atmosphere: feels like a small tavern. There were plenty of people inside but it still felt comfortable and "homey". The Bad: -Only real complaint would be the long line but its expected with food this good. Also, the spiced chai could have used a little more flavor. Again, this place serves quality brunch and is definitely a place worth visiting.
