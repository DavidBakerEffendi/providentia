I've been here twice and have no complaints about the establishment. The drinks are priced decently, especially considering I went on a Saturday both times. Also, their food is pretty tasty. The fact they still serve pizza late into the night is such a perk for those who are always hungry and looking to grub on something. Personally, I would suggest their Mia Hamm Pizza. Anything with fried eggs is a winner in my book. When I asked the bartender about food service, she prefaced saying I shouldn't expect much out of the roaming waitress taking food orders. However, whoever was on the floor that night did an awesome job making sure we were served our food and drinks promptly. That's a plus for sure. The space was very spread out, regarding the dining areas. The bar can get a bit crowded though, but at least there are two. I've been here when it was rainy/cold both times so I've been unable to enjoy the patio in the back, but it, too, seems very spacious. You will definitely see me back here especially considering it's one of the better bar/restaurants to hit up in the Montclair area.
