This restaurant is remarkably popular and frequently has more than 30 min wait times for a table.  The flatbreads are really just pizza but what sets them apart are the creative ways they prepare it.  Steer clear of the complex, multi-ingredient flatbreads that they have as specials, the ingredients will just make the delicious flatbreads soggy.  The best menu items are the simple cheese and spice mixtures as toppings for this excellent flatbread and these will cost only half as much.
