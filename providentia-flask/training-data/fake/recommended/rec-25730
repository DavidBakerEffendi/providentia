I know this place probably doesn't need another glowing review, but I just had to share my experience. My friend had a really bad day, administrative problems and a cancelled flight. Remembering all the good reviews of Melograno, I took him here. This was Tues evening, and we snagged the last table. His face literally lit up the minute he put the pasta in his mouth. He ordered some mushroom pasta (forgot the name...), I had the wild boar parpadelle. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was unbelievably good. Not your usual boring red/white sauces. We also shared a pistachio strawberry panna cotta, which was absolutely fantastic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the price...while the food was very very good, it was just a tad overpriced. But if you love Italian food & dessert, run to Melagrano at once!
