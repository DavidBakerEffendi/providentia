Food-Outstanding... But terrible service can't make good food great. Let me start by saying that we made our 6:15 monday night reservation a week in advance, so they should have had our seating well situated... This wasn't just your perfunctory bad server. I mean they took food off of our table while we were eating, spilled spinach on a friends arm (with no apologies mind you) and literally rushed us out from the minute that our reservation began...The real kicker was when the host came and asked us to get up because he needed our table. Â I come from the restaurant industry...I completely understand what it's like to need a table, but I would never treat a customer so poorly. In addition when we were on our way out, there was no one waiting to be seated! Like I said, outstanding food...Get the veal, if you can tolerate the service.
