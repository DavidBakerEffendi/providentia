Absolutely delicious! This place lives up to all the hype. Crispy golden little bites of heaven. My only complaint? Ordered a cup of wonton soup and they tried to pass off their hot and sour soup for it because they were close to closing time and didn't have any wonton left. But I don't care, I came for the dumplings!
