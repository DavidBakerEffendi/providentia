Sweet Chilli in Bayonne is one of the few good things my ex girlfriend contributed to my life. The food is amazing, the chicken and broccoli, fried rice, and sesame chicken are heavenly. I have introduced quite a few of my friends to this place and everyone agrees that it blows away all of the other Thai food favorites that everyone has previously enjoyed even everyone's favorite Thai food favorite Spice in NYC. The staff is great, the owner is a really nice guy, and his family is very accommodating. This is not only my favorite Bayonne restaurant but one of my overall NYC and NJ favorites! Highly recommended! *****
