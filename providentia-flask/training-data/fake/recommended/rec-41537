Il Bambino is alright. The paninis are good, but I find the bread gets very dry and crusty. I live close and have been here a couple of times. Service is always good. Very inviting. However, I am not that big of a panini fan and the menu doesn't have much else. I think waiting in line for this place for weekend brunch is just nuts but that's just me.
