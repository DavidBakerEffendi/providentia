My favorite restaurant in New Haven!  The atmosphere is casually elegant and always bustling -- make sure you have reservations.  Highlights are the homemade butter (they have new flavors all the time!), the cheese plate, the macaroni and cheese...and the wine, oh the wine!   The servers are really friendly and attentive, despite the fact that they're always super busy -- and really knowledgeable about the menu. My last server talked us through the cheese plate like she had made them all herself.  A little on the pricier side, but totally worth it!
