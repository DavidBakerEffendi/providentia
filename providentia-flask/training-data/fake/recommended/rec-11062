Now this is what I'm talking about. Great Vietnamese food. I brought my boss here, who is Vietnamese, and he agreed the food is great and really authentic. Their crispy rolls are awesome. Only place with better crispy rolls is a place called Tu Lan in San Francisco. I could eat here every day. Best broken rice dishes I've ever had. Crispy noodles, vermicelli, coconut drink, yum, yum!
