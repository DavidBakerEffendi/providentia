I ordered grilled salmon with vegetables and my boyfriend ordered a meal consisting of meat (don't remember the exact name). The staff was really friendly. The waiter who was assigned to us forgot our order but honestly there was a good amount of clientele therefore we were understanding. He was nice and brought us complimentary tuna salad which I have to say was pretty darn good. They are also very generous with the amount of meat that is served with each meal. My salmon fillet was huge compared to other restaurants. The mashed potatoes were so tasty. I tasted my boyfriends meal (the meat which you cook on your own) and it was pretty good. I definitely think you should order this for the experience but IMO I like having my food prepared and the only thing I have to worry about is eating it haha.
