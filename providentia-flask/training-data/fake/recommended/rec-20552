I (and my 3 kids) gave this place a try because a Groupon deal.  It was exactly what I was hoping for -- nostalgic, old school with good food and great ice cream.  Our waitress was a sweetheart and very attentive.  Burgers were good but a little on the thin side, I like that they melt cheese on both halves of the bun; onions rings were very good; fries were OK.  Ice cream was excellent and I eat a serious amount of ice cream to compare Holsten's against (black raspberry and coconut chip were stand-outs).  Entire staff was pleasant and we all agreed that we would be back soon....the 35 min drive for me was well worth it.  I would have given 4.5 stars if Yelp allowed.
