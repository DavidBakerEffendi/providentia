Amazing brunch! The Crispy Grits blew my mind and you can tell a lot of though went into every dish, many of which are really inventive. The service was a little awkward (like my cocktail coming 10 minutes before my husband's whisky), but everyone was friendly and the whisky selection is huge. I will definiely go back!
