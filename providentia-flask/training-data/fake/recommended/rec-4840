Went here packing a living social all you can eat deal...with this deal you can only order two rolls at a time which is no big deal...cuts down on waste and allows you to pace yourself for the impending face stuffing. The rolls were really fresh and super delicious...my favorite was the Mexican and King Crab (real crab meat)...the atmosphere is a mix between romantic and modern...service was awesome! 50% off cocktails with Yelp check-in...the lychee martini is habbit forming :) Overall will definitely be back hopefully with another living social deal
