Absolutely amazing. I just a few words:I hate pancakes, and this place changes that. Their blueberry pancakes are just to die for. I would ALMOST dare to say they're better than waffles. And I LOVE waffles. Although the wait is usually LONG, I will not drop a star due to them just being super busy and awesome. It would be unreasonable to lose a star just because a restaurant is doing their job well. We also had the Chicken and Waffles and that was amazing as well. Definitely don't miss their soup, my girlfriend and I make sure to grab a bowl every time we come. But please do you favor and get their Blueberry Pancakes! By the way, if you'd like a wait under 1 hour, please get there within 30 minutes after they open. If you go in the afternoon, you're likely to be held on the wait list for ~2+ hours. But like the Cronut, this is worth waiting for.
