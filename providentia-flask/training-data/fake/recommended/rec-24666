We had a very enjoyable dinner at Amelie recently.  The trout was exceptional and the filet very good (the sauce with the filet could make anything taste fantastic).  Also liked the beet salad and cheese plate.   And, the wines by the glass, a California Cabernet and Cabernet Franc, were well worth the hefty price.  Only negative for us was the club-like vibe but the meal and the good natured staff left us looking forward to our next visit.
