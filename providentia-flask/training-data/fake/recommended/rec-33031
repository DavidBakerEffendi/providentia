So I was excited to go here after visiting the other place vegan chinese menu in west hartford. honestly - for take out and without the competitor this place may have ranked better in my book. But somehow we went here for casual date night thinking it was sit down service. THIS IS A TAKE OUT PLACE. there are a few tables but they serve the food on styrofoam plates with plastic forks. and the vegan items listed are the same (but not as many as) the competitor. And not as good (imo). The vegan BBQ were tough and the sauce wasn't sweet enough. The kung pao pieces were lacking something. The mixed vegs were good. But everything came out ten minutes apart- was expecting it all together. So basically....I won't be back unless my car has stalled on farmington ave and I simply can't go on without vegan chinese food.
