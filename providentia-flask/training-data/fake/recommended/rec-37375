WORST lobster roll on the face of the planet. OK - so overall the place is cute and has some cool décor, but that means nothing if the food can melt the paint off the place! I should have taken the hint when I ordered the lobster roll and the waitress said that it is made up like a salad, like tuna fish... was I sure I wanted it??? But I was like, yeah, I get it. There is some mayo and celery... like every other New England Lobster roll. Not the case. I can hardly describe the concoction of meat presented to me on an old rotten piece of lettuce atop a hot dog bun. Like... lobster meat puréed until gooey, mixed with mayo with a "no longer safe to eat" tang. UGH. Everything tasted like it was 30 days past its prime. Luckily the waitress came back quickly after I pushed the plate away and said, "It's disgusting, right? No one likes it." Right.... I wish she had just said that before I ordered. She kindly removed it from the bill and offered to bring me something else, but as they say, fool me once.... I'll never go back. It's one thing to serve something that doesn't hit the mark, but it is another thing entirely to serve something that other people have complained about and that the waitress even calls disgusting. 4 Aces, you may have cut corners to push that dirty lobster meat, but in the process, you lost a customer.
