More like 3.5 stars. I treated my family here on our last night in NYC.  I chose this place because of the reviews for the other location, but since we were nearer to this one, we came here instead. First off,  atmosphere was rocking!  Everyone was dressed up and looking amazing.  The ambiance was a little more upscale, and we walked in here grungy and tired. There was some snotty people looking at us, but I didn't care.  We walked in after 12 hours of running around NYC, and were in wrinkled travel clothes.  If we offended your sensibilities, then don't look at us. We ordered wings for the appetizers and I thought it was decent.  But you only get three per order, so we had to put in a couple orders, which is probably the most I ever paid for wings (my big bro is a wing fanatic).  We each ordered a different Ramen, so we can taste each others.  There is only 3 types to order.  Then we chose different various toppings according to what our server recommended for each ramen.  I thought everything was delicious.  So did my family.  I especially enjoyed the braised pork belly topping.  The broth was hot and fresh, and very tasty. The service was awesome.  He was attentive without being too intrusive.  It was most likely his recommendations that made my Ramen  extra tasty.   Okay now the sticker shock for wings and bowls of soup...Wow.  I mean I knew what I was getting into, but still!   This place was very, very expensive for what you get.  Oh well, at least I enjoyed it! 3.5 stars.  I rounded up to four because our server was great, and his recommendations were spot on.  5 stars for service, 4 stars for atmosphere and food, and 2 stars for price. I do not know if I will be back.
