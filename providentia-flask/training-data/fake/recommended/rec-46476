Holy mother of god. This is the best lobster roll I've ever had. Though only the size of a hotdog bun, Red Hook will pack that toasted bun with your choice of hot, buttery connecticut style lobster or chilled mayo maine style lobster. I had the connecticut style, and it definitely was one of the best $16 I've ever shelled out. Huge fan. Yum yum!
