Thank you happy hour! But why do the margs and sangria have to be carbonated? Maybe it's just me...but it was strange...the sangria was MUCH better then the margaritas tho so that's what I'll have next time. I love tacos...and during happy hour you just can't beat it...$2 for the the most part...I'm in! We didn't have a full out dinner so I can't say much about that...but the tacos and guac were both solid...tasty...flavorful...I'll def go back for happy hour!
