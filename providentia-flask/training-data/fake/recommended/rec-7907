I don't care what they say, that was chicken on that sandwich lol! I'm kidding, but one taste of their Crispy HipCity Ranch and you will think the same. The food is delicious! I did a 7-day vegetarian challenge last week and found myself seriously craving meat by Day 5. So I figured I 'd finally go and check this place out. I'm glad I did. I went crazy on the menu and ordered all of the favorited items I'd heard about at once, for myself and my family. I ordered the Crispy HipCity Ranch, the Philly Steak, Udon Noodle Salad, Sweet Potato Fries w/ both sauces (the sriracha aioli is out of this world!!!), an orange spice cupcake, a brownie, a chocolate chip cookie, and some Green Lemonade. Everything was very good. The layers of flavor that this place manages to come up with are insane. Regular chicken sandwiches rarely taste that good, how can "fake" ones? Lol Clearly, the Hip City Ranch was my fave out of the smorgasbord I ordered, but the steak was great as well. I didn't even realize nothing had cheese on it until I was halfway through it! To me, that speaks volumes about how far this food was buried in "Flavortown" because I don't eat ANY sandwich without cheese.The Udon Noodle Salad was light and tasty, but could've used a bit more dressing in my opinion. My least favorite items were the desserts. The cookie was good, but I didn't enjoy the brownie at all, and the cupcake only mildly. I'll definitely return!
