* I'm a top chef masters fan so have been doing my rounds - and was super excited to see Jonathan Waxman in the kitchen last Sat when I was at Barbuto for dinner (even though Susur was my fav in season 2). * I somewhat expected an upscale Italian restaurant, but was greeted with an outdoorsy converted garage. Nice change of pace, esp on a nice day. Good vibe. * Food was delish! Get the chicken (got that from watching top chef), and rigatoni (if it's on the Â menu). Both were fab. Chicken was well-seasoned with crisp skin. Rigatoni was perfect al dente with rich ragu sauce. Oh, and get a side of potatoes!
