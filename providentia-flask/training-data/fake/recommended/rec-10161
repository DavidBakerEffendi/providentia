Ramen noodles tasted great and the chicken broth is surprisingly thick.  Never had a good (non instant) chicken broth ramen before so this was a nice change of pace. I gave it 4 stars because it was so amazing that I would go out of my way over and over to come back.  I'll probably head there next to show friends that want to try it too. Also, expect to wait a bit during peak hours, I think this is part of the hype but not that appealing for me...
