This place is amazing.  It's unfortunate it's so small, but the product they serve demands a limited audience.  The burger lives up to all the raves. The fries are like crack -- from what I hear about crack.  The barkeep spoke for about 13 minutes on the bitters he uses.  Needless to say, they know how to pour a drink as well as execute food.  Go at an off time, like 3, bask in the sunlight filtering through the blinds, order three fingers worth of hooch, a cask draught to chase the whiskey, order the burger and fries and savor life. My wife wants to add that the Kentucky Hot Brown is tremendous and way better than Bobby Flay's at Bar Americain in NYC.
