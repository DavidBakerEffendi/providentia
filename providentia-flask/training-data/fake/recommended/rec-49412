My friend discovered this place somewhat near her apartment when she was looking for a craft beer bar that served take away growlers. This spot is in a relatively tucked away place (right near the Queensboro bridge) and not something you would typically notice, but I'm glad she did! It was early on a Tuesday, happy hour time - like 5pm - so we were lucky to get to try some of their cheaper offerings for a couple of hours. They even do $1 east coast oysters - so I hit that up. Their beer selection is pretty huge and off the beaten path. They also change their menu rather seasonally so you won't get bored with their offerings. They have a selection of sandwiches and a charcuterie board (which we tried) and everything was tasty and relatively inexpensive. Definitely a spot worth checking out post-work if you are in the area and like craft brews. My friend tried something called "orange wine" which I had never heard of before. She said it was interesting, not something she would have all the time, but hey, it was something new.
