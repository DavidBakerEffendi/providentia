I've been here on a number of occasions.  I highly reccomend going when the weather is nice so you can sit outside - beautiful. The food has always been above average - all the reviews can tell you that.  I think the food at Arunee is just as good, if not better at times though.   If Sripraphai gets busy though (which it does often because everyone in Manhattan is braving the 7 train to get here), watch out for your service.  Sometimes it felt like my dining companion and I were not even there.   We'd have to flag down the water-guy to get some attention. Arunee over in neighboring Jackson Heights has incredible service and I venture to say a bolder menu to boot.  For most folks (including me), the options of various stomach meats is lost, but I'd say it definitely matters to some.
