Ok. So I'll qualify this review by saying I do not eat pork. After a 0.5 mile walk through a very sketchy neighborhood from the train, I observed a sidewalk of restaurant spillage and veered right to observe the tiniest eatery known to man. Traif is packed, LOUD, hot and VERY small.  I'm 5'9 and my date was considerably taller so we painfully squeezed ourselves into the preschool seating in front of us.  I was excited by the turn out and decided to order a combo of six small plates, all seafood. Traif has some of the most creative cuisine that I've ever come across. The food was decent but I'd stay away from the butterfish carpaccio. The shrimp dishes were lovely and I really enjoyed the fried calamari. I think I'd definitely go back but try my hand at the seared scallops. That seemed to be a favorite.
