My first trip to Hearth was drinks at the bar with some of my favorite Yelpers. They sure knew how to make a Martini and I was sold. Stealing a bite of gnocchi only left me wanting more. Finding out that they had apple cider donuts on the dessert menu sealed the deal for a return trip. So it was with delight that I found myself sitting here again this past weekend and I certainly made the most of it. The charcuterie plate for two basically contained a whole barnyard and the 12 year old idealistic vegetarian that still lives somewhere inside of me cringes a little at that thought. Luckily the 26 year old meat lover I've morphed in to was far too busy moaning over pate and lardo to notice. Is there anything sexier then just eating a ton of really decadent meat? (OK, maybe that's just me.) Sea bass with calamari and cockles followed for me, and the fish was skin on, and the skin was cooked in such a way that it was basically seafood bacon. mind=blown. I paired my meal with a perfectly cold Hendricks Martini. It's basically what I drink when I want to feel like a grown up. If you order it here, they'll pour it from the shaker with just a little hint of ice chips floating in it. Could I ask for anything more? Well, if you could, there's wine, and cider, and beer, oh my! After all this we could barely handle the donuts for dessert, but it being the driving force for our visit, we ordered anyway. They tasted like fall and were warm. Mission accomplished. Satiated, we were both nodding off on the train ride home. Sexy.
