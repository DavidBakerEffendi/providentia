Walking into this bustling and lovely brasserie, I knew we were in for a special dinner. We were not disappointed. The savory and cheesy onion soup was the best I've had anywhere. My husband had the agniolette appetizer and it's one of the most amazing dishes we've ever eaten! He ordered another appetizer, the risotto, and he loved that. I had the special of the day which was the short ribs. It was melt in your mouth tender.  Highly recommend. Do not leave without trying a dessert called the chocolate pot! Oh my gosh, out of this world. Never had anything like it! My husband said it was chocolate butter. It's not mouse or pudding but has this butter like consistency you have to taste to believe.  it's better than the creme brûlée, which was very good too, but we've had plenty of creme brûlée. We will definitely put this on our short list when we visit New York.  Also, kudos to the management. One of the glasses being served to our friend broke and spilled out all over him. Not a great way to start off dinner but they gave us two desserts on the house. Such a thoughtful gesture.
