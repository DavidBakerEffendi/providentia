You know when your friends say "You gotta eat here its the bomb or hella Nom Nom" you think 'Yea Yea MF'ers been there done that' and then when you get there the wait is 45 mins and plus its raining!? Yea that was this time. BUT once we got seated, duuuuude it was a whole different story. Service is great and the servers hustle to get your order and drinks taken. All in the table had the salmon bennies, others had the huckleberry pancakes, bacon and eggs and I had the smoked salmon scramble with a side of rosemary sausage. Sh*t F&ck C#nt Wh@ore Muthafugga gawd dammit the food was off the chain! Those pancakes were life changing for me. I mean shit, they fold in the egg whites and dont over mix the batter so its fluffy and dense at the same time and has that nice crunch to the outer crust of the cakes. the maple butter was magic too. the smoked salmon scramble i had was made with creme fraiche and chives. silkiest eggs i've ever had and the salmon was not over smoked. other notables was the handmade, homemade biscuits, their bacon was amazingly mapley and oh how can i forget the Horchata Iced Coffee! Yes let me repeat...Horchata. Iced. Coffee My ninjas! OK, I need to go back soon...
