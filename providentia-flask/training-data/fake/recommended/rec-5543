I love Fogo. The service is professional and quick. They're absolutely to die for who knew such outstanding servers were still alive? I came here a couple times before and every single time has been to die for and had me talking about it for days. I came for Restaurant Week a few days ago and one of my guests were running an hour late. Blah. But the servers were all still attentive and continued to refill out drinks even though we weren't eating. The food quality during Restaurant Week was not as great though. Save yourself that money you think you're saving and go on a regular day, pay a little more and get that quality you're looking for. Again, the service is amazing!!! I feel so spoiled. :)
