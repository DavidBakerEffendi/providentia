I found out about this place on Yelp. I then realized I live only a few blocks from this place. So I had to try it because I love corn beef, pastrami and beef brisket. So I went there for the first time unfortunately they ran had already ran out of beef brisket so I tried the $5.00 corn beef on rye with mustard. It was good. then I went back and finally got a chance to try the beef brisket on rye with mustard it was okay not mind blowing like everyone made it out to be. But I want to try the combo sandwich with beef brisket and pastrami it looks good. But number #1 on my list for delis is still Katz's. The $5.00 sandwich's are always a good lunch deal. Plus I like the choice of the $8.00 med. and the $11.00 large. The portions are good for the price.
