You know what the greatest thing in the world is? Going back to the place you haven't been for eleven years, and loving it just as much as you did the first time. My friend and I stumbled on Corner Bistro more than a decade ago while visiting Manhattan and it has since become a nearly fabled experience--for the fact of its great atmosphere, awesome jukebox and tasty, tasty burgers. The same friend now lives in Manhattan and together we returned to the fabled spot to find it somewhat more crowded than in 1997, but the place was still as raucously charming as I remembered it and the burgers were still out of this world. It is not a place to be missed if you're a burger connoisseur traveling or living in New York City. Just don't expect any warm fuzzy service, and if you sit at the bar, don't be afraid of being splashed with a little beer.
