LOVE Sandra's. Found her place driving through Connecticut and I'm so happy I did! She has a great story, flavorful food and warm and welcoming vibes. Let me just say it's the best southern soul food I've ever had, I ate a combo of fried chicken and herbed chicken that were to die for! Her sweet tea is absolutely out of this world, I would go back just for the tea. Sandra is so sweet and treats her guests like family. Highly recommended!!
