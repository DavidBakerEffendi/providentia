It is a mad house here for lunch/brunch and I would HIGHLY recommend calling for reservations a couple weeks in advance or chance waiting roughly an hour and a half. The Salade Nicoise was decent and fulfilling.  On par with expectations, but nothing really special.  The beef stroganoff was tasty and the beef was tender and flavorful  The flat egg noodles were very well prepared and portioned perfectly.  We did not leave unfulfilled, but not stuffed to the brim. Service was decent but detached.  Given the crowd and hustle and bustle/ turn and burn of the atmosphere, service was what we expected.
