4 of us went her for the duck dinner. This has to be reserved online. There's enough food here to feed 4 big eaters, or 5 or 6 people w/ smaller appetites. The dinner actually comes serve on a large plate with - a full duck (sliced after the show it to you) under a bed of rice, only a couple bits of sausage (literally 2 bits...) - lined with mint, parsley, and a few other herbs - 4 large scallion pancakes It also comes with a large bowl of light greens, a few sauces (spicy Korean, reduced duck fat/juices (best one... always the unhealthiest), and sweet hoisin sauce. It also comes with 2 sides. We chose the: - broccoli salad with little bits of duck skin croutons. SKIP! It sucks! Blank cold broccoli. - the potatoes (marinated with black bean sauce and a hint of spiciness). Get this, really tasty. My overall impression is that the duck was really good. When they brought the whole duck out for us to inspect before cooking, it actually looks like a small turkey and not like the ones hanging in the windows of Chinatown restaurants. Is it worth 150 before tax and tip...? Maybe once in awhile, but definitely to try at least once as it is cooked very well and different that traditionally prepared duck (very tender, medium rare, and juicy). I couldn't do it all the time simply because I do live in the vicinity of Chinatown and I can get a full duck that is also very tasty for about 20 bucks lol. TIP: They also do one of the best jobs doggy bagging your left overs. They even put the condiments in little containers without prompting.
