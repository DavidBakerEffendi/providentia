I was so happy that a new Ramen restaurant had open up in Philly and I couldn't wait to try it.  First, I must say I have eaten at "Totto Ramen" in NY, Suzu Noodle House, (JapanTown) in San Francisco, and Ramen Underground also SF, and all of these places are great.  Terekawa is very nice looking place and the staff is very friendly.  When I walked in, the music that was playing was a Justin Bieber song... not very Japanese. I would suggest some J-Pop (Arashi).   We ordered three appetizers, the seaweed, Tako Yaki (octopus puff balls), and the Edamame.  All three appetizers, were very good.  I then ordered the Shoyu ramen/w chicken.  I found the broth lacking flavor. It also came with half a boiled egg, which had an odd taste to it and was cooked too long.  I had to add a little white pepper and soy to give it taste.  Everything else was fine: noodles, bamboo shoots, etc.  I also got to taste the Tan Tan and Miso ramen, which had more flavor then the Shoyu.   I will go back to Terakawa when I'm really craving ramen.  It's good to know that this place is here. One more thing: I really hope that Terekawa puts a vegetarian ramen and a spicy ramen on their menu.
