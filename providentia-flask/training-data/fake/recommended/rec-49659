I went to watch a WVU football game and the sound was turned off. There was also a Nebraska game on at the same time, with the volume on. There was no one watching the Nebraska game, but a few people were watching the WVU game without sound. I was complaining to my friend whom I was sitting with and I noticed a guy standing behind the DJ booth. He apparently saw my frustration, walked over to me and asked what my problem was. I asked him if he could please turn on the volume. I said there's no one here watching the Nebraska game and he agreed. But he said he wasn't going to turn the volume on for me and asked, "you got a problem with that?!" Â I said yes I do. He said, lets go pal, pay your bill and get out. I asked why? He said get out! He got hotel security, a large ogre of a man with food stains on his shirt and said let's go pal. I asked why, but he had trouble putting together a coherent sentence. This was embarrassing and shouldn't have happened. So let me get this right, I'm in your establishment to give you money and you can't turn the sound on? And your telling me to pay my bill and leave? I'm sorry, but I work in a restaurant I've bent over backwards to please the most impossible guests and this clown is gonna just throw me out? Miami Mike, you don't deserve your job. I will never go back and would encourage everyone else to boycott this dump. The food was horrible. I made sure to give the waitress a good tip.
