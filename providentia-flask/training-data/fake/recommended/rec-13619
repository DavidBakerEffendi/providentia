Alright, I was following the "Man vs. Food" and I'm not a sandwich person but this wasn't bad.  Was it worth the line on a saturday!! Heck no!  But i had friends to keep me company so it wasn't bad.   Here's a tip:1 person gets in line to order and the other hover for seats Bonus:  if you manage to get a seat at the counter you can skip waiting to order in line and order directly from your seat!! Or just don't go on a Saturday!
