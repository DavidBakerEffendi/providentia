My favorite brunch spot in the city! The food is great but really the best part is the nearly nonexistant wait. I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table for brunch and that is fabulous. I highly recommend ordering one of the featured items from the brunch menu. For the price of $15.5, you can get challah french toast or eggs benedict with either canadian bacon, smoked salmon, bacon or spinach as well as a small glass of fresh orange juice and americano, cappuccino, latte or tea. I always get the Eggs Norwegian (smoked salmon). Home fries that come with all of the eggs benedict are delicious too.
