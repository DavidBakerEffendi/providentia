Good burgers. Like that you can order any burger bunless or meatless (mushroom instead of meat). Good flavors, nice dipping Sauces. Wasn't a fan of the beet salad it was more of an arugula salad with a few Pieces of golden beets. Don't get me wrong it was good just not what I was expecting. Food was good and great friendly services, but it didn't blow us away and exceed our expectations.
