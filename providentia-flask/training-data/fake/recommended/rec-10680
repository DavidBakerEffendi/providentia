Cool little spot in Park Slope. I got the chicken burger, which consisted of freshly ground chicken and spices, and they topped it with a nice chipotle mayo and some lettuce. Loved the atmosphere and ate outside during this particular visit. Prices were reasonable, my only criticism is that the sides (vegetables, mac & cheese, etc) were priced at $5-$6 a piece. Overall, the ingredients were very fresh will definitely be back to try some different iterations of chicken from the menu.
