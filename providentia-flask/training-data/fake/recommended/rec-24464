AMAZING ambiance. Came here last night for my 4 year anniversary and absolutely loved the decor. We had reservations at 830 but were seated 20 mins later (unfortunately), I guess they realized how long we waited bc management personally greeted us and apologized (even brought out some goodies for us on the house). The food was really good we had two starters and I had the Comandante cocktail (delish) if you are planning on ordering a main dish you'll be waiting for around 30-40 mins for it to be prepared (well worth it) YOU HAVE to try their blanco & negro dessert (AMAZING!!!) overall I would definitely come back just for some drinks and starters.
