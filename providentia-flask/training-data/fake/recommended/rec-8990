My parents loved this place. Let's back up a bit. Parents visiting for the weekend. They are Chinese, live in the Midwest, and embody all the stereotypes that you could possibly throw at that weird combination. That explains why when I took them to Recipe, they eyed the menu suspiciously with its fancy descriptors, were disheartened by the portion sizes, and balked when the server presented the check at the end of the meal. Granted, they enjoyed the food. But there are better ways to spend a Friday night than defending the value of your meal. Fast forward to Joya. The parents left with full bellies, big smiles on their faces, and barely a dent in their wallet. And lest my ears deceived, Dad may have even complimented the food at least once and said that Thai food wasn't this good back in Oklahoma, and definitely not as cheap. Bonus points for the amazing mango coconut sticky rice dessert. Subtract same points for the two times that I requested dessert menus and the waiter came back with the check instead. Service leaves something to be desired, but they are a victim of their own success with people spilling out onto the sidewalks just about every night.
