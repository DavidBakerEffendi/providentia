Was in the Kips Bay area looking for a place to have dinner.  Launched the Yelp app on my phone and this was the first place with four or more stars that was listed.  So we went in - no wait for a table for two at about 8:30PM on Friday night. I don't really care for gluten-free, so the availability of gluten-free pasta and entrees wasn't a big deal for me. The restaurant is nice and cozy.  Good place to have a conversation with someone because the restaurant is far from noisy.  Bread with olive oil and garlic is served.  We ordered the Rigatoni in Ragu and the Lobster Ravioli.  The rigatoni was ok - instead of ground meat that is typical of these dishes, it was shredded.  The lobster ravioli was ok as well.  The ravioli and rigatoni pasta itself was pretty good, but I felt like the sauce was missing something. Also ordered the gellato over caramel apple crisp.  I think that was the highlight of dinner.  The dessert was not overly sweet and went well with the gelato.  I recommend this for dessert. The owner greeted us as we were preparing to leave and seemed to really take an interest in his restaurant.  I saw him go around and talk with people at the bar and some tables. If you're in the area and want some decent Italian and good dinner conversation, this is a good place to go. Entree prices were about $17-23, appetizer was about $10.
