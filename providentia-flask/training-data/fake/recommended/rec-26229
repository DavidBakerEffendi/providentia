The chicken platter is my favorite! Much healthier than street food, and more delicious! It's next to my school and before my friend took me here I never walked into this place cuz I only liked Asian food. Now I come here every week at least twice, and willing to try their other dishes. But shwarma chicken is always my favorite!!!!!! The combination of salad, yellow rice, chicken and hummus is perfect.
