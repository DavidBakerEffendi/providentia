It's like Cheers (you know, where everyone knows your name) but with good food and BYO alcohol.   Yes, yes -- we heard about the whole lobster incident via Eater.  And you know what?  I'm with the "eccentric" Neil on this one -- that couple must have been out of their minds.  Our ciopino was so perfectly rendered -- each element just the right doneness, texture and flavor -- that we will be driving into Brooklyn to get another serving.  And another, ad infinitum. The Thai curry cod with root veggies may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it.  And again, the cod?  Expertly cooked.   The wait on a weekend night for this tiny place (hint: the window next door?  Same place) may be long but you'll have a laugh or two with the charming Neil while you wait, and a cup of the corn and crab chowder will warm you right up.   Bring a bottle of white burgundy.  Stay a while.
