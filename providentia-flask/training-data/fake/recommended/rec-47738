I LOVE THIS PLACE! Â  Had some free time in Philly hoping to catch the US v Ger game at Fado (across street) but line was wrapped around the corner so I stumbled onto this lil gem. don't pass over this place because of its name, but rather swing in grab a bar stool and order up a pint and some food. I hate to use the term "dive" bar, but that's what it is. Albeit on of the best dive bars as it has a TON of sophistication and class hidden behind the darkness and tattoos. Looking for Guinness or Stella on tap? Not going to find it here, but what you will find is an incredible array of craft beers on tap and hand made cocktails from bartenders that know their craft. Not to mention $3 PBR pint cans. This place screens hipster awesomeness. As for the Food, lunch was so good I went back for dinner. Jerky chick sandwich hand cut fries (white & sweet potato mix LOV IT) was the perfect order for a soccer game. For dinner the grouper Fish Tacos w a side of romaine salad w cilantro dressing. Tacos were awesome and reminded me of the tacos had in Venice beach. This place has it all: character, edge, great bartenders, good food and great draft beer selections. Go there ITS GOOD!
