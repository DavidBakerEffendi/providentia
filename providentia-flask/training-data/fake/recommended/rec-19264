I had to ask for tea 3 times before I got it. Also, I had to wait about 10 minutes before I got a table, even though I made reservations well in advance. But I forgive them... And I'm normally not this tolerant. I loved Fitler Dining Room. Went here for brunch with a group of 6 on a Sunday. The small dining room is very inviting and it's almost as if you're coming to someone's house. The open kitchen enhances that feeling. Brunch menu is small which I like, because sometimes there's just too many options. I had the French toast and it was pretty good. Also, their portions are somewhat smaller than most restaurant. This is something I also like. Staff was very friendly and welcoming, even though they forgot about my tea several times. ;-) I will definitely go back here and can't wait to try Fitler for dinner!
