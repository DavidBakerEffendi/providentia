Burger and fries with an asian twist. Other than the serious hype, this place has okay food for the price. Its 12 bucks per a burger which is a little bigger size then a double cheeseburger in mcdonalds. The line was crazy long as my party had to wait for 40mins. Tho I arrive 30mins late it was surprising that everyone was still waiting. We had to go to another place after for more food, the place is nothing special and for the price and line I would rather go somewhere else.
