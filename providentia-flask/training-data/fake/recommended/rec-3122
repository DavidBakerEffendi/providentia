This place serves all my favorite foods (chicken, rice, beans) and it does so in an outstanding, unpretentious style.  If you're polite about it, and offer to share, the friendly staff will even let you bring a bottle of booze to compliment your feast, if you please.  I always leave satisfied, and extremely happy!!!
