Wow!  I'm so impressed, and so happy to finally find really good food on the UWS. I'm so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and went along with my friend's suggestion to try this Greek restaurant. We opted to split the leg of lamb, sheep's milk ravioli, and a bottle of red wine.   -The Lamb-Absolutely delicious! No knives needed here--fell apart when my fork nearly grazed it! It also came with a side of Orzo which I couldn't get enough of. -Ravioli-good, but definitely not as good a the lamb. I think the inside seemed a little dry.   -Wine-complemented the meal perfectly. I need more places like Kefi in my life.  Please send me recommendations for comparable quality restaurants on the UWS-will love you forever!
