I have to say that I am a big fan of this place after eating here several times. First time around we came in for dinner with a big group and sat in the back at a table. Had the ribeye steak entree. Came out cooked perfectly to MR with sauteed mushrooms and broccoli rabe and sweet potato french fries. Ther service was very good as well considering one waiter handled the whole table of almost 20. Second visit we went for an early dinner and sat at the bar. Had the foie gras burger with tomato jam, onion rings, and sweet potato fries (because they were so good the first time). The burger itself was very good, my only complaint was that I ordered it M and it came out almost WD...big problem when it comes to most burger. Regardless of the temperature problem it was still really good. Third visit we went for dinner and sat at the bar again I had the foie burger again...this time it was cooked perfectly and even better than the first time. I guess the B team was working for the second visit. The tapas are all very good from what I have had. I recommend the chorizo a la sidra (chorizo in cider), garlic shrimp, albondigas (spanish meatballs), or the fried manchego cheese (warning it is really heavy). All the tapas plates are small, as most tapas are, so order a bunch if youre hungry. Most of the tapas range in price from $2 to $5. Outside of food the bar is stocked with literally everything from what I saw. I tend bar myself and made it a point to check it out...they have all bases covered. Beer and wine selection was also very good. The restaurant itself is really nice to be in...totally new remodeled building in Gaudi style. Despite being off the beaten path in the Ironbound Catas is worth checking out, especially if youre heading over to Red Bull Arena. Be weary though, it isnt a place to go and sit down for a quiet dinner if there is a soccer game that night.
