I always enjoy visiting Employees Only although I havent gotten the nerve to sit and get my fortune told. But I just remembered my last dinner there and had to write a review. Besides the creative concoctions of a cocktail list and the friendly employees, the food and the atmosphere here is pretty darn good. So my last meal here I had ordered the rib eye steak which came on a carving board accompanied with au gratin, little ramekins of seasoning and a sprig of rosemary. The steak was massive, huge and very very tasty. Perfectly cooked, I didn't want to cut into it so that the juices didn't run. Hands down to the chef! I have to say it was the best piece of meat I had eaten in years. And I only remembered this meal because I was trying to compare the last steak I had ordered on my recent evening out (Landmark review). I truely recommend this place...for dinner...for drinks...for a little insight into the future...
