This place was quite lively and a bit on the loud side, which was fine for us but might not work for some people.  We started with cocktails which were spot on (Manhattans) and poured at the table, which was a nice touch.  They were a bit on the small side but very tasty.  We had the truffle polenta to start and it was A-MAZ-ING.  3 of us shared this and we should have ordered two to share.  We shared bruschetta which was tasty but didn't wow us.  We then shared the scallops which were wrapped in bacon and delicious, although difficult to cut up.  We also had Salmon with endive and asparagus in a lovely cream sauce.  It was really quite good.  The polenta outshined the rest of the meal, for sure.  We had one "gluten free" person in our party of three so we didn't try the pastas which seemed to be the highlight of the menu.  Looking forward to going again.
