Ok no. This place is a joke. Gave this place another try, and i had by far the worst pork bun in my life. Their pickled vegetables don't taste pickled. Their pork tastes funny and has too much fat in it. Their sauce also has no flavor. Maybe because I'm asian and am very picky about my food, but how does this place have 4.5 stars? Mind = blown. Feeling very hopeless about food in E. Williamsburg.
