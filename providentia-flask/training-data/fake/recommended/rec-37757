I just left a lunch at the red owl tavern. I have to say I was very disappointed. Our server was very nice but our fod was subpar and incredibly overpriced. I paid 21 dollars for a grilled chicken salad that was supposed to be a chop salad but was really just a garden salad with 2 ounces of dry chicken on it. I got that because they were unable to serve the 15 dollar turkey wrap without mayo because they prep them all for lunch. My coworker ordered the wrap, the waiter asked if she wanted avacado on the wrap, she said yes and they served it on a seperate plate because the wrap was already prepped and they couldnt take it apart. I rarely write poor reviews but I was very disappointed with the food and price. I will not return.
