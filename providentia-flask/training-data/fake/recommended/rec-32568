This place is absolutely delicious.  We had the spread appetizer (definite must-do) with pita bread and every single spread was good.  Really a no fuss great appetizer choice for two who are not Greek and want to sample a bit of it all.  For my entree I had the lamb shank with orzo which was absolutely delicious.  The lamb was falling off the bone and the dish had a bit of kick.  My friend had the fish with vegetables.  You apparently can substitute your sides that come with the entrees too.  The employees seem to be Greek (can't really tell) and everyone was really nice. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is the lack of ambience.  It felt like a simple family friendly place, which caters and fits the UWS location, but Manhattanites are spoiled on this front.  There wasn't anything memorable about the ambience, but the good Greek food did make up for it.
