I have heard mixed reviews about this place- you either love it or you hate it. We went on a great day cause we loved everything about it. Showed up at 10:50am and there was already a line forming. This was our third attempt going, each time the wait was too long. My advice is to go as soon as they open. All options are pork except one option of vegetarian noodles. I had the veggie option with boiled egg added to it. Noodles were freaking tender & flavorful! I added some chili powder to mine to make it extra spicy- if you like spicy-- do it. Several of the servers helped us out and the price was just right for NYC-- $14 plus $2 for egg...yes, this is actually pretty cheap for NYC. This place is not all hype- the real deal.
