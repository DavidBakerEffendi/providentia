Had to try while I was in town. Great sandwich. The quality was way better than you can find in Denver. I give Pat's the edge over Gino's. I like the meatier sandwich. Pat's also uses real Cheez wiz. Very important. The service is lame at both places. They both are fun and a good visit. The best in town is Sonny's though.
