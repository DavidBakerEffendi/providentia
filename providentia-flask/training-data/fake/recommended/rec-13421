Was walking to Clinton Bakery from 6th Street when we happened to come on this place...so glad we did!!!! The food was great.  We were visiting from California for the week and so wished we had found it earlier in the week.  The service was a little slow but I can handle that when my bill was under $20 for almost the exact same thing I had ordered the day before at Clinton Bakery and spent $37.  Don't get me wrong the blueberry pancakes at Clinton are out of this world but Cornerstone is pretty darn good.  Next time I am in town we will be hitting Cornerstone for certain!  Great coffee too!!!!
