I went to this restaurant bar area for drinks for friends celebration. we went to the bar area and were greeting by a quite bitter young female bartender. I am not sure if she is new and learning bartender etiquette but she had no customer service skills. she must have asked my friends and I if we wanted to pay separately for our drinks nearly 4 different times. She acting like this was a chore instead of being kind and polite, all we ordered was champagne and wine which should take a few minutes to get done and for over 20 minutes we were standing empty handed. the older gentleman at the bar was kind enough to step in and help bc he could see our frustration with her. at least he was kind and had good manners. I would never bring a small group of friends to this bar again. the female bartender also continued to gossip about us to about 5 waitstaff lingering at the end of the bar. Rude and Unwelcoming!!
