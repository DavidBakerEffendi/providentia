Try The Potato Latkes w/ the Jambalaya..Incredible! This melts in your mouth and not only that, The portion is HUGE!..You will certainly have leftovers..I do in my fridge right now! Hats of to Stanley and his talented kitchen crew, and servers..Coffee is always hot, fresh, and you will easily get 3 refills without even asking. West end Breakfast staple!I love Mo's!!!
