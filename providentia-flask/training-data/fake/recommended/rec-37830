I wish there was a 6th star, because this place deserves it! Kai (hope I'm spelling this right!) is remarkable. She is so helpful and really made my experience an awesome one. I was interested in trying some new coffees, she went out of her way to assist me and ensure I got the sample I was most interested in. There was a few customers behind me waiting, she could of simply told me "No, we don't have the tasting notes." and moved on to the next customer, but she was sincere in helping me figure out which coffee I'd like most and the other barista stopped what she was doing to open up the next line. I have frequently visited OCF and have always had a great experience, but yesterday was beyond that. Kai is wonderful and offers sensational customer service. (All of the workers I've dealt with here are very pleasant and knowledgeable, by the way!) Thanks, Kai and OCF, for exceptional coffee and customer service to match! P.S. Indulge in one of their baked goods; had the rosemary shortbread yesterday, it was worth the extra 20 minutes of Yoga I did this morning to make up for it. lol
