Ultimately, I've been looking for a good speakeasy in the city and Employees Only was a disappointment. The only component that made it speakeasy-like was the fact that you could not tell it was a bar from the outside. Once I entered the crowd was all people 35-50 so I could not really get into it. The drinks were average at best, but the environment was not all that fun so it did not make it a place I wanted to stay at or revisit.
