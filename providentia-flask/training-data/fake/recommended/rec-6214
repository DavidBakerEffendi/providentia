Awesome burger. Tasty, and not oily. Meat is very lean. The original, not dressed up, is the way to go. I'm not a mayo guy (their choice), so I got a house made Dijon mustard which was great. I wouldn't want to have dinner here because you sit realllllly close together at communal tables. Like, footsy close together. But for lunch and a beer? Yeah what the hell. Good spot just east of SoHo.
