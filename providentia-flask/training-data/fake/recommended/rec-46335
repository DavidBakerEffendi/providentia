Excellent service. Very professional and attentive.  My husband and I are still talking about the kampache appetizer.  So delicious.  The halibut is to die for as well -- prepared in a way that has a crispy crust, but not oily at all. I thought the desserts were just ok (ordered the ice cream cones and chocolate cake), otherwise I would have given this place 5 stars. Sit outdoors and enjoy the loveliness of Tribeca and Marc's restaurant.
