If you were to judge Room Service by first appearances, it would be that trendy little Thai place you love to hate: sure, it might be pretty, with stylishly-dressed staff and a fancy cocktail menu-- but the food is shit and the prices are extortion. Fortunately, Room Service provides all of the glitz and glamor of a sceney place without the prices you'd expect. While the food is far from remarkable, it's generally all tasty and you will be shocked at how cheap everything is ($3-5 for appetizers, entrees starting at $6/7). The long bar and larger area in the back makes it seem perfect for a large group or for a girl's night out, and the bartenders and host/ess are friendly. I wouldn't mind returning, especially for a quick dinner with the girls. Room Service has this gothic/disco feel to it-- lots of black, dark colors, and mirrors, along with a giant chandelier, ghost chairs, and other ornate furniture with blaring dance music. This could all easily seem overdone and tacky but, because the prices are so reasonable, the experience ends up feeling like a steal. Come when you are looking for a loud, festive dinner. All the atmosphere/environment (and, I warn you, noise) of hipper neighborhoods without the cost.
