Loved this place! Started with guacamole crab martini- so so good! There is so much fresh fish on this menu it's hard to choose what to order. Everyone got something different and was very happy. Service was great, very accommodating kitchen, and we sat outside on a gorgeous Sunday night. Oh wait and guess what's? It's BYOB- shabang! Amazing little gem - can't go wrong. We'll be back!
