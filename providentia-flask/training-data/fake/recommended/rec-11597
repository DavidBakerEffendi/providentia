Amazing go to spot if you don't want to question if the food will be good.  I love this place.  Food is always amazing.  I also have always had great service here.  Erin or Aaron, was our waitress last time I was in.  We were at our table foreverrrr and she was so sweet and never rushed us (even though it was close to close).  I really love when I am not rushed or felt rushed at dinner, she was awesome.  Pretty crowded and noisy place, so just be prepared.
