Came just a few weeks after they opened.  My husband & I found it to be delicious and a unique spot. I love the space and found it very relaxing & inviting. While I'll agree with some others that the service was very slow, I did find them to be polite and also took into account that we were there within their first 2 weeks of business.  Also, it was nice to take our time & not be rushed through a meal. I plan on going back!
