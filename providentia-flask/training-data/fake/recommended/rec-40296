I was eating here before I could talk.  The smell of crab fries owns prime real estate in the oldest plot of olfactory memory banks in my brain, a smell I would catch whiffs of years later, thousands of miles away, and have no idea why I'd suddenly almost shat my pants with happiness for seemingly no reason.  It wasn't until returning to Chickie's & Pete's years later that I was able to connect the dots.  It was around that time that I found myself disappointed to continually discover that I couldn't go to just any city and expect to find bulk seafood joints.  This style of dining is awesomely hard to find and seldom affordable where it exists.  Of course, who wants a belly full of gulf oil nowadays anyway. Eat the crab, mussels, steamers, peel and eat shrimp (hot or cold), craaab friiies, really anything that was once swimming... and crab fries... and beer.  Have you seen all those cans?
