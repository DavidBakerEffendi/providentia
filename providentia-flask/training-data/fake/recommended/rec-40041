3.5 stars I came to Amada for my birthday and while the atmosphere is a good balance of romantic and classy and I love the dark lighting, we gave up waiting for our 9 pm reservation and grabbed a table in the bar when it became available. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria which was ok but not the strongest. On to the tapas... Not so great: *Patatas Bravas - not the traditional fried potato crisps but rather small bite size bits where the "friedness" dominates - but the sauce is really good *Chicken Brochettes- not much flavor - thought these would be like the ham croquetas but they were really just chicken skewers *Calamari - very very salty and the sauce was strange Very good: *Lamb chops - my husband was a big fan of these *Artichoke/Mushroom flatbread - by far my favorite tapas with a great blend of flavors and the perfect amount of cheese *Pastel de chocolate - chocolate heaven All in all, a fun place to grab a drink and a few tapas but I wouldn't make a full meal or special occasion of it.
