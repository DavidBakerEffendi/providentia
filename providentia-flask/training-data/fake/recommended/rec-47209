We had heard good things about this restaurant but had a horrible experience. After waiting for 20 minutes longer than was quoted our burger came and was cooked medium rare instead of medium well. That was the last time we saw our waitress she never came back to bus our dishes or to give us refills on drinks or even to see how we were. After complaining to the bartender our experience still does not improve. I would not return to this restaurant and I would advise against it due to the lack of service.
