For all my expectations of a charming French bistro, Balthazar unfortunately didn't live up to its hype. Perhaps it was a factor of arriving on a Saturday night without reservations, but the staff was off-putting and after nearly an hour of being pushed around next to the bar, my friend and I got squeezed to a narrow corner where I could barely keep my dish on the table. The menu's impressively large, but my steak and fries weren't anything out of the ordinary.
