I was here a couple weeks ago with a friend who was in town from Jakarta and he had to get his annual fix. I can't blame him! I'm off wheat totally these days, but I made the exception, and it was definitely worth it! We went for pepperoni and italian sausage (CLASSIC!) and boy was it YUMMY! I can't wait to break the rules again and get back to Lombardi's!
