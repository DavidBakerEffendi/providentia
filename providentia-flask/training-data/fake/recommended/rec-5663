i am not a drinker, so came here with friends and got a burger. it was decently priced and tasted okay. the best part is that you can hang out wherever you want and play Stacking blocks (aka jenga), ping pong, or a variety of other games to keep yourself busy.  I was there on a weeknight and it was pretty slow, but when the weather is nice, you can sit outside and they have big fire pits which i think you can roast smores on?! sounds good to me! i imagine that having to walk up to the bar to place your order would be annoying when its busy, but not sure if its like that all the time.   Pretzels are yummy!
