Went for lunch with a group of 7 of us and it took forever to get our food. We ended up being in the restaurant for over an hour. Not a place to go on your lunch break. Then to top it off I asked for the cheesesteak without mushrooms and half my sandwich was correct and the other half had mushrooms. How hard is it put the proper sandwich on the plate?
