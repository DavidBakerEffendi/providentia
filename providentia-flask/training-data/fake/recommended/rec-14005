I really want to give this place 3.5 stars but I guess I'll round down. Yes, the spicy duck meatballs were delicious.  If anything, come here just for that.  All the other dishes were good but probably not good enough for a return visit. We also ordered the lamb belly.  This should be advertised as lamb morsels as the two pieces were really small.  The three little pigs tasting was really good.  The pork belly was melt in your mouth and I liked the kimchi on top of the pate.  Maybe because I'm not that big of a fan of pork tenderloin but it tasted kind of plain to me.  My date ordered the special of the night, sea bass.  Sea bass is usually a really tasty fish but somehow they managed to make it very bland.  I think I'll pass on the desert!
