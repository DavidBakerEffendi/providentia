Let me start by saying the food here is absolutely wonderful, unprocessed and divine. I get you have to pay more to eat better. However, I have eaten at many other places that offer similar quality food, and Hu is by far, the most expensive.  It's impossible to get out the door without spending less than $25-$30 on just a small meal.  I would eat there far more if the prices were actually reasonable, instead, I go to competitors with better prices.
