Cheap, fast and delicious food!  Never had nan zhou hand drawn noodle before, but they did not disappoint at all! Ordered the popular beef stew noodle soup, pork minced noodle and spicy pig ears.  Everything was astounding and spicy pig ears were not too spicy, but yet really tasty! Beef stew noodle soup was delicious, and they had vegetables in there that I've never tried before, so it was really a mixture of different flavors.  The pork minced noodles were a bit salty, but still good.   Perfect meal for the cold weather that definitely hit the spot!
