Came in for a lunch on a weekend. Got their lunch set Uni Ikura Don. Uni and Salmon Roe over rice. It is served with miso soup and choice of small plate appetizers that you get buffet style at the back end of the restaurant. Kind of weird how they set that up and the selections are ok. Pickled vegetable and egg? Eh. We added a chawan mushi with our order and it came with a little piece of shrimp and mushroom and what seem to be mochi. Again. Eh. Not a total bust. I still did come out full and satisfied with my sea urchin dish but it isn't something I will be coming back for.
