The best fries.  Thats right - I said fries.  I would have never expected to find the best french fries in a bar but there I was.  Had them several times since and always the same crunchy goodness.  Well done Double Windsor! The downside is that the place is so popular and its a self seated pub, its tough to find a seat.  You have to stalk other dinners as they are finishing up and launch yourself into a free table the moment they leave.  Not exactly the kind of laid back dining experience I would prefer.
