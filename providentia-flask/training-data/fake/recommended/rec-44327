Good food. Good beer selection. Terrible service. Lots to figure out! Tried ordering a drink table service, only to be told id have to close my tab at the bar and reopen one with the waitress. Her excuse? Essentially she was too lazy to look up my tab at the bar. The POS system they use is not difficult. Also, why have table service if you can't order food at the tables!? My vote. Eliminate the waitresses. Have all the tables be self serve. OR make the waitresses take food orders table side. It's not difficult guys, figure it out! I really hope the owners care enough about their business to read these reviews!!
