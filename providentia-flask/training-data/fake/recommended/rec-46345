We checked out Marc Forgione for brunch a couple of weeks ago with two other couples. One note -- if you are a group -- they will wait until all of you are there before seating you.   Reservations are recommended -- this is a popular spot. The brunch was yummy - comments on the food: - banana brioche french toast was wonderful -- not overly eggy but puffy and light -- came with maple syrup  and vanilla sauce (could have used a smidge more maple syrup) but recommend that you get an order of the bacon on the side (4 pieces).  Oh that bacon -- yummy yummy!! - friends had the pancakes with blueberries which also looked wonderful. - my hubby had the brioche with egg and bacon and he only got one piece of bacon with this.  Really!!!???  - that made this place a 3 star vs 4 star for me.  All the other photos I saw had two pieces of bacon on the meal.  I could not get over this, and shared my side bacon with him (I had the french toast).. - good coffee and iced coffee - they did let us sit for quite a while and catch up with friends which was good too.  All in all I do recommend.  But avoid that egg dish if you are a bacon fan. BTW parking is challenging here and recommend that you take the underground lot across the way.  You can drive around a long time looking for a space. To the restaurant, maybe you should make a deal with the nearby lot.  Would save a lot of headaches!
