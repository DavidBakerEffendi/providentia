When i was in NY, i wanted to experience the best Italian food possible and after talking to some friends this place came up.   This is the best italian food, one of the most memorable dining experiences i've ever had.  Homemade wine, appetizers and desserts i've never even heard of that resonate with me to this today.   The place has been around for some time, and is only open for dinner and only reservation (6 tables only).
