It's not the best ramen in New York, but it's a pleasure to find a respectable bowl so far from the Japanese restaurant rows in lower Manhattan and midtown. The soy ramen with pork came with generous portions of the latter, and beautifully cooked noodles; the flavor wasn't quite traditional, but it was tasty. Eggplant buns (the winter counterpart to the popular green tomato buns) were fairly flavorless, but the kale salad was quite good. The staff was extremely pleasant and definitely a highlight of the visit. It is maybe a tad overpriced.
