This płace has been on my list for about 4 years but I never had the courage to withstand the crowds. However after finding out that brunch on Sunday goes until 6, I decide to go. In this way, the late birds always win because we beat out those nooners waiting for 2 hours. If you can hold out going late ALWAYS wins. So I got there around 3 on Sunday and the wait was still about 35 minutes. Since it's the LES killing time is no problem. I ran an errand and by the time I was done my table was ready. Upon walking in I realized that the wait is so long because the set-up of the place is exactly like that of a small, cozy diner. And the menu matches, it's def several steps up from your local diner but it serves the same kind familiar, delicious food just way upgraded. I had the Spanish scramble with chorizo, onions, tomatoes, cheese which came with hash browns and toast. #perfect. Just the kind of filling delic brunch you dream of on a Sunday. I got a side of sugar cured bacon - amazing. It was sweet bacony goodness.  For good measure I got the chocolate chip pancakes to go. They do NOT disappoint and the maple syrup is fantastic. This place is so good that I returned today - two days later. I got an omelette and my son got the pancakes. Food was just as amazing and they were so kind and attentive to my 3 year old. The topper though is that they have boozy shakes - I got a mudslide shake that was out of this world with the fresh cream on top. I say this place deserves it's ranking among NY's best. Friendly, approachable service with equally great food. Enjoy!!!!!
