We stalked this place until it opened up, and we have never been displeased. The beer selection fantastic, the bartenders are knowledgeable, Â and the food is delicious. I love the chicken and waffles, mac and cheese, corn dip and the burgers. The atmosphere is fantastic as well. The bar itself is beautiful and the music is always great!
