Go with the Sopressata Picante. You will not be disappointed. *Small warning- If you are ordering pick-up during off peak hours the wait time is incredibly quick. Called before leaving from a 15 minute walk and the friendly woman on the phone said, "That will be five minutes!" Can't wait to come back and try the artichoke/pancetta and clam pies. The arugula and prosciutto sounds really good, too.
