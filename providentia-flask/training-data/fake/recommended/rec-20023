that was really good! Came for dinner on a friday night with two friends. We had for starters the lentil salad which was okay and the scallops, that was amazing! For main course I had the Australian lamb and they had the venison both delicious! And we shared the Public Chocolate Plate for desert, some weird stuff happening there... But overall it was great! And the interior is really cool
