Great food at a great price served by super sweet waitstaff, and it even included a candle for my friend's birthday and a heartful rendition of Happy Birthday sung by the entire dining room.  I've been eating here probably as long as the waitress was alive, but still, always a home run.  Thanks Cafe Orlin.
