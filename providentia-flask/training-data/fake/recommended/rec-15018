your restaurant experience is half food based and half atmosphere based.  if it was only based on food, han dynasty would get a 4.  unfortunately for me, atmosphere and service may outweigh the quality of the food and hence the 2 stars.  the service is BAD.  ive been to han dynasty a few times and the waiters come by the table to take an order maybe once every 30 mins so dont pass up the opportunity to order when they come by!  my last visit to han dynasty the waiter was straight up rude.  my friend who is a vegetarian, wanted some tofu as a side dish.  granted this wasnt on the menu but usually restaurants are accommodating and for an extra fee will give provide such items.  our waiter's response to this question was  "no. we dont do that" not "oh let me ask the manager and/or the chef for you" youre at 3 stars now, han dynasty. also what is this $10 corkage fee for BYOB?  thats so ridiculous!  down to 2 stars, han dynasty we got the dry pot lamb which is served at a level 10.  the entire dish was chili peppers we had like 5 pieces of meat in the dish!  for $18, in a family style restaurant, not cool, han dynasty not cool at all.  you can keep your 2 stars. sadly, im obsessed with spicy food so ill be taking out of this place but will not be dining in anymore.
