It is hard not to leave Grimaldi's disappointed these days. It takes over 30 mins for the pies to get to you after ordering, the new location lacks charm and is in need of a renovation, the oven is inferior and too hot, leading to invariably burnt crust and obliterated basil, and all the while you wish you had just gone to Juliana's. Grimaldi's is at a crossroads. It can either go back to the basics, perfect pizzas in a smaller location, or continue its decline and hope for a future in fast food franchising while its name is still synonymous with pizza. With every passing day as an inferior pizza joint guidebooks are changing their reviews and less locals are Â willing to give Grimaldi's a second chance.
