I am giving this place one star due to the horrible service that I received there. The food was good but the customer service was horrible. I had a large order and they only allowed me to order half of the it and then made me get in the back of the line to wait agin to order the rest. I was told if I ordered it all at once I would hold up the line. I spent a lot of money there to be treated very rudely. When I waited in line again to order the rest of it the girl behind the counter was very dismissive and rude. I will not be going back to that place again. If you have a larger than normal order be warned you will have to stand in line twice.
