Love love love this place. Always come here. Dinner is really solid; all their pastas are good. I'm partial to the penne (which I get almost every time). Every person I've brought here have enjoyed the food. Plus, it's pretty cheap (like 10-15 for most dishes) for Manhattan. Brunch is great too! I'm seriously in love.
