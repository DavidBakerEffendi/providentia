Vibe is great (sometimes they have a live DJ). Unlike any other creperie in NYC.  This is in the tradition of Japanese perfection - it is all in the presentation.   My favorite is the Tuna Nicoise for lunch/dinner. Ingredients are very refreshing.   For breakfast Eight Turn Lox or Double the Eggs, Double the Fun Only downside - place is very small - in rainy weather you can't use the benches outside.
