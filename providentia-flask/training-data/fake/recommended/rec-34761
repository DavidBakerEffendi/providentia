Great food. The Spicy Chicken Thai Basil and Bangkok Chicken Pumpkin Curry were very very good. Feels more like a lounge instead of a restaurant according to my friend but I kinda disagree. Very modern decor and laid back atmosphere and excellent service (male waiter). Perfect spot for a second date if you want to show someone something, "different".
