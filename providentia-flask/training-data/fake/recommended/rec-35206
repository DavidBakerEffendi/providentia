Best fresh noodles I've had! Order pork paitan ramen. The ambiance is very cool because they cook everything in front of you. The broth was so fresh and everything was flavorful. Always add egg to your ramen. It's almost a must! Note: there was a long wait when we got there. We waited an hour because the line was long so be sure to be ready for a wait!
