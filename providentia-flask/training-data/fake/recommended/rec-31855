The Zon sandwich was perfect. The pork terrine was delicious and totally elevated the texture and flavor of the sandwich. I recommend eating one half of the sandwich with the cilantro on top and the other half with the meat on top - sounds weird but you experience different flavors with each layer of crunch when you try it this way. The bread is flaky but has a great chewiness to it. The chefs/owners are incredibly kind. It was my first time eating here and I didn't realize they close at 9p on weeknights (because I neglected to read sign on the door) but they didn't turn me away. They welcomed me inside and took time to make menu recommendations. They did not rush my order, making my food meticulously by hand. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. Thank you for being so patient, sorry I was so late!
