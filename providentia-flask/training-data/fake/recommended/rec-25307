I pass this coffee shop everyday on my way to work. Whenever I have gone in I have ordered a small coffee (to get me through past midday). Their coffee is wonderful and strong. The employees are always so nice. And I got my first chocolate brownie (gluten free). It was delicious! Gooey, soft, and just plain awesome. Next up on my list- salad and a latte!
