So looks like we might have hit an off night? Hostess was super sweet and friendly, but we ended up sitting at the bar, where they were less so. With two bartenders you'd think getting a glass of water or a beer would have been easy. Not so. The food came really fast, despite the place being full. However the rice under the super yummy duck jumbolaya wasn't really hot, and neither was the gumbo soup. Also, be warned, you've never seen or had gumbo like that, or at least I hadn't. Good flavor, the shredded meat and rice just makes it unique. Also, the po boys are SUPER dense if you like them like that, you'll love them. Their presentation is A+. We had the desserts that were suggested in other write ups and were not disappointed. Maybe skip rush hour periods and just go when things are calm? Because when you've got your SPICY food, nothing is more frustrating than not being able to get a drink after asking REPEATEDLY and being vaguely ignored by the mildly rude bar staff.
