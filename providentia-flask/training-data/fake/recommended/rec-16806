hands down, the best chinese veg restaurant in philadelphia. well worth the few dollars extra (compared to the competition in chinatown). i had the hot and sour soup which was more than adequate. the bean sprout rolls appetizer was delicious. sprouts were fresh, the sauce light and tasty, and the quantity surprising (4 large rolls in total--enough for a small lunch!). for the main, we ordered the kale and hot pepper (was actually a chinese broccoli, but still delicious nonetheless), the tofu skin with 2 kinds of mushroom, and the vegetable chow fun. the tofu skin was tasty and well prepared, the mushrooms absolutely scrumptious. the chow fun noodle seemed to be homemade. very surprising! and delicious. all the vegetables were extremely fresh and not overcooked. flavors were savory and light. two thumbs up.
