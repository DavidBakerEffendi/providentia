This is my favorite Fairmount neighborhood bar. Without a doubt. The beer list is extensive and glorious. There are always so many wonderful new International beers (including, of course, Belgians) on tap. The place doesn't get too crowded and there is lovely outside seating when it is warm enough. Also, the dining room has a really pretty mural on the wall. This is a great place to take some people for a casual, comfortable night of dinner and beer. Oh, the beers. On the food, I've had pretty good meals. Note that although this is the new Monk's, the mussels just do not match up. You would think that they would use the same menu as Monk's because it is such a hit but I guess they are trying to establish the BC as its own unique place. Now, don't get me wrong. I am not saying that the BC's menu is bad. I'm just saying that Monk's is better. Definitely still get the mussels. Definitely try out the vegan options. But seriously people. THE BEER.
