What can I say that hasn't already been said about the glorious truffle burger. It's heavenly. It's totally worth every calorie. And it's definitely worth the higher price tag than your average burger. We came in around 1:30 on a sunday expecting a somewhat long wait but much to our surprise we were seated immediately! We started with the perfectly crispy sweet potato fries since we were starving and while they were fantastic I just can't wait to try the truffle fries and fall into a truffle-induced coma on my next visit.
