This is a cute restaurant but there was a lot of construction noise outside, which was drowned out by the indoor sound. The menu had a lot of selections, but the service was very very slow. Although we informed our waiter we had to enjoy a quick lunch at the get go, we never received our lunch items. We ordered nachos, which were very tasty, and ordered tacos and sandwiches as a quick option. The nachos came out quickly, but after 45 minutes passed, we were still without food. Our waiter never checked on our table or noticed that we had not received our orders. Another employee walked by and we asked for our food. No food came. We then asked for it to be boxed, and he seemed put off by this comment. 10 minutes later, our food arrived in boxes and no comp on the receipt (we did get a drink voucher, but would I come back?). The sandwich was soggy. Not worth the wait. Perhaps I would try again as others had a good experience, but our business was not appreciated.
