I'll give it a 3.5 for now but it definitely has potential.  It's nice to see a place like this in the neighborhood; Queens needs to step up their game in the food department.  The wait was maybe 5-10 minutes on a Saturday night which was not bad at all.  Staff was very friendly and attentive. And now the food: Yellowtail- Served with Italian speck, pickled jalapenos and citrus; was very fresh and worked well together.   Short Rib buns- I love the bun but thought as  whole they were kind of plain jane.  Didn't taste much of the apricot mustard. Oxtail Terrine- My favorite of the night.  Perfectly cooked, the roasted mushrooms were great and the caramelized onion puree added just the right amount of sweetness to the dish.   Braised Pork Belly Tacos-  This was the item I was most looking forward to.  Wish the pork belly had been crispier.  The kimchi salsa was good but needed a bit more kimchi.   Whole Roasted Branzino- I did not like at all.  The fish was mushy rather than flaky.  Wish the skin had been crispier especially since it was cooked in bacon fat. Complimentary popcorn- Popped in bacon fat you can't go wrong. Rice Krispie (two big squares) with Marshmallow Ice Cream-  The ice cream was good but the treats could have used a bit more marshmallow when they were being  made. The place definitely lives up to the name because salty and fatty is exactly how I felt when I left.  Menu needs a few more items but I'd be back in a few months for another try.
