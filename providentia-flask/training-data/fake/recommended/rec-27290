Came here a little over a month ago was a good experience. The ladies in the front were super sweet. They explained how it worked and thought it was interesting. The numbers make it much easier. We ordered a regular sangria but bc I'm not a wine person wasn't my thing. Food was good maybe a little salty for my taste but it was a good experience. We order 6 and shared it. Decent price. Definitely a place to check out
