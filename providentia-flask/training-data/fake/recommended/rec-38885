Enjoyed the drinks and so happy they offer vegetarian options.  Very cool set-up and a great outdoor venue when it's not 100 degrees.  My favorite part when I visited this spring was the make your own s'mores dessert at the bonfire! Single serving option for $1 and you can get one with a Reeses cup! So amazing and creative- however I heard that they aren't doing this anymore which is a huge bummer.  Bring back the s'mores and bonfire, your most unique feature FH!!!
