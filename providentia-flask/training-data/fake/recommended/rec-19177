This place has great food and the portions are amazing especially for the reasonable price. I love the barking chihuahua as a regular go to. Today I had the Santa baby pancakes which are pumpkin pancakes with oats, pineapples, and peanut butter chips topped with peach vanilla syrup and kiwi banana butter. Now I know that this may sound like a lot but it fit together perfectly and was absolutely amazing. The frittatas are also great. Sorry I don't have a picture of this amazing meal but I'd rather eat my food while its piping hot than pause and take pics :-) there's also a new wynewood location. All of the locations except for the University Blvd location are also BYOB.
