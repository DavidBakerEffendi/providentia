If you're not sure what to get, I recommend starting with the "roti canai" (pronounced chanai) appetizer, a freshly prepared flat bread which you tear up and dip into a chicken-and-potato curry. I always get the "penang char kway teow," a seafood dry-fried rice noodle (contains shrimp and calamari among other things). Other favorites: the Thai basil noodle (a little spicy), the mango chicken, and the very sweet and flavorful Thai-style ice coffee or ice tea.
