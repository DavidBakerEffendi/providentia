Burmese food is hard to find anywhere in this country except on the west coast and Philly is not really an Asian food city except for a few good Vietnamese places. Rangoon is as good as SE Asian food gets. Forget the generic, interchangeable and over-sugared Thai restaurants, which are our era's equivalent of bad 70s Chinese food. The menu includes lots of things -- curries, lemongrasses, etc -- that will be familiar from Thai, Laotian, far southern Chinese cuisines, but also a number of flavorings that are quite unique. The mango and chile pork was exceptional, with none of the cloying sweetness you get with typical mango dishes (Patak's mango chutney it's not); the tea leaf salad is a great appetizer, as is the crispy taro root (effectively taro french fries, but it is Philly...). Also, any restaurant that can cook with okra and not turn it to jelly knows what it's doing. The atmosphere is close to zero, the service is indifferent at best, but at $25/head (including four drinks) for four people, it's better value for money than you have any right to expect, and a reminder of how privileged Philadelphians are to consistently get A-/B+ food for a fifth of NYC or San Francisco prices, with some dishes rising to the best world class cities can offer.
