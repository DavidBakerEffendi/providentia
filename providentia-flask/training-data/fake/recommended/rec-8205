Sandwiches, salads, pastries galore.  This open concept cafe, featuring dark wood and fun chandeliers, has many options to choose from.  Personal favorite is the tomato basil mozz. The balsamic dressing they use is addictive and the perfect complement to the simple ingredients. The sandwich when made correctly is out of this world! That being said, I have had some occasional issues with the sandwich makers being light handed with the fixings for the sandwich and sometimes the greens are a bit past prime. My suggestion here would be to speak up to let the maker know your preference and scope out the quality of fixings laid out before ordering. My only other complaint here is the flow of ordering can be a bit chaotic and confusing. Between not having a clear order here station and that the counter is right in the walkway that joins the back of the cafe with the front, prime ordering time can be a bit of a hurdle. Grab a mini cupcake, cookie or other pastry and/or a bag of chips and you are good to go!
