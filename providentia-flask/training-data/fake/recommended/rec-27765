We've been here 3 times and each time was FANTASTIC! I seriously can't write enough about how much we love going here. It's the perfect place for anniversary or special night out. The ambiance is magical and the staff is just lovely! We have always been greeted with a smile, and Stephen always recognizes us! We love it here, some of the best food and service NJ has to offer, I can't wait to go back for our next anniversary!
