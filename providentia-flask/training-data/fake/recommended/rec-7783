I don't know what you people are complaining about!  I called ahead, the waiter (Brian) picked up the phone and was happy to reserve a table for me.  He surmised it was me when I walked in 45 minutes later - nice job - and then proceeded to help us select wines and small plates for our meal.  The only downside is the price, and the fact that this place is a little out of the way being so far east in Alphabet City. Anyway, we escaped with a $100 tab (tip included) for 2 glasses of wine and 4 food items.  The bean dip is good; so was the tuna carpaccio.  Skip the ceviche.  And the cheese plate is a cheese plate, but with the homemade jam and homemade bread, it was pretty damn good. Will I be back?  Yep.  Give it a rest on the music and all your other complaints.  Maybe you should try going on a weeknight, when things are going to be more chill!!
