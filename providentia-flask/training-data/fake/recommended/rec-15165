Holy yum!  A friend and I were visiting from out of town and she found this place online.  We mistakenly walked the wrong direction to get here (heading toward S 13th Street instead of N 13th Street).   Once we figured out our mistake, we turned around and headed in the right direction.  We walked through a little dodgy area - but made it there safely.   And it was well worth the long walk!  We had the cannoli french toast and the lemon ricotta pancakes (each with a side of bacon and turkey bacon).  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The french toast was amazing and the bacon was cooked perfectly.  This place is worth a trip to Philly!  And I can't wait to go back!
