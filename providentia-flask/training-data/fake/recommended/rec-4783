Giorgio is everything all the reviews have said. It is wonderful. Good food, friendly atmosphere, extremely knowledgeable staff and gluten free. Valentina was our server and she was great. This is my new favorite restaurant. If you require a gluten free diet and still like going out take your wine and go to Giorgio. Â A winner for sure.
