We stumbled into this place after wandering around for an hour trying to decide on a place to eat. The service is friendly and welcoming, and though we couldn't sit in the backyard (private event), the dining space is cozy and laid back. The place is BYOB (which I wish we'd known ahead of time)...and has some of the best fried fish around (sandwich and fish & Chips. Who knew?!? We were looking for decent, and were pleasantly surprised to find fantastic!! If we're ever in the neighborhood again looking for food, we won't have to wander long.
