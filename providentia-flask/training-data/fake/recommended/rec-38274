I live up in West Hartford during the work week, and on Wednesdays my roommate and I have ordered in pizza from this place. I've never been inside, but I drive by every day and it looks like a very clean, cozy space. Outside seating looks adorable. However - the pizza. Not a bad pie, but thin crust does not a good pizza make. The crust is dry, with no flavor. Last time we ordered a plain cheese pie, and also a white pie. The sauce/cheese on the plain was fine, though nothing special, but the white pie was practically cardboard. I'd be willing to bet that something with a little more moisture would make a better meal - vegetables, maybe?
