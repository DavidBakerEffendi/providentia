Whenever you pick a restaurant for your anniversary, you need to be very careful. Will this be the place you roll your eyes years from now and remark, "Remember that awful place we went that one time?" I assure you, this will NEVER happen at Garces Trading Company. Ever. Go here every year if you can. My wife and I went on a Saturday night, and were seated outside quickly with no reservation, despite the inside being very packed and the sidewalk tables being pretty full, too. It was definitely a blind luck occurrence, I highly suggest calling ahead. Our waiter was excellent, very knowledgeable about all the food and very friendly. We ordered varying cheeses, charcuterie and olives, and each thing was explained by the waiter, and in the case of the cheeses, paired with some sort of fruit accompaniment. The lavendar honey was amazing, as is their house olive oil. Even the obligatory table bread has great flavor, and I couldn't stop tearing off pieces of it, dipping it in the olive oil, and spoiling my dinner. It reminded me of that Simpsons episode where Marge yells, "Homer, don't fill up on bread!" and Homer responds "That's right! The steak!" Our main dish was the deep dish pizza, which takes about 40 minutes to prepare, so you know it's being made from scratch. It is definitely a shared entree, as it is rather large and extremely dense. Everything in there was fresh and prepared carefully. We took out half of it, and had to take the rest home. And for the curious, yes, it does reheat very well the next day. My favorite part of GTC is that if you liked a particular element of our meal, you can buy it and take it home. It's good to be able to see a place that boasts its ingredients so strongly put its money where its mouth is offer them to you to enjoy whenever you want. I will definitely be back here again, long before our next anniversary.
