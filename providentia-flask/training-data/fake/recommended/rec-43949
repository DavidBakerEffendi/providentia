I ordered the Salmon and Sweet Potatoes and a Milk Shake. I didn't like any of it. First the fries were soggy by the time it was delivered, the milkshake was just okay and I was expecting a lot from it, since that was what most people here talked about. The Salmon was cooked well, but it was under seasoned, not sure how it got 5 stars but it's not worthy of it.
