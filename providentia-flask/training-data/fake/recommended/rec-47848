The food here is really great!  The service was really slow, but when the food finally came we realized that the wait had been worth it!   We went on mothers day so we ordered their $40 prix fixe menu.  The very tasty bread (which was kind of pizza-y) came out hot and was delicious with the tomato-based dipping sauce.  I had a salad with arugala, goat cheese, raisins, and beets that was fantastic.  My fiance had the tasting of empanadas (made with duck and steak) that he raved about.   For an entree (which took probably over 20 minutes after we were done with our appetizers to come out) I had the lobster ravioli, filled with a satisfying amount of real lobster, and was served with big sweet scallops and plump shrimp in a delicious cream sauce.  My fiance had an incredible seafood paella, which was filled with really well prepared seafood and was seasoned perfectly.   We finished off our meal with the desserts included in the mothers day menu: a tres leches cake, which was very tasty, and a very rich flourless chocolate cake, also quite good. The drinks were great as well.  I am a big mojito fan, and I was not disappointed by their pina mojita, which had a lovely pineapple flavor.  My fiance had a mango mojto, which was a bit too sweet for me, but he really enjoyed it.  The coffee that we drank with dessert was also very good (I hate when really great restaurants serve mediocre coffee). All in all, the slow service aside, this restaurant offered up some really tasty food, and we definitely plan to go back!
