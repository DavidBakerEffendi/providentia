First visit to One 53 and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Glad I made made reservations for Valentine's day dinner as clearly it was a popular choice. Appetizer(Salmon Tartare) and main courses(Yellowfin Tuna, Seared Rabbit Loin) were excellent. Did feel that the cheese plate for dessert was way over-priced for what it contained. Only other detractor was that our server was not particularly friendly. Look forward to another visit.
