Great Service. Great Food. Will defnitely return. Went last week with a friend to celebrate a birthday. The hostess was really nice. The waitress was a doll as well. We ordered short ribs of beef and chicken & waffle entrees, and a side of mac n cheese. All of it was fantastic! Wine bottle prices are reasonable. No complaints and will definitely return again!
