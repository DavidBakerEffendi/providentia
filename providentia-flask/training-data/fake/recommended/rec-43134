Cheap but not worth your time. There are so many other delicious restaurants here in NY, and although this place is cheap, definitely not worth it. ==== I was really excited to try this place after reading all the Yelp reviews, but I was really disappointed. The ingredients are not fresh. You can tell that they masked the taste of the meat with a lot of salt and soy sauce. And the place didn't look very clean and made me nervous about what I was putting in my stomach (And this coming from someone who grew up in Asia...). Lastly, the dumplings I received were transferred from another container to my takeout box. It was clear that it was sitting out for some time.... Also, I waited 15 minutes for my dumplings and then was told that they were out. There aren't many places to sit at this place. And it does get pretty busy... Have some cash on hand if you decide to try this place!
