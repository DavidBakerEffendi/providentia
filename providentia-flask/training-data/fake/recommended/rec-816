I finally had the chance to try out Umami and I was so disappointed =(  I really really really wanted to LOVE this place.  I mean who doesn't love burgers + truffles?   We came on a Friday night and we didn't have to wait!  The place wasn't too packed and service was slow =(  I'm used to bad service/slow service from frequenting Chinese restaurants so I don't care if the service is slow, but I digress.   We ordered: Truffle burger - the burger was all right =(  It didn't wow me and I actually found the burger to be a little greasy =(  It wasn't juicy, tiny and didn't give me that wow factor that I was looking for =(   The Royale - this burger was the same as the truffle burger.  There was absolutely no wow factor and not juicy at all.  It was also greasy and tiny. =(   We were both so underwhelmed by the burgers.  The burgers here are definitely way too hyped.  For the price we were paying, we were expecting wow and we did say wow, at the tiny size =(   Don't get me wrong, the burgers were good, but it tasted the same as something you can get at Five Guys, which is a fraction of the price.   Cheesy Tots - these were good, but definitely not what I expected.  It's something everyone should try, but don't go out of your way to come here just to order this.  This was my favorite dish of our meal. Truffle fries - I was so disappointed and underwhelmed by these fries.  They were actually pretty horrible to be honest.  I know the description says "thin fries", but boy were they thin!  I love truffles and I love truffle over fries, but since the fries were so thin, the truffles over powered the fries and I got a nauseous feeling from eating these.  There was no potato meat to compliment the truffles.  I hope umami changes their fries and get meatier ones.  These fries suck! So yes, you should come and try this place, but don't bother waiting in line.  It's not worth it.  Come back when there is no line.
