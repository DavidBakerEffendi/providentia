I have to revise my review and upgrade this place to a neighborhood gem. The food is excellent and really reasonably priced (I hadn't tried it before) and the staff are friendly and helpful in the utmost. Plus it's a great place to work. Hell yes. Oh - and to the reviewer who said she had to throw out her coffee because it was too hot? Are you serious?? I am boggled.
