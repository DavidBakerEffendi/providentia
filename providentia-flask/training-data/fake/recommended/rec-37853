I went to Fogo for a business dinner the other night .  This might have been the best idea ever.  The service was amazing.  Those little discs with the red and green that indicates whther you are ready for more?  You need to be real careful about them, because if you leave the green side (translation:  "I want MORE MEAT!!") up, you will be set upon by roving meat servers.     Most of the time, at business dinners, you get loaded up with plenty of carb-rich foods that leave me feeling kind of foggy-headed.  The garlic mashed potatoes at Fogo are petite little bowls - if you take more than a couple of tablespoons, you will empty it.  So holding back on carbs is easy.   The salad bar is excellent - a nice variety of cheeses, anything you would want on a salad, and the most amazing bacon.  Everything is better with bacon - and this bacon was amazing.  Thick sliced, cooked to crispy perfection.  I put a few pieces on my salad and then grabbed some as a side dish. The meats?  This was obviously where they shine brightest.  Several kinds of steak, pork loin, lamb chops, sausage and even chicken.  All were great - grilled rare, medium or well done.  The filet mignon was perfect, but the lamb chops were my favorite.   My only minor quibble was with the beer list.  It was pretty plain-vanilla - Bud, Miller, Stella, stuff like that.  Not one pale ale, not one local beer.  The only saving grace was a Brazilian beer, the name of which I forget, that was a sort of a stout..  It was very good and went well with all the meats. I have to add - our waitress was great - very sweet, good natured and fun.   I would definitely go back.
