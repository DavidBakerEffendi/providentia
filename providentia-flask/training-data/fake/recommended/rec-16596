I should explain my one star rating.  I have eaten here before and had an excellent meal (the tasting menu is the only way to go, as otherwise things can get fairly expensive). Last night, however, I made reservations for 8:30 for three people.  I called and spoke with someone to change the reservation to four people at 9 and was told this was absolutely no problem.  We arrived at 9, only to find no space available but were told that it would be a short wait.  after 20 minutes, the maitre'd apologized and said it would be just a few more minutes, but they would be able to seat us.  Interestingly, even though our original reservation for three was at 8:30, there were no vacancies, so they could not even have seated three of us.   Anyway, by 9:30, we were told we could have a seat next door at Jewel Bako (note that we were not offered a drink, but told we could order one) while we continued to wait.  The wait was now estimated to be around 30 more minutes.  I asked if we could have our meal served from Degustation while we were sitting in Jewel Bako (the restaurants are connected with an open passageway).  We were told that was not possible as the Degustation chef did not wish his food served on the other side. Perhaps Mr. Genovart has such a high opinion of himself that he doesn't mind that people with confirmed reservations would have to wait at least an hour merely because he does not wish his cuisine served at a table 8 feet away. We left. The maitre'd did not seem to care. The service was inexcusably bad.  We won't return.  Pity.
