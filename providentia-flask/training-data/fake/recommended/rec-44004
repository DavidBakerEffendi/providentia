Chalk another one for yelp ! Like many, i had never tasted Burmese food before. If i were to explain, the food has thai food texture,chinese preperation and Indian taste - a lethal combination if there was ever one ! I ordered tofu kung pao,pea soup,lentil fritters and 'Jungle' chicken. Each dish outdid the other ! The lentil fritters looks and tastes like southern Indian 'vadas' - deep fried lentil batter with curry leaves and spices. The pea soup was creamy,garlicky and mildly spicy. The kung pao tofu is out of this world ! It is the real mccoy of Kungpaos with searing hot whole red chillies and tofu flipped to crisp in a wok. No excess sauce,no gravy and none of that 'PF Chang' ish americanized kung pao. The jungle chicken was a mild yellow curry with ginger,basil,red peppers and shredded chicken. The only downside are the portions which is on the smaller size ( entrees served in appetizer sized plates! ). And ofcourse the terrible and near impossible downtown philly parking situation. So now Â there are 3 things one cannot/must not miss in Philly - the Ben Franklin bridge, the liberty bell and the 'Rangoon' Burmese restaurant ! Cheers !
