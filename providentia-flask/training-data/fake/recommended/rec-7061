This place is unbelievably amazzzzing.  Seriously..those z's are not cheap. I went there with someone who knew the chef, but I'm still stating an unbiased review.  We tasted a few off menu items and they were amazing...Kudos Chef.  From the menu we enjoyed, the Scallops and Spare ribs and they were both great (though sorry, the scallops were too salty). The atmosphere is extremely sexy...fish tank is distracting - because I swear a fish war was about to happen lol . They also have happy hour at the bar from 5-7 M-F so go!
