Truly great. I waited about 20 minutes for a table here last week, but was cocktailed while I waited, and then had the same server at the table with no interruption of service. I had the crab toast, the nettle agnolotti, and the arctic char with peach gazpacho and was astounded by the artful simplicity of each delicious dish. Our server, Fjolla, was informative and attentive. I loved the mid-meal cornbread surprise and the caramels that came with our check - gilding the lily on a wonderful evening.
