When I think of summer, I think of happy hour at Cantina in the sunshine with a group of the finest friends. I have dined at Cantina Los Caballitos at least 25 times in the last few years and very rarely have I been unhappy with my food or service. I definitely prefer to grab drinks/food in the summer when the long windows are open in the front and there are tables outside, mostly because it eliminates a lot of the congestion the restaurant has in the colder months. Plus I can't get enough of sitting out in the sunshine with a margarita in hand. The food is yummy. I have a hard time switching it up as I've developed some staple snacks/favorites over the years. The salads are really yummy, the nachos are so delicious (beware, the large is super grande!), veggie quesadilla (when not left to get soggy) is so good with the mushrooms and smokey sauce, and all the tacos- YUM! They consistently have interesting specials on the board including different ceviches- a bunch of which I've tried and have all been executed really well by the chef. I almost never leave the establishment without ordering some fried plantaines to share at the table topped with scallions and queso fresco. The happy hour margaritas are really good, especially for the price. Occasionally they cut corners and make them weaker than they should be, leaving you with more heartburn than a buzz- but it is happy hour, hopefully they will fix that one day. I tend to order the margarita with the guava juice, it's so refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. In the winter, I tend to steer clear of the margaritas and order off their draft list which is consistently a decent selection. Last, but certainly not least... I love the decor and vibe of Cantina. Without being completely tacky, it vibes Mexican culture with the perfect South Philly neighborhood appeal.
