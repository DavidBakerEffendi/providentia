While the bisro is a bit small, large groups (we were 6) are well accomodated because of well thought out use of space.   Each of us had a different entre and one was better than the other.  Service excellent. A welcoming wait staff and great food made for a memorable brunch.  You must try the lemon tart made by a local woman for the restaurant.  Thank you,
