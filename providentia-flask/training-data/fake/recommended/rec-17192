The food is beyond amazing. I go here on the regular. But the last time I was there which was last Wednesday, the music was extremely loud, I couldn't hear a thing my boyfriend was saying. Our server also messed up my boyfriends order. His salmon was supposed to be served with coconut rice and came served with rice and beans. I could tell they don't really care about their customer service points.
