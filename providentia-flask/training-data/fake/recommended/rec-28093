Il Bambino is a hidden gem. Everytime I go here (almost always for lunch) I am shocked that there is no wait (especially since there are only a handful of tables). They have great paninis and crostinis. I will admit that many items on the menu I have never heard of before, but don't let that scare you! Just order something new and be amazed at how many delicious food combinations you never knew existed. p.s. - they have wine! I wasn't expecting that from the outside but it was a nice surprise
