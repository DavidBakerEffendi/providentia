I hosted my birthday dinner this year at their private dining room which seated 12 of my nearest and dearest. The room is amazing! It feels like you walked back in time to a more refined and eclectic world. The set up was great and I didn't have to think about much since I pre-ordered the food and alcohol prior to the night. It's a great and easy experience to host a dinner there and I highly recommend it.
