We recently held our rehearsal dinner for our wedding at Amada.  I had been to the restaurant on two previous occassions, but this was our best experience yet. Erin from the special events group helped us reserve the private room in the back and select an oustanding menu.  Personally, I loved everything, but my favorites were the crab stuffed peppers, the totilla espanola, and the Sangria... The service was also oustanding for our group. I would highly recommend the private room for a special event and we felt the cost was worth all of the food and attention we received.
