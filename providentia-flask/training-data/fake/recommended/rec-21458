Not that I intend to create a dent on the 3000+ reviews, but as it turns out with many famed places, it's just the brand name that makes a place popular. We had a half-half white and regular pizzas which were good, nothing to rave about. We had to wait in a queue at around 9-10 pm on a Saturday, but it moved at a decent pace and didn't see one when we were done. It took some time to place our order, and the place doesn't offer liquor which was a bit of a downer for us.
