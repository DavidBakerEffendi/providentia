On my way home and craving sushi, I Googled my Droid to see where Glastonbury's Japanese restaurants were and wound up here. It was a Sunday afternoon and I sat at the sushi bar. The chef was very friendly. The sushi was really delicious; I had a special spicy tuna roll. I would definitely go back and hope to have the same experience. I felt very welcomed.
