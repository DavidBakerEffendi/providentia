This place is everything that is wrong with the Manhattan restaurant scene these days. Unnecessarily high prices for average, casual food. This place is not a fine dining joint, no table cloths or even a decent tequila menu, for that matter. It is just expensive for the sake of expensive. I get that rents are righ, so prices need to adjust to pay the bills, but perhaps the village is too expensive for a Mexican joint. Don't get me wrong, I am all for paying hefty prices for an amazing dining experience, but these guys just plain rip off their patrons. $14 for guacomole $15 for a taco $27 for a basic Mexican entree As for the food, it is pretty decent. I can vouch for the guacomole and the suckling pig carnitas. In the end, if you can stomach the absurd prices for basic Mexican food, it's worth a try.
