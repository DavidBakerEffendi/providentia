I LOVE this place. My favorite bar from this weekend when visiting my sister who lives kitty corner from Yuca. Happy Hour is great at this bar. I'm VERY picky about my mojitos having gone to Cuba last summer and had the real deal. Yuca makes an amazing mojito and I LOVED the sugar cane that came in the drink. My only complaint is that the service when we went back on Saturday night was really slow (needed another bartender). And the waitress that we had for brunch on Sunday was a bit rude. But, the main bartender is great and makes delicious drinks.
