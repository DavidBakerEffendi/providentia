Five stars because there is nothing like it in Tribeca and it's about time! Large space for a wine bar but still has a cozy feel. Recently started serving lunch. The Reuben was one of the best I've ever had, right up there with Zingerman's for anyone who's visited the Ann Arbor sandwich holy land. Also tried the beet and gorgonzola risotto balls under "fried stuff" - these were admittedly a little weird but a cheesy fried concoction is always going to be ok by me. That said, our waiter reccomended the oxtail balls, which in hindsight probably would have been a better choice, next time I'll listen. Great for after work drinks, a date, lunch or really any excuse to go. Will definitely be back.
