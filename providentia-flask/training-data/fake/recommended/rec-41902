We've been twice.  The first time it was mindblowingly good, but very crowded and loud. The second time (exactly one year later) it was TERRIBLE.  All the food was greasy and gross, and the bar was out of ingredients for the first FOUR drinks we tried to order.  (Why not just tell me what you can actually serve instead if making me guess?). When we finally did manage to order drinks, they were really gross and I had to force mine and my wife's down so I wouldn't be wasting $25. I'm not sure what happened in that year, maybe they lost a chef or had a crazy night, but I'm not gonna risk going a third time after that experience.
