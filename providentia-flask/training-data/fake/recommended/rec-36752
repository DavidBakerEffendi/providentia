I need to come back for the nutella french toast and my friend always tells me about their veggie burger I will have to get a hold of as well.  I had an egg sandwich with sausage and cheese and pesto sauce on an english muffin and it was perfect.  We sat at the bar cuz it was packed and service was still great.  The vibe in here makes you feel like your up in VT or something which is a nice little getaway from NYC.  Plus its 3 blocks from my home so I plan on coming here a lot more.  New fave.
