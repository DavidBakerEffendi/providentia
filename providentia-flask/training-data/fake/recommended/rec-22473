My wife and I visited this place on our trip to Philly. Amazing beer selections. We had the pretzel appetizer(should have ordered two). Wife had the grilled cheese(had me a bite) which was amazing. I had the burger with gruyere and carmelized onions. A feast for my taste buds. Will definitely be back.
