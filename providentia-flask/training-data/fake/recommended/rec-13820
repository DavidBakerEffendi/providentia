About half way through my 2 week New York visit and Grimaldi's has now jumped to the top of the pizza list. That oven throws out a lot of heat, the pizza arrived steaming and the tomato sauce bubbling. I added just sausage which had the distinctive aniseed flavour that some lack. The basics are all there, good crispy base, intense sauce spread in good proportion and mozzarella that retains it's flavour. Just don't try getting a photo of that famous oven, they really don't like it. Unlike Lombardi's where I was invited behind the counter to get a closer snap.
