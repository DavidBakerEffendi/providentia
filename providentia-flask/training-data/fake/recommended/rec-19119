French and Spanish charcuteries and small plates plus a decent and well priced wine list, 2 people, 5 dishes, a bottle of wine, plus tip came in under $100.00.  Great atmosphere, great place, seemed to be filled with younger locals.  Well worth the stop, excellent place that nails what it sets out to do.
