What better way to spend Christmas Eve than to hit up the infamous Umami Burger for dinner!?   The BF & I started with the Umami Caesar salad (baby kale & butter lettuce, white anchovy, fresh Parmesan, & Caesar dressing).  I could have done without it, but the BF has a true devotion to Caesar salad with anchovies!   I chose The Original burger (parmesan frico, shitake mushroom, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, and Umami house ketchup).  Although a bit messy, the size and combination of sweet & savory flavors were perfect!  The BF really liked his Hatch Burger with roasted green chiles, house American cheese, and garlic aioli.  I'm pretty sure he even added avocado... that's my man!!   In addition to our burgers, we shared the thin fries and sweet potato fries.  Both were made just right, but those sweet & salty sweet potato fries had me addicted at first bite!   Although there were a few hiccups with the service, we were both very pleased with our dinner at Umami burger.. especially coming in with such high expectations!
