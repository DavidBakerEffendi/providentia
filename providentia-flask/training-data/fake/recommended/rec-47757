I love Mamoun's.  I moved out of state years ago and haven't found another middle eastern restaurant that offers the same variety as Mamoun's.  Here's a breakdown... Authentic middle eastern staples [falafel, hummus, grape leaves, baclava].  The falafel mix is made from fresh ingredients & crispy to perfection. The sandwiches are built in a pita, not lavash bread as in most California falafel joints - so people from the west coast should be prepared this food is a bit different.  The menu also offers comfort foods that I haven't seen anywhere else [Ful Mudammas & Mouhjedra, Syrian rice, Makdoos, Kibbeh].  I strongly recommend trying some of these other dishes because it's not everyday you can find these comfort foods.   Prices are really affordable! And Mamoun's is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year so you have no excuse not to try it. It's not a fancy restaurant.  The food is served on paper plates, cups and wax paper or foil.  So don't come in expecting anything other than good, affordable food & a really authentic down home middle eastern atmosphere. This place is a gem, can't find no other middle eastern restaurant like this.
