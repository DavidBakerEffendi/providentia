I don't love paying $12 for a cocktail anywhere, ever, but I'll do it when I know that my drink will be well made and taste good. It's becoming a common theme here in New York that the drink description sounds super promising but rarely does the cocktail actually deliver. Such was the case at this hip, overpriced, slightly intolerable spot. The Ginger Smash was mediocre. The service (lots of young model-type guys with giant quaffs and annoyed faces) was mediocre. The food was pretty, but mediocre. The only thing extraordinary about The Smith was the fact that 90% of their patrons are fucking douchebags. Rich, whiny, ridiculous douchebags. I particularly appreciated the folks behind us taking their friend out to lunch so that they could berate her loudly and argue for the entirety of their (and our) lunch. It really added to the conversation I was having with my dining companion ....that we stopped bothering to have after a few minutes because we could hardly hear each other over the din. On the other side of us was a table full of nitpickers- torturing the server with their self importance and entitlement. As I looked around I realized that table after table was filled with privileged dingbats picking at their salads with bored expressions, legs surrounded by shopping bags filled to the brim courtesy of daddy's credit card. Gross. If you enjoy being around that shit (and obviously many people do because it was packed) and eating food that isn't very good, but the prices imply that it should be- this is the perfect place for you. I'm never stepping foot in this vapid hole again.
