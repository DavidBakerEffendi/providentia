Not sure why the low ratings but this place is fantastic for authentic Hong Kong style Chinese food in the area. Dim sum is good, I even find it much better than anything in Philly. Their regular entress are good too, I would recommend these highly: - Peking pork chops: Crispy on the outside but super soft on the inside, just phenomenally cooked. - Black pepper udon noodles with beef: Just a great combination - Pork belly with preserved vegetables: It could be done better, but does the trick and tastes even better as left overs. I would avoid their beef chow fun, I was really hoping for it to be good since it always ran out, but tried it three times and each time it was bland. The service isn't too bad, its not the greatest during Dim Sum, but that is pretty much expected at any authentic Chinese place. Though during dinner, the food always ends up coming out lighting fast Prices are pretty good too, pricier than NYC but still a good value considering the portions.
