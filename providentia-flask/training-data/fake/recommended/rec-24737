I really wanted to give this place 3 stars, but the service was sooooooo bad I had to drop it to 2.   Great location and a much needed addition to the neighborhood with "good" BBQ.  We were a party of 4-wing appetizer was great, baby back ribs were great, St Louis ribs and brisket were OK at best.  They use a dry rub and don't smother the dishes in BBQ sauce which I really liked.  Unlike other reviewers, i found the baby back ribs meaty and flavorful.  1/2 price app's before 7pm (which we just missed).  The killer of this place is the service. They weren't crowded, there was plenty of staff, but we were continually ignored, as were the tables around us.  Wait staff would come by, ask if we wanted a re-fill and never return. Plates were left to build up even after we ask they be removed (I'll be right back for that") I'd excuse it to a point if they were understaffed or busy, but the service simply sucks...they've been open long enought to work out the kinks.  Save your money and go elsewhere.  Hat City Kitchen is right down the block and while I actually like the ribs here just slightly better,  Hat City has a much better atmosphere and the service is stellar.
