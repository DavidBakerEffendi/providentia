A cute and homey space, I went here for brunch not too long ago.  A couple of comments:  best fresh squeezed orange juice I've had outside of Florida, everything on the menu looks incredibly delicious, they don't have whipped cream to top your waffles or french toast (huge bummer since the waffles, though excellent, really needed it), and get there early or expect to wait 45min to an hour.
