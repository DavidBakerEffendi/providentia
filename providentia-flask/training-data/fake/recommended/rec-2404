There was only one waiter working when we went, so we got ignored.  That's not the waiter's fault, it's the management's.  I thought the sushi was tasty, but it was WAY too expensive for what we got.  The rolls were tiny and I left hungry.  Bummer.  We won't be returning.  I think this place took that "best of Philly" award and got a little ahead of itself.   Side note: obnoxious family next to us came to a sushi place and asked for substitutions for all the fish in all the dishes they ordered.  wtf....if you don't like fish you should not go to a sushi restaurant and order dishes with fish in them.  rude
