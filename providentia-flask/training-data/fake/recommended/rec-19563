Food was great, nice selection of breakfast entrees. This was my first visit and I will be going back for sure. The only negative I have is the exceptionally long wait ,I went early on a Sunday morning and for a party of 2 waited 45 minutes. Â  Facility is not large hence not a great deal of wait space , not a good thing when it is cold outside. The wait staff was attentive. I had the egg white frittata w/turkey bacon this is served with LeBus bread and home fries the portions are nice.
