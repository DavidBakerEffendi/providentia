I was going to give this place more stars cause it's a great hang out, but they recently changed the menu a bit and I think the food has taken a bit of a dive. The new cheese board is awful. I dunno if they are trying to be cheap or something. It's also very cramped inside, if you are lucky you can get a seat out back. But I like the atmosphere, the staff and the beer selection. It's a cool place to hang out. Especially since it is hard to find places like that on the upper east side. I'd go back but not for the food. Although try those hard boiled beet eggs- it seems weird but they taste good.
