Yeah this place has really good pizza (duh). All of the ingredients were nice and fresh, and the pizza was light. I didnt have that "aww man i stuffed myself" feeling after i finished eating. I made the mistake of taking the advice of the waitress and had white pizza as one half of my pie. It was ok but the other half of my pizza was the bomb. They made me wait forever for my seat since i was by myself which was pretty wack. Lucky for them i was hungry as hell.
