This is more a 3.5 star but not quite a 4 star...After last year's christmas dinner disaster at Bryant Park Grill, i decided to come to Ai Fiori for their $125 pp christmas menu this year as they have one Michelin star awarded to them, i didnt want to take any risk of a bad dinner again on christmas.. Arrived at 6:15 for my dinner reservation and we waited an additional 20 mins! We werent seated until 6:35 pm, big minus in my book when a restaurant make you wait 20 mins past your reservation time.  Once we were seated the service was pretty fast though.  The restaurant is big and the seats are super comfortable!  We got the lobster soup and fluke crudo as appetizer, the soup was very rich and full of seafood flavor but there was only 3 tiny pieces of lobster meat in it, the crudo was fresh and a lot thicker than what I am used to.  I was really excited to try their famous trofie nero (squid ink pasta) but I ended up being very disappointed, I dont know if that's how the dish was suppose to be but they put soo much lemon juice that all i tasted was the acidity, I definitely had much better squid ink pasta elsewhere. For main entree I got their long island duck.  They cooked the duck perfectly, its extremely moist with the perfect gamey taste, its as good as the duck breasts I had in paris! I would come back just to have their duck entree again. I had a good time at Ai Fiori but for a one michelin star restaurant, I wasnt really blown away by their food.  Everything tasted pretty good but nothing was really that extraordinary except the long island duck which was really good.  However I couldnt get past the fact we waited 20 mins for our table with no apology or simple acknowledgement....normally I wouldnt mind as much but for a high end restaurant with such a high price tag, they should be able to do a better job at time management.  We ended up spending $400 for 2 people which is not a big deal but I left the restaurant feeling underwhelmed...
