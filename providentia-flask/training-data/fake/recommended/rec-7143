All I can say is you had me at pork belly adobo! The mussels in lemongrass broth were another favorite. Everyone at my table chose something different, so we all tried each other's dishes. Don't forget to order the coconut rice! Everything was delightfully seasoned and prepared! An adventurous foodie heaven!
