Welcome to Pepe's. You have just stepped back in time to 1943 and should get ready to enjoy a tomato pie with cheese, sprinkled with olive oil, and parmesan. I'd give this place a five for ambience, five for service, 6 for deliciousness and character. It is absolutely fantastic and worth every minute of the wait. Even worth a special trip to New Haven from Brooklyn-where I hail. The pizza is served on a metal tray on top of slices of thin butcher block paper. The Margarita can't be beat-where you should start. Don't leave the clam pizza off your order its amazing.
