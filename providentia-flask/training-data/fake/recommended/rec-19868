We live across the street so we decided to give it a try.  Pretty pricey. Example - their tasting ,menu was $90.  The servers were all great, polite without being snobby, which is particularly appreciated considering the neighborhood.  my pet peeve is being in a fancy restaurant and having servers trained to treat customers like gods/goddesses. anyways, ambience wise, it was dimly lit, but not overly dim/dark.  the set-up of the tables was not my favorite.  it lacked a feeling of privacy, because the majority of the tables are just sprinkled throughout a large empty space.  i could almost completely hear the conversation of the table next to us. the regular menu is broken into 4 sections.  they are small dishes so its recommended to order 2-3 per person.  me and my date ordered a dish of endive, a cauliflower dish, a dish of scallops, and a dish of cod.  we topped it off with an AMAZING piece of banana cream pie.  oh man, that pie was something else.  tacky as it might be, i will probably see if i can just order the dessert to go. we left satisfied - definitely not overly full, but thats an american norm anyways - expect to and to eat like gluttons. i dont drink alcohol so our bill wasnt as high as it likely would be for drinkers.  $120 bill for the aforestated,   all of the food was excellent and very innovative.  however, if you are a picky eater, definitely look at the menu before committing.  there arent any "typical" or "usual" items.   downer for a post dinner treat for me is that they ONLY have french press coffee.  i love a good cappucino after my meal.  and as for the french press, it was only available with whole milk and "regular" sugar. i can see why a person would like this place more than i do, but i definitely wont be going back.  mostly because despite the professionalism of the servers, it had a stuffy energy, and i personally prioritize that highly.  id give the food a 4.5, but overall just a 3 for me.
