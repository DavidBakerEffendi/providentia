both the chicken and lamb meat over rice with white sauce are great.  however, there is something still better, which is iskender kebab (turkish food in europe) that i haven't seen replicated here yet.  but at 3 AM for $5, this meal certainly satisfies.  i added a little too much red sauce -- it is fairly hot.  to know you have the right place and not the imitators, look for the yellow bag.  there are 3 carts, but i stayed with the one at 53rd and 6th SW corner, line wasn't too bad.  a persistent small line is good since makes the turnover fast which = fresher/tastier.  these people have it down to a science to keep the line moving.
