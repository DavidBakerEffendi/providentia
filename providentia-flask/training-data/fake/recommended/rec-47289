Love this place!  The space is absolutely beautiful with long wooden beams intersecting in random patterns above you, making you feel like you're in a section of the Guggenheim.  They play a lot of Lebanese pop music, which also contributes to the fun atmosphere.     The food:   We went here for restaurant week, and all four of us were blown away by the quality.  You can order two appetizers a person.  The highlights were the hummus and mouhamara, but the kebab kerez stole the show.   Order more than one order if you can because it's that good.  They bring it out in a hot small skillet with some cherry sauce over it and wow.... the salty meat goes perfectly with this sweet sauce.  Oh and the warm pita bread came endlessly. Main dish: My steel head trout was a bit dry, but I loved the olive sauce on the side. The gnocchi was definitely my favorite main course though.   My friend was nice enough to share.   I love the creative yogurt sauce, and the gnocchi was fluffly and melts in your mouth.  A+ The cheese cake was mild- just the way I like it.   Not too heavy.  I would definitely recommend getting the ashta.  The cream had just a hint of salt, and the honey syrup around it was perfect.  I loved the Lebanese ice cream as well.  I got the pistachio, and it had a hint of rosemary.  The consistency was very surprising due to its foamy texture.   Service was great too! This is the way restaurant week should work.   They have made a loyal customer out of me, and I'm bringing friends.
