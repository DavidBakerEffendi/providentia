My friends were on a pub crawl: Mcgillans, PBR, National Mechanics etc but I told them I wanted to stop here. It was pretty crowded, and much smaller than the other places. My friend ordered calamari, which had jalapenos, and he wasn't crazy about it.  The skinny hipsterish male bartender acted as if he was too cool to help us explore our drink options; he was very annoyed we didn't know exactly what we wanted and acted if he was too good to be bartending there.  He knew a lot more about beer than the girl bartender, who couldn't recommend me a wheat or white beer bc she didn't know about the options they served, but I just didn't want to talk to someone like that. So we only stayed for a drink.  Prices were higher than the other bars too. I really wanted to like this place too...(however, I could see how it could be a hipster hang out spot)
