My son and I walked over to Chelsea Market on a Friday night to get some good tacos. We're from Santa Monica and have been traveling on the East Coast for a little while, so we were jonesing for some flavors from home. We weren't disappointed. Where we live the best tacos are found on trucks, and while these aren't quite that great, they were delicious, filling, and cheap. Like every place in NYC, there was a line, but that's not the restaurant's fault. It just means they're doing something right.
