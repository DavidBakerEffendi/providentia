If you are hungry, don't go here. The menu and the mini 1$ skewers of meat will rape you and your wallet, unless you are not paying for it, then go right ahead. They charge 8$ for a kirin??? woooah babaaaay. If you want to go cheap, go to pho cali and drink up and eat up before you go do their appetizer sized bites and over priced mini list of beers. Unless if you want okay sushi, then its a safe point, I guess...(go in wednesday for half off rolls) It's a good place to go with you and your friends and go bonkers with the karaoke during the weekdays if you and your friends have time.... If you can figure out the karaoke machine. Or just rent the room and watch a really drunk friend figure out the machine. (if you ever do that, invite me!!!) Not the best karaoke setup but it definitely is worth a try if you don't have anything else to compare with.
