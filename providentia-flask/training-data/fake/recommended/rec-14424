Jungsik was one of the most impressive meals I've had in a long time. Their flavors were complex, the dishes well composed, and the subtle Korean influence was a joy to experience. We got the tasting menu and added a full-size Pork Jowl and a full-size Jang Dok. I also asked that the mushroom course be substituted since I dislike mushrooms. The progression of the meal was very good and the dishes were consistently impressive. The portion sizes here are actually quite large and I probably should have substituted dishes for the tasting menu instead of adding on extra dishes, but everything was so tasty I'm glad I tried everything I could. The raw scallop presentation is a great dish. Three scallops on top of uni sauce and fresh apples and cucumbers made a very strong start to the meal. The squid ink panko fried oysters were perfect. The crispy red snapper with cilantro (or parsley?) tom yum was spectacular. Instead of the mushrooms, they gave me a tasting portion of the wagyu beef and truffle bibimbap (with quinoa instead of rice). The pork jowl with sweet and sour broth was my favorite dish of the night. From beginning to end, the meal exceeded my expectations. The tasting menu changes often, but I would say the scallops, the oysters, the crispy red snapper, and the pork jowl are must-eats. If they're not on your tasting menu, do a substitution to get them or just order them on the side. I don't think I have ever had a meal where every dish was as strong as it was at Jungsik. Each dish had flavor combinations I have never had before with great complexity and texture. The pork jowl was not on my tasting menu. I have no idea what I would have substituted on my tasting menu to get the pork jowl. That shows how strong the menu was. Why is Jungsik not 3 stars?
