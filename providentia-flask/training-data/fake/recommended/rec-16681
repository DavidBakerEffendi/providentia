I stopped by here with my brother for some breakfast. At the Brooklyn location, they automatically give you free mini pastries while you wait for your order to come out. but not so at this establishment... or perhaps just not for our table for 2, I'm still not sure. as for the food. it's decent breakfast and cup of coffee. but really 2 eggs, sausage and toast with homefries and a cup of coffee x 2... for almost 40 dollars? A bit overpriced if you ask me.
