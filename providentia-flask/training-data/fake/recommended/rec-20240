Yes the Bronte Burger is Delicious. And I thought the arugula, shrimp avocado salad was too. Until I ordered it for delivery one Saturday. It took 50 minutes to arrive. For ONLY 13.95 plus tip.... I received a flavorless, sour arugula salad. I ate a couple of bites and had to throw it away. All 16+ dollars worth. How depressing. But I'm reliving this depressing moment for you- so you'll never make the same mistake I did.
