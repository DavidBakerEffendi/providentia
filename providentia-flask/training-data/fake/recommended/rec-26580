On Thursday headed to the Town Hall Deli for lunch with Carmela my buddy and at the last minute changed our minds and walked across the street to Papillon 25. What a great decision. I had the filet mignon surrounded by a scrumptious brown sauce, and string beans and scalloped potatoes. OH MY GOODNESS!  Kudos to Ricardo the chef .........I asked for the filet "medium" and it was cooked perfectly. Perfectly!   The knife slid through it like butter, that's how tender and juicy it was.   Outrageously delicious. I was licking the plate!  Honestly the best filet mignon I've ever had.  Awesome!   And thanks to Jibari for the great Champagne Cocktail. Looking forward to my second visit.
