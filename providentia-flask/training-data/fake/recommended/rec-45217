Senorita's is actually one of the few restaurants in the area that serves decent Mexican food. I used to go here often, but lately the service is so awful, especially considering the relatively high pricetag, that it's completely turned me off. The food is good-not-great. Good portion sizes, usually cooked correctly and to temp. Steak is often tough so either it's being overcooked or (more likely) they are not using quality cuts of beef which is unacceptable considering the prices there. The service is really abominable and that's where they lose the most stars. Delivery takes a crazy long time - over an hour every time, and that's when they actually remember to bring your food at all. They seem annoyed at having to even take an order over the phone which is crazy. In the restaurant it's no better. Long wait times for your food, surly untrained waitstaff who often gets orders incorrect because they are distracted, and because the restaurant is busy they seem to feel like they can get away with it. Not worth the money in my opinion. Their margaritas are lousy too.
