We arrived a few minutes early for our 8PM reservation; a very pleasant lady said there would be a short wait for our table.  We waited outside as it was a pleasant evening and there is no space to wait inside.  The beet salad and the pear salad were amazing and another guest with our party raved about the wild mushroom soup selection they offered that evening.  The salmon and skate were deliciously prepared and perfectly done.  The steak was tender and delicious, the sauce not overpowering. We will be back.
