I don't get the hype around this place. I've heard so many friends talk about how great this place is and it's only subpar at best. Food was kinda gross and cold and the dumplings weren't really that good. While their prices were great, the food was not. I won't ever return. Would rate zero stars if I could! Edit: not only that but it also made me incredibly sick! I threw up all night and felt rather horrible. Definitely never grabbing food here again.
