I've been going here since 2001. The best hole in the wall, fresh soup takeout spot in the Penn Station/Madison Square Garden area. Over a dozen choices of fresh soups to choose from, with the menu changing daily. A "large" bowl, with a piece a bread, a piece of fruit (usually a banana, apple or orange) and a small half sandwich will run you just under $8.00. Good stuff.
