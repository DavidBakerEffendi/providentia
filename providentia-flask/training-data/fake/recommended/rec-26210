Thursday evening around 7:30, but still many people waiting, I waited about 20 minutes, not a long line compare to Ippudo. I ordered spicy ramen, and cucumber as appetizer, the waitress recommended me cucumber but it was not salty, the ramen was OK but not surprising as I thought, maybe not go another time.
