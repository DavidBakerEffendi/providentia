This place had decent reviews so we decided to try it. I don't like writing bad reviews but since I depend on them to choose where we will eat, I have to be honest. . We were very disappointed. The service was good but I can't say the same for the food or the value.  We had the Buffalo shrimp appetizer - medium size shrimp at best. It was $7.95 for 5 shrimp. They were not breaded and they were served with cheap tasting blue cheese dressing. The seafood chowder was watery - not creamy. . The fried shrimp were tasteless and rubbery. The french fries tasted like they were frozen before being fried. The fish and chips - priced at $13.95 on the menu but according to our server "that is for a thinner fish called 'bassi' or 'basa." (not sure which). If you want cod, the thicker fish, it's an additional $3. There was one piece of cod with some french fries and cole slaw for $16.95. A total let down...this is supposed to be "what they do best." It was also a turn off to be told we had to pay $3 extra for cod which is what should be used anyway. Don't advertise $13.95 fish and chips and then tell me when I order that basically I have to pay an additional $3  for the real thing. We will not be going back to Argyle...not good and pricey.
