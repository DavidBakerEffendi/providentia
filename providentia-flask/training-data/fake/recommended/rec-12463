I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and I was really excited about trying it out. When I finally got around to it, I had the pulled pork hash, and I liked it, but I don't think I liked it enough to ever come back. I'm glad that I can cross it off of my never-ending Places to Eat in NYC bucket list though.
