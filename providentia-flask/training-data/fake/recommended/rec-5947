OK, so I didn't adventure too far into their menu, stuck to what I know, kept it light, and do have to go back and then update this review. But, where I did go - beef capriccio, pepper ravioli, artichoke - was fantastic. The pepper ravioli (I am not using the name they did and I promise it is more amazing than the name I give it leads you to believe) was the highlight of the meal for me and was just mouth watering. As well, the side of artichoke was marinated and cooked nicely and really added the perfect flavor contrast.
