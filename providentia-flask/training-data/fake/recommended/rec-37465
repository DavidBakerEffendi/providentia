I, like so many others, find brunch to be the most fun and delicious meal of them all-- and Le Barricou is at the top of my list for favorite brunch spots!  The Bloody Marys are fantastic, and the last time I was there I had an egg-white and goat cheese omelet that I loved.  The food is great and the atmosphere is equally appealing.  I try to go back here every chance I get and love introducing people to it.
