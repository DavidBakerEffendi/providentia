So I went to this restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. I read that it was a nice restaurant on a new haven magazine so I decided it was appropriate for the occasion. First, they have parking in the back, so I loved that. When I was seated, I was greeted by a waitress who was very friendly and had the specials memorized. Great! We ordered two mojitos to start. Mine was a coconut mojito, my friends a passion fruit mojito. It was possibly the worst drink I've had ever. It tasted like pure alcohol. Where's the coconut? The waitress asked if they could fix it, I gave them an opportunity. When it came back, it was worse!  It tasted like Pepto-Bismol and alcohol. Yuck! I asked for a glass of wine instead. The food was actually very tasty, everything that came to the table was delicious and it all came out on time, one after the other. However, I came in hungry, hoping to come out full but it didn't happen that way. The appetizers we soooo small. I know they're tapas, but sheesh, they were way too small. Like, you could eat everything on one plate with a bite or two. I'd say in comparison to Barcelona, a spanish tapas bar, Barcelona tastes better, has better tapas, they are $1 or $2 cheaper and you go home full and satisfied. In all, I spent over $100.00 and left hungry :( In addition to sad ending, my stomach became sick and I threw it all up two hours later. These are some of the things I ate. Gambas al Ajillo      $8.75 Ensalada de Rúcula $ 7.50 Queso Nevat con Higos y Nueces $8.25 Pepito de Filete $ 8.75 Paquetitos de Cordero $9.75 Croquetas de Chocolate $7.50 Bananas Caramelizadas $ 7.00 If you are someone with a small appetite and just drinks wine then you have absolutely no problem here. But if you're someone like me, who has a bigger appetite, Be warned, eat something before hand.
