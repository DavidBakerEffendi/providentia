The blueberry pancakes that everyone talks about are DELICIOUS. SO GOOD. Their other desserts/sweet brunch foods are good too. But their dinner service (I didn't realize they did savory dinner foods for a while because their pancakes are just that good) is also really, really good. All the dishes I tried (some were on their specials menu, some were regular) were well prepared and nicely plated. Service was attentive without being pushy. I asked for recommendations because I'm bad at decision-making when there's a menu of endless delicious-sounding dishes in front of me, and all the recommendations made my taste buds very happy. I went earlier than normal for dinner, so there wasn't a long wait (mid-week), but later at around 7 or so, the line got a little longer. Brunch always has a massive line, I think. But it's worth it.
