First time I went on a Saturday around 1pm, I waited for a good 30min as the line wrapped around the whole place. But after taking a bite of the roast pork with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe I would say it was well worth the wait! I went again on a Monday afternoon around 2pm and they've relocated to another part of the market not too far from the previous spot and the size of their place doubled so more people can eat in and therefore the wait time was cut well in half! The roast pork may not be the most tender I had compared to John's Roast Pork but with the sharp provolone and the spices of the broccoli rabe made a perfect balance! It also tastes great after a day old too! I would say just plan your trip back to DiNic's wisely!
