Took delivery an hour and a half (I live 2 blocks away). When I called to check on my order they told me the delivery guy had come in late and was out on another run, but my food was ready and waiting for him to get back. They made no offer to me for having to wait so long, and it was clear that my food had been ready for some time as it was cold when I finally received it. In their defense I believe they finally sent a cook to deliver the food. Still, a bit late and a bit cold for the price. Not to mention it was not the best brunch food I've had.
