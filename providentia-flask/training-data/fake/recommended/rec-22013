We were driving through the area and saw some easy street parking so we stopped. Shanty on the Shore was right there where we parked and it was one of the few places that wasn't advertising its view as a selling point. As a general point, I won't eat anywhere that is selling the view. I can't eat the view so it is pretty irrelevant to my dining. The food was fine. It wasn't anything spectacular and the service was satisfactory. It was a solid causal seafood dining experience.
