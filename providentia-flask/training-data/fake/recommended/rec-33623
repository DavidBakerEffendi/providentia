Currently my favorite pizza spot in New York.  Its not your traditional triangular New York slice, its authentic Italian pizza and its so, so good.  I'm giving it 5 stars despite having had small issues with management, service, the temperature and space, etc.  None of it matters when you bite into the tartufatta or buffala pizza and savor every bite.  When I say a perfect crust, I mean a perfect crust.  Bless you Luzzo's and thank you for delivering this delicious (and not overly expensive) meal.
