For 3 measley dollars, you will get the best falafel in NYC.  I've tried a crapload of falafels in LES, EV, midtown, street carts, williamsburg...and they all pale in comparison.  Also, almost everyone one of those falafels were more expensive than Oasis'!   Oasis is opened 24/7, can make your falafel in about 10 seconds, and conveniently located by the subway station.   All falafels have some kind of veggies with the falafel in the pita.  90% of falafel places will give you some wilted lettuce and tomato combo.  It's pretty gross.  At Oasis, you see ALL their veggies in front of you when you order.  There is lettuce, purple cabbage, pickles, tomatoes, and onions.  Every single one of these ingredients is completely seasoned with salt, pepper, and vinegar.  Blasting this falafel past the stratosphere of falafels (the only other falafel I've ever had that was slightly better was in Barcelona).  This is the king of cheap eats. My only gripe is that the other things they have on display in the window have no names.  And sometimes I'm curious to try them, but have no idea what the fuck they are called, or how much they cost.  Only people who grew up with this stuff know.  So I'm forced to either have a falafel or a lamb/chicken sandwich, and nothing else.  Booo. I still love you guys, and please don't ever change the prices!!
