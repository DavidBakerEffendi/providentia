I will try and be fare in my review...This is another organic/locally grown themed restaurant. We used to live in the neighborhood but as soon as we moved across town several great spots opened up here. We sat outside in their alley which has heaters and features a mural and soon a wood fireplace. The food was on point. We ordered crab cakes, sea bass, and chicken entr√©es with a lobster flatbread appetizer. The food was excellent. We ordered cocktails as well which were pricey but strong. Our food was a little slower than tables around us but the service never lagged. Now this isn't really a go to pub (due to the prices of the meals) however it is a great date out or if you are from out of town and want something really special. I suspect their lunch menu is a little lighter and easier on the wallet. We will be sure to check that out soon. Oh, there is a bar so drinks only us always an option.
