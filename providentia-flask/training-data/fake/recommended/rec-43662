after trying to go to Grill 21 prior to this meal (very unsuccessfully) i was still craving some good filipino food. i headed down to maharlika and i was so happy the minute i walked in. the hostess was super sweet. and we started the meal with the baguio breeze and paquio punch drink. yummy! great service, great atmosphere. very happy customer :) highly recommend their sisig. will def be back!
