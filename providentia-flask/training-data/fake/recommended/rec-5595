My husband and I came here for dinner on a whim based on our Yelp search of the area and we were pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent - it was actually quite refreshing to have such great service! Food was good.. starting from the bread to our falafel appetizer to our chicken and lamb dish. I had only wished my pita bread wasn't under the meat because it was soaked and soggy. But it was still good nonetheless. You get a lot of food for what you pay! We will certainly come back to try other dishes in the future!
