Like the atmosphere more than the food.  Really cool decor with a small outside patio in the back. Roasted corn was bland. Think I may have ordered the wrong menu item.  Everything else that came out of the kitchen looked MUCH better than my dish.  Can't complain though, my food was good just didn't blow me away.
