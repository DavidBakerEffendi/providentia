A great family restaurant. Best known for their pizza, but the rest of their menu is good too. I'd recommend the native tomato pie when it's in season and the chicken parm pizza or pepperoni. I wouldn't rank this pizza far behind the big 3 (or 4 if you count Grand) in New Haven, but since I live literally within 2 minutes drive you might say I'm biased. They can get very busy on Friday nights so be prepared. It's like winning the lottery when you don't get a busy signal on the phone. Sometimes I've dialed non-stop with 2 cell phones until I get through ;-) but it's worth it! The staff is really friendly too. You can tell that Neil the owner works very hard and cares a lot about the business that his parents started 25 years ago. He's a nice guy so if you live in the area you have to give them a try at least once.
