I'm a vegetarian that dabbles in chicken, and since I work in south philly (the navy base, if you must), I get the opportunity to check out some of the fine eateries in our area.  I'm usually hesitant about chicken cheesesteaks, but all the hype of JRP (or JERP, as we say) piqued my interest.  The storefront is nothing special, larger than a shack, with some tables outside.  All the glory lies in the sandwich itself, which is freshly cooked, and served on a FANTASTIC south philly seeded italian roll.  They offer some toppings/condiments (I recommend that you research what you want before you go, since the folks there are known as cheesesteak nazis)  that you can throw on, but I've found that a chicken cheesesteak with onions and peppers and a splash of hot sauce is the perfect lunch meal.  Mix it with a Stewarts soda and some kettle chips and you're in heaven.  I've also found the best way to reheat a cheesesteak from them is to wrap it in foil and bake at a low temp for a while, and then remove foil and bake a higher temp for a short while, and boom, awesome cheesesteak ready to eat at home. GO THERE!
