Food is great but nothing exceptional. I only order here because of great pricing.    As for delivery, I just want to warn you that there's a delivery guys who would demand tips. I seriously had a 5 min argument with him telling him that the tip is not required. I was honestly going to give him a tip too but when he started demanding it i held my tip back. this happened twice, the first one caught me off guard. But the second time I was ready.(lol) Food: 3 stars Pricing:4 stars Delivery: 1 star
