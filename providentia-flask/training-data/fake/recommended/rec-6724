The food here is amazing! I love the Gorgonzola bacon cheese fries, the penne vodka with prosciutto, the salads, and especially the french onion soup. They once had this amazing spicy corn chowder, but I haven't seen it since. Not a great place to watch a game - I couldn't find any room at the bar, and there weren't many TVs (and definitely no volume) in the other dining areas. Service can be slow, but the food makes up for it. It's a warm, homey atmosphere, and a great place for a casual dinner out. It can be a bit busy, so if you go at dinner time on a weekend, be prepared for a wait.
