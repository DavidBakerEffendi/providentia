I had two friends in from out of town.  One lives on the west coast and one on the east coast.  They absolutely loved the dining experience at Pylos.  I would recommend all of the items that we ordered.   Appetizers: salmon cakes with fresh herbs and olive oil, served with greek-yogurt skordalia and kolokythakia kai melitzanakia tyganita!!!! Main Dishes: brizola and the lavraki me tsigarellia were to die for!!! Of course they had a bottle of wine.  The prices are so reasonable, the decor was awesome and the staff catered to us well!!!
