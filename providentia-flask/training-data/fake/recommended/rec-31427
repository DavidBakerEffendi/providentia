Amazing pizza. I'm not sure what I could say that hasn't been said before, but we got the potato, garden, hot pepper and cheese, a clam, and a pepperoni. I tried all the veggie ones and they were fantastic. I thought 5 pizzas was going to be too much for our 8 person group, but we only had a few pieces left over. I know that the hype is clearly the pizza and so not much thought is put into offering or bringing drinks, but this place could benefit from better beer options, wine (one in my party was sad about this), and better service in general, including bringing water. That being said, I will definitely be back.
