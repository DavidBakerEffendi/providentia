What a great dining experience! We were looking for a superb meal without being stuffy and hen of the wood didn't disappoint. The ambiance is modern rustic - tables are not crammed together and they have a nice seating area for drinks next to the fire while you wait for your table. We dined on the coppa (great -the cured meats they do in house), peach/pepper special small plate (great flavors), the corn chowder (good but my least favorite), the hanger steak (big enough to share if you aren't starving) and green beans (very rich) and ended the night with one of the local cheeses. All of the dishes were very flavorful with some innovative touches. With such attentive wait staff and truly amazing food, I was happy to pay the bill at the end of the night. Days later and we are still raving about the experience!
