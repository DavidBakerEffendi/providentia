Awesome staff, ambience, food and real coffee! Great for week day breakfast and weekend brunch. So awesome to have a local that opens at 7.30am! Only minor gripe is they don't bring utensils out to table with food so when their gorgeous food comes to the table, you have to leave it and pick up your own knife and fork. Otherwise this place is perfect!
