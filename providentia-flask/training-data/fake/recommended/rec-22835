I always wondered why there was never a Korean bbq restaurant in Connecticut. I came to this place on xmas and was really Impressed with the decor. My family was promptly seated. We were able to get a high chair for my kid which was good. We ordered a few things. Pork belly,  galbi and sushi rolls. The pork belly was awesome but the  galbi was amazing   The flavor was bursting and the marinade just right. There were many complimentary side Dishes =ban chan, very authentic like something my mom would make.  I'm happy this opened as i will be coming often. The waitstaff is extremely nice and friendly and the place has full sushi bar and a liquor license. Merry xmas Seoul BBQ!
