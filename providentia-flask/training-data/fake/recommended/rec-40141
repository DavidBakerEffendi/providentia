Great blood orange margaritas and steak tacos. No comment on the guacamole because I couldn't be less interested in guacamole. Do not show up on Thursday, Friday or Saturday night after 5:00-5:30 without a reservation or they will be all like "we'll call you." yeah. Just like your last one night stand. Not worth it and never happening again.
