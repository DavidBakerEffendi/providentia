My eggs benedict was stellar and delicious. My husband's bar steak was less exciting, but still good. They charged 5 bucks for iced tea, which our wayward waiter never refilled...arrggh! Manhattan is expensive, I get it, but not to have it refilled is a joke. We enjoyed the ambiance of the old building, and the warmth and hustle and bustle in there on a cool Easter morning. But with the lackadaisical service I doubt we'd return on future trips.
