This place is a tourist trap! I took my brother and sister here for a "taste of Philly". We got two cheeses steaks with onions and provolone, (note I am saying this wrong and if I ordered it this way id probably be refused service) with cheese fries. All Of this cost 24 dollars. After biting into the "steak" I thought I was eating leather. The meat, or so they call it, has zero flavor and was tough. The onions were not cooked and seemed to come from a bag, not fresh at all. The fries were the saving grace of this meal although they tasted like they came from McDonalds. If you wanna pay for terrible food, go here, but there are many other places in Philly, such as reading terminal or Jimmy's Steaks on south street, that have a tourist appeal and actually serve edible food! How disappointing!!
