On 12/18, Masa 8 was offering a buy one entree, get one entree free when you showed the ad from the local Clipper. As soon as my roomie and I saw the ad we called ahead and made a reservation for 6:45pm. Because of the Clipper ad, the restaurant was very crowded. The hostess was overwhelmed and it was obvious that they are never really that busy. Although the hostess was overwhelmed she remained very friendly. My roomie and I noticed that the sushi bar was empty so we suggested sitting at the bar versus waiting for a table. We sat down and the waitress brought over free edamame for us and everyone sitting around us. Maybe this was because we had to wait a little while? Regardless, a sweet gesture. We ordered 3 sushi rolls (spicy tuna, california and something else that I can't remember) and the salmon teriyaki. The sushi rolls came out first and by the time we finished eating the salmon was served. Our waitress apologized to us for having us wait for the salmon, but we shared both meals so the timing of the meal was perfect! Sitting at the sushi bar we watched the two sushi chefs create roll after roll after roll (again, it was a very busy night). They really did not even get a chance to stop until the time we ended our meal. At that time, they started making small talk with us and they were both very friendly. Overall, the food was good, prices were in line with other sushi/asian restaurants and the service was good. I would definitely visit again, coupon or not.
