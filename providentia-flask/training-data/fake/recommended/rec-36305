Let me start by saying that I am NOT a kebab/gyro person, or a fan of greasy food in general. So the fact that I happily queued at lunch times, ate from the cart three times over a five day trip probably says something. Point is, it's that good. There's a reason why the Midtown crowd come here for their lunch-fix, and ignore the hundreds of other carts nearby. Portions are massive, and for $6, what more can you ask for! (As much as I love this halal cart, I wouldn't recommend eating from it as often as I did. Three times in five days was way too much.)
