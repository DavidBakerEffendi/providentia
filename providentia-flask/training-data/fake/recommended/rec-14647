I've tried this place about 3 times and was excited at first but then found that everything is prepared using outside ingredients.  So nothing is actually made there.  The buffalo chicken was chewy tofu tasting like it came from chinatown.  The buffalo sauce to the venganiase is all bought from the stores. I don't think the food is tasty here and i think it's because they don't make the food there.  Vegan food should have some flavor from vegetables and pulses and not be dominated by concentrated soy.  I can get better vegan food at Alphanoose which is a lebanese non vegan restaruant.   I really would like to see Terri survive and hope they change there menu to have items that they actually make vs store bought veganaise over some chinatown tofu on some white bread.
