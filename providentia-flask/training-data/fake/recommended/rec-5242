King Arthur Flour has delicious baked goods!! Their drinks...not so much. WAY too much ice in the iced drinks (if i finish all the liquid in three sips, that's a ripoff) and the hot drinks take far too long to make and are not high quality. More than once I have discovered a flavor syrup/crushed stuff sludge at the bottom of my hot drink. It seems there are always two employees in the back who do nothing while the line reaches out the door. There is no sense of urgency among the employees during peak times and I'm not sure if they realize how much business they lose by not working more quickly though the line. Many people intend to go inside, see the line, and turn away. A little more organization and streamlining the ordering process behind the counter would help a LOT. What keeps me coming back is the quality of the food, but the service gets a D. That's not to say the employees aren't friendly or nice - they are - but efficiency is really important in a cafe, especially one that sees this much traffic. In fact, I'd prefer efficiency over friendliness, if I had to choose. Also, they need to learn to stock more of the in demand items so they don't run out so quickly - it's ridiculous that a bakery runs out of rolls at 2 pm!! I don't know why this issue hasn't been fixed yet. Maybe upper management doesn't know or what, but this is another things that loses business. PRO: quality baked goods, good hot chocolate CON: inefficiency, slow service, long line, poor quality drinks
