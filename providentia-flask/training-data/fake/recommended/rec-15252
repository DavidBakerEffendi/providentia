I LOVE THE CREPES HERE! This is my number 1 place to grab lunch, and apparently everyone's as well (by looking at how ridiculously long the line gets). Both the savory crepes and sweet crepe are amazing! My go tos are roast beef for the savory crepe and mango strawberry with Nutella for the sweet crepe. Thinking about them is making my mouth watering now!
