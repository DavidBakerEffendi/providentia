This is a great place to come to when you're not in the mood for a full meal, but you want to share a few things and drink some good wine. There is seating at the bar, as well as other tables for 2-4 peoples. You seat yourself, and I've never had trouble getting a table. The atmosphere is pretty casual and the lighting is fairly dim, so it works well for a date or a catch-up with a friend. They have an extensive wine list and a good amount of wines by the glass. The servers are friendly and really knowledgeable about the wine. Definitely use them to figure out what you like and don't be shy about trying a few different wines before you make your decision. I also love they have a Riesling on tap! As far as the food goes, its meant to be shared tapas style although they do have a few entree options and sandwiches. I'm a big fan of the veal meatballs, duck confit salad, and the redwine/oxtail risotto balls. While the servings are fairly small, if you get a few things you'll get your fill. They also offer various meats and cheeses, bruschetta, and some bar snacks.
