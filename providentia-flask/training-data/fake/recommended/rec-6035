Went for Dinner after the theater. We had problems getting a cab so I called and told them we would be late. We arrived at 1130 pm and they close at 1 on Saturday. They were extremely friendly and escorted us to the back of the restaurant. The decor was amazing and cozy!!! I asked our server what she recommended and I was also with my mother and aunt. We ordered the Greek salad. No lettuce but it was outstanding!! We also had the saganaki again amazing!!! The 3 meals we had were the moussaka, braised short ribs, and lamb chops..all were FANTASTIC!!!! The manager came by to check on us. It was a fabulous experience and I would highly recommend it and will be back!!! Service, Food and over all experience were phenomenal!!!!!! A+++++
