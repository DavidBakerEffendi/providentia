I live only a few doors down from Little Italy Pizza, so I am very happy to have such good pizza only steps away. Â Pizza being my idea of nature's perfect food, I stop in several times a week. The owners are friendly and the pizza is great; crisp, flavorful crust, way above average tomato sauce and tasty, well prepared toppings. When I call ahead for any of their other menu items, they're always ready in 15 minutes or less. I'm working my way through the entire menu, and have yet to order anything that isn't great (I recommend the chicken parmigiana - bellissima!). Thanks Little Italy, for doing such a good job!
