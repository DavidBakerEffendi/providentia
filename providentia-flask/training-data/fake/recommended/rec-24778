The food was alright here. It wasn't anything amazing, but they definitely had some interesting dishes. As appetizers, I had the Tuna Pizza and the Peking Duck Hand Roll as they were the most raved about on Yelp. The tuna pizza was nothing that interesting except for the fact that it was a play on pizza. The rice on the duck roll was actually very well made, and the duck was great! We also ordered a variety of specialty rolls, including the Deep Sea Roll, the Zento Square Roll, and the Volcano Roll. Our favorite was the volcano as it had a variety of flavors with a crunchy outer layer. However, I felt that it was a bit pricy for what I had. I definitely think you can get similar sushi for cheaper the Philadelphia. Overall though, it was an enjoyable experience.
