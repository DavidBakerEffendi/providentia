Pure expensive garbage. Just ordered the sweet & sour chicken. Never seen chicken like this. It's more like fried chicken dumplings. It had no flavor whatsoever with a side of plain white rice. It's a shame because I've heard nothing but good things from this place. I don't even want to try their sushi anymore. Never again. Stay away.
