You would think that more places would know how to cook a burger properly. Corner Bistro's version is solidly basic, sloppy, cheap and consistent. It also hits on most high notes of when you are craving a charred crusty burger. Not any toppings to speak of, the overall charred ground meat between a bun and some cheese is what you come here for and they just do it so well. Their cooks are not pancaking or stamping the burger down to death so that it loses all of its juices like so many other places. Is it worth it to wait  in a line for this place? Hell no, but if you happen to stroll by and there are seats,  plop yourself down and order a couple of burgers, order of fries and a drink. You'll leave satisfied for $15 bucks.
