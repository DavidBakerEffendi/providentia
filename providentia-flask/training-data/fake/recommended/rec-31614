Not sure what everyone is talking about .....   Had dinner there with two other couples every dish look the same and was fairly non descript and didn't taste all that different. Then if you have to use the rest room you have to walk straight threw the kitchen in the middle of service on slippery floors next to flat tops sauté pans and a working kitchen. Didn't even think that was allowed. Maybe I'm missing something here I love food, love cooking, love trying new things this place was forgetful at best.
