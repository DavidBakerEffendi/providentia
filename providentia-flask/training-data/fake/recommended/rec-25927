Horrible!!  Dirty filthy bathrooms, actually has crust accumulated on the towel dispenser. Stopped eating there in fear of food poisoning. Food is always luke warm NEVER hot.  Save yourself the trip.  Have called the Hanover health dept several times and it hasn't changed. Now we go to Route 23 buffet where the food is consistently great, super clean and we're not afraid of getting sick. I have NO affiliation to Route 23 other than great food, cleanness and clear bathrooms!!!!
