I very rarely give 5 stars. However, Salt & Fat should have 6 stars. I started with the homemade ice tea which was great. Their beer selection is also phenomenal.  I couldn't stop sipping from my husbands IPA. The ambiance is warm and friendly.   Perfect for a date night. It also seemed popular for parents with 1 child. My 7-year old is a picky eater and loved everything on the menu. We shared the  following items - all of which I recommend : Fuji apple and goat cheese salad Scallops Oxtail terrains Arctic char BLT Buns Korean BBQ wraps Fried Chicken Rice Krispie treats. This place has become my Queens favorite.
