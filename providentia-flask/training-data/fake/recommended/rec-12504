During my 2-day trip to NYC, I was able to sample 3 different pizza joints (Lombardi's, NY Pizza Suprema and Patzeria Perfect). If I had to rank them, it would be Patzeria, Pizza Suprema, then Lombardi's. I stopped here for a slice before seeing Phantom of the Opera and would highly recommend visiting this place. I got a thin crust pepperoni and it was perfectly cooked, the cheese was very flavorful and the sauce was the right mix of zest and sweet. Full disclosure, I got the thick sicilian slice square slice from Pizza Suprema, so it's kind of comparing apples and oranges, but I give the slight edge to Patzeria. I also got the thin pepperoni from Lombardi's and Patzeria was overall a better slice IMO. This is a classic small, hole-in-the wall joint off the beaten path from the Times Square craziness, but definitely worth the few minute walk. I definitely recommend checking this place out; you won't be disappointed!
