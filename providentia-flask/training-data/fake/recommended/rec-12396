I went there yesterday and got the burger with fries. I enjoyed the Shoestring fries a lot and really had to stop myself from eating double portions (afterall, I did go there for the fries) The fries were seasoned with tiny fried garlics strips as well as rosemary (no wonder it was so tasty). The burger was cooked just right (medium) so it was juicy but I didn't enjoy it as much because it had blue cheese instead of American or Swiss. I didn't read the description so it was my fault . If I had known there was blue cheese, I wouldnt have gotten it. Blue cheese has a very very strong taste; it overpowered my burger. I tried scraping it off and put more ketchup; failed. Well, at least I had good fries. Service was slow but very courteous. This is a popular place so I'm glad I tried it. I heard their muscle were good, maybe I should've tried that. I don't know if I would want to wait another hour to be seated again . The wait wasn't bad since the location is good. My friend and I had a magnolia cupcake and shared a small cup of Grom before "the spotted pig " called us to let us know that our table is ready.
