I work pretty much right next door and love that they are open later than us! On New Year's Eve, after service and a champagne toast at where I work, myself, the boyfriend, and 3 coworkers and their significant others headed over to Percy Street for some grub and some booze. The bartender Ryan, was wonderful for putting up with our annoying,drunk idiot-like behavior. He made kick ass Manhattan's! He alone gets 5 stars. They have a pretty small late night menu but it was pretty tasty. As a vegetarian I was a bit weary about finding something to eat, but I was successful! Their vegan chili was amazing! I shared it with the others in my group and they(all being carnivores) found it wonderful too. I also tried some of the mac n' cheese, holy shit! That is the best damn mac n' cheese I(and everyone else who tried it) had ever eaten! Gaaah! So good! My only gripe with the food is that their bread is 3rd grader grade Wonder-like white bread. As a carb junky and a lover of the grain, the bread was very disappointing, But, being over-worked, tired, hungry and semi intoxicated, the white bread turned out to be A-Okay. One last thing! The chef, Erin who is a goddess for making us food at a quarter to 1a.m, was such a kind woman! She came out and introduced herself to us. She was very kind and another reason why we will most likely pop back in for some gold old bbq!
