This is a solid addition to the Brooklyn Heights culinary scene and something which fills a really needed vacancy. Aside from Henry's End and Noodle Pudding, Brooklyn Heights lacks a solid representation of neighborhood restaurants where the food is good and the experience great. The food at Jack the Horse is really solid American fare, with a great burger that is always a go-to, a very delicious, smoky macaroni and cheese, and some great salads that change from week to week. Nothing on the menu stands out as unique or amazing, but the restaurant seems happy to stand by the classics and just have a solid all-around menu. Despite the great comfort of their food, the service is somewhat less than impressive. They are very welcoming at the door and seem to be trying their best, but certain things fall through at the table that are somewhat inexcusable. Several times, they have forgotten drinks that were ordered, and they also are very inattentive in terms of replenishing bread and water. Despite these faults, Jack the Horse is a solid neighborhood standby that the Heights can seriously benefit from.
