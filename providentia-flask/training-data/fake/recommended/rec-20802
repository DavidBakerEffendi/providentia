This is my go to place when I want any kind of halal food in the city. The wait is worth it!  From what I noticed, the lines are usually longer very late at night. It's okay though because the workers there are actually very quick and efficient.  I don't even want to go to any other halal truck in the city because I know I will just be disappointed.  I've been here sober and not so sober at times and it always hits the spot.   Be careful with the red sauce, it is VERY VERY spicy. I can only handle a few drops. I prefer drenching my platter in the white sauce.  That white sauce is so freaking good! Do they put crack in there?! As good as it tastes, this is definitely not something I would eat every time I go to the city. I know some people that drive all the way to the city to eat this. I wouldn't.  It's definitely not healthy and the meat is not quality (you get what you pay for). There are so many great options in the city. I usually come here for a really late night meal and  it's usually when someone else wants it. It tastes so good while you're eating this type of food but after you're done eating, you kind of regret it because of the way you are feeling afterwards lol. The portions are huge and the price is VERY good ($6 for a platter), I suggest sharing it or taking some of it to go because you will feel like crap if you eat the entire thing. Food coma to the max if you eat it all!
