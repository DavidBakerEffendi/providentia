Listed as one of the top 20 burgers in America by GQ, I HAD to make sure the Rouge burger lived up to its title. It definitely was one of the best burgers I've had. It was cooked perfectly medium, juice running down your arm delicious. Mmm.... Of course that's not the only thing they serve there. We also had the salmon with asparagus. Salmon was great too! They didn't overcook it as how easily it can be. Â  I think it's supposed to be a swanky bourgois place with the dim lights and super intimate (very close to the next table) environment. Our server was friendly, although not super attentive (we had to try to get her attention on our empty drinks).
