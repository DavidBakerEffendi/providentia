i spend way too much money here. they are in line with my ideology even though i'm a pescatarian. no one, NO ONE can turn down the almond butter chocolate. my only criticism is the first few times i went, the organization of the space was too confusing so i left before giving it a chance. other than that it's the perfect spot. i prefer to takeout than eat in.
