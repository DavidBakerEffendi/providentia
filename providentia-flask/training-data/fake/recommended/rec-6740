I've only sampled some of the food, and I've only been to this place on weekdays before 8pm, so... limited experience.... but I can comfortably say this place overall is at least a 4 star establishment. "Then why the extra star Jake?" Good question you! The fifth star is for the happy hour... This place has above average to well-above average cocktails, and at $10 a piece, one might even say they're 'reasonably priced' in this mixed up world where $10 for a cocktail at the nexus of downtown brooklyn, cobble hill, and ft. greene (?) counts as 'reasonable'. BUT during happy hour (before 7pm) they're 2 for 1.... so quick math... carry the 2.... $5 cocktails! Additionally, the ambiance is pleasant, the wings were pretty great, and the staff is exceedingly friendly... like friendly to the point where you can order 4 happy hour cocktails for 2 people between 6:55 and 7:05 and they won't bat an eyelash (yes. that IS an expression) or call you cheap (at least not to your face!!).
