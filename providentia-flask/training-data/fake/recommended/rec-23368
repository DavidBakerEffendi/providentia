I really enjoyed this place.   My fiance and I actually ate here twice last weekend, once for a light lunch and the next day for brunch.  It was convenient from our hotel, and we liked the outdoor seating.  We are both total suckers for Balthazar and Pastis in NYC, and the menu here is somewhat similar. After about a 25 minute wait on Saturday afternoon, we secured a table outside.  The place was slammed, probably due to the art festival at Rittenhouse Square.  It was warm out, so we opted for a lighter meal.  We started with a bottle fo Chablis, the beet salad, and decided to share the petite plateau seafood platter.  The beet salad was good, but the seafood was AMAZING.  I am usually weary of raw bar platters at restaurants- I find that the shrimp is usually overcooked and rubbery and the oysters/clams to be not as fresh as they could be, but this was declicious.  The dish consisted of shrimp cocktail, mussels, amazingly fresh oysters and clams, ceviche, and octopus salad.  I was beyond impressed.  Service was a little slow, but given how busy they were, our server was pretty attentive. Brunch was somewhat standard fare- we ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, and a croque madame with fries.  Wow, the fries at this place are unreal- probably one of my favorite plates of fries I've had in a long time.   We would definitely come back here next time we are in Philadelphia.  The only thing I was not a huge fan of was all the obnoxious women with their small dogs who seem to frequent this establishment.  Um, your purse dog is not cute- it looks like a rat- get it the fuck out of the restaurant.
