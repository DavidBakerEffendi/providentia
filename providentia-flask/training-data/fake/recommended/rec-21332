Fresh & delicious is the best way to describe this restaurant.  The restaurant is located in a part of Brooklyn that is up and coming; sorta what Williamsburg used to be.   I loved the braised short rib stew for my appetizer.  For my main I got the market fish wrapped in pancetta.  It really hit the spot. The plating is beautiful and I loved the decor.  Their restaurant uses a lot of recycled items and incorporates them into their sleek design.
