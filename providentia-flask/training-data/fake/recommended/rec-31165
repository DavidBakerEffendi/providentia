Ate here for my first time with my family. "Italian comfort food" as we like to call it..the place is ideal for a traditional family dinner. I had been ordering takeout/delivery from here for a couple of years or so and have always been satisfied by their pasta dishes. Tonight was my first time actually eating in the restaurant. The inner ambiance is lovely with a somewhat elegant looking dining room with tables clearly meant for couples or families. The front dining room is definitely more for informal and short dining, while the back room is better for families looking for a multi-course meal and to linger and enjoy their time. The food is wonderful. The mussels in red sauce as our appetizer were big, fat and juicy. The sauce just melted in our mouths and they were some of the best mussels I've ever had. Our main courses were terrific as well. Service was sweet (although sometimes a little slow because they were busy- lots of people with kids off from school for holiday break) and we brought two bottles of wine along which complimented the meals perfectly. Definitely a place that will continue to enjoy the patronage of myself and my family because of the wonderful dining experiences we've been having. Right now, I'm in a bit of a food coma, but I am more than satisfied. It's just what the doctor ordered when Montclair's Italian restaurants are pretty scarce.
