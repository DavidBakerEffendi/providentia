love this place ! never knew french fries could be so great when you have so many choices for dipping sauces ! its a VERY small place has a couple of seats so its not meant to really eat there if anything its a more of a takeout place. The cool part is that they will let you try any dipping sauce before purchasing it for $1.00 . Ive had the Mango chutney which was good , blue cheese , cheddar , and peppercorn Parmesan = all delicious .
