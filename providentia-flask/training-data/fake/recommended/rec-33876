I LOVE this place for DimSum on the weekends! I was searching for a DimSum Omar near me in NJ so I wouldn't need to go to the city. Found it, just 10 short minutes from me! I'm obsessed with this place. Come here almost every weekend. They have all sorts of dumplings and noodles. My favorite is the soup dumpling. They have yummy pork bits and tripe. I also love their yellow cake and dessert assortments. Besides the DimSum carts, you can order dishes off the menu. Prices from carts and passed around, according to dish size. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because once I found a small bug on my swirled yellow cake. Not a huge deal but enough to earn them one star less. Only happened once and they look pretty clean. Bathrooms are nice and clean too. Place gets packed so come early! And bring your friends! Great place to come with your family!
