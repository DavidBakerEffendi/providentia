This place has become quite possibly my favorite place to eat. It all started one day my gf and I were walking by to get a free slurpee at 7-11 because of the free slurpee day. Hummus, Pita & Co were giving out free samples of their falafel and pita bread. We tasted it and fell in love with it. A few days later we returned to eat a full meal there. Falafel on pita bread in combo with soda and french fries. The service is incredibly friendly, you feel welcomed to eat there. The food comes out fast and the fries are taken to your table when they're done. The food is phenomenal. The taste, the texture, to me it's perfect. The french fries, nice and crispy, not overly greasy nor overly salty, just about perfect. We went for a second visit and tried the sweet potato fries instead. It was even better than the french fries. The place has free wifi and student discount, so this is an ideal place for a college student, as a matter of fact I saw quite a few students studying and doing homework there on their macbooks and laptops as they ate, so a great place for students or a writer looking for a spot to do some writing. Great food, fantastic service, I look forward to going again and again.
