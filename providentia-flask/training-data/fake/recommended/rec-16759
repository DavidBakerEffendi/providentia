The food and ambience was great. The interior decor is very nice and calming. The food was phenomenal, as soon as you enter the restaurant there is a wonderful smell of steaks being cooked on hot stones perfuming the place. Yes, you can get your steak and/or lobster brought to you to sizzle yourself on a hot stone. It's amazing. Very generous portions, and great staff. The sangria was ok, but probably not the best I've ever had. Overall a great place to go if you want a nice dinner and VERY reasonable prices.
