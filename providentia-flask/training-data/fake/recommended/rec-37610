What a surprise! This place is amazing! The sushi was fresh and delicious! The portion was great and the service was awesome too! The place is super small and I believe the kitchen is down in the basement, so you see the chefs going up and down the stairs while trying to prepare sushi/Japanese food up at the sushi bar! I am always hesitate about sushi being NOT in a fancy restaurant, but this place is just awesome... I will go back over and over again!
