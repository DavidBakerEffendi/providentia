We've been to Ray's a handful of times.  We recently went after having not been for a couple of years (we're often in the area on Sunday, when they are closed).  On our most recent visit we had a lychee smoothie and a fresh squeezed lemonade to drink and both were oh-so-good.  My husband had the chicken fried rice and I had the buckwheat noodle soup. We also had sides of cucumber salad and cabbage/carrot salad.  Everything was great.  As we were eating we discussed how the food has a home cooked taste, as opposed to a restaurant taste.  This may not be for everyone but we certainly enjoy it.  The woman who runs the shop is just as sweet as she can be, which only makes me want to try to frequent this little cafe more often.
