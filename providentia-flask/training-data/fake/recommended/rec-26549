I've recently gotten into eating sushi..somewhat..I guess. However, only eating it when I go to hibachis. I've always wanted to go to this place but hearing from other people, they say it was over priced. Although last week a friend of mine told me that it was cheaper than what my friends say, I decided to try it out. Walking inside looked very modern, almost maybe space aged? I don't know, but it looked cool and I liked the ambience. I guess one of the main attractions is the conveyor belt thing going around the center of the restaurant itself. I like the idea that you can just sit and start picking up stuff right away. You can however other things as well. I tried the chicken ramen and wasn't a big fan of it, the taste was too plain. I can make better ramen at home! Might try a spicier one next time. I loved the sushi though, and I liked how they had different types. Me being not so much of a hardcore sushi eater, I was all over the BLT, sweet potato, and chicken teriyaki rolls. Those were delicious! I did find it weird at first, because I wasn't used to how the servers took orders. I thought the whole time that our server was just texting on his iPhone while taking our orders till I looked around and found out I guess they use iPod Touches to take orders. So warning to anyone who's never been there, they use those to take orders. HAHA Prices rance from $2.50 - $4.75 which is about average price for sushi so I don't konw what my friends were talking about. There are stuff on the menu that is a little pricier but I guess maybe that's what they're basing it on. Overall, I like the place and I will be going back here multiple times in the future! PROS: -Cheap sushi -Nice environment -Good music -Modern feel and look CONS: -Needs to work on the ramen
