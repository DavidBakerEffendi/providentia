So we have tried time and time again to get our foot in the door at this place and finally made it all the way in last nite (on a monday of course).  And I must say we had an absolute blast.  The staff is this spot's number one asset.  They were fun and down to earth.  Wish I could say the same for all the patrons.  I guess that would be my only gripe here; it draws a bit of a pretentious hipster wannabe crowd at times, which I have heard before.  Yet the staff was more than entertaining to make up for it.   The fried pickles were the perfect snack, we had three orders in two hours.  Can't wait to be back.
