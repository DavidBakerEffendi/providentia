The ambience is what makes this restaurant great.  It's a perfect mix of old world diner meets tattooed Williamsburg-ites.  The menu is good and the execution of food is just OK.  However, the restaurant is completely thorough in theme....and that wins big points for me. When I say the food is just "OK" that is not to mean it's bad.  In fact, it's quite good but the detailed theme made me want more and I was let down.  I ordered the chicken and pumpkin waffles which came on a plate with no garnish (sure that sounds picky) and there were two pieces of friend chicken on top.  The chicken came with a hot dipping sauce and the waffles came with maple syrup.  It was not BAD but I would have liked a little more effort for the price. The Beet Salad looked great. The staff was great.  Everyone was super friendly and awesome.  I will go back.
