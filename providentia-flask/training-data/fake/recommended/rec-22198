There is a ton of hype surrounding the sandwiches here, and the line you have to wait in to get one backs that up.  We waited about 25 minutes for our sandwiches on a Tuesday and we got a roast pork and roast beef with provolone and broccoli rabe.  First off, the sandwiches are big.  We were both very full after we ate them.  However, I must say that the sandwiches were pretty bland, especially the roast beef.  It seemed to me like the meat just didn't have much flavor.  I'd have to agree with the other yelpers who say that there just seems to be something missing.  Don't get me wrong, it is a solid sandwich and the broccoli rabe is a nice touch, but I just wouldn't crave it, especially with the line being so long.  Also, I felt bad for the guy in front of me, who got his credit card dropped by the cashier into a tray of fatty pork juice...
