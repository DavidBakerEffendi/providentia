I hate to write a bad review for this place but my meal last Friday was so disappointing. I love the atmosphere and that this is a byob, this is my second visit and the first time was perfectly fine! In fact I started with the grilled caesar again, which was delicious both times I ordered it. This time my boyfriend started with the mussels, which he enjoyed. It all fell apart on the second course, which sadly happens in a lot of restaurants that could be really good. My boyfriend went with the steak special and I the roast chicken. My roast chicken was dryer than a desert. Just awful, like it'd been under a heat lamp for hours. Also pretty sure my mashed potatoes were instant. However, I didn't feel like complaining since my boyfriend was having such a  terrible time with his steak. He ordered it medium rare, came out well done. They took it back and it came back medium well....this time he just ate it.  Its sad when a meal that could be great is ruined because of improper cooking techniques. If you are going to go I recommend the potato encrusted tuna, which was pretty good last time I was there.
