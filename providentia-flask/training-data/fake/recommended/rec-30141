This place definitely satisfies. Between the staff and the food, I couldn't have been happier with my experiencd there. I got the softshell crab vermicelli and my friend ordered the lemongrass chicken bahm mi with chicken. Â The portions were perfect, the flavor was on point. If you're looking for a small, cozy restaurant where the staff is friendly and the food is great. This is the place to try.
