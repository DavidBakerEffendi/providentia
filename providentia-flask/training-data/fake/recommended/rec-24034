As good a reason as any to venture over to Fishtown. JB's offers the best local beer and fine locally grown and raised fare.  The new dining room sets it right up there with the big boys.  I find it refreshing as a new Fishtowner who still holds a ton of hope for his neighborhood.  It's the only reasonable place round Girard to catch a game of pool too. JB's is also one of the best music venues in the city.  Though it's small, the room sounds great and the acts are plentiful and varied.  Only World Cafe Live sounds better.  But WCL's overpriced and underachieving menu doesn't come close to matching Johnny's. Go on a Sunday for the Bloody Mary and stay for the hand-pumped Hop Wallop.
