Really good food, although a bit on the pricey side, which is standard for Philadelphia. There are standard menu items, and then specials which are usually quite good. Service is quick. There is outdoor seating, and in the summertime the floor-to-ceiling windows are all opened and the atmosphere is great. The rest of this review is just an amusing story, and has nothing to do with the rating. A while ago, Bridget Foy's had this big plastic spark plug affixed to the corner of the building. I thought it was because the building had once been an auto parts store -- you get a lot of old surviving features like that in Philadelphia. So after going a few times, I finally worked up the courage to ask about it (I'm shy by nature). The waitress said that she thought it was part of a promotion they had done a while back, something about Bridget Foy's being "sparky". Well, it was as good an explanation as any. Although I like mine better.
