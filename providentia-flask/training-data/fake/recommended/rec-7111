I've only came here after work, maybe a bit drunk, and always hungry.  I find myself skipping the bar completely and walking in the back, hoping there's a table to squeeze 6 people.   Burgers and fries...whiskey and beer. I'm a happy camper.  Cheap. Fast. Delicious.  Just get the burger. Maybe a side of crispy thin cut frozen fries.  It's super classy. Definitely fancy on its paper plate. Hey, at least the tomatoes are fresh and lettuce still crisp.   Everything else in there is a bit of a mess, but who cares! Half of you shall be drunk and hungry, and only want that burger.
