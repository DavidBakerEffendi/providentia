Best coffee in NYC.  Perfect. For both coffee and food, it is worth a trip uptown to VQ. It is very expensive.  But worth it. The tartines and paninis are great.  Usually I opt for the simple caprese and it never fails.   For another meal, two entrees are highly recommended - their lasagna is superb.  Robust and meaty.  The baked risotto has great contrast in texture between the 'crust' and the risotto.  Delicate spicing.   Finally, have the deconstructed Tiramisu.  Pick up the Ladyfingers, then dip in espresso 'sauce', and finally dip in whipped cream.  Better than the real thing.
