Love the signature ramen! This place is much cheaper than the ramen bar in university city and is even better. I started it off with some pork bun, which really worked well to peak my appetite. Then my ramen came rather quickly. I put all of the spicy toppings on and dug in and could barely even finish it. I cannot wait to come here again for the ramen. Next time I will probably try the kimchee ramen.
