My friends were in town visiting, and they actually recommended this spot after they ate here the day before. They liked it so much that they decided to bring me here. Good call! The locale is low key, comfortable, and big enough. The food was very very good. I had the "Grey Dog's Breakfast" with pancakes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, and sweet potato fries. So the smoked salmon and sweet potato fries aren't options on the menu, but I'm a pescatarian and they were very kind to sub the meaty stuff for me. I paid a couple extra bucks, but that's to be expected. I washed it all down with a mexican hot chocolate which is a smooth milk-chocolatey treat with fragrant spices, topped with whipped cream. Yum! The thing I found a bit strange was the standing in line to order, but by the time you're done waiting in the very long line, and get to the desk to order, your table is ready. Hmmm, very clever... I'm a fan!
