My go to spot to watch the Real Madrid games. What keeps me coming back is the friendly staff n the bangin food! Love the clams in green sauce. The rock n roll shrimp will knock yer socks off. The paella marinara will put you in a food coma. Â The smothered pork chops are so good they could make some folk question their own religion. For el clasicos I like to treat myself to the stuffed lobster tails. Wash it all down with the sangria or a passion fruit mojito. Got a sweet tooth? Try the creme brulee or flan. I hate flan, but the flan at vivo is decadent. If you're not careful you might lose track of the time, in which case ya might as well stick around for the party at night. Thursday and Saturday nights are muy caliente!
