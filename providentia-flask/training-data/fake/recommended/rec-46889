good beer, good food, and a fun atmosphere. and at a price that won't leave you feeling robbed, which is rare for a stephen starr place. we had the mushroom strudel, giant pretzel, and cheese spatzel to go along with our liters of oktoberfest. everything was delicious. i wasn't really a fan of the cheese sauce that came with the pretzel, but everyone else liked it. there's a fire pit outside for chilly nights. or you can sit inside and play ping pong or jenga. it's kinda like being at a party at your friends house, only without the cleanup effort. i can't wait to get back here again!
