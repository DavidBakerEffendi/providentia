This is my favorite place to eat in all of Philly. Over the past few years, Â I've tried almost everything on their menu and it has all been fantastic. My favorite is the pulled pork with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone. The brisket is also mouthwatering. Stop by... if you get lucky you'll get seat or the long line will move quickly (Don't fret, the long line is a testament to how great the food is).
