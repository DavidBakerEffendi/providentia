I just wanted to shoot myself in the head after dinning at Prospect. I waited THIS LONG and paid THIS MUCH for this tiny amount of incredibly bland and miserably creative food. The dishes sounded and looked very interesting, but for some inexplicable reason they just tasted like boringness exploded in my mouth. Every bite I took made me laugh. Luckily there weren't that many bites. I am totally fine with paying a lot for a little food (think Japanese), but please don't insult me with terrible food quality. There is a fine line and you just crossed it. The service was great though.
