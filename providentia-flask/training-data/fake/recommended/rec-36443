Five stars for brunch and maybe three for dinner. Delicious breads and coffee. Even when Balthazar is packed, the servers are so professional that your coffee cup is never empty. I fantasize about Sunday morning brunches here and scrambled eggs wrapped in pastry. Wonderful ambiance -- even when it's overcrowded after work. Dinner entrees are good but not "the best meal I've ever eaten" caliber.
