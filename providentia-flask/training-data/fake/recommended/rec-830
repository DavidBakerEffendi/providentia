Brooklyn pizza at its finest! I love this place, Â the service is always good and the food is even better! My favorite is the zucchini and eggplant pizza so delicious! Its thin crust pizza with so much flavour from the dough to the tomato sauce to the toppings. Also, a must try is the nutella dessert! Warm and damn good! Love this spot! There's a bar, dinning room and outdoor seating for any type of night you decide to have :) Enjoy!
