Never before have I been so willing to spend $10 on tea. We came here for dessert directly after eating at Sake Bar Decibel a few doors down -- I guess we were feelin' the whole Asian thing that night -- and were pleasantly surprised by the cozy atmosphere. It's true about the bathrooms. I didn't go, but my fiance couldn't stop talking about how cool it was. Also, the dessert was very classically French, which was a nice twist. If you sit at the bar be sure to stay away from the right side, by the door. It's right in front of a dishwashing station and you may get splattered a bit.
