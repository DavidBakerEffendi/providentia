This is actually the first time I've been to a Momofuku - it was a relaxed vibe, and lots of fun. Turns out my friend's friend was the head chef too. I grabbed the scallops, which were great - the avocado puree thing was perfect. I was also hungry so grabbed the Shanghai noodles, which were like soba noodles with snow peas. All so crisp and fresh.
