Lemme start out by saying that the lady taking the order was rude.  The delivery guy was late by 15mins even though we called in the order early in the morning.  The only items worth trying are the corn flour items.  Everything esle is just Ehhhh....I would prob go back if every other place on 9th ave is closed.
