Ate here for the first time yesterday and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The decor as soon as you walk in is very nice. The crystal chandelier looks cool right in the middle of the restaurant. They put a lot of effort into details when it comes to how the place looks ( I thought it was genius that the menu was titled "Check In" and the check said "Check Out"). Honestly, I heard so much about the decor and atmosphere that I didn't know what to expect from the food itself.  I tried the Red Curry Chicken from the lunch menu and it was delicious!  It was spicy, but they didn't go overboard with it and the plate was a nice size proportion. I've tried all the Thai restaurants in ths area many times for lunch and Room Service is definitely at the top of my list along with Yum Yum. Seeing as to how this place looked like the most upscale one out of the bunch, I thought it would be very expensive, but the price was the same as the other restaurants ($7 for lunch). I'd probably give this review a 4.5 star. The only reason why it's not 5 stars is because the waiter was very snotty and service could have been a lot better. This place is excellent, specially considering what you pay for it. I'd definitely recommend it.
