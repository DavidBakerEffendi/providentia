Atticus is the place to go if you want to be talked down to by a passive-aggressive waitstaff. My friend was meeting me at Atticus and had coffee from another store. He ordered food and coffee from Atticus, and even offered to hide the "outside drink," but that was not acceptable to the waitstaff. He was forced to throw away his coffee, even though he was a paying customer and not consuming it on the premises. Come here if you want to be treated like a criminal for possessing unauthorized coffee.
