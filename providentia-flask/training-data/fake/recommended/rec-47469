Although I consider myself a girl with a wide ranging palette and appreciation for all sorts of international cuisine, I must say that my favorite food, hands down, is pizza. Luckily I reside in New York, where the choices for pizzerias are both diverse and abundant. Posto is my go-to, and if you're a fan of thin crust pizza, then it should be yours too. I crave Posto's pizza in my sleep. Crispy, paper-thin crust spread with tangy marinara sauce, covered with bubbling melty cheese and sprinkled with Italian herbs-- I can't imagine anything more satisfying. In addition to the simply divine plain cheese, Posto offers standard combinations of meat and veggies, plus other specialties, like a Greek inspired pie, and an homage to mushrooms. The wine is great and served in short stemless glasses, lending a European air to the eatery's rustic surroundings. And the prices can't be beat, although I admit I would still go to Posto even if those prices quadrupled: it's just that good.
