With the extended RW, I took advantage of this opportunity to try out this Lebanese restaurant that I've always wanted to try since it opened because I was once obssessed with Middle Eastern foods.  It was also my friend's birthday and what better way to celebrate without tearing my hair out thinking of what to buy for her at the mall? Yes, 21st century people have lost the creativity of present making.  Anyway, I was surprised that if one orders from the RW menu, then all the other parties have to do so, but the waiter was nice enough that I order something that's 'almost' of equivalent prices, then he could overlook it.  Well, I got the "large' shrimp salad and when they say 'large', it's really 'small'.  The salad came with bits of shreaded romaine lettuce, a quarter of a sliced avocado and 5 tiny shrimps on a skewer.  The only cutting edge to this dish is the sprinkling pomegrante seeds and roughly chopped dried figs and like 3 sad looking madarin wedges.  It was not worth the $15 tag.  The RW lunch price was decent I think.  You get to choose two sides, a sandwich/wrap and a dessert.  Not bad.  I liked the tabbouleh.  I was going to go for the hummus, but I thought I could get better ones at my go-to restaurant.  Sometimes a hole in the wall places make more authentic flavors.  The lamb tenderloin wrap was good according to my friend.  She ordered the chocolate bar.  I was expecting a better presentation, but it was just a dense piece of chocolate chocolate sweet with chocolate sauce poured on top.  it's quite sweet.  If you're a chocoholic, you'd like it, if not, it might be a bit too much.  The service was attentive.  Would I return? Probably not. I got the experience now and that's all I need.  I'm ready to head back to my whole in the wall place, put my feet up and taste some authentic flavors at a fraction of the price.
