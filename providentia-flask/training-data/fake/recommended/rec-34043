I've been to this place at least 3 or 4 times now. Every single time the service is spot on and the food is outstanding. The brunch and dinner menu are equally great. There's usually a long wait on weekends. The place is tiny and they try to be kid friendly but there's really no room for high chairs and I dont think they have any. The front outdoor space is beautiful and cozy-I prefer to sit outside because of the plants and decor but the inside is nice too. Enjoy!
