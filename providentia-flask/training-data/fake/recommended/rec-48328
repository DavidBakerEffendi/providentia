This is a fine place especially for some of us who miss the great old New York German-Austrian places of the past such as Luchows and others that used to be in Yorkville and parts of Queens. Reasonably priced, less than a typical diner with a nice variety of wursts and as a German-Austrian place should have, an extensive selection of beers.
