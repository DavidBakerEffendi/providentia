JB's is my kind of place inside - dimly lit, a little Pee-Wee Herman-esque with quirky leather booths that light up, pool tables and a scribbled menu on an oversized chalk board. The octopus is really delicious but the hands down star is the Cuban sandwich. I can't not get it when I go there now. Pure delicious, one of my top two sammies in Phila and probably top five overall. My boyfriend played there with his now defunct band only a month before we started dating (and no, I had nothing to do with it defunct-ing! ;)) but I also love this spot imagining him geeking out on stage. Now that there a lots of other "hip" spots popping up all around, JB's has lost a little of its IT factor...but that is often the case with joints who pioneer gentrifying parts of town. Can't really hold it against em. Get the Cubano. Seriously.
