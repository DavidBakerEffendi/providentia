Went to this place for brunch .... Had a mimosa and a kebab wrap. Mimosa tasted very funky and the food just tasted burnt. I didn't eat much of the wrap, no server came over to ask how the food was and even when they cleared my plate and saw that I hadn't eaten much of it they still didn't say anything. Will not be going back.
