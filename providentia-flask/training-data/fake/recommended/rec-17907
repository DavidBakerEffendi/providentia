Ippudo has, by far, the best ramen that I've ever had. I am not Japanese, but I have had a lot of ramen in different places in my life. I've even visited Japan numerous times so I'd like to think that I have something to compare this place to. This place just gets it - the thick broth of the Akamaru and the perfect consistency of the noodles are something that EVERY ramen enthusiast NEEDS to try at least once. I went for lunch with a Japanese friend who insisted that this place was the most authentic ramen - and I was definitely not disappointed. We beat the lunch hour rush so there was no wait, but a mere 15 minutes later the place had a line out the door. I always associate "authentic" ramen places with shabby, hole-in-the-wall decor, but Ippudo surprised me with their chic decor. it's hip and you can tell it is trying to cater to the young, hip crowd of NYC and it does its job and i'm guessing it's the decor and the ambiance you pay for because i JUST don't think a bowl of ramen should ever be over $10! In summary, i LOVE this place and i can't wait to go back!
