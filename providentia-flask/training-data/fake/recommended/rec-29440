This place is amazing. The salad bar is great but it's really one of those places where you should skip the salad bar and make up for it tomorrow. The serving style is interesting with the "gauchos" bringing you some amazing meats from nearly every animal on a stick. Medium Rare, Medium and Well done meats. My FAVORITE things there are the bacon wrapped filet mignon and the polenta. I recommend this place to everyone I know. Better than Chima!
