Four words: $20 bottles of wine. That's right. You can get a wide assortment of wines for $20. Not only that but this place is great for Italian food. To start they have amazing bread and salad. I've been a few times, they have a pasta specialty where you can get three different kinds of pasta, they change every night, and it's bottomless. Really delicious. My boyfriend doesn't like this place as much as I do because he's lactose intolerant and they have a lot of dairy in many of their dishes, but I think for Italian, it's hard to find better in HK.
