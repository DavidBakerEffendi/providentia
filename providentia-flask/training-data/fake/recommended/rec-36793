The food hits home! I grew up on this stuff, well actually 1 islands to the right (Dominican Republic). It's a little confusing when walking in, a long narrow room, half of it the long line were the cuban sandwiches made right in front of you, cafe con leche and Â super long steamtable with about 15 items wich are served by three ladies. I did'nt know were to start! Let's priortirize first! Told my brother-in-law "OK! Igo order the Cuban Sandwiched and Cafe con Leche and you go to steam table and get everthing you see and we'll meet back at the table, Break! Octopus salad: Thinly sliced Octopus, red bell peppers, cilantro and a touch of tomatoe & lime. Very good! Cuban sandwiches: Nice and Crusty on the outside and nice & warm on the inside. Chicharones de Pollo, a little dry but the flavor right on! Pastele (Carribean style Tamale) Instead of of Masa Corn the latinos from Carribean use Platians, Yateua(kind of like a huge Tarro) and green bananas, stuffed a a Picadillo of olives and stewed pork. I had two of them. Pernil (Roast pork) with rice and beans, that tasted like moms. My eyes got a little glassy. The price was right on, we spent around 70 bucks for 6 of us. A defintie stop next time at the Big Apple.
