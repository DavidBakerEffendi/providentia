I've always wanted to try Ippudo, but have always been turned away by lines that rival Disneyland. Spending time in Japan has really opened my eyes to the different aspect that make up a good bowl of ramen. These include tasteful chicken or pork based broth (not the watered down kind that taste like it came from a flavor paste), hand made noodles that is not too thick or thin and stays chewy, dry seaweed garnish and meat that melts in the mouth. With that said, Ippudo's ramen was mediocre at best. So I only gave it two stars since I had higher expectations with all the hype. I had the shio ramen with boil egg; and also pork buns. The buns were good, but not particularly memorable. As for the ramen, the broth lacked flavor as evidenced by the excessive salt they used. I understand that i ordered the shio broth (which literally means 'salt' in Japanese), but that is not an excuse to dump the entire can in there, the broth tasted more like meat juice mixed with sea water. The noodles had good consistency and texture. I prefer fattier pork, and my piece was simply too lean. Finally the egg; there really isn't too much to be said about it, it wasn't particularly good or bad. All in all, there are lots of better options in NYC, don't waste your time here.
