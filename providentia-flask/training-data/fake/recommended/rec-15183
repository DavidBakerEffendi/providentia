LOVE. Vanessa's is one of my go-to spots when coming to chinatown. You can't ever leave without a full stomach filled with dumplings and sesame pancake sandwiches! Everything here is ridiculously cheap and super flavorful. I love getting the peking duck sesame pancake as well as the roast pork one. It's pretty greasy (napkins are crucial) but the pancake is really what makes the sandwich so good. Also make sure to also get the pork and chive dumplings, and take a peek into their cold case...love the seaweed salad and Â tangy cucumber salad!
