I came back to Philadelphia for a quick weekend trip and one of the places I absolutely had to go was Good Dog. What can I say about Good Dog that hasn't already been said? Yes, it can get really crowded really fast, but you can always go upstairs. Yes, sometimes the waitstaff can forget about you.... Get the Good Dog Burger. Your mouth will thank you.
