oh sweet, sweet dinner special!  and $25 bottles of wine!   the pasta was great - straightforward and simple.  all of three of the selections were great except one - but that was only because i don't like mint in my pasta.  you also have a choice between antipasto misto or caesar salad to start - go with the salad.  i got the antipasto and it looked like uneaten bits from various plates were thrown onto mine.  it was the only thing i didn't like about our dinner. the waitress spilled wine on our table as she was pouring it into my glass, but she apologized and comped both of us a glass of dessert wine, the name of which escapes my memory because i drank most of the bottle of wine we ordered.  i do, however, remember it was good, just like the rest of our dinner.
