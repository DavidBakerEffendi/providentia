I LOVE CUBAN PETE'S!!!!!t!!!! I have friends that live in Edison whom I visit about 3-4 times a year and it's become tradition to go to Cuban Pete's while I'm there. Last time, one of  my friends suggested we go somewhere else but I refused. The food is great. I always get the Vaca Frita bc it's my favorite but I've sampled everyone else's food and haven't tasted anything bad. The meals are average price but the portions are HUGE. I can never finish my plate,  even if I tried. What I love just as much as the food is the  atmosphere; you really feel like you're somewhere else and their birthday song is cute (they bust out drums and everything). Be sure to save room for dessert, the Gloriana Empanadas are awesome. O yea, they don't have a liquor license so if you'd like to enjoy an adult beverage or two with your meal be sure to bring some!
