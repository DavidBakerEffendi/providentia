It's high time I wrote a review for Mood cafe. The chat here is unique and Hasan is very creative when it comes to combining different ingredients. Love the paneer chat and pani puri is an all time fav! Don't get me started on the amazing variety of lassis here.. It's difficult to pick one but no matter what you choose it is always wonderful! I have recommended this place to several of my friends who are now regulars here :)
