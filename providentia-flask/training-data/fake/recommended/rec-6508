Great atmosphere, outdoor seating and awesome food! Cafe Orlin is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Their veggie burger is only rivaled by that of Westville East (AMAZING!). They also have reasonably priced sangria pitchers. For Brunch they have delicious pumpkin pancakes, the only downside is that you usually have to wait a while before you can sit down and order them.
