What a great place! Great food, good service and awesome decor! The only thing that was weird was in the middle of our meal 3 ladies walked in for lunch and were coldly turned away by the host who informed them that they would be switching the kitchen over from lunch to dinner soon and so they could not be served. The ladies informed the hostess that they had traveled very far to come to this specific restaurant but she still turned them away. Considering my boyfriend and I along with one other couple were the only people in the restaurant, I didn't see why they wouldn't just let the women stay?! The women were so upset and we felt bad for them and even a little uncomfortable considering this happened right next to our table. ...Very awkward
