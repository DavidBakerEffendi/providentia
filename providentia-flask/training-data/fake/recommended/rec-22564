Wow! This place is awesome! We had an amazing brunch complete with tastey UNLIMITED mimosas and bloody's (and they never let the glasses go empty). Their Prix Fixe lunch came with unlimited mimosas and bloody, anti-pasta, and a brunch menu. I had the Roasted beets, walnuts & goat cheese salad (although they replaced the walnuts with another nut) to start. The beets were perfectly roasted, the goat cheese was added in the right amount, the salad was very fresh. My husband started with the Ricotta Fritters. They were delicious! For our brunch I had the "Uovo al forno", oven baked egg over polenta, tomato & ricotta cheese. It was the star of the meal and I couldn't have been happier, what a great dish. My husband had the veggie omelette, the veggies were cooked exactly right, the omelette and the potatoes were on point and we were full. I can't wait to come back. If I 'had' to critique I would say that I wanted to hear is some nice chill morning music, without it the ambiance was left slightly lacking (and I use slightly as light as possible because I really do enjoy this place regardless). Maybe some Peace Orchestra or K&D, Giovanni? I would also say that we're missing out on advertising. They've been here since November and we had no idea. A neighborhood direct mail piece would make sense for them.
