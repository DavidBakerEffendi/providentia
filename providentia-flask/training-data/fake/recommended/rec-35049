Met a friend here about 2 weeks ago on a Thursday night. It's a very clean, nice place with helpful and courteous staff. We went on a quiet night so had no problems sitting outside (weather was warmer then too). The place is BYOB which is a plus. I ordered the grilled salmon steak (Solomo) with over roasted lemon potatoes and must say everything was delicious!! Salmon was soft and perfectly seasoned! Friend and I shared a baklava which was also very nice. I'll be going back here to try other dishes.
