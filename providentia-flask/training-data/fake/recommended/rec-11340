This place rocks. We sat outside last first Friday, the atmosphere was great. Our service was awesome, and may I mention the Seabass my boyfriend got? It was like tasting a piece of long lost delicious, glutenous cake that I sometimes miss so much (I'm gluten free). It was like butter melting in your mouth. It was absolutely amazing. I got the Lump Crab Pad Thai which was also great, but next time I'll definitely opt for the Seabass.
