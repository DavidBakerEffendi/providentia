This place is bomb! I loved the pulled pork with broccoli rah... The line was kinda long but it was quick... Make sure you watch your change and check your order... I did have to go back and have them add my broccoli rah to both my sandwiches... The broccoli rah is a must! Woulda gave em a 5 but two mess ups on change and my order dropped em down.
