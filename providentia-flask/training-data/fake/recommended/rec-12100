Really good guava margaritas. I like the chicken tacos as well, though I'm not usually a chicken fan. The atmosphere is lively in here but be prepared for a wait most nights for dinner from 6 pm on wards. I've brought my mother and aunt here but they didn't enjoy it as it was too noisy, so this may be a spot for a younger crowd. I'd skip dessert and head across the street for gelato from Capogiro after and then some jazz entertainment at Time up the block.
