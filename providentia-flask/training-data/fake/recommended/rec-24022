I'm going to admit I haven't been to the venue (and I heard its fabulous) so I'm writing based on my bar experience.  I absolutely love the crowd, atmosphere, and feeling of this place.  Based on this alone, I would be here every night of the week. Unfortunately what knocks this place down for me is the UNBEARABLY SLOW bar service.  You could be standing at the bar for what feels like FOREVER for what feels like the weakest drink you have purchased, from a less than friendly woman.   Because of this, patronizing Johnny Brenda's is surely a chore for me.
