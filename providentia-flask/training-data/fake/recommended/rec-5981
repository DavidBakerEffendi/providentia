On my first ever trip to New York, my boyfriend and I met his family and a few friends at this obviously VERY popular New York spot.  When we got there and asked about wait times - we were looking at somewhere around 3 hours - IKES!  Luckily a close family friend of my boyfriend was a chef there and pulled a few strings and we were all seated (very snuggly) at a couple of tables pushed together on little stools.  This was a vast improvement though to standing tightly next to one of these tables and being jostled by fellow diners and employees every five seconds.  Thankfully, once we were seated everything was as phenomenal as promised.  The smoked haddock chowder with homemade crackers was out of this world and the five different types of meat in my burger made it by far the best I have EVER had - easily.  All of the "bar snacks" and desserts were equally over my expectations.  If you don't mind waiting a bit (or maybe try this on a night that isn't on a weekend) - I would definitely give this place a few hours of your time and any room you can make in your belly.
