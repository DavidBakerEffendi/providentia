Amazing! Specially the appetizers! My very picky Italian friend was impressed. Small restaurant great for dates or small groups with amazing Italian menu (that goes way beyond pizza, they actually don't have pizza) I absolutely recommend this. And the menu changes seasonally so its a great place to go back to.
