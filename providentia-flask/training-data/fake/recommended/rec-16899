My bf and I went here for dinner last night and the food was amazing. We ordered the coconut curry lemongrass soup with chicken and shrimp, the ahi tuna dumplings on top of guacamole, shrimp pad thai, and the szechuan dry pot chicken in the mini wok. They also threw in the spicy cucumbers and the pumpkin dessert on the house! The service was great and Ben, the owner, came around and introduced himself to us and was very friendly and welcoming. The decor is also very clean, simple, and inviting. No complaints! We will definitely be going back to Spice 28!
