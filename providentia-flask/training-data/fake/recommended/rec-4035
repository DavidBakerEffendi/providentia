the fourth star is really for the crab and corn chowder. i love a chowder and this was some excellent, delicious, flavorful stuff. perfect for a rainy, chilly saturday night. big portion, 8 bucks, bravo. i have always sorta avoided this place because i thought bouillabaise was overpriced and annabelle's was the worst ever. but the crab and corn chowder is definitely worth a visit. my dining companion had seafood chowder which was also fantastic. i had the curry cod over mashed potatoes and vegetables and it was good enough but sorta boring and not worth the 20 buck price tag. i'm always bummed when i order something that tastes like something i could have made at home. the service was spotty, even though the place is tiiiiny and we were seated in the front less than 3 feet from the staff. but the service was friendly, up until we got our bill and saw the double corkage fee for our two bottles of wine. okay, the first one i can understand......they opened our prosecco and gave us some glasses. but the second bottle went ignored by them, opened by us and we never even got clean glasses. sneaky. annoying. overall, i'd go for soup at lunchtime on a drizzly day. i was generally underwhelmed.
