Giddy up! Rex 1516 is the goodness. My baby mama, no drama, aka the wife, took me here for Father's Day. It was for brunch, and it was some good Southern Cooking. There was much to choose from, and that means reasons to come back, but on this visit I went with the Chicken and Waffles. Now this concept, in of itself, is pretty fantastic if done right. I've had it before at several places, but never like Rex 1516 does it. This was done a la open face sandwich. At the bottom, you have Belgium waffles. Expected. Then, you have boneless friend chicken. Well of course. But then. Wait for it. Wait for it. You have poached (fantastic) eggs (yes yes yes) with a creole (woah!) hollandaise sauce (yup, Carlton dance time!). I mean, like, wow, this was some good stuff. Like, really, really, really, fantastic, great, good, good, gooodie, good. But there's more.This came with breakfast potatoes, as they call it, also known as home fries to some. This gets real special because you can get the sweet potato version. Yeah, I did. And, oh how sweet it was! Gosh. Oh gee. This place was so so good. I want to go back to there!
