It's amazing how congested Soho has become, and it's hard to find a casual lunch hour spot.  Taim is clean, reliable, and healthy for a quick lunch. I usually order the olive falafel sandwich with all the toppings (on special now).  Tasty and really alot of food.  I wish the sauces were a bit spicier, but considering this is located in the middle of Soho, clientele might have delicate palates?
