Great food. And inexpensive! I would say their menu is similar to Ting Wong and MKee in Chinatown. But, here at Shing Kee, parking is plenty and free :) This area of the city offers so many great Vietnamese restaurants, and I think Shing Kee is the place to go if you want something else other than Vietnamese food in the area. I would definitely come back.
