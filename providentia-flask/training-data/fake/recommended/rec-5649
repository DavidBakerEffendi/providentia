This place has got to be one of my All time favorite spots to get something different from the regular asain noodle fare because their broth is just so different, rich and out of this world combined with fresh hand pulled noodles.. My favorite thing to order here is their sliced beef noodles.. I'm addicted and feen till I can get my next fix from this place , truly a gem
