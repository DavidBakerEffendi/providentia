I was visiting Philadelphia over the weekend and my friend recommended here. I immediately enjoyed the laid back vibe of the place, and the food was delicious. From the different sauces to add to your burger, to the fries that were just amazing, I wish we had one of these in Orlando! I ordered avocados as a topping for an extra $1.50 I think, and they pretty much put a whole avocado on the burger, definitely worth the add on price. My only issue I had were the drinks, after we order the waitress just asked us to get up and pick out what drinks we wanted, as they seemed to only have teas, and bottled drinks, besides their milkshakes. That was a little bit of a turn off for me, as I felt they could have just mentioned what they had instead of making us walk towards the register. Minor detail, but I think it could have been a more efficient way to deal with drinks. Overall friendly service, fun atmosphere, and I will be back next time.
