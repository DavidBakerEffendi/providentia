A meal at Cheryl's is almost like visiting a European cafe.  You have to wait to get seated. Then wait to get your menu. Then wait to order.  Then wait for your drinks. Now I am offending European cafes but I think you get the point. It is unfortunate because the brunch is pretty good. When you throw in the complimentary mimosa or bloody mary plus a cup of coffee (they even have soy creamer!) it could almost be my favorite neighborhood brunch place. I just can't take the pain of the slow and crabby service.
