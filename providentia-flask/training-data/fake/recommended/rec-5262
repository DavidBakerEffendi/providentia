Food network said to go to this place, so I went. Nice Filipino ladies running the place, and the fries were cooked perfectly: golden, crispy, and good sauces. There are several free sauces, and most cost a dollar each. You can get three sauces for $2.75, so try that. I got the european mayo (a free sauce), which was really mild, and not heavy at all. The war sauce was my favorite: onions, mayo, and... something brown (doesn't sound good, does it?). Irish curry was good as well. Can't recommend the pesto mayo though. The kicker is that the fries come in a sheet of paper wrapped into a cone, a-la pita wrap. Prices are good, given nyc standards. I like french fries =)
