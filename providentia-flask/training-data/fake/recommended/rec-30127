Wow. We totally just stumbled upon Cafe Habana from Yelp. Signage is non existent, and we actually past it twice (saying, "wow, that place must be good, because it's swarming with people!"), without knowing it was what we were looking for. Very small, but surprisingly efficient, short wait, and the staff was very friendly. We tried the corn. The corn, the corn, the corn. If you eat nothing else, eat the corn. So delicious! (And it comes with toothpicks! :) ) Next we had the Sopesitos- little crisp corn cakes with black beans and a sampler of three salsas. Yum! The Ensalada de Espinaca y Manzana was beyond delicious, with chunks of crisp apple, spicy pumpkin seeds, spinach, grapefruit, and a fantastic orange tequila vinaigrette. Will definitely have that again! Shrimp tacos were different and delicious, with a terrific sauce on the side. (Only complaint would be that the tacos were so stuffed, and only had one tortilla- would have been easier to eat with 2 tortillas.) Finished with the Cheese Flan, and it didn't disappoint either! LOVE this place! Worth the wait (because there will be one!)
