Tucked away in the village, this little restaurant offers an intimate ambiance where they seated us quickly, even without a reservation.  I think we timed that just right though.  The chef masterfully prepares duck and other meats oh so well.  Savory, not overly salted, and no substitutions needed.  Treat yourself to a great experience here.  Our waiter, Nick (?), was knowledgeable on the menu and provided excellent recommendations.  Someplace I would be more than happy to go back to.
