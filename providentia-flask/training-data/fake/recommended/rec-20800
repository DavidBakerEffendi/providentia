I have been eating at this place since 2007 and they have been very consistent with their taste, service and overall performance. The place is very small to dine in but the ambiance is soothing. The owner is super nice, She recognizes me even if I haven't been there for months. I usually order spicy food here and their black pepper chicken is outstanding. Also I would recommend sweet corn chicken soup and curry chicken. It has got the best Chinese food in the area
