We stumbled upon Café Orlin while strolling through the East Village one Wednesday night and LOVED IT.  We sat at a table outside, facing the busy sidewalk of St. Mark's Place.  The ambience was lovely. We started with the grilled calamari appetizer, which was nothing short of perfection.  The calamari was tender and seasoned perfectly.  I ordered the sesame salmon with Asian vegetables and my date ordered the linguine with sauteed shrimp.  Both dishes were relatively simple, but I cannot say enough good things about the seasoning.  My salmon was tender and delicious and came with a very interesting mix of sides.  Most notably, the hijiki salad (kind of a seaweed type vegetable) was amazing! The service was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Cafe Orlin!
