Hey Balthazar, nice laurels you're resting on. But even they are getting a bit fetid, no? Honestly, if we had gone to a random diner without expectation, we would have given this mediocre brunch two stars. But, if we're expected to wait in line for an hour for a so called reputable dining establishment, only to have a  crepe that is so dry and overcooked it reminds us of saw dust, and paired with a bland salad and unremarkable dressing for la mademoiselle, and  boring and undersalted eggs florentine for me, than there is something truly wrong with this joke of a bistro. Beyond the taste wasteland, the actual service was awful, too. We were seated in a tiny kid's card table next to the register. While my date only had to contend with posture endurance befitting a yoga master, my dining experience was matched by the aerobic workout of trying to avoid servers who had deigned the counter space next to me as a condiment depot. I cannot stress this enough: there are hundreds of other places to dine  in new york city than this tarnished establishment. Close your eyes and choose one. You won't do any worse I can promise that much.
