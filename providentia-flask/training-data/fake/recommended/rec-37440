Good North African / French restaurant. Mussels in African spices were flavorful, but the broth was on the bottom and the vessel didn't allow even distribution.  Nitpicking, I know, but its really all about getting the flavor with the mussels. My guest had a beautiful salad.  I don't remember the specifics, but she really enjoyed it. The place is small, so make a reservation and be prepared to be close to others.  That being said, I'll go back.
