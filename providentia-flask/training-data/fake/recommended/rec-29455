I don't think there's a whole lot left to be said about Dalessandros, with almost 80 reviews I think the reputation is solid. The cheesesteak is fantastic and they've got a fairly extensive beer selection. What I really enjoy about Dalessandros is the service. It's been the same pair of women behind the register and counter every time I've gone and they've been pleasant. Took a friend for lunch one day when it was packed and they still asked at least two or three times if we needed anything. I don't really dig the attitude/abuse sold to tourists at some other places and appreciate Dalessandros not playing that game. Don't know how long its going on but as of my most recent visit yesterday they're running a $7.99 cheesesteak and Stella special Monday-Thurs. Try and beat that.
