My favorite Thai restaurant ever!!! I still have not found a bad meal in this place. My all time favorite is panang chicken and mango salad!! A++++. Â Pad thai is delicious too and their calamari is to die for!!! I moved DC a few years ago but every single time i come back to BK to visit my family i MUST stop here before leaving. Thank You Song!!!
