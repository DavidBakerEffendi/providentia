fish tacos are a must. they have this cool sauce that they give you to put on it... we sat outside, which was nice, since it's pretty quiet. atmosphere outside (and in general) is pretty unpretentious. service was excellent and there was an excellent selection of beers on tap. they are a bit keen on the breading / frying thing....
