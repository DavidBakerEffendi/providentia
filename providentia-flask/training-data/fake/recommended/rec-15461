Solid Italian food! Don't care about gluten-free personally, but went there from good reviews. Artichoke - 5 slices, buttery+lemony. Scallops: 4 pieces. I got orzo with seafood which was flavorful with generous amount of lobster and 4 large shrimps. Got a bit too creamy but didn't get wine this time. BF liked the pasta with sausage, spinach, and pepper. Dinner ambiance not too classy, but not too noisy either. Good for casual date, friend gatherings, or family dinner. Would go again if I'm in the neighborhood!
