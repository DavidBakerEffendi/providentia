Loved this place.  Get there soon because once the word gets out, there will always be a long wait.  I went with a large group and so I was able to try a few dishes. Drinks The Louie Louie was outstanding.  Big crowd favorite Venitian Spritz - I loved it.  Would absolutely order it again.  Simple, just what I wanted. For appetizers, We had the Octopus.  Tasty, I'd order it again.  Good flavoring. Scallop - Very good, but there's only one scallop.  It was awesome though. Main Lasagna - awesome.  5/5.  I'd order it again.  Perfectly done pasta.   Taglioni Sasicca - I just had a bite of it but it was also very tasty.  Will try it next time I go.   We had the flan and some other crunchy dessert, both which were fabulous.   Ambiance, 5/5.  Great lighting, perfect volume, service outstanding. Of note, they have some options for open bar with big parties and I would highly recommend open bar.  They were generous with their drinks. Afterwards, we went to the bar/club downstairs.  Super cute and trendy.  Again, go soon and early because it's going to get busy.
