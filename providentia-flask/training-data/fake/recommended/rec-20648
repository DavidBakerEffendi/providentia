The place pissed me off from the moment I walked in. First words out of the waitress' mouth was, "sit, I'll clean the table after you sit". I had to get my own chairs. We were also essentially scolded in that we're "supposed to go to them" to order. Then the portions were freaking tiny. The gnocchi was flavorless as was the meat and potatoes. Overall, I will NEVER come back here again. Edit: I still haven't been back just because the place was THAT forgettable with their rudeness and their food wasn't even all that good. I just happened to be scrolling through all my reviews and happened across this one and wondered why their rating was still so high. After looking at all the reviews that complained about her lack I service, the ones Gaia responds to, she never apologizes and instead always blames the customer. Amazing...
