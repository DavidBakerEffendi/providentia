Friend came from out of town very late, so we didn't have many options for places to eat. We found this place and it was full of pleasant surprises--a variety of food! We had the chicken fajita, banana nut pancakes, and the vegetarian panini. The waitress was very hospitable! She made the experience memorable. We are recent east coast transplants from California and we left satisfied.
