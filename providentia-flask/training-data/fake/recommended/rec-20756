This is by far the BEST chicken and rice cart I've ever been to! I didn't understand why people would wait in such a long time for halal food, but this place made me a believer! Even though the line seems extremely long, the line moves very quickly because the Halal Guys are so efficient. I've never had to wait more then 30 minutes. I always get the chicken and lamb mix, cover it in white sauce and let me just say it is to die for. However, there are two downsides. One, it ruins all other halal places for me and two, I live in Maryland, so my craving for halal goes unanswered 99% of the time. But in all seriousness, I want it every time I'm in New York and considering how many other food paradises there are in the Big Apple, so this must be some good halal!
