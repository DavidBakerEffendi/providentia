what i enjoyed the most--- the clam chowder! i absolutely adored the tingly taste of bacon that creeps up on your taste buds when your mind is so set on just experiencing some good old fashioned clam chowder. everything else was just pricey... even with my living social coupon, i felt like i got ripped off... sorry to say, i won't be coming back. another issue was in the grilled salmon fillet.. i found bones in it.. not just 1 but 3-4! good thing i know how to pick bones out.. but that's quite hazardous especially for a high end restaurant. Â when we told the waitress, they didn't do anything about it either.. simply said she'll pass the message to the chef. service was ok.. felt like it was a bit slow or maybe we were just really hungry... but if you're in the area, there are definitely better places to visit than doc's ..
