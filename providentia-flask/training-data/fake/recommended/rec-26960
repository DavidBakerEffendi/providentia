A fun place to enjoy a burger and a beer. A good solid honest burger but there is nothing particularly outstanding about it. Not worth waiting in a long line, so go at an off hour. The place is old school and unfortunately dirty. The bathroom is similar to what you would find in a truck stop. The prices are reasonable given its popularity. This is a check the box type of place for burger aficionados.
