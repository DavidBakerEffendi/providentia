Some of the Best bar food I have ever had! They have great burgers and Â bar snacks! They have a full bar and a good draft beer selection. The owner Gus is very friendly and personable and the bartender Danni is a lot of fun! If you live on 10th or 11th ave and your craving a burger skip 123 and go to Retro!
