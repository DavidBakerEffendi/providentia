Wow - tucked in on 12th street, this bbq packs a punch of flavor. We went out for lunch and made a game time decision to stop into Jake's.  None of us had been there, and we were glad we stopped in. They have some creative sandwich ideas, from roasted pork, brisket, roast turkey and others.  I had the mensch (12 hr roasted brisket, caramelized onions, horseradish sauce).  Fantastic. Fries were decent, sodas are no-name brand but they have good flavors (birch beer!). Moderately priced - $6-8 depending on what you get.  Looking forward to trying some of their other sandwiches, and breakfast.
