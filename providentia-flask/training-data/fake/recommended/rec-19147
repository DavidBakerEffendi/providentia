A great neighborhood wine bar in the LES. This place had really started to take of in popularity. It even been packed on the weekend recently. Went with a group of 4 and just hung out. We had some great wines and food off the small menu. The cheese Â sliced meat selection was delicious with very generous cuts. It all complimented the wine perfectly and made me us stay for while. Jadis is a sweet place to be.
