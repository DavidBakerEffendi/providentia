This is my favorite Malaysian place.  The roti is delicious, and you can watch as they make it from the outer window.  The clay pot pearl noodle soup has always been my main reason for eating here.  I always order it sans pork, because I dont eat much pork ever, but with or without I'm sure it will be equally tasty and soothing.  The prices are always low, and the staff is always attentive, no matter how busy things may tend to get.  They have plenty of appetizing sides and nibbles, as well as a full menu filled with delicious dishes.  It has a more comfortable feel than most hectic places down in Chinatown.  With warm lighting and wooden decor, it makes for an enjoyable and very affordable delight.
