The standard here approaches that of a Michelin star restaurant. Very interesting ideas and dishes that you won't really see anywhere else (like frozen & shaved foie gras with oranges) and they all taste surprisingly great. The amuse bouche bacon popcorn to start and tiny Asian yogurt drinks at the end leave a smile on your face.
