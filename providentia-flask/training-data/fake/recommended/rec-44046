Best fish I ever tasted and the wait as totally worth it!  If you plan to come here on a Friday/Saturday night, plan ahead and make reservations, or you will have at least an hour wait. We started with an appetizers of clams, which were the tiniest clams I ever seen, overpriced, but the sauce was amazing! I think the fish is a bit overpriced but definitely very fresh! Recommend to order the chilean sea bass!  Oysters were all fresh and raw and delicious! It is BYOB (bring your own beer/alcohol) and there are liquor stores right down the street, 2 stores away.  Which is great because you can drink as much as you want!  I suggest to bring your own wine. I wouldn't know anything about dessert because I was always full once I finished my entree. Overall, great and fresh food.  Great environment with outside seating.  Great Service.  Definitely a huge recommendation for a special dinner with the family, or your significant other, or with friends too!
