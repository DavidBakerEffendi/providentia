so let me start by saying that i do NOT know what noodles SHOULD taste like in an authentic asian food restaurant. but what i DO know is that the food is affordable, the service is QUICK and it's BYOB. so it gets an A-OK from moi. went with my friends, its perfect for groups. the noise level was high on a friday night. the staff was NOT friendly and we had to ask a few times for what we needed but the food came out within 10 minutes, everything was hot and fresh and tasty. not the best food i have had in philly but good. quality and good enough for $10 a person. can't say i HAVE to go back but i enjoyed the experience. thanks and i am done capitalizing a word per sentence.
