Its a pretty good burger but not the absolute best I've had in the city.  The fries you should skip, they're very standard fast food fries, and a waste of calories. The burger itself is a nice thick patty with a small thin bun which I love.  Nothing fancy, and only a few choices which they make well. The only reason it's not a 4 or 5 is because I asked for medium rare and got medium well.   Cash only, but cheap:)
