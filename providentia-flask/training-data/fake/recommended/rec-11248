Nam Son, this review breaks my heart. You were my first, my only, my everything. Whenever I needed a beef-inspired liquid pick-me-up; a satisfying banh mi; or a delectable meat-filled crepe, you we're my go-to--my love. I've been going to Nam Son, consistently, for 3 years--ever since I moved to North-South Philly. I brought all my friends there, my girlfriend and I went on date nights there, it was our post-Mummer's New Year's Day tradition! If there was one Vietnamese place I would ever recommend it was Nam Som. But over the last 6 months, you've changed Nam Son. What happened to the friendly, fast service? The tendency to cut me a break on your $15 card minimum? The ability to get my order correct?! All of these things, these golden qualities I knew to be true have gone by the wayside. Nam Som, you've changed, and I don't like it. If you're looking for declining quality of food and bad service, Nam Son is your place. If you're looking for me, find me at Nam Phuong, my new love...
