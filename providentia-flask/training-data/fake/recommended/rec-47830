Wow so I don't know where to begin, I was so disappointed with the service. For starters our waitress brought us burnt ass mashed potato pizza. I tried one bite and knew I can't force myself to finish. I sent it back and they gave me a new one that was much better. Pizza was ok but my wife loves it, so if u like mashed potatoes then you will probably like it too. Anyway back to service, the waitress never asked us for a refill on water and it wasn't like she didn't see us as we were sitting right in her path to and from the order station. I finished early and sat and relaxed thinking my waitress might see were done and so she could ask if we need a box and the check.    After 15 mins I just flag her down and ask.  I'm so irritated at this point I decide I'm gonna leave a small tip. To end this great experience she hands my money in a dirty cup with loose change on the bottom. By dirty I mean old beer was all over my coins and bottom of my bills. So furious at this point I took all the tip and then my wife left her 2 dollars. Which is not what I wanted but can't fight the wife.   Go to pepes if u want a more casual setting. Bar is a young immature crowd at night.
