A wonderful new addition to the neighborhood. The cocktails are creative, the beers are quality and both are fairly priced. The food is simple pub fare done well and works very well. The staff are all down-to-earth, affable people. The music is eclectic and cool. There aren't any tv's to erode your attention span or hollow your soul! The energy there is warm and fun, devoid of any attitude. Just a really terrific bar. Well done to the owners.
