Terrific in every way -- food, wine, decor and service - except for the annoying habit of not seating a reservation until all parties are present and therefore not guaranteeing choice of room. The bartender and manager were very warm, made us comfortable and almost completely effaced the irritating impression made by the young snippy hostess. The nouveau tapas menu takes some risks -- cold vermicelli with lobster and crab sauce - which mostly succeed. The more traditional offerings might be more satisfying - it's hard to beat thousands of years of audience research. Wines are all Spanish -- some nice discoveries, but most with that stony minerality often found in Spanish wine. But I drank white as it was a hot humid day, so make of that what you will!. An interesting and refined restaurant.
