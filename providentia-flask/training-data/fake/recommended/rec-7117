Wow, I'm so glad that I ended up having an impromptu dinner at this place tonight. It was great! Like my mom's Eastern European cooking, only turned up several notches! The dumplings with spinach and the Korzo burger were delicious, as well as their Jalapeno infused cocktail. The space is small but very cute and warm - feels like you are in the East Village, not Bay Ridge! Happy to have found another gem right around the corner from my place and will be back for more very soon.
