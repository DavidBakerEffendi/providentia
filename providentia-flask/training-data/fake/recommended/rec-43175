My first yelp review must be this one. Lived in FiDi for a few months and this is the only place to frequent for both late night food & booze and delivery food after work. All the steaks and sandwiches are as good in the restaurant as when they are delivered, and don't even get me started about the Old Bay fries. Delivery always comes with a smile and the late night bartenders are awesome. Adam is the man and always has the best suggestions for what to order. Highly recommend Shorty's for whenever you are trying to eat or drink ... ever.
