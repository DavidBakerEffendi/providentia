I had such a lovely time here last night. The food was delicious the service impeccable and the atmosphere beautiful. I ordered the loaded potatoes and the trout almandine. For dessert I had the cookies--to go because I was so full. I also had two glasses of the Cabernet. The price for all was a very reasonable $67! For an added treat Amanda Freitag who I have a huge crush on walked back and forth doing whatever it is that amazing chefs like her do. Â  I had to fight not to scream out "i love you and I love your restaurant!" Anyway I always use yelp to complain. I just wanted to balance with a great review. I will come back again and again.
