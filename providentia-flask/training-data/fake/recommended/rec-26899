Great  food, warm service, and chic ambiance! Who could ask for more? The candlelit lounge area is huge and welcoming with lilac velvet couches and leather cubes, and the dining area is minimalist chic with red leather retro chairs and cream tapestry. The menu is offers mezzahs (tiny portions like tapas), and standard sized portions for bigger appetites.  We ordered from the prix fixe lunch, and all choices were mouthwatering. You can taste the multidimensional flavors in the grilled shrimp salad. The bitterness of the lemon vinaigrette is offset by the sweetness of the fig, and the avocado adds texture. The garlic cream dip that comes with the fries is so addictive. Our waiter was very helpful and personable. Will definitely return.
