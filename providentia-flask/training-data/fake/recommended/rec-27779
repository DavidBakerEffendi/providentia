I found this restaurant using reviews on Yelp and Google and, in an effort to try something different, gave it a shot. We've been back over and over since then. -Food: Try their "specials".  If they have the ravioli's, get them! You will not be disappointed.   -Service:  We always make a reservation and usually sit within 5 to 15 minutes of the reservation time, which I think is reasonable for a Saturday night.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, and has always steered us in the right direction with their recommendations. Keep in mind, If you have to wait for your table, its in the foyer of the restaurant, which can get crowded and their are limited seats. Since its BYO, they don't have a bar to have a drink while you wait. Also, it can get very busy, so if your reservation is early and they need your table, you may feel rushed toward dessert time. -Atmosphere:  The dining room in the front is really big and can get a bit noisy and a little hot. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic dining experience, I would ask to sit in the rear of the restaurant and avoid the "dinner rush" time. -Parking: There is no restaurant parking so give yourself about 10 minutes to find parking on the street. =Bottom Line: I would highly recommend Paisano's if your looking for a fun, and satisfying dining experience with friends. Bring a few bottles of wine and enjoy! -MJ
