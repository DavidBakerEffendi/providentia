The proprietors at Xe May are very pleasant and respectful. They also make delicious sandwiches. I appreciate that they don't load their banh mi with chipotle mayo-like sauce, as they do at Ba Xuyen in Brooklyn; a little bit of condiment is good, but you do not want to drown out the other flavors (and there are many). My only recommendation would be to add a bit more cilantro to the mix. Overall, a great, cheap option for sandwiches in NY.
