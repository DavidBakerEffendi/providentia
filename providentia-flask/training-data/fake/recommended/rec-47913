I've been here twice, once when they first opened, and a second time just recently. Both times I had a really amazing time, love the atmosphere, the dishes, and the service. Really a great place to go with a group of friends. I'm sure once they get their liquor license it'll be even better. Atmosphere: the back room is decorated like a jeepney, with "bomba" (Filipino porn /toppless ladies on the walls) fun environment, def a gastropub. Casual, and fun - especially with people yelling "Balut!!" Whenever one is served Service: this is based on my first experience there, unbiased. (as the second we dined with the owner) friendly, welcoming. Our server acted like an ate, a Filipino cousin or so, loving, even tho she didn't look Filipino she had the accent down pact, and we felt as tho she really knew the menu well. Food: Really great dishes, and they are constantly tweaking and changing their menu. Good sizes for the prices you pay. [dinner] * bulalalo * like a nilaga dish, soup broth were amazing. Get the extra bone marrow, well worth it. * pancit malabok * not s fan * longa dog * get it! It's perfect with anchara on top * Bicol express * eh, I've had better * chori burger * we get this every time we eat here! Def a must try ! * embodito * Filipino meat loaf - really good, but not exactly amazing * champorado * JEPROX! I'm still craving this, it's so good! [brunch/lunch] * bangsilog * not my favorite - although the garlic rice is pretty amazing * pan de sal salad * just okay - I'd rather get something else * adobo shrimp * REALLY YUMMY!! * lumpia shanghai * nothing special * fish balls * meh [dessert] * halo halo * yum! Best on the east coast, just not as good as chow king =P - I wish it had pinipig in it, hint hint lol * ube shake * yummy! Loved this! Bottom line, go here, experience it, eat it and enjoy! Oh and I didn't get the Balut, lol too scared. LOL
