Best not to go with a group of friends on the weekend. If you do it should be as soon as they open or near closing since it is a small place. But there bartenders know what they are doing. They make some amazing cocktails. All the kitchen staff seem to of change, they don't seem to enjoy what they do. But the pizzas are still very tasteful. Top drink is a new york sour. Top pizza all. Can't go wrong with anything you order. Defiantly love coming here with friends but when its not rush because then I feel like they rush you out.
