As you walk into this fine little eatery, It feels like you are transported to the BK dining scene. The place looked and smelled delicious.  Everything on the menu sounded like a true craft of art making a decision very difficult. I ended up splitting a warm and gooey Rough Francis (fried chicken, blue cheese, hot sauce, pickled celery) and a Porchetta sandwich at lunch.  Both fantastique and generous serving sizes. The donuts and other baked goods were appealing to the senses,  but avoided - this time. ...Ive been back for lunch a few time and have yet to be disappointed with their sandwiches. Dinner here is like a little taste of perfection in every bite. And the service is great.
