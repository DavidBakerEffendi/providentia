Oh yeah, I was wondering why in hell this restaurant was on my checked-in list and then remembered that night where we ducked in here when all else was packed (Friday night). They were too, but we got seats at bar. Portions are small, but good for a quick nosh. They have a very good salted fish dish, but you will be a bit taken aback by the small jar and the stingy 4 pieces of bread. But still, it was tasty (we had to order two, after getting over the shock of the portion size). Crowd is the usual yuppy bangers, getting inured to that by now.
