With, at the time of this review, near 2000 reviews in total and an average 4.5 star rating, I had to check this place out.  Dumplings are around 25-cents each and up to 50-cents each, grouped in minimum orders.  For example, four pork fried dumplings are a dollar and eight shrimp boiled dumplings are two dollars.  A small wonton soup was $1.50.   Now, having given sufficient focus to the pricing, keep the following in mind.  This is in NYC and it was very, very good.  No, it's not five-star, fine dining.  But, it is gourmet of a sort and well worth the trip to Chinatown. I highly recommend it.
