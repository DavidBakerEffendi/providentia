Beer Cocktails!  This alone should make you want to go here. The place is small, but I think it adds to its very welcoming atmosphere; felt like I was invited to a private party. :)  Service was excellent, the staff was friendly and they were great with answering any questions we had about the menu.   I tried the pretzel appetizer -- nice crispy crust on the outside and a soft, chewy center.  The spreads and mustard that came with it were also delicious.  My entree was the emmentaler sausage with dumplings -- a perfect combination of salty from the sausage and creamy/cheesy with the dumplings. Loved it and will definitely go again or suggest to other visitors to the area! :)
