Great!  Now I have to go to Spain.  All because of darn Tia Pol.  We went on Friday night after the theatre.  The wait was about 40 minutes but well worth it.  We actually put our name on the list and headed next door to Izakaya Ten, a Japanese place, for drinks while we waited. I don't know a whole lot about Spanish food and wine, but this was delicious!  I tried a taste of the red sangria and it was a little too sweet for me...a hang over in the making. I loved the pork sandwich.  And the pescado en adobo was amazing!  Don't miss it!
