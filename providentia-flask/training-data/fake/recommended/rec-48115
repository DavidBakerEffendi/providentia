We ordered the brisket and chicken on a stick with potato salad, sweet potato salad, cucumber salad and corn bread.  Sides were good, corn bread not bad. The brisket was at least 70% fat (not kidding here), bbq sauce was skimpy and tasteless (very sweet) and the chicken on a stick was dry and charred, no sauce or even a rub on it. Could not eat any of the meats for our picnic.  Place is not clean. Price was according to what we got.
