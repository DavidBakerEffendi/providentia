I've eaten here many many times but this may have been my last. Completely unpredictable and unreliable food quality and service. Sometimes it's excellent and all too often it's awful.  And when it's awful, it's not just not good, it's really awful. I just had the Maryland Striped Bass with seared prawn, porcini mushrooms and vegetables. It was inedible. Fish was not fresh, prawn was a limp grey flavorless mess, and what I assume were supposed to be porcini mushrooms were unrecognizable rubbery bits with a nasty off-taste. One other member if my party ordered the same dish and also found it awful. Others at the table received their food cold or other similar problems. I'd have sent my meal back if it hadn't been a  dinner with professional colleagues where that would have been out of line. Service was slow and inattentive.   All in all, I'd rather have skipped dinner.  This meal was so bad, it will be a while before might even consider going back.
