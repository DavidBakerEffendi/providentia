This place has been around as I understand for quite some time and has undergone a few changes over the years.  It does not have your typical Chicago Pizzeria Uno AMC-crowd as there are no strip malls or movie theaters within walking distance. One thing it has is a small-town mentality (or whatever that means in 2009) and a mom and pop family business ethic. I went there on a Friday night and it was packed with football, your local borough hall types and some twenty & thirty-somethings...  being that this was East of the tracks literally, we were officially in East Rutherford!  (Downtown Rutherford is a dry town across the street).  The pizza was thin crust and that made it all the way more special.  Mine was of the Ricotta White variety at a $1.75 each additional topping. I washed it down with a couple of beers with a friend and felt right at home with restaurant staff summing up the bill total revenues seated around us at adjoining tables towards the end of the night.  The Tavern is within a street away from GainVille Cafe... Great atmosphere. Hope you enjoy!
