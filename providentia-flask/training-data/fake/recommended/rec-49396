Beyond Sushi is amazing! I love fish, but with the amazing combination of flavors in these vegan rolls, I didn't feel like I was missing anything. We tried the spicy mang, might mushroom, sweet angel summer roll and some individual pieces. The space is small but very efficiently run, and the staff was extremely friendly. I will definitely come back here...many times! New favorite spot for sure.
