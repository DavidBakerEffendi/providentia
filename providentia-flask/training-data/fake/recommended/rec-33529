Bistango Bistango Bistango... I don't know what to say... My friend in the area, who is a regular in the place, swears by it... I have had my share of meals from them, by delivery, and going there.  I'd say my taste buds are screwed up... but while the wait staff is very attentive and friendly, and more so to regulars, and the place is very welcoming and nicely decorated and organized... i have a problem with the food. Texture and preparation wise its fresh and well prepared. The wine list is very good too... but... i find no flavor on their food. I might be spoiled by other places that use more spices and seasonings on their food, but this place is expecting you to either find the subtleties in the the pasta and water used to boil it, or the natural taste of tomatoes and basil, which i like but come on! u need more than that, its Italian food for gods sake! Every food joint in Rome had more tasty plates than this! Any ways... if its any consolation.. their prosciutto and mozzarella and basil salad is good, they might be using Prosciutto De Parma i guess. Well hope it gets better, but I've had much from them, and usually the same experience... it might be me in the end, but this is my experience.  Sigh.. i like Italian...
