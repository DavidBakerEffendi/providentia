As a designers point of view, I love the interior/exterior. As an eater, I love their food. We went her as an accident and happily so. We were on our way to watch the Euro Cup finale at the Central Bar and we didn't anticipate the crowd. So we spun around the block and found this place. The facade was a real eye catcher. Faceted wood slats and clean glass, cant go wrong there and the inside was not a bore either. Japanese modern, but, by no means minimal. The menu was short and simple (always a good sign) and we got our food fast! Tasty and fresh noodles with great broth. I would definitely go back if we're in the area.
