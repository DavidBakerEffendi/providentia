I've been meaning to write a review since we were there in August 2013 so this is a little late. The sushi there was AMAZING!!  When my husband and I get a chance to go out for sushi we always order enough for a large sushi boat. Normally I can't finish it all but this place, I had too. It was just too good to stop. I don't think I've ever had sushi this good in my life and I couldn't stop eating it.   Wear elastic pants if you go. Trust me. An NO I'm not a huge person but am a marathon runner so sushi boats are part of my lifestyle ;)
