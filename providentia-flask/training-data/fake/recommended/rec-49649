I had been waiting for Beyond Sushi to open and luckily I was not disappointed! Anything would have been a step up from the wig shop previously there but this definitely takes the cake, delicious! I had the spicy shroom rice paper wrap after several of the employees told me it was the best out of the wraps. Absolutely perfect, fresh and light, a perfect summer dinner. For the 8" it was 4.75! Everyone there is really nice and I plan on working my way through the whole menu soon. Welcome to the neighborhood!
