This place is life-changing. Within the last year (or less?) Kimchi has introduced their 3/$10 taco deal, beer (!), brunch AND increased their vegetarian taco options. Things just keep getting better! As for the food, the krispy fish and roasted veg tacos are amazing, the falafel taco is meh (but the falafel burrito is phenomenal) and all of the apps are really really tasty (I usually go for the gnocchi or Aranchi). They can make virtually all the veg options vegan too, if that's your cup of tea. Free cucumber water and friendly staff (and owner!) is a plus too. Seriously, what's not to like? Just one note to groups: don't hound the patrons sitting at the tables, there's a really fast turn-around so just have some damn patience!
