OH lordy.  I love Hanco's.  Yummy vegetarian options (i get the garden rolls, salad and tofu sandwich).  Super cheap.  If you don't like your teas too sweet - ask for "half sweet" or get the Jasmine Bubble Tea.  Oh - call ahead because even if there isn't that many people in there, it can take a while to get your order.  Probably due to all the other customers calling ahead : /
