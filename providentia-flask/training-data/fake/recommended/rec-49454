Just a head's up: portions are definitely dinner-sized (even the dessert ones)! They take awhile to make the crepes but the cashier was super nice and offered me a free drink while I waited. I heard they're running a La Colombe offer- 1 free La Colombe coffee with any crepe order, for breakfast only (if I'm not wrong). I had the Matcha Stripe Chocolate and WOW. The homemade chocolate truffles were absolutely divine. Good lord. I triple-checked the menu to make sure that you couldn't just order their chocolate truffles alone. The ingredients in my crepe were evenly layered/ mixed throughout so you get a little bit of everything with each bite. Also, they have a cute little clear cone-shaped plastic 'carrier' for crepes, which makes it very convenient to hold on your walk home (if you can wait that long, that is!). The paper cone that holds the crepe has diagonal perforations, so those who love to eat while they shop don't have to worry about making a mess. I should be writing a paper right now but I'm here raving about this place. This in itself pretty much sums up how amazing their crepes are.
