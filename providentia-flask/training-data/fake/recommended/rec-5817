I give this place 3 stars, but they get an extra one since my friends, who dined there with me, really liked it. The place is a hole in the wall, and by hole in the wall, it was one small table and then tall stools and window ledges for dining in.  I was expecting actual seating, but my friends and I made do on one side of the place (and 5 of us took up half the place).   I LOVED the miso soup; it was mostly broth with some seaweed, tofu and scallion (I hate it when miso soup has extra ingredients like noodles).  The sushi is pretty solid.  The meat/fish to rice ratio is awesome.  I can see the piece of fish with a small single layer of rice around it.  I got the Mexican roll and Salmon/Avocado roll.  The portions are good, but I wasn't blown away by the taste.  It wasn't bad or sour, I just didn't really taste the salmon or yellow tail that much...?   Compared to other sushi restaurant reviews in Princeton, I would go here for sushi if I am in town again (I'll probably just order something else that has more taste) for fear of wasting money on bad, unfulfilling sushi.
