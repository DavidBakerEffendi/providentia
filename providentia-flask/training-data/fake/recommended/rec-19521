Duck fat fries, homemade tots, juicy goodness burger, and milk shakes?  So I just listed what I had for lunch here at Village Whiskey, yes all in one sitting.  I was visiting the area for business and a buddy said this is the burger spot in Philadelphia.  Coming from the DMV area and absolutely loving Ray's Hell Burger, I had to compare.  I asked the server to bring me all the items at once, minus the s'mores shake I had at the end, which I barely finished.  Anyway, the duck fat fries were a tad over fried in my opinion.  Their sauce it came was ehhh too.  However, the tots!!  Very crisp thin outside crust and mashed potato consistency on the inside, which bursts in your mouth.  These were good, best tots I've had, ever.  I can taste them as I am writing this and want now.  The main attraction was solid, but it wasn't drippin with the fatty goodness I had expected.  I can only assume they use different cuts of the cow vs Ray's. Anyway, still a great burger if you're in the area, I recommend it.  The finale was the s'mores shake which wasn't too pleasing.  It lacked flavor and was way too thick.  It was nicely presented though, but lack performance in my opinion.  Will I be back?  YES, the tots have me here.
