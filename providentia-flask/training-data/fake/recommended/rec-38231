A friend of the bf's raved about this place so we all headed out for a night of good food and of course... margaritas!  The atmosphere is perfect for a night out with your friends for some drinks hands down- gets really crowded and really loud.  It's also really dark so make sure you can see what you're sippin' and eatin'.  Thankfully, we had a reservation so we were in the clear to avoid waiting outside in the cold! The margaritas were absolutely delicious!  We had the refreshing strawberry lime margaritas (obviously ordered by the pitcher) and they were very cool and refreshing.  The food on the other hand wasn't very spectacular.  Started with the queso and was not very impressed and when our entrees came out, the quesadilla I ordered was nothing special.  It was not bad though - which is pretty important, if you ask me! Overall, nice place for drinks and good ambiance.  Don't come super hungry though.
