Sat at the bar bc inside looked jammed. Got perilla 75 drink to start off. It was s√ºber nice. Then I ordered the restaurant week menu and got the chicken and mussels salad. The chicken was sooooo nice my bf kept stealing it. He said it was the best chicken he ever had besides himself. I had a hard time telling which was better between him and this chicken. I would totally come back here again.
