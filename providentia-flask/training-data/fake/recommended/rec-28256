My friend and I ended up at this bar/lounge after dinner and after doing a quick Google Map search, we walked over even though we passed this place twice. Everyone was seated at the bar whereas my friend and I decided to take up space at the communal table.  Their selection of beer is mostly organic beer along with some Belgian ales. My friend opted for the Belgian Ale but I had to refrain from drinking that night because I had a cold and was on antibiotics. Overall, I liked the vibe of the place.  The crowd was definitely more in their late 20s - 30s so it was civilized.  There weren't people spilling drinks on me and we didn't have to shout over to be heard. I truly loved the music and whomever picked the playlist that night was AWESOME! A lot of the music was downtempo and surprisingly I owned a couple of their compilations.  I definitely heard some Nordic Lounge and gave me some sweet, sweet dreams that night. It's chill and laid back and the designer definitely had some good taste.  There's a fireplace to the side with red candles lit inside to give it this nice ambience and along the far left situated against the windows is a modern, sleek  two seater couch. There's some contemporary artwork that adorn the walls as well. I'd definitely come back for a few more drinks for the music, the ambience and of course their selection of beers were appetizing!
