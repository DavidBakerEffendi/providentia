I went here on a date and have to say this meal sealed the deal with this guy who is now my boyfriend.  As a trained chef from the CIA, he was completely giddy at the size of the kitchen and the quality of the cooking being served here.  I was also very impressed being a fanatic of all things food and cooking.  Every dish combined flavors perfectly and got better and better throughout the night.  We had a pleasurable time trying to guess how they came up with some of their combos.   My all time favorite is the broccoli rabe with egg served on toast with truffle sauce.   For anyone that loves eggs this dish is phenomenal.   We loved this place so much that decided it was the spot to take my boyfriend's mom, who is an amazing chef herself, for our first meal.  Some of the highlights were the duck confit, foie gras, the brocolli rabe, tuna on zucchini fried discs and a lovely panna cotta.  Let's just say she was just as impressed with the meal and realized why we took her all the way to Brooklyn.  And when asked what her favorite dish was I was pleasantly surprised to hear it was the brocolli rabe with fried egg!   I guess we both have good taste.  I think it just may be meant to be!  So maybe we'll come back in a year for our anniversary.
