We just went to this place for the first time after walking past it many times. Easily in my top five favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. Great Spanish Fridays, delicious wine, great tapas. Had amazing bacon-wrapped almond + dates; some great wine (can't remember name, it was the special of the day red wine, Spanish); meatballs with great sauce, and a big delicious salad. Highly recommend.
