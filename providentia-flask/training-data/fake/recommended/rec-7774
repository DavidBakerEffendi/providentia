This restaurant is like out of a mirage. A meal at ilili is flavorful, exciting, and adventurous. Â The decor is ultra modern and sure to impress if you want to take a date or a friend out for dinner and drinks. I love everything but you must must MUST order the "from Beirut with Passion" cocktail which is a divine melody of mint infused vodka, cilantro, and passionfruit. Then I suggest going with the vegetarian mezzo platter that comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, fatoush, lentils with fried onions, stuffed grape leaves, all served with fresh baked pita bread. The Phoenician fries are also hard to pass up. Its wonderful because everyone at your table can share the food, pass it around, and eat a lot of different things without feeling grossly overstuffed. A vegetarian will feel right at home here. Even though they offer meat and fish options, over half the menu is vegan friendly. And did I mention how well prepared and flavorful everything is? For dessert the ilili candy bar is pure chocolate enthrallment. Its so smooth you'll feel like you're biting into a chocolate pillow, with an exciting crunchy bottom layer all topped off with some vibrant green pistachios and fig caramel. A trip to the ilili restroom - where an attendant personally locks you into your ultra modern stall with a sleek sliding door - completes this experience. If I could afford to eat there every night I would because I always leave full, happy, and loving New York.
