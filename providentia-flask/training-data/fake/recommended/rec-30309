All this talk about delicious truffle burgers might get a vegetarian down. But, thankfully, there is another stellar option for cow (not beef) lovers: *the sloppy mami*. A veggie, "umamified" take on the sloppy joe. It's got braised lentils, tomatoes, and mushrooms bound with TVP (texturized vegetable protein, which is way tastier than it sounds). The sandwich is served open face with cheddar cheese (not vegan), fried onion strings, and jalape√±os. Overall fantastic option for vegetarians silly enough to go to a burger joint. And, if you're pining for truffle, there's always the truffle fries!
