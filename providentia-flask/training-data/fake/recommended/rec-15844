They have a bourbon cocktail with habanero pepper.  I repeat: They have a bourbon cocktail with habanero pepper. We decided to pop in here as a stop along the way on a friend's birthday excursion.  While they do have a seated area in the back, we decided to stay up front since we would only be spending about an hour or so there.  The waiter quickly gave us a menu and I noticed ALL the bourbon bottles lined up neatly behind the bar.  I love a place that makes a solid bourbon cocktail.  The first thing that caught my eye was the hot toddy but since those typically put me to sleep, I decided to go for the Bourbon Bonnet instead.  This thing looks harmless but it packs a punch, spice-wise.  Pineapple juice, habanero pepper, and lime.  It was spicy but in an absolutely wonderful way.  Even those of you who dislike bourbon but love spice would ultimately end up falling in LURRRVE with this cocktail. Overall, this place is very nice and classy-looking.  The prices are decent for what you get.  The food looked tasty, too.  I'll probably be back sometime to check that out, also. Pepper!  Spicy cocktails!  Oh my!
