We expected to wait on a Sunday morning, and the wait was 15 minutes, just as we were told. We were lucky enough to get a booth, even though there were only 2 of us ( tables are pretty tightly packed). Coffee was hot and surprisingly good. Â Wait staff was friendly and helpful, our waiter was probably new, but his co-workers had his back with coffee refills and such. Ordered a fluffy omelet, which was good, maybe a tad bland. I could only eat half, it was quite large. I ordered 3 apple pancakes (again, took half home), as my side with real maple syrup (both are up charges), making my meal $15, which was a bit of a surprise. Butter for the pancakes is served on the side, very nice. Real maple syrup $1.29, well worth it. The apple pancakes were amazing, I would definitely order them again. Not too sweet, just right. Santa made an appearance for the kids, he even had a real beard!! Overall, worth the 15 minute wait for the pancakes, but be prepared for the price. I wouldn't re-order the omelet ("condor omelet", price not listed on the menu), I'd just get the apple pancakes.
