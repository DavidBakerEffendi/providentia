Well, I know I'll be kissing Ricci's goodbye. Well, if I want a "plain-ole sandwich" I can go there. But for just a dollar more... PAESANO'S!!!!! I went there today for the first time before reading any reviews, just that 610AM said they had the best Italian hoagie in the metro area.. well, as a pescetarian, I don't do Italian, but I would suspect the glory would trickle down to the other sandwiches. I tried the Pesce Fritti.... from bite number one, I knew this spot was on another level. And I'm so excited to try the tuna and the chick pea sandwich!!! The potatoes were very flavorful and I loved the soda machine with orange creme and other different flavors. The way people are reviewing the Arista and all the other sandwiches, makes me "think" about giving up no land animal thing... lol.
