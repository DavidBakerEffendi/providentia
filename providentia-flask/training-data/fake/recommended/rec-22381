I probably go here once per week, even though I don't particularly like it.  The high prices and "Greek"-style pizza (=greasy,thick dough) do not do it for me.  The service is always friendly and the hours are the saving grace.  The owner, Tony (I think), seems like he knows everyone and is generally and all-around great guy.
