Amazing Italian Sausage. I could have split one with my husband since it was so huge, but I was able to finish it on my own. The sausage is great quality and the toppings of sharp provolone and peppers really add something extra. The staff were some of the nicest people I have met in a restaurant stand. For 2 sausages and a coke it was $18.
