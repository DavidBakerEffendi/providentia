loved the atmosphere, was psyched to sit outside but there was construction across the street that was driving me insane so we moved inside. Really great service, we had the duck, lamb and pork - all of it was really great! I think our favorite was the Pork Chop. The german Torte for dessert is a must!!!!!!! great texture and flavor.
