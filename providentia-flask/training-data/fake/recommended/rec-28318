I have been to Afton's a few times for Brunch on the weekends and have really enjoyed it each time. I usually sit at the bar and find the bartenders to be attentive and friendly. The food usually comes out pretty fast and is very good. I highly recommend the burgers and fried pickles, but really everything on the menu is good. On the downside Afton gets a little too crowded for my tastes at night. Any time I have tried to stop in for a drink I find it to be way too crowded. So I move on to another less popular spot. But that's just me, if you don't mind the crowds then it's worth checking out. Also, I don't think they do any drink specials which limits it's appeal. Perhaps I will try getting there before the evening rush sometime and see what all the fuss is about.
