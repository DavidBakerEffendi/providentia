I hate to be a jerk, this place may be fantastic but I will never know. My husband and I were in Philly for the weekend, staying at the Sheraton Society Hill. Our concierge suggested Spasso's. We have been to Philadelphia too many times to count, and wanted to try something new and with my husband running the Philly Marathon the next day we needed an early pasta dinner. So around 5 PM we ventured over and walked in for a table for two. This very snippy young lady told us we needed reservations. I said OK, looking around there were maybe a handful of patrons. We left. Outside, walking along the second dinning room with MANY tables, there were, again only a handful of patrons. I was angry and could not understand how at 5 PM with an empty dinning room how they could turn away a table for two. Sad.
