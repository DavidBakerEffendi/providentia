My main issue with Morgan's was the dick of a bartender; 3 friends and I went on a Wednesday night and had to wait for a four top to open up. Looking around I realized three sets of couples were sat at a four top while as many two-person tables were wide open. The manager asked us not to wait in the entryway, so we stood Â crowded around one of the two tops near the bar since there were no stools open. When my friend went to order drinks, the bartender wouldn't serve is because we were "at a table." False. One of the waitresses finally came over to our "table" and took our drink order. The drinks were pretty decent--had the Texas Tea (sweet tea and bourbon)--nothing spectacular but fine enough. After we were sat, we ordered another round of drinks. This time I could not taste even a hint of bourbon. It was like drinking a glass of straight sweet tea that a southern grandma would serve you on a hot afternoon. Tasty, but if I'm shelling out ten bucks per drink, is it so much to ask for some actual alcohol? I asked the waitress to see if the bartender somehow forgot the bourbon (it was seriously THAT weak) and she checked with him. His response? "She probably got a strong one last time and can pay for a double if she wants more." Really, dude? You can't admit you made a weak-ass drink and pour an extra finger of bourbon? Cheap as hell. The food was alright. Mac and cheese was the star of the show, but that's not even Morgan's--it comes from Elbow Room next door. If you're looking for legit BBQ, head to Dinosaur on Union.
