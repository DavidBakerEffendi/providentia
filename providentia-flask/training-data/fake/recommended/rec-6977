mmmmm Fried Chicken, Peaches has some of the best. I do agree with other reviewers that the hot isn't very hot. The extra hot, however, lives up to its namesake. The creamed corn is exceptional but the last time I went they didn't have it. It does get crowded, especially on weekends, so sometimes we will order to go and pig out in our car in front of the hood liquor store. The hostess can be really annoying yelling throughout the restaurant sometimes but otherwise this place is delicious. It looks like they've added some new things to their menu that i'll have to go back and try.
