My family and I found this hidden gem while we were looking for a place to park and get some breakfast after traveling all day. We loved everything! The space is cute. The food was amazing! The juice and coffee were nice and fresh! We were impressed with Alex, the guy who took our order at the counter, delivered our food to our table, he also cleared other tables and seem to keep the line at the counter moving pretty fast!!! He manage all of these different jobs very efficiently and with a smile and a great personality! When we are in the area again, we will be sure to visit again!!!
