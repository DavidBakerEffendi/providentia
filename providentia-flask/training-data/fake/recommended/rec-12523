Two couple friends came to NYC and I chose this place to treat them. Three people ordered two way lamb, one ordered lemon chicken, and one ordered salmon. We also shared combination platter. Everything is good, even the compliment olive and bread! I had two way lamb and was even surprised by the so special mashed tomato and eggplant beside the lamb! I never had so smooth mashed potato before!! The lamb chop is great. Combination platter is good also with unlimited pita. Service is good too!
