A great breakfast/brunch spot on St. Mark, especially for the different eggs benedict offerings and brunch specials.  Recently went for a late dinner on a Sunday night though and was pleasantly surprised with dinner options as well.  Easy to get a seat, nice outdoor area in front.. gazpacho was great as well as a simple linguini and shrimp dish. All relatively well priced for nyc too.
