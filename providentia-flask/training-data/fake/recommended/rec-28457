One thing missing from all the reviews for Sweet Afton is really how great the bartenders are.  In particular, Matt found a way to get  drinks done quickly and correctly, and always found a way to refill my water without my needing to ask.  This was all on a busy Saturday night, and him having to fend off the not-so-subtle advances of the ladies sitting at the bar.
