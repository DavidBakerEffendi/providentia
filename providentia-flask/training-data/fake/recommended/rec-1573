I like it. Quiet place and very laid back. Actually just ate there and got home about 10 minutes ago. Pizza was good- it's hard to find good thin crust pizza. The decor is very quaint... and although they don't have a liquor license yet, the bar area is very cool looking! They're giving out glasses of wine in the meantime. How can you turn that down???? I had one of the walnut chicken specials- it was delicious. I could taste a hint of mustard in it, and it was topped off with a side of spinach. The staff here is also very friendly and helpful. Bumped into Ivanka Trump and Aston Kutcher. Hey, if I enjoyed the food and service there, and their whole party did as well... it's a place to check out :)
