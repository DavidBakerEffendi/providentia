i've now been here a few times and the consistency never fails. Â the food is some of the best i've had in the city and the staff and decor are first class! the sea scallop dish alone is worth making this place a regular, and the mains are just as great. i'm a pretty hard guy to please and don't drop a 5-star rating lightly... but this place deserves it. 5 stars!
