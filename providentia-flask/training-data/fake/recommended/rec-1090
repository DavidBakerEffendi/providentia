This station stood out the most to me during my first trip to the market. It may have been the sample of the bread pudding that made me return after walking around which was not in short supply of delicious options. I ordered the jambalaya and gumbo, both were just so rich and tastey, no complaints about the quality. Reminded me of my feasts in New Orleans during the jazz festival. Comes with plenty of meat and sauce, both spiced to a notch more than mild. Enjoy!
