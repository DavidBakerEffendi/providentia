I first visited Galli a few weeks ago and after that visit, I was so impressed with the restaurant that I knew it would be added to my list of places to take people when they visit NYC. I love the ambiance of both the bar area as well as the back room. They have different vibes, however that isn't exactly a negative. In terms of the food, I tend to focus on chicken dishes when I come here, as they are really good. One example dish is the Chicken Marsala. The chicken is tender and the amount of mushrooms in the dish is perfection. As for the sauce, it's not thin and I can see how that may turn off some people. It's extremely flavorful. I've also been told that the pasta dishes are great. Personally, I don't know but they sure seem popular. I mentioned the different vibes of the front and the back. The front is the bar and has an area with a few tables. The tables felt a bit quieter then the back. Â As for the back area, it becomes a bit of a hip SoHo type spot with a great large skylight that opens at times. It can get a bit noisy, but at the same time if you have a bigger party and/or want a more casual type of a date then here's a great spot. Some people here have had negative service experience. During the times that I have come here (multiple times since my first visit), the service I received was quite good. The server was quick, always on point and went out of his way to make my time there great. I have no ending for this so I take a small bow.
