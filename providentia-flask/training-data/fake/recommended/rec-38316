Probably the best pizza ever. The flat bread provides an excellent home for the fresh, organic, locally grown veggies . While I'm defiantly a "Meat Lovers" kind of guy, I'm always up for a veggie pizza at American Flatbread. In the words of the man sitting next to me "There are puppies, rainbows, and freedom...this pizza beats them all"
