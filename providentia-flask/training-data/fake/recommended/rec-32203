I came here with a large party of 8 people (all guys) and we decided to go with the family dinner for 10. Since it was Saturday night, the place was pretty crowded, but we had made a reservation so getting seated was a smooth process. Needless to say, the food was more than enough and it was delicious. We got spring rolls, lotus rootlet, shrimp soup, fish stewed in pottery pot, country style beef cubes, clam sauteed with black bean sauce, water spinach sauteed with garlic, chicken sauteed with lemongrass, salt & pepper squid, and jello cake for dessert. It was a great experience from start to finish. The spring rolls and lotus rootlet to start off were really good and we destroyed those dishes quickly. There was a little bit of a lull as we waited for the next round of food though. However, we weren't disappointed. All this food came at once, plus there was A TON of white rice. I'm a sucker for getting your money's worth, so the fact that they re-filled our rice and water/tea pretty often was awesome! I can't really complain about any of the dishes, but the ones that stood out were the shrimp soup (a really tasty mix of sweet and sour), the beef cubes, and salt & pepper squid (there was also shrimp). I wasn't the biggest fan of the dessert, but it didn't take away at all from how complete and delicious the entire meal was. It was super solid and I left full, but it didn't blow my mind which is what keeps me from giving it a 5-star rating. Since this was my first time here, I can't speak to the other dishes, but I heard that the broken rice and vermicelli is quite good; however, the Pho is just alright. I think that if you've got a big group wanting to eat family style, this place is perfect.
