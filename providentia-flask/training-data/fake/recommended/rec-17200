I have been to Cuban Pete's quite a few times. Go early there's always a wait, but most of the food dishes are definitely worth the wait. BYO wine or alcohol to add to their "sangria" and/or "mojito". My only problem with Cuban Pete's is their extremely LOUD music. Please Please Please, if anyone from Cuban Pete's is reading this review!!!, tone it down a few decibals! I couldn't even hear myself think let alone try to talk to my family and friends at the table.
