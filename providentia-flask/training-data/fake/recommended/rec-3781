God I wish it was Friday. If it was Friday, then I could start my weekend with this meal! Bit alas! It's Thursday. I have a whole day left ahead to sour the experience of this moment. Maybe I should take off tomorrow. Self declare it a National Burger holiday. Man this place is good. And it's not just the burger. I haven't cursed on Yelp yet, but suffice it to say it's pretty "flipping" good. Heck the bread they give you raises a couple eyebrows. People who complained about the wait didn't try the bread. Couldn't have. I almost made the same mistake. And like everyone mentions the service makes you feel right at home. I usually hate coming to this area. Tourists jammed in with too many of the normal NYC rabble trying to push the tourists into on-coming traffic. But I've found a bit of an oasis. Suddenly Mid-Town ain't so bad.
