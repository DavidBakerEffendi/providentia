I can't really write much as I didn't extensively try the menu; but frankly, I don't feel like I need to in order to give it 5 stars. Here's why - - Both my date and I got spectacular glasses of red wine (3 glasses, for $21 on the happy hour) - I'd brought some cheese as a gift for my date, and they were kind enough to just bring us bread and not charge us a dime for it - Service was rockstar - Outdoor seating was even better Really lovely setup. Can't wait to come back and try some of the food.
