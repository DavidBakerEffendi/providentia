Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. Small, cozy restaurant. Nice ambience. Food was good, not great. We started with mussels - portions was huge! Then we got homemade papardelle in goat cheese fondue and steak frites. Steak frites was good. Papardelle was too rich... couldn't finish half of the plate. Service was ok, busboy was amazing! Bottom line - nice experience, but probably won't come back. If I want french food, I would definitely pick the Odeon over this place.
