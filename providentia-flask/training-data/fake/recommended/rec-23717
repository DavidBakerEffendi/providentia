I went to Jose Pistolas last night as one stop on a friend's birthday celebration and was pretty disappointed. The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired. I found the decor to be pretty plain, and lighting was almost nonexistent. I had to use the candle at the table to read my beer bottle's label. The prices were just a little too high for my liking. $4.50 for a Miller Light, and $6.50 for a shot of cheap tequila? Are you kidding me? No thanks. I didn't have a chance to sample any of the food, so I can't comment on that. I might give the place another try... so long as someone else is paying.
