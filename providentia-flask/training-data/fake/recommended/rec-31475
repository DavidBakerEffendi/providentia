We went to Fogo as a family for my daughter's birthday.  We were so excited and this place did not disappoint!  The servers knew we were in the mood to have a great time, and that we did!  They were happy and friendly and relaxed!  Our cocktails were tremendously good, and the food was excellent!!! Hot and delicious!  Tip: skip the salad bar or just lightly graze...the meat is the star!  While we were dining, we were trying to figure out the next special occasion so we could come back!  LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS EXPERIENCE!
