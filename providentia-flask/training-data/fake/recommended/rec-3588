Went to Buttermilk Channel for brunch on Mother's Day.  I expected a line based on previous reviews I read but still hoped it would be worth the wait like everyone said.  Well we got there at 10:07am (they open at 10am) and the line was half way down the block.  The good thing is that the line moved fairly quickly & because there were only two of us we were able to be seated right away.  I would definitely recommend the Pecan Pie French toast - oh so DELICIOUS!!!!! Also the short rib hash was FANTASTIC nothing like I ever tasted....and the eggs.....I have never had restaurant eggs that I didn't have to add salt & pepper too until coming here.  They were the best eggs I ever had.  On top of all of this the service was great an very efficient.  We also didn't feel rushed or pressured to eat & run because of the crowd.  I cant wait to go back and try the fried pork chop and cheddar waffle.
