For what I've read about their brunch we were all expecting a lot more. It could be summarised as an egg overdose, their brunch menu was all about egg and not really would give you a chance to taste something light and still delicious. We were four and each of us asked for two different dishes, we were asked by the waitress if we're sure about it cause it was going to be lots of food. We cut down 2 dishes and we felt like it was not necessary. We either eat too much or the eat too little cause we destroyed it all really quick. Service was a bit inattentive, after we finished it all we decided to ask one of the dishes we gave up and she said it would be a minute. It only came after we asked the bill and just because my friend asked if it was coming and we all noticed that they completely forgot about it and order on the very last minute. Food was tasty but nothing that justify all this fuss. Wouldn't come back.
