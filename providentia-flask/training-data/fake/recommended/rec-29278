My experience at this place is based primarily around their skewer and sushi specials on Tuesday and Wednesdays. The food is very good and at $1 each for skewers on Tuesdays and $2.50 for sushi rolls on Wednesdays, that is hard to beat. What really stands out about this place and I really appreciate is the outstanding service that I consistently get here. The servers are polite and efficient. They are able to accommodate all of my needs from filling up waters, to taking extra orders, and overall attentiveness through periodic check-ins and they do all of this without being invasive. This is why I always enjoy dining at this place and always tip my servers a little extra. If you're looking for a nice ambiance with decent food and prices, check this place out.
