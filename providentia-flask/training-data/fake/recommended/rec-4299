This is my favorite cafe in Philadelphia. And as a grad student, I log plenty of hours in cafes. Pros: -Free wi-fi -Delicious alternatives to coffee if you are over your daily limit. Snaps are my favorite-ginger, almond, deliciousness -They allow pups! With the dog park around the corner, I get to exercise my dog and then we head to b2, where I can get some work done and she can nap. -In the summer, their fresh juices are really delicious. -Cupcakes-among the best in the city, in my opinion. And you can't go wrong. They have vegan and gluten free options, which taste just as good as their regular cupcakes. -Lots of street parking Cons: -Cash only. Which is a bit annoying, but there is an atm in the back.
