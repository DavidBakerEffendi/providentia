Usually, when I get Bahn Mi, my one complaint is that there isn't enough meat on the sandwich. Not here. These sandwiches are full of it! And deliciousness in general. I recommend the sidecar, the hog, and the pilot, but really, everything is good. They make a solid coffee as well, in my humble opinion. The guys that work here are super awesome too.
