I am a loyal customer to this restaurant w decent food.. but today they went over board with their poor delivery service ... they have been late before.. but today it took an hour and a half.. food was VERY COLD... and all they can offer is a redelivery of a new order that will take "45 minutes" Â HORRIBLE.. never again... seems they get worse and worse w their delivery
