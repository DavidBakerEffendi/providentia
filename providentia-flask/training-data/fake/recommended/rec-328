After maneuvering the labyrinth that is the West Village, my brother and I finally found Corner Bistro. Tucked away in quiet section of the neighborhood, it offers you that quintessential burger and beer hangout without any of the inflated prices. A step inside reveals a charming dedication to the slogan "what's old is new!" Victorian-era tin tiles on the ceiling and walls, dark woods throughout, beer garden style benches in the back, and an antiquated register up front with typewriter-like buttons? This place screams take me back to yesteryear where I had an awesome handlebar moustache and cheap beer! Fair warning to everyone looking for a new chic burger to consume: this place is not for you. The menu is limited, but brings you the basics of what any person would want in their burger meal. My brother and I both went for the Bistroburger with a side of fries. Within 5 minutes of our order, our food was ready. That's what I call service! The burger, on initial bite, seemed average, BUT when my teeth finally dug their way into the onion at the bottom of the bun, whoa mama! I don't know what the onion did to make the burger go from o.k. to oh heyyy, but it worked! The meat inside is perfectly seasoned and succulent; juices were a-flowin' on my plate and mouth. Fries, as well, were not overly greasy or soggy. The size, while seeming small when presented on plastic plates, is actually perfect to fill you up. The only negative I can say is that we were done with our meal within 20 minutes of getting to our table (it took us longer to find the place) so there is a sense of a rush while dining. Overlooking that, though, the food more thank makes up for the lack of Sex & The City like cosmo-talk time. Is this the classiest place to consume a burger? No, but who cares when it tastes this good?
