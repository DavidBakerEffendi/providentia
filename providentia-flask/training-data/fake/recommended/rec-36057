I was recommended this place by a foodie friend in NYC and it did not disappoint. It's a busy place and you will need a reservation. Everyone that worked here was very friendly. The menu has a great selection of courses and a wonderful selection of Italian Red wine. We kept our meal small since we had been eating all day. We started w the meatballs---to die for could have eaten this for a meal perfect to split for two people. We both had pasta dishes---the cappelletti (super rich but yummy) and another mushroom pasta. This place would be perfect for a group of people to try a lot of dishes and share...portions are perfect sized (some might say small but perfect for the dishes served). Our server gave excellent recommendations (wish I could remember her name---sorry we also had a bottle of wine). The prices are far below what I expected based on the quality. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
