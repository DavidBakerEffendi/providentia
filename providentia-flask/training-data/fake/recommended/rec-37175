I took my mom here for Mother's Day. We loved it. She got the steak sandwich and I got the chicken sandwich. They were delicious. The owner (I think) came out and made sure we enjoyed everything. Our server was also very friendly. The cafe is super cute. We loved the Spanish music that was playing.  There is a large outdoor space in the back. I cannot wait to go back. I'm so happy there's a place like this in the neighborhood.  Although, I would love it if the mimosas were cheaper, or they offered unlimited for brunch.
