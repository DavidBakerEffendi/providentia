The food was really good. I created my own omelette. It was very well priced and came out very fast. You get a good amount of food for your money. It is cash only, so make sure you bring it with you. I would definitely go back there and recommend it. Â Also, if you don't eat pork, they have turkey ham for an option for their breakfast which is nice. I always want meat with my breakfast, but don't eat pork.
