I'm from L.A. and was headed to NY a few weeks ago. I love the Puerto Rican culture and have always been amazed by thier food. Thanks to the previous review of Thomas D, I kidnapped my cousin who lives in Brooklyn and I finally had the opportunity to dine at this Awesome joint! I ordered everything that Thomas D suggested along with some Rotisserie chicken...just one word..WOOOOWWWW!!!! The neighbor is a little sketchy, but the food is soo worth it. Thomas D mentioned that it's BYOB, well you don't have to ask me twice.  I showed up with a bottle of Pinot Grigio and we were quickly serviced by Miguel  who immediately opened our bottle and served it to us in glasses. Let me tell you; he was awesome. He suggested some other foods and actually suggested another wine called Albarino. I quickly ran accross the street to this wine shop and got us a bottle. The wine was Awesome...I just couldn't believe how amazing the Food, Service, and atmosphere was. I will definately be going back to Casa Adela, every chance I get. Thank you to everyone that gave it great reviews...you yelpers are always on it !!!!
