Their roasted pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sharp provolone is quite literally one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten in my life. O.M.G.  GREAT service, and super great if you can score a seat at the counter (where they also offer horse radish, mustard, and hot peppers to add to your food).  The way the juices soaked into the bread, each bit just got better and better.  We also enjoyed the beef brisket sandwich with roasted peppers and sharp provolone.  The roasted pork was my personal favorite of the two, husband says it's a tie.  SO GOOD.
