My boyfriend had heard great things about Jimmy's, and it did not disappoint us. It's a super cute, laid back joint with 0 attitude and a seriously yummy menu. Be prepared for the best kind of food coma, as the menu is straight-up comfort food. We had a bowl of the mac & cheese to start: Wonderfully crunchy on top, perfectly gooey inside. For dinner we ordered "Brooklyn's Best Fried Chicken" with white gravy and sides of creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, bacon and deliciously flaky-buttery biscuits. Wow. The "adult" milkshakes were amazing too. We tried the White Russian and a Jameson & chocolate. Yummm. Can't wait to try the chicken & waffles...
