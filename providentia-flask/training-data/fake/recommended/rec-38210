I bought my sister-in-law a gift card for this place because she and my brother were moving to New Haven and they love tapas. They absolutely LOVE the place so when we were visiting, we made reservations for Saturday night. The ambience is very cool. It's a bit on the darker side (I love low-lighting) but very elegant, yet you still feel casual. We had two servers and they were very attentive and knew a lot about the food and the wines. They suggest 3-4 tapas per person. That seemed like a bit much. We ended up ordering 10 total for 4 of us, and we were all very full. We did have lunch earlier in the day, however, so if we'd been starving that might have been appropriate. Unlike many tapas places I've visited, the portions were very good. Sometimes there barely enough for everyone to get a taste, but not here. We got olives, the mussels, whipped sheep's cheese, roasted red peppers (which weren't on the menu, but they put together for us!) and these FABULOUS roasted green peppers (wish I could remember what type!) that were simply charred, and seasoned with olive oil and salt. They were a little spicy, but not too much and there were a LOT of them. YUM! We also had the eggplant caponata, the octopus, and chorizo with figs. There was absolutely NOTHING we didn't like. Everything was fabulous, reasonably priced (especially for the size) and the wine was great. This will be a regular place anytime we're in town visiting.
