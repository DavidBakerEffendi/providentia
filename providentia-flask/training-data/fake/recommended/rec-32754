Took the family out for a casual dinner at Bartaco and was thoroughly pleased with the quality of the service and food. The ordering process works well for larger groups and you cannot beat the placement of a card in a table holder to get your waiter or one walking by attention for a drink refill or more food. We started with drinks and guacamole and then had an assortment of tacos and sides. The wild boar and fried oyster tacos were great. If you are looking for something different than the usual West Hartford fare with a vibrant bar scene you can't beat this place.
