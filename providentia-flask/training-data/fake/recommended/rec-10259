great staff and friendly neighborhood feel. definitely go if you live in the area. the food was excellent, if you like thin pizza this is the place, plus i asked for well done Â and it was amazing crunchy pizza just the way i like it. the apps were good too. by the time the pasta came i was full, i can't say it was the best pasta I've had but you can't always have a perfect meal. its a place i want to always go back to since i live a few blocks away. you can go order a bottle of wine w some friends and walk out full and nicely buzzed for a fair price.
