Came here for lunch with colleagues. A bit disappointed. Prices for lunch were decent. I got the salmon panang curry special. It was reasonable for like $11 with chicken satay. I understand that it gets crazy busy during lunch but my food was just warm and not even hot so I feel like it's been premade and sitting there for sometime. The decor and ambience is nice though.
