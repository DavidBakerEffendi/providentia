Outdoor drinking-- check. Decent beer selection-- check. Food-- not huge menu but the basics like bratwurst and spatzle. And they have someone walking around selling pretzels. If they had more options, I could make this a 5 star review! Atmosphere-- casual and definitely great for groups. I'm definitely bringing any out of town visitors here to check it out. This place is quintessentially Philadelphia! A must see!
