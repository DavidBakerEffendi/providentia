the fan favorites at umami were for sure the truffle burger. we were a bit deterred by the NYT article that raved about the manly and the hatch burger - and slightly glazed over the truffle burger but it was totally awesome!!! i think the original was subpar - but not one to always have to be the purist, i was happy to load a bunch of stuff on my burger and indulge. this proved to be the way to go. the CRUST on this burger is incredible! the tastes were just what i wanted them to be - juicy, flavorful - hitting all the right palate places. the onion rings were a nice accompainment, and the freckles (aka the "fried pickles") were spears of tempura coated deliciousness. the manly fries were also excellent - loved the sauces that were served with each one (ranch for the manly fries, along with a spicy sauce and another creamy based sauce). dedespitepsite the calories being included on the menu (we all grimaced and groaned and agreed not to let it deter us from ordering) we thought "sides" for 5 people would be enough - the onion rings, fries, fried pickles and a burger was just enough for me, although the dudes at the table were wishing we had gotten another order of fries (sweet potato or smooshed potatoes probably would have gone over well). portions here are not ginormous. we aced the noon arrival time and waited for about 5 minutes, while those entering after us (from 12:30 on had a bit of a wait). Have heard that the line at night is out the door (still).
