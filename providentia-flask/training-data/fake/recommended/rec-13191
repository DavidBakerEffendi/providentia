This place is definitely not worth the wait.  Someone needs to teach the hostess how to count and figure out that if someone isn't there after the 5th time you've called their name, it's time to move past it.  Biscuits were dry, coffee was mediocre at best, service was slow, and food is over rated.  Pass.
