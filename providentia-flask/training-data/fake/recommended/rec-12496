SOOOOO JUICYYYYY! I can't wait to come back here and try their other burgers. I got the manly burger and my friend got the truffle burger. We ordered a side of fries, which was crunchy and delicious! The dipping sauces that come for the fries are delicious as well. The burger, omg... I am a huge burger fanatic. I love juicy and fat burgers and it was so good. I had a great meal here. The buns are nice, soft, fluffy, while the meat is perfectly cooked to medium rare and very well balanced with the other ingredients in the burger. Ambiance of the place is nice, casual, and comfortable!
