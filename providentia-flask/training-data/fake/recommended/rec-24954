Everything is excellent. Â Service, food and atmosphere. But... This is the second time (last time at Bayou) I called ahead to see if I needed reservations. The hostess said walk ins are welcomed. So when we got there it was fairly empty and fifteen minutes later the hostess proceeds to tell us that they have reservations coming in at 8pm so we would have to be out by 8. It was 6pm when we got there. Now I understand sometimes customers like to sit and hang out all night Mind you it was a Wednesday night and a family of four. Trust me, we didn't plan on eating for two hours. But they did the same thing when I went to Bayou. I find it rude. If I ever go back I know to make reservations.
