The host was very friendly and quite accommodating despite our tardiness. We feared our reservation from a month in advance was disappearing before our eyes and our trip to NYC would be sans Balthazar. The other reviews about how loud it is are so true!  This is a noisy restaurant. It was difficult to hear our waiter and even each other at times. The bread was pretty good. That was definitely expected at a French bistro. We shared an appetizer of lobster risotto which was creamy and delicious. My duck confit was crispy, rich and complemented by many levels of flavors with mushrooms, crispy potatoes and a frise salad. My fiancé's roasted chicken, however, missed the marked as it was greatly lacking in any seasoning at all. Nicely prepared yet sadly bland. The somewhat offensive restaurant crime is that they actually charge $3.50 for a coke that can't be more than 6 ounces and you don't even get free refills. Honestly, that is ridiculous. No matter what kind of a restaurant it is. I don't think we've ever seen that and I hope not to again. Ridiculous.
