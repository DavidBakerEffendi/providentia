Born and Raised in San Francisco's Mission District and this is as good as it gets in NY. Hands down. The prices are right on for what you get. The service is great. Really, I have no complaints, only suggestions... The sour cream in a squeeze bottle is kind of weird and inauthentic. I like a dollop! But that's just me and I'm weird. I'd like to see their menu expand - IE I love Pollo en la Salsa Roja (Stewed Chicken?) instead of Pollo Asado or , but they're doing excellent with what's on the menu now, so I understand if there aren't any changes in the near future. In SF, I'm not the biggest Gordo's fan just because there were other taquerias that I grew up with and were closer to me. But it's good. Dos Toros, I love you.
