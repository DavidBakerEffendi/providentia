Not like this place needs another review but 5s are hard to come by so I had to.  I've had the chicken alone as well as mixed combo - topped with both sauces - it's all delicious!  The food is good for all times of day, whether for lunch or a late night drunken snack.  They've been very consistent over the years so I'd expect their new store front to be equally good. The line usually moves along quickly, but is sometimes stalled by folks ordering a ton to go. A must have!
