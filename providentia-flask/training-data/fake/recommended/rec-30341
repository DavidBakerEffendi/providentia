If i could marry a place to eat, this place would be in the running.   I have friends willing to travel from the Upper East Side just for lunch.    Outstanding service coupled with food that delights the palate and fills the stomach (always key for me).    The soups are in the top 5 soups I have had in the world.    I have yet to be mildly unimpressed with any entree.    I make it a point to enjoy a meal there each trip.
