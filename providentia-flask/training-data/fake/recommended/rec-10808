The food here is fine.  Not out of this world.  That's apparently enough to procure voluminous crowds, but the fact is, despite being a local institution, Dino is one step away from a Times Sq-style theme restaurant. Though it has its strong points.  You can bring a kid here and they can holler and make all kinds of ruckus and because the place is loud it doesn't really register.  And the $5.95 kids menu is a pretty great deal.  Both times I've been here with my 4 year-old, there was more than enough food.  Plus they gave him crayons and something to color, so, you know, bonus. I've opted for sandwiches, first time going for the pulled pork, second time for the chicken churrasco.  Both were good.  Not overwhelming in taste or size.  Even with two sides (I opted for the BBQ beans and Harlem potato salad), I was still hungry afterward.  I attempted to eat off my sons's plate, but between his protestations and my wife's glare, it was clear I was done for the day.  My wife had the chopped salad with BBQ chicken, and while she enjoyed the chicken, she felt the salad was nothing to write home about. The beer menu is extensive, and I look forward to investigating it further.  Because let's face it -- a place like this, you can bring just about anybody -- young, old, whomever.  Brooklyn standards may be through the roof, but that doesn't mean everyone else will turn their noses up.  Just leave your expectations at the door, and you'll have a "good enough" time.
