Had the gnocchi everyone was raving about, and yes, it's pretty awesome. Â Very creamy and very unhealthy, but whatever. The back patio is really cute and fun for a small group at lunch/dinner. Another thing I really appreciate about this Italian place:they don't give you huge, riduclous Italian-style portions.
