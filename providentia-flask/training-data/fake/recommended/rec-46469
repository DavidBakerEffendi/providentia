Unlike many other reviewers, we went to Marc Forgione for brunch instead of dinner. One thing is for sure- It's not your typical quiet and quaint brunch. When you walk in you're greeted by a rustic-looking sign with the word "Forge" carved into it. Aside from the obvious allusion to the restaurant's proprietor and its former name, it was also an apt description of the dimly lit, rustic interior. In stark contrast to many of Manhattan's established brunch destinations, there was nary a speck of pretention in the room. Everywhere diners chatted loudly in the dimly lit space making it intimate but lively at the same time. As for the food and drink, my date and I were able to share one order of the bottomless mimosas since we are still recessionistas even at a Michelin star joint. I ordered something called "The Sandwich" (no descriptor on the menu, so that you're encouraged to ask your waiter and open up a conversation) which was an extremely decadent creation made with poached eggs, maple pork and fennel sausage, thickcut black pig bacon sandwiched by two beautiful and pillowy buckwheat pancakes. You'll definitely need your friends to help you finish but it was a nice sampling of Marc Forgione's take on simple items like pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage. My bf ordered the "suck you" sliders which were three sliders of pulled pork and vinegar coleslaw on potato rolls, served with Yukon wedges and pickles. The pulled pork and slaw combo was surprisingly very Asian but a great combination. Special mention goes to the side order of bacon we devoured. After that experience, I can't imagine going back to fried pig of a normal-thickness. Marc Forgione manages to combine hearty food and lively atmosphere with the clean execution and attentive service you'd expect from a highly rated eatery. We'll definitely be going back at some point. The table next to us had the "Eggs Benny" which we'll be looking to try next time.
