This place is on the more pricey side but very nice and this location is one of the more exclusive looking than the others. Once inside and downstairs its a bit noisy. I've been here about 4 times and each time I've had the chicken empanadas and red sangria they are awesome! Â Best empanada's ever really taste good and authentic.
