Not your typical Italian restaurant.  Very casual, and very very good.  Each dish is juicy, flavorful, and impressively cooked just right. The hot food is served in these metallic bowl-like dishes. Keeps the food warm.  Order a few dishes and it's easy to do family style. Prices are very reasonable, borderline cheap -- but food is high quality.
