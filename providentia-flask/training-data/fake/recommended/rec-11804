I was looking forward to taste the duck fat fries, recommended by a co-worker's brother. So I went to Northern Spy with my friend Tim. We both never had duck fat fries before, but I must admit I did have some high expectations. So, there we were, staring at our duck fat fries. And..it tasted alright. I have to say I've had better fries though. Not sure it was because of the duck fat, or that my expectations were just too high, but I was a bit disappointed. Just a bit though, because it was alright. The staff was very friendly and this is a huge plus, after the service I've had in some other restaurants. Tim really loved the fries! But he had no expectations what so ever. I will go back, because I liked the atmosphere and I want to try out a few other things I saw on their menu.
