This place used to be amazing I used to go here all the time with my friends or family. I always order the honey walnut shrimp because it's my favorite but recently they changed how it's made. It's horrible, I mean why would they change something that was already perfected ? I was very upset and asked them why they changed it and they just said that it's better but it wasn't. The waiters also just stand there and watch you eat and it's very annoying. I don't need someone standing there and watching me. Not coming here again.
