I've been to El Camino twice now in as many weeks and look forward to going back. Both times we had midsized parties of 5-7 people and got seated pretty quickly. There was a wait for the outdoor seating (picnic table-style), but it was worth it for the people watching and to be able to spectate as the table next to us rang up a $700 bill and then had to cut through their tequila haze to deal with it. The food was excellent both times, and between the two groups we sampled quite a few dishes, including: Beef ribs half rack (more like Brontosaurus ribs), pork ribs (excellent), pork shoulder (also excellent), grilled corn, seitan, pulled pork sandwich, a single rib appetizer (the "loosey") and sweet potato ice cream. In short, the BBQ is excellent, but it is texas-style, so the sauces are in squeeze bottles on the table and not on your meat. The draft list is local/regional and the margaritas are delicious. For a small supplement, you can have them add a spicy smack to your marg, which I've heard from several sources is well worth the investment.
