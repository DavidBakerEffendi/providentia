I just shared a feast with three people for $5.50.  I'm not religious, but dear God, I feel like I have sinned.  When you can get four fat scallion pancakes, a box of ten juicy pork dumplings and an overstuffed tuna sandwich for this price in Manhattan (even in Chinatown), it's like you're stealing... and of course the inexpensive nature of it all makes you prone to gluttony.
