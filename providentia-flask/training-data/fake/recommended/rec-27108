"Sandwiches" is how this eatery is known by Orange and East Orange natives. This place has been around for more than 25 years at least. I speant many a teenage night in the booths on Main St. In Orange, which was the original location. Back then I was a meat eater so the Italian cheeseburger was my favorite as it is for many. Now I'm a pescetarian (seafood only) so I get the fish or shrimp, well I would if I was to ever go back there. There are 2 stores, one in Orange and one in East Orange. I made the mistake of calling and placing an order @ the wrong one. When I showed up to get my sandwich and found out I'd called the wrong store, the staff at the Orange location refused to make the sandwich. They wanted me to go to the East Orange store and pick it up. The sandwich was $3. Not worth driving to another town nor loosing a customer over if you ask me, but they don't agree. I haven't been back since.
