I had the best fried chicken of my life. Was visiting the city when a friend of mine dragged me into this place- it must have been early because we had no wait. We sat down, had a great wait staffer help us out, drank a bottle of wine and gorged. Once again back in SF, I keep dreaming about the chicken and can't wait to get back. This is now a mandatory stop on any NY trip.
