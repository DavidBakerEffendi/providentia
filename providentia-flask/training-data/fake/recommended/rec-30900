I would've given Scratchbread 4 or 5 stars because their food is amazing, BUT the prices too high for their disgracefully small portions.  I am a southerner and think their grits are some of the best I've even had.  Last time I was at scratch bread I was relieved to see they were using coffee cups for their $7 grit situation instead of the biodegradable handfull planter cups.  However to my dismay, the folks at the window balled up a piece of wax paper in the bottom of the coffee cup to prevent it from being filled up.  Really guys??  Last I checked grits were not that expensive.  Also, their delicious $1 half piece of bacon just decreased to 1/4 a piece.  I have no problem paying for quality, but don't skimp on portion sizes.  I'd like my whole half piece of bacon please.
