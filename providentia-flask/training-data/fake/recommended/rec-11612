Been here a few times, never had to wait too long even on weekends. Firstly, the truffle fries are a must-order. The truffle flavor doesn't overpower the overall taste of the potato and it just compliments the flavor, as well as the cheese. There are moments in the day where I am daydreaming about eating these fries. Ugh. The truffle burger is also a must-try, one of the best burgers I've ever eaten and I probably could've had 2 more. The other burger I had was the Cali burger-- it is also a worthy mention burger but nothing in comparison to the truffle burger. Will continue to come back here for my burger fix.
