Disappointing because i had high hopes from some of the reviews posted here.  I had the chicken/bacon tacos and they were bland. For a place claiming mexican food I expected some flavor, seasoning, spice or heat...something.  Place isn't really so much a restaurant.  It's more of a bar that serves food.  I also had plantains.....they looked like plantains but surely didn't taste like the plantains i'm familiar with.  Being married to a hispanic male I know what plantains are supposed to taste like.  However, the pickle chips were really good.  Best I've had.  Being that the food was not expensive at all at least I know I didn't overpay for something that was less than mediocre.  Waitress was nice but watching a drunk couple making out at the bar, right by our table, at 5 in the afternoon wasn't exactly the ambiance i was hoping for.
