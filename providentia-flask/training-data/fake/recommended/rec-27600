So very cheap and delicious. I judge all thai places by their masaman curry, my favorite dish. Often it's watery, bland, with undercooked potatoes. Sometimes restaurants throw in random vegetables that don't belong there... This one was a definite B+ with a zesty, peanutty flavor and well-cooked potatoes, skin on. Beer selection is small but passable, and the bartender was friendly. The backyard seating is gorgeous on a hot summer night, cooled by some very tall trees. Watch out for the flowers falling in your curry.
