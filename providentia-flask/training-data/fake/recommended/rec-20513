It was an okay burger. The place is an obvious dive bar. I'm not old enough to drink, but it seems like a good place for a group of friends to get a cheap drink. I was seated immediately in the back and I have to say that I was sweating the entire time. It was a bit cramped, and it was very warm. The menu was behind me, and I got the bistro burger and a side of fries. The burger came out quickly and was medium rare, but it just didn't have much flavor to me. Instead, the taste of raw onions overpowered my mouth, and still lingers right now three hours later. The fries were also lacking salt. For 12 dollars, this was a good deal for a big burger, but I'm not a huge fan.
