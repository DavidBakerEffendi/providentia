Make reservations for brunch otherwise it's over an hour wait.  The food was great.  But one of the hostesses was very snotty to me.  I had reservations and she told me that they were running behind on seating so it would be 10-15minutes wait after my reservation time, which to me wasn't a big issue.  But when I checked in again 20 minutes later and she rolled her eyes at me really turned me off.  Again, the food was really tasty but the hostess being rude and service slow makes it a 3 star for me.
