My husband and I just tried this place tonight.  It looked nice; outdoor seating,  nice evening.  Has decent ratings here on Yelp. First off, the tables and chairs here are flimsy plastic.  Like they bought them at Walmart.   Thin, cheap forks and knives, plastic baskets were used for many dishes. Now the food.  My husband got an arugula salad with pears, goat cheese, walnuts and chicken.  It was the size of a side salad.  The single piece of goat cheese was the size of a grape.  My fish and chips were passable, if a little greasy.  Soggy fries.  And, unfortunately, the ketchup was not Heinz as presented.  The bottle was definitely old and refilled with an off brand.   On the bright side, our server was very friendly and efficient. We won't be back.
