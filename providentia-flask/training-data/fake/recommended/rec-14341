Eataly came highly recommended  to me by a couple of my friends currently living in New York. I'd have to say it definitely lived up to the hype. Yes, there was a lot going on. Yes, there are long lines. Yes, there were a ton of tourists. Yes, I was one of them. That aside, though, you can't beat the food. I had the BEST sandwich I've ever eaten there -- the prime rib sandwich on a french  baguette. Eataly is definitely worth stopping by, whether you are visiting as a tourist or live in New York. Not only is the food stellar, but it has an awesome marketplace of fresh foods that can't be beat. I tell all of my friends who visit to New York to eat at Eataly!!
