Mama Rosa's is about a block away from our apartment and though we've been in this close proximity for half a year now, we just tried their food this evening for a filling dinner after playing some tennis. It hit sooo many spots. Delicious! We ordered a simple plain cheese pizza (large, and between my boyfriend and me we demolished this thing - it was so yummy) and picked it up within ten minutes of ordering. It was hot, fresh, and ready quickly. We paid $13 for it which isn't bad, and took it home to enjoy. It was a wonderful concoction of cheesy greasiness, and the crust and sauce were both fantastic! Love how mild the tomato sauce is since it really amplifies the cheesy flavors, and the crust was refreshing to me since I've gotten a little tired of the mostly burnt brick oven pizzas around the New Haven area. We will definitely be returning to Mama Rosa's. The service was friendly and timely, and the food was great within a short distance of home to boot. Next time around I'd like to explore their menu a little more (we're frugal college students so the cheese pizza is our norm) and see what else this adorable hole in the wall has to offer!
