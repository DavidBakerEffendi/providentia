The girl in front was awesome and attentive.   There were one man waiting for a togo order and one couple.  It should have been a sign to leave when alot of items on the menu where crossed out. I ordered the carne asada meal and a tres leche. They were out of the tres leche. So i wait and wait and wait and my food is finally ready. I get home and open my container and tortillas. The tortillas look like the ones out a taco store bought package. I taste the beans and promptly spit them out. They were horrible!!!! Tried the rice, no good. So i start on my meat. First off ive never had carne asada where the beef is already cut into slices. Tastes over cooked and waaaaaay too much pepper. Honestly i through it away. Maybe im just spoiled bc. I live in virginia ans have millions of spanish food places, but i will not be going back to this place. Sorry guys
