Chinese buffet is what it is. You're not going to get incredible quality or outrageously creative dishes, but the thing I look for is the variety of items in the buffet and this place has it! I went here with my in-laws for my little brother-in-law's 21st birthday. We were quickly seated and asked for our drink orders. The buffet included four huge hot tables, a Mongolian grill, a raw/cold bar with oysters and the like, and two dessert tables as well as an ice cream machine. The food was coming out frequently and most items on the tables were hot and fresh. The sushi wasn't anything to write home about, but the crab legs were huge and the seafood selection was delicious and plentiful. Even though the ice cream was ice milk (more grainy and less creamy than real ice cream) it was still good enough that I got up for seconds. I'm a sucker for ice cream.
