There are perhaps 2 schools of thought when it comes to the process of eating: 1.  Those who slowly savor each and every tiny little bite. 2.  Those who try to jam as much food into their mouth as possible so that their tastebuds are overwhelmed with flavor.  (This is also, coincidentally, a similar trait to that found in crack addicts) I am definitely of the latter school (uhh... not the crack addict part of course *cough cough*).  People often find it embarrassing to sit next to me at a meal... especially at a nice restaurant.  So with that context in mind, let me just say that any meal that can take 3 hrs and not have me feel impatient or bored in between, is a meal deserving of 5 stars.  That meal, was the tasting menu at Dover. 7 courses... SEVEN!  With like a million little things in between!  It is definitely a good value for the price, the time and the quality.  Pictures tell a thousand words, but the standout dishes for me were the scallops and the lamb (a substitute that the staff graciously made). I'm glad that this extension of Battersby is living up to the reputation of its beginnings.  It may not have the same intimate atmosphere, but the friendliness of the staff, and the care with which you are served, are impeccable.  The meal was perfectly paced, and it felt like something special. And now I can make reservations online... there goes my bank account.
