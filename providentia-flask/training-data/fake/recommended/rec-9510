The atmosphere is cute and cozy . Great for a date night with the girls or your significant other. I ordered a Strawberry-vanilla margarita which sounded interesting, but totally worth the try it. Everything was amazing. We also ordered Plato Mexicano which was more than enough to share for 2...and for dessert we had the flan de coco. The Jamaica tea is also an interesting but great drink, it was made with hibiscus and it was extremely yummy. I absolutely love this place! I've been there a few times now, the bartenders are nice the servers are always busy and can be a little delayed but their personalities are great and they're attentive. Â I hope they stick around for a while
