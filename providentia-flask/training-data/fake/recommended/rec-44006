WARNING: This restaurant is Szechuan style Chinese food, therefore extremely spicy. The BF and I were traveling to Philly for the weekend. After the rain died down on Saturday night, we went out and he wanted to try out Han Dynasty, seeing that there were so many high rated reviews. Hearing Szechuan style food, I was scared but was forced to go. When we got there around 7-7:30PM, the bar and tables were PACKED! There was a table waiting to be cleaned and according to the hostess, they were understaffed. That's fine, we wait, but we waited an additional ten minutes. The hostess was nice enough to offer and wipe the table down herself when our waiter came and did it. The decor was very nice and TV screens were big and bright enough in mid-dimmed place. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles (one of their popular dishes) level 6, dry pepper style chicken level 4 and salt n' pepper style scallops. For myself, I ordered an Amaretto Sour as well, probably should have saved the money though because it tasted very diluted. Anyways, the Dan Dan noodles tasted very good but the spice intensity gradually built up. It's a mixture of what I would say peanut butter noodles with hot oil, delicious but dangerous. At that point i think my tongue could not taste anything so I don't really know what to feel for the chicken. My boyfriend said the chicken was VERY spicy for a level 4 but it was delicious, so delicious that it hurts so good! Finally the scallops... Holy moly the scallops were so tender and flavorful, my favorite dish of the night! There were a lot and were big and chunky, yum! The atmosphere and design is very nice inside, you will be comfortable sitting alone or with a group. Would recommend if you are an avid spicy food lover like my BF! If you're coming with someone who isn't, you can lower the intensity to 1 or 2 and ask for hot oil on the side.
