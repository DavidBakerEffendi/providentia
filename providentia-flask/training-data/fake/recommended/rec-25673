My husband ordered the wings hot and well done, with a basket of sweet potato fries. I ordered the tomato mozzarella sandwich. I absolutely dig the soundtrack they have playing here. Totally laid back.. Our order arrives and my sweet potato fries with dressing are absolutely perfect! They are crunchy and perfectly seasoned, and the dressing, although advertised as spicy, isn't, and it's delicious! The mozzarella sandwich has fresh made mozzarella and is perfect on a brioche bun! I am not a huge fan of basil, and forgot to ask for it on the side, but it was still very good. My husbands wings are a decent size and are unbreaded. They arrive exactly as he ordered them, well done and hot. He also digs right in to the sweet potato fries. They really are delicious!!
