The place is very swanky and hip and looks just like a modern Japanese restaurant does in Tokyo. For a date, I recommend calling ahead to reserve their little curtained booth, which is very cozy and special. Their miso soup is shockingly good (the best, really), as is the dipping sauce for the tempura sweet potato. Said potato, however, was somewhat undercooked. The staff were friendly and service was quick. One sad thing is that apart from a couple of soups containing noodles, there was not a single noodle dish on the menu, which is a tragedy. Yakitori Boy being otherwise so close to the Tokyo experience really ought to serve the young Tokyians favorite late night quick grab Yakisoba, which is hard to come by in Philly. In leu of a noodle dish I asked for some simple Ramen noodles on the side, which got me: Â half a packet of Ramen *without the flavoring!* who thinks of this?! for which I payed 5 dollars. As scandalous as that was, I say the miso makes up for it.
