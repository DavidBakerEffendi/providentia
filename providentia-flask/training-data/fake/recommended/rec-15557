Great experience at Uva. The only downside is the cramped entrance where people tend to congregate as they wait to be seated. We had a reservation, but it took probably an extra 15 minutes to be seated. Seating is also cramped. Your table is probably a foot away from the next, but in a way it adds to the experience. It is a lively, beautiful place. Fun, but cramped, atmosphere. Started off with a sun dried tomato and pesto bruschetta, which was fantastic. Just an incredible experience for my tastebuds. I then had the ricotta gnocchi with black truffle chive sauce. WOW! Highly recommend this dish. My friend ordered the short ribs, which were good, but tasted like pot roast. Not a bad taste, but not what you were are craving when at an Italian restaurant. I could tell he was jealous of my gnocchi! I hope to see Uva continue to do well, and would love to return next time I'm in NY.
