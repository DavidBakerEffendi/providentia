I love having lunch here!  I probably come about once a month at least.  If you ask for the spiciest they can make, it may be the spiciest food served in the area (spicier than all the Thai places I've tried). Servers are very nice.  All the food is good here.  Lunch menu is a good deal for the price.  Great place to take out of town guests.
