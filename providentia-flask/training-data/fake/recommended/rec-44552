Sooooo gooooood. Had the seafood pasta special. I had to try hard to be polite to my company by not scarfing down the food. The waiter had a thick Italian accent and was very helpful in making my decision with my meal and wine. This is a nice place, and I will definitely go again. Probably alone next time so I don have to watch my manners.
