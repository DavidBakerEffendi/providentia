It was my first time trying Tofu House since many of my friends recommended this place. I decided to try it the other day and boy, I am fascinated. My friend and I arrived around 6PM for dinner. It was a 15 minute wait, so it wasn't that bad. Eventually, the waiter brought us to our table in the second floor, which was filled with empty seats! I didn't know why we have to wait that long while there were plenty of seats upstairs. But anyways, I ordered a mixed soondubu (seafood and beef) and the Korean pancake. As the waitress was placing the side dishes on our table, they also gave us a small fried fish as well! Now, I've been to a couple of Korean restaurants in the city and in Queens but never have I ever gotten fish as my side dish. The soondubu and the Korean pancake were delicious! I am a huge tofu lover and their tofu texture was perfect. This restaurant became my go-to place every time I head down to ktown. Despite being my favorite restaurant, I gave it 4 stars because of the workers. My friend and I stayed at the restaurant for 2 hours (just eating and talking). The restaurant slowly filled up with more customers and the staffs are becoming uneasy. It is as if they're waiting for us to leave any minute. As soon as we paid, the worker came to our table IMMEDIATELY and cleaned the table infront of us. I felt that was kind of rude because my friend and I didn't even leave the table yet (we were grabbing our bags) and they started to clean the table asap. 4 stars for the terrific food! The service was decent. The food was good. Definitely coming back!
