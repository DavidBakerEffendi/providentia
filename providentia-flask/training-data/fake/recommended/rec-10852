People here are 100% right about it being overpriced, but you are paying for the view. This place will blow up this summer with only a hand full of water view locations in the city it is on the cheap end . Great place for big or small groups. Big plus the corn hole game is free. So for a lazy day chill in the back and take in the sun. Drinks are ok. And it is a seafood place so you are going to spend an extra buck or two. Service was pretty good,
