Buttermilk Channel you have more class than you know. You have been host to my many dates some good, some bad(Im looking at you mom), and not once have you dropped the ball. Â The standouts in my mind on the menu are the Chicken and Waffles, and the always tasty Duck MEATLOAF!!! For brunch you also have tasty options that keep my mouth watering on a pavlovian level unattainable by most humans.Cheddar Waffles and Pork Chops, Duck Hash and eggs.....and the biscuits....oh the biscuits. You are just a mouthgasm waiting to happen and youre always sweet and efficient in service, why havent we gotten married yet?
