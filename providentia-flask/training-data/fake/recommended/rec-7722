Came here again for dinner with a friend and again thrilled with the quality of the dishes, especially for the price! Grilled octopus is a must and I was pretty pleased with their main course chicken dish as well. I wish I could up my review to 5 stars, but I was pretty disappointed with the service. One of the servers kept asking us if we were done even though we clearly weren't and there weren't customers waiting for tables. I'm hoping this is was just an off-night though because I've had such great experiences with the food.
