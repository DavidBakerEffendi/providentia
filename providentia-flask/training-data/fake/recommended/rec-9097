This review is for delivery only (sort of). I had a major cake craving and saw this place on seamless.  I had been there about 10 times for drinks and apps or dinner but was never inspired to write a review.  It's cute,  friendly and yummy but never inspiring But back to that late night cake craving...The only cake was chocolate with chocolate. I wasn't in a chocolate mood so i went for the creme brûlée and the passionfruit crepe.    The crepe looked like a sad quesadilla sitting in a juice mess.  The creme brûlée was a very tiny, cold, messy pudding w a mandarin orange slice on top.  I was inspired to write a one star review for this pathetic mess I just spent $25 on.  Then I ate it. It was delicious and fabulous and satisfying.  Five stars worth of taste!  And it turned out to be the perfect amount and I will be ordering again!
