Whenever I'm in the mood for some bun bo hue this is definitely the go to place. They have the best ones in Philly. The best part is you can choose your level of spicy. You can get a small for $8.50 or if you feeling a little hungry go for the large which s $10. I've also had the chicken noodle soup with fresh mushroom but keep in mind the chicken noodle soup has bone so if you don't like having bone or pieces of bones in your soup then stick with their bun bo hue since that's what they known for anyways.
