Eat here every few weeks, food is always excellent. Get the lobster ravioli, also had meat sauce with gnocchi on New Years and it was amazing! The veggie spread for the bread, I crave it. Really like the waitstaff, friendly and attentive. They now recognize us, which I really love about a place. The owner is super nice and always checks in. It's a small place but they really do the best with what they have. Really hope they do well!
