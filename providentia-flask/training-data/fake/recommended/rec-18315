So I rolled in this evening and had my all time favorite- the Slate Burger.  This Slate burger rivals Good Dog.  It's one of the best in the city.    The fries are evil.  I love them so much but instead I had the salad.  The food was served after I finished my first drink which was in about 20 minutes. Perfect.  I watched a bit of game, talked to the friendly bartender and made fun of the owner.  It's always great seeing my friends  hanging out at the bar as they  talk about this and that.  Slate is in the quiet section of Rittenhouse Square, which I always thought was very cool and I always  enjoy spending my time here when my work for the day is done.
