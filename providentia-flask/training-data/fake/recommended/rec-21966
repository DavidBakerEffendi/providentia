Was very pleasantly surprised.  I had passed by this place probably 100 times and never figured it to be more than a dive bar.  But then a couple of friends mentioned that the food was really good and that the owner actually owned another restaurant that was supposedly very good (can't recall which one).  So it was on my radar to try for a couple of months and we finally made it last weekend. The interior was much nicer than expected given the drab/dive-ish exterior.  It's along the lines of some chains but less gaudy. The service was very friendly and attentive. For appetizers we got 2 orders of wings and I got the gumbo that was the soup of the day.  The wings were very good though maybe hotter than my wife and 10-year-old would've liked - but they enjoyed them nonetheless.  I really liked the gumbo.  Restaurants serving gumbo are rare in this area which is one of the reasons I love Jose Tejas so much.  So I was very happy about this special at Harrigan's.   For the main dishes I got a cajun chicken sandwich, my wife got a salad of some sort, my 10-year-old got a burger, my 6-year-old got chicken fingers, and my nearly 2-year-old got a hot dog (I won't comment on that since she didn't offer an opinion other than that she gobbled it up quickly). The salad was good but not great according to my wife - she regretted not getting something more substantial.  The chicken fingers seemed to be ok - they're chicken fingers so it's rare that I would rave about them. My sandwich was excellent - the chicken wasn't dry like at so many other places.  The burger seemed to be the real jewel of our orders.  It was thick and very juicy (ordered medium-well) and my son loved it. The prices seemed to be roughly in-line with my expectations so no complaints there. We will definitely be going back.
