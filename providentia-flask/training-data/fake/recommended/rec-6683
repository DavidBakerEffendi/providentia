I wasn't sure what to think when first walking into this place . Its on the small side and is well looks sort of thrown together . We sat down they opened our bottle of wine ( most restaurants in this area are byob huge plus) we ordered to start spring rolls and scallion pancakes .. The spring rolls Â where made fresh to order not pre made and the warmed up they where crispy but not greasy and the filling was simple but very tasty. The scallion pancakes where some of the best i have had they where thicker and shaped like triangles rather then like typical pancakes not over powering scallion flavor just the right amount to really make all the other veggies better. For dinner i had beef pad thai it was great the beef was cooked just right crispy and not chewy the noodles where sauced perfectly so i could taste the eggs and veggies and the chopped peanuts my wife had mas mon curry with chicken ( spelt that wrong sorry!) which she enjoyed very much and our friend had curry noodles which was also very good
