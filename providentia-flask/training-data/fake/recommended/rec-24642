So I had to roll out to Newark to meet with some clients for lunch and they chose this tapas spot right on Ferry. Win. The plethora of appetizers they bring - breads, salads, olives will fill you right up if not careful. Beware. I ordered this absurdly tasty Veal Marsala that really hit the spot. What can I say - baby cow does it for me. Everyone at the table raved on how good their dishes were from the seafood paella to a couple different pork dishes. Literally cannot tell you the next time I'll be in Newark but this place was a solid spot. Disclaimer: it is VERY Spanish - this means service is slow and drawn out. If you are not expecting to sit at the table for 45 minutes before the food comes then don't come here (or any tapas place on Ferry)
