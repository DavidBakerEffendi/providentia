I had heard from a friend that Claire's was great, amazing, etc. I eagerly tried it for myself. After two visits I still have no idea what my (now un-trusted) friend was talking about! Both times the food was flavorless and looked old, and t took forever for it to come out. The sugar cookies (which were very expensive) were so dry and bland that I threw them on the sidewalk for the birds!
