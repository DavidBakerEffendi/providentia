Parc fills a very important need in Philly -- I've been waiting for a decent place with typical French bistro food to open for years (Caribou doesn't cut it). I've experienced a few missteps here -- for example, my scallops were a little sandy once, and their lemon tart that looks like an ashtray is just foul. But in general, this is good, simple, classic bistro food that never surprises, but almost always does the job. I also think the space is absolutely beautiful and they did a great job with renovations (although it is a little bit 'Epcot' -- they tried so hard to get the authentic details right that it looks inauthentic). It's not a great deal, but it's a lovely place on a beautiful park with good food that's hard to find elsewhere in Philly.
