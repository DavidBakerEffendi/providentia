Loved the delicious  food and strong tasty drinks, the vibe is pretty cool too, sat  there for a little while and it always seemed busy! Service is the worst though our waitress didnt check on us once, and when we flaged her down to order more drinks she would drop them on the table and leave without saying a word. Just creates this unwelcoming atmosphere Overall we enjoyed our time and looking forward to come back)
