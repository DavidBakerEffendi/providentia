Best Fries Ever...hmmm, not quite, but very very good. Great dining atmosphere located in one of my favorite parts of NY. I would love to come back here and try their seafood selections. I ordered the Steak Frites which were very good even though I ordered it medium and it came out well done (this was pretty wack), but the accompanied butter sauce was perfect compliment. The Balthazaar salad was really a basic salad that had incredible earthy flavors - it hit my preference for salads that focus on organic flavors as opposed to a creamy dressing. Had a bite of their cheeseburger and it was really tasty basic cheeseburger! I would actually say it was one of the better cheeseburgers I ve had, you could taste the quality of the meet.
