The place has a great location, spacious parking and cozy feel inside. There are times when all chairs are taken and people stand everywhere, but it gives it a nice feel of celebration too, I like it. They have a great selection of beer and some good drinks too (they make them pretty strong!) I only ate there once but the food was good too. Also heard many positive reviews on it from friends, so I also recommend it to others. It might be pricey, but it shouldn't shock anyone since it's Montclair.
