My friend and I were visiting New York for a week this past July. We had Da Andrea our first night there and it was the best meal we had the entire rest of the trip. I ordered the cavatelli (homemade with shrimp, fresh salmon, and a light pesto sauce). Oh. My. God. It was delicious! And the best part, it only cost me $13! Oh, hello best deal in all of Manhattan.
