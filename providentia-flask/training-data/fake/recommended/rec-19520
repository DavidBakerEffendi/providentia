What's all this rave about chicken and rice in NYC?? I had to see what everyone was talking about. I went in zero degrees weather to wait in that ridiculously long line. It was so worth the wait. My fingers were about to fall off, but the chicken and lamb combo provided enough grease and flavor to keep me happy. I drenched the platter in the white and hot sauce (is a must!). The little pitas were really soft and delicious! Although it must have been 2,000 calorie meal, you have to try it at least once in your lifetime. Great street food.
