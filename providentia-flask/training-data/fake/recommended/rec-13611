After walking all day with my girlfriend on a Easter afternoon, we decided to come to Robataya for dinner. We got there around 7PM and was greeted by the hostess and the people who worked there....i love the welcoming greeting..made me felt like i was in Japan. We were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or in the back, since we were tired and had alot of stuff with us..we opt for the back seating area instead...but we reminded each other that, when we do come back again..we would sit in the front in the bar area..where there will be a live performance!! I love the atmosphere and the decorations of the place...the front of the store, felt like you were on a boat, while in the back, you felt like you were at a Japanese Garden...love the whole mood and the wooden scenery. We were both tired and exhausted and didnt want a heavy dinner, so we shared a Hotate soup, Kakuni, and Kamameshi with Kani and Greentea dessert. The cooking of the dishes were more on the bland side...meaning not much seasoning was added, which we loved because the chef really allowed us to taste the natural flavors of the food. I love the freshness of the hotate, and the kani kamameshi rice pot. I think if too much flavoring was added to the dish, it would take away the originality taste of the ingredients. Definitely would come back and try out the Omakase.
