I have a thing for dimly lit bars, so I love Sweet Afton. Its dark, they have good beer, and good tunes. Every time I've been there I've heard a really good mix of indie, alternative and classic rock. The food selection is good too. I've ordered Mac & Cheese, Fries and Fried Pickles. Excellent bar food for late night drunk snacking. It can get a little crowded sometimes, but I've always been able to get a good seat at a table with my friends. Definitely one of, if not the best bar in Astoria.
