A co-worker used to frequently run out here for an afternoon snack so when I was driving by the other day I decided to stop in for lunch.  Although I found the Manhattan-prefixes a little corny, I really enjoyed my sandwich.  The store was bright and clean and someone immediately offered to take my order.  I liked that they gave me option of sides.  My sandwich (roast beef with cheddar bagel) was very good.  I ordered a medium iced caramel macchiato as well.  At first sip, it was a little too sugary, but it was super tasty.
