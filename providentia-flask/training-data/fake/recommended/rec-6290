Excellent food, but absolutely TERRIBLE service (at least when we went). The waiter essentially forgot about us. He never once came to check up on us... we waited 30 minutes for him to come and offer us dessert, by which time we were so turned off by the poor service that we decided to just leave. Basically, 4-star food, 1-star service.
