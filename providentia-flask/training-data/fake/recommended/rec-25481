Fantastic food, wait staff is attentive and professional.  I have been there twice this week and bringing more friends to dinner there tomorrow.  The variety of the menu is a big plus, very diverse, something for everyone. The appetizer, Lollipops are crazy delicious and all portions regardless of what you order are generous.  Salads are huge.  I have never left there without bringing half of my order home.   Another nice thing, I thought, if you go as a family, they do not care if get something at Fuddruckers for the family member and bring it over to the Red Tavern and vice versa.  Restaurant decor is fun, very different, classy.   Good choice for everyone in the family or for date night or just a bunch of friends getting together.
