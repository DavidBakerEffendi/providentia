It was good but I didn't taste the goodness that everyone raved about.  I ordered a small brisket sandwich and small pastrami on rye w/ mustard.  The brisket was bland but take my review of brisket with a grain of salt as I am real picky about brisket and have come to prefer Texas style.  The pastrami was decent.  I just finished my leftovers from this place and still can't give it a great review. Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself and give your own valued opinion.
