I feel like I am losing faith in Yelp after seeing this place has a 4 star average review.  Im not one to often write overly negative reviews (see my history) but I must share my experience with this place.   Came here on a Wednesday night around 9 and the place was packed.  Seated quickly which I like.  After that it was downhill.  Server was aloof and disinterested.  Dinner came when we were about half way though with apps and since the tables were small it was really cramped.  Also, it's not like we were eating slowly.  The apps had been on the table maybe 5 minutes.  Also took forever to get the check.  Really just wanted to get out of there. Drinks: Dirty Martini - 95% olive juice.  I have never had a martini that dirty before Mango Mojito - undrinkable, sugary grossness.  I took two sips and couldnt stomach it anymore. Food: Papaya Salad App - Not bad, not very spicy though.  Best dish of the night. Coconut Calamari - unimaginative,  greasy Room Service Pad Thai - great idea in theory with the egg wrapped noodles, but execution is terrible.  Noodles were not tasty and the seafood within the dish tasted like it was made 3 days ago Lemongrass Mango Chicken - Overly sweet, jelly like sauce, bland green beans and overly cooked chicken which they tried to disguise using the sauce. Won't be going back.
