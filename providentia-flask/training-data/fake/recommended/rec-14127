i was fantasizing about the scrummy egg and cheese on a massive, buttery biscuit, and so i am compelled to write! alas i no longer live in the hood, and never got to try the jalapeno cornbread or friend chickin, but all those who have the opportunity to try this awesome place must!! you wont be disappointed! a really nice bartender even gave me an old man drink for free once, with rum-soaked Â dried cherries at the bottom! it was delish! she didnt even laugh when i thought the cherries were sun-dried tomatoes (it was a long day) (NOTE: on the downside...and it's minor...there can be a long-ass wait on the weekends. if you get there too late, you may not get in at all!)
