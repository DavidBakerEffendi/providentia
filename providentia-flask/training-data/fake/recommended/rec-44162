There's a couple Ethiopian places in the area now, but Lalibela is my favorite. If you don't know anything about Ethiopian food, don't worry. They're happy to explain the menu. I usually order the lamb tibs, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything. It's all perfectly flavored and delicious. BYOB.
