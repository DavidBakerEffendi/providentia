I use to enjoy this place but then realized the sandwiches were just ok. The bread is hard, dry and makes up a good portion of the sandwich. Prices also have gone up after the renovations and they changed their menu and took away some sandwiches that I use to enjoy like the garlic bomb. I do like the fries here though but again, the prices have gone up even for these. Also when I asked about the platter, the counter girl had no idea what it was even though it was on their menu. She said they weren't trained to serve the platter. I figured how hard can it be?
