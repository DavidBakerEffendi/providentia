don't go. Please, stay away, you will have to wait a millions hours to be seated. But if you are like me. Go to the bar. Sit down, get an allagash white or once of there home brews, nice small salad and order a flatbread to share with the people sitting around you. Oh, wait these people are my friends. We didn't wait for a table. We just ate, talked, and got cozy, in by far the best place in Burlington.
