I'm a bit of a health-nut at times, and the Raindrop Café definitely aids in my insanity.  They have all the nutritional info you could possibly dream of for their foods printed and readily available for your viewing pleasure.  The smoothies I've had there are delish and don't wreck my diet for the rest of the day.  A great place to stop on my bus route when I'm running errands in CC!
