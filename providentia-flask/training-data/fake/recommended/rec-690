The cheese steak was sooo delicious. Especially after I ate Genos. I went to Genos first because it was closer than Pats. When I saw the cheese steak at Genos I was pretty disappointed and then I took my first bite, and I was sooooo disappointed to the point that I didn't want to waste my money on another cheese steak. Luckily, last minute I decided that I should at least give pats a try since I probably would never have an opportunity like that again and I was so glad I did. The meat was good and had a slight sweetness that tasted perfect with the salty cheese. They also had these delicious pickled peppers that made the cheese steak even better. It was a good experience and when I go back to Philly, I know where I will get my cheese steak.
