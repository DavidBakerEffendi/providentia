seems that rattle n hum has a new food menu. i had some okay hot wings ($8 for six, quite spicy, otherwise unremarkable). i LOVED the FRIES that my bf got with his burger. the menu says that they're brined in beer & salt. they have a deep potato-y flavor and are kinda chewy (in a good way, like baked potato wedges). next time i'm def going to order those fries with some curry. i was pleasantly surprised by the improvement in their food, but i was kinda disappointed by our overly attentive waitress. she asked me for my order immediately after i sat down, and did the same thing with each new person joining our table. she'd hover at our table, glaring impatiently while we rushed to select one of their 23478923489 delicious beers. i've been here several times before and the staff has always been friendly. maybe i caught her on an off night?
