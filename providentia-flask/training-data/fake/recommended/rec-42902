Hands down my most frequented fine-dining in New York.  Any time I'm trying to impress out of towners, or just don't feel like risking a new spot, I always return to Perilla.  The menu is always inventive and delicious, and the service is attentive but never overbearing. Of particular note is how they deal with potentially bad situations - one time my friends and I were refused the tasting menu for a birthday dinner due to a reservations time crunch, but the manager sent out so many free dishes and sides to try that everyone forgot all about it and ended up raving about both the food and service.   If you can't get a reservation, try the bar - for $40 you can get a top notch meal (with booze) of chicken liver mouse, roasted hot peppers, duck-fat popcorn, and seasonal specialties like bone marrow pappardelle. And for the trillionth time, the duck meatballs are worth the trip themselves.  Perilla also has special events - the fall tasting menu with beer pairings curated by the Blind Tiger owners/chefs was one of the highlights of my 2011 eating.
