I am so unbelievably disappointed.  I waited so long to come to this place.  My husband had the spectacle too, off of their secret menu.  He liked it, but was not blown away by any means.  I had the Ricotta de Vegan and the pizza was not good.  Cashew ricotta was the only decent part.  Crush tasted like burnt puffy matza, the vegan sausage was horrible (and I usually love faux meat) and the sauce was bland.  I waited 40 minutes to be seated, another 25 for the pizza, and paid $18 for a pretty small pie. 3 stars because my husband thought his was good, not great, the place has a nice vibe and decor, and the server was friendly.   My hunt for great vegan pizza continues...
