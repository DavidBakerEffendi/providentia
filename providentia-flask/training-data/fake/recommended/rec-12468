Absolutely fantastic food! If you have a big appetite this is the place for you. Servings in my opinion are big (which is fantastic! Money's worth!) My girlfriend and I hit this place up every Monday evening. It's our weekly ritual :) I would recommend going with a few people and everyone order something different to share. I'm hooked on the chicken lollipops and the chicken and waffles. 5 stars all the way! Friendly service (in my opinion) and great relaxing vibe :)
