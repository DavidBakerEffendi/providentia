4.5 stars for this place. Thanks to all the previous Yelpers, this place didn't disappoint (for the most part). Went outside to the seating area and enjoyed the sun. Waiters and waitress are responsive. Very attentive to customers inside and outside. Wanted fried spring rolls, and the kick? Waiter: Sorry it's not available Me: Uh... what? Waiter: We don't have oil today Me: O.o'' Anyhoo, ordered the Skewered Chicken, Grilled Steak and Fried Rice, and the Mamasan (I probably mispelled this) curry. Skewered chicken was ok. Had some peanut sauce and light veggie dip. Grilled Steak and rice looked really good. Very large plate. My friend couldn't finish it. Very generous portion of rice. Mamasan Curry was smooth. Light coconut and mild. Comes with rice that should just be tossed into the sauce. It's so tasty. I ordered it with beef and it was pretty tough to chew. Overall, great place for lunch for the prices. Goodness, very affordable. NOTE: bring cash, no credit cards! Hopefully next time I can get the fried spring rolls for the extra 0.5 stars.
