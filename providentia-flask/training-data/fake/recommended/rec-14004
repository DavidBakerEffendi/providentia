Four stars????!!! What a JOKE! The lobster (ceviche?) was tasteless and weird. Everything I ate here was weird. The BLT buns tasted like McDonald's chicken sandwiches...all mayo and sauce. The wrap was filled with meat so tough that it was impossible to actually eat the wrap with your hands...it had to be sliced with some very vigorous knife work. The fried chicken was overseasoned and horrible. The glass of Barbera I drank was like warmed over Yellowtail wine. The interior is cold and lifeless. Basically, this place is totally mediocre. How can anyone think it's fantastic?
