The opening scene.  Can I have a latte with nonfat milk?  Bartender: We only have plain milk.  Okay then I would like a BloodyMary but not too spicy. Bartender: they only come spicy!  Obviously we are at Le Baricou, it is Saturday brunch and the staff do not care if we enjoy ourselves.  The place is packed.  There is a jungle drum beat pounding away on the speakers so folks are screaming at each other making the noise worse. We order Eggs Benedict and Eggs NorwEgian. As per a previous review this chef is in love with salt. I love salt but this is is almost over the top.   Eggs nicely cooked.  The hollandaise standard.  The smoked salmon grilled at the edges (strange). Home dries are nice with a garlicky slick and of course salted. Thank God the waitress poured us glasses of water halfway through the meal. Not worth there'll to Williamsberg.  And if you want a beautiful nonfat latte Verb up the street does a great job.
