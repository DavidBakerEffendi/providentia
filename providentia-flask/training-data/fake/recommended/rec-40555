Good date spot. We showed up early but were seated quickly which can be difficult in a smaller restaurant. Luckily had a table near the air conditioner in the back corner. Service was attentive without being annoying. Food was excellent and we didn't have to wait much at all between courses. All in all a good BYOB with great Italian food.
