I hate this cart. So why not give it 1 star? Because they won. They got me to stand in line for 30 minutes AND got me to take the time to write a review. That's probably worth more stars, but I can't bring myself to do it. You guys - come on. I can understand a tourist from the middle of nowhere who has never had Middle Eastern food before to be super impressed by this cart, but get real. Total urban legend. Starting now, I will begin all introductions with "have you eaten at the 53rd and 6th Halal Cart? What did you think of it?" and depending on the reaction, it will be decided if we can be friends or not.
