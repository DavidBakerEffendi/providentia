This is less of a restaurant than a neo-typical bar. It's usually packed on a nightly basis with younger people out on a casual date or enjoying happy hour after a working day at the office. I had the burger, and it was exceptional. But everything in this place screams "after hours hangout on a dirt road in the middle of New Jersey".
