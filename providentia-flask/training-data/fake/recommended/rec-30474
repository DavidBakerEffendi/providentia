I went to dinner at Kefi last night with a girlfriend and LOVED it. The decor is super cute and the service is very good, but their food is pretty outstanding.  Perfect place for a date night or girls night out. We shared a bunch of different dishes, starting with the selection of spreads (tzatziki, taramosalata, melintzanosalata, & revithia).  The spreads come with grilled pitas and are really delicious.  The tzatziki is very garlicky FYI.  Then we had the Grilled Octopus and bean salad. The octopus was cooked perfectly - not chewy at all and the bean salad was fresh and a nice texture combo with the octopus.   Next we shared the mussels and then goats milk dumplings.  The mussels are very different and really excellent.  They are made in a white wine sauce with feta cheese, tomatoes and gigante beans.  The sauce was incredible! The dumplings are soft pillows full of goat cheese in a broccoli rabb, lamb sausage and tomato ragu.  They are a bit heavy given the cheese and sausage, but really amazing. I will definitely be back to try more dishes in the future.
