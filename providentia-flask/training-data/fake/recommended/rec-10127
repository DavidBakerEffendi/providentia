Room Service is the absolute best Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen and arguably, in New York. The food is authentic, yet accessible and the restaurant itself is really trendy and fun, while still managing to be dirt cheap. Its my favorite place to bring out of towners for a cute, "New York" nightlife type of dinner, without breaking the bank. The drinks are out of this world.. the lychee sangria is divine. The tuna tartare and the golden fritters are incredible and the Room Service Pad Thai is absolutely amazing and unlike any Pad Thai you have ever had-- definitely worth ordering-- you'll never want a "regular" Pad Thai again. The only thing I find incredibly annoying about Room Service is the no reservation policy. Since this place has gotten very popular on weekends, it can often lead to long waits of 45 minutes or more.. But the food is so good.. its worth it.
