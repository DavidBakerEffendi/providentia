This place is perfect. My boyfriend is Venezuelan & often craves the traditional food his grandmother made.  That is what you can get at Arepas Cafe. Not to be missed: Arepitas!  They are small, fried arepas for an appetizer. They come with a divine cream dip called nata, a decadently thick cultured cream. Also delicious: the empanada sampler. Venezuelan arepas have a light & crispy shell, not as flaky or doughy as Dominican ones.  Best fillings are: a stringy white cheese, chicken, & baby shark (my favorite). Arepas Cafe also serves Polar, a light Venezuelan beer that pairs well with the food.   I ordered a Chica for dessert. It's a thick rice drink flavored with cinnamon.  I don't think i'll ever drink that again.  It was warm instead of ice cold & was chunky, bits of rice in it.   Keep in mind, Venezuelan food is very subtle.  You're not likely to find a very spicy dish or anything that uses lots of peppers.  The food is cooked well, ingredients compliment each other without being fussy.  Arepas Cafe is the best place i've found in NY for simple, delicious Venezuelan fare.  If i lived closer, i would probably eat there every day. The owner of this place is SO NICE! If you don't know what to get, the Arepa Pabellon is delicious and very traditional, such a wonderful melding of flavors: tomato-y shredded beef, salty white cheese, plantains bursting with sweetness & creamy avocado slices.  If you're very hungry for a lot of food, get one of the $10 platters and ask for a plain arepa for the side. Be sure to slather the table sauces on all of your food: CILANTRO CREAM SAUCE FOREVER.
