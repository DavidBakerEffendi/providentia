Food - 3.5 Service - 4 Ambience - 3 Dined solo at the bar tonight.  Received excellent service from Robert the bartender. Arrived a little before 7:30 and the bar was busy but there were still plenty of seats available at the bar. But within 20-30 minutes, the bar was packed and people were waiting for seats. The bartenders were good about keeping guests apprised of seat availability and making sure that you were taken care of while you waited. Started with the escargot appetizer ($14). Very plump and sizable, but the flavor was only so-so. Nothing was particularly memorable about it. My previous two experiences - first time in France and second time on a cruise - yielded better memories. Enjoyed the Saturday night special - beef short ribs ($32), which came with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and a few vegetables. The short ribs were incredibly tender and fell off the bone easily. The flavoring was good and the mashed potatoes were really creamy. For dessert, I couldn't decide what I wanted so I ordered two - 1) the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream and pina anglaise and ($9) 2) creme brulee ($9). I mean, I couldn't go to a French restaurant and NOT order creme brulee, now could I?! Sad to report that the creme brulee was rather disappointing. The consistency  and size for the value was good, but there was something off about the flavor. It just wasn't sweet enough, maybe? On the flip side, the pineapple upside down cake was fabulous. The warm cake was a perfect balance to the cold coconut ice cream. It was really a perfect dessert. I gobbled ever last bit of it. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed my experience at Balthazar. The food was good, but not fantastic (pineapple upside down cake aside). I would probably return here to try their steak frites (which from the reviews seems like the thing to get, but I'm a sucker for short ribs).
