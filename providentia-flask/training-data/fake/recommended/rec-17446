Way overpriced and nothing special. Who charges extra for Jasmine rice?! I've had better Thai food elsewhere. The lady at the register argued with me over the menu when it was clearly written there that a dish didn't come with noodles and then refused to charge my card for $20 saying the minimum is $25. What cheapskates...never coming back ever.
