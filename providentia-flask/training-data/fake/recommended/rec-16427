Ilili is one of my favorite places in the area. They have a great happy hour! Cocktails for $7 up until 7:30pm, along with some cheaper appetizers too in the bar area. They also have awesome food -- tapas style. Best dishes are fried cheese sticks, the saut√©ed brussel sprouts, the hummus, and the black iron shrimp. All of their drinks are amazing, especially the Phoenician lemonade (for those who like sweet effervescent drinks). Minus one star for a tiny bit of spotty service, but it is a great place, especially for a big group dinner for sharing. It's very family style tapas, so be ready for smaller dishes. Service here is on point as well, and definitely ask for suggestions for your own tastes.
