Stamna means comfort food and nice lunch or dinner to us.  One of our local faves.  Moussaka, spanikopita, eggplant, lemon potatoes.  They start you off with a lovely plate of olives and tasty toast.  Treat yourself to the grilled Octopus too.  We also like their various vegetable apps and dinners.  Reasonable prices and pleasant dining room.  BYOB.  Thinking about having them cater a casual summer party for us soon.  They have trays of our favorite meals.
