Visiting Brooklyn for two days, I waited an hour to get in because the place smelled legit from a block away. I got the tonkotsu bowl with pork cheek and ajitsuke tamago (marinated soft-boiled egg). It was so perfect, I went back and did it all again the next night. This place is the real deal and well worth the wait.
