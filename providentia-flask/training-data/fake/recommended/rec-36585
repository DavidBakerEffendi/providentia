Very disappointing, especially for a Michelin-rated restaurant. Black Label Burger was indeed juicy, but the bun was ordinary. The fries were good but nothing special. Latkes...Mediocre as hell and oversalted. Service was up to par, but I expected so much more for the reputation. There are much better places to dine at in NYC, might as well avoid this place.
