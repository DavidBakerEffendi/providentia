Best Spanish restaurant in NYC. Ambiance, Food, Hospitality, Food & Prices its all there. Make sure to go on flamenco nights, performance is amazing their selection of Spanish beers and food is right on the spot. I could go on writing about how good the place it is but you should go and experience it yourself!
