Love this place. The food is consistently good. I go between lamb gyro and kofte kebab and I love both. The meat is always cooked just right and full of flavor. I also like the fact that some of the side dishes rotate daily, so I get to try new things if I'm feeling adventurous. As I said, everything I tried here is generally good. The service, however, blows. The cashier girls at the register are just rude and unpleasant. I sometimes ask myself why I spend so much money at this place, when there isn't really a slightest indication that they want my business. Also, if you ask for any kind of modification to your sandwich, it causes obscene amounts of confusion. Five stars for food. 1.5 stars for service.
