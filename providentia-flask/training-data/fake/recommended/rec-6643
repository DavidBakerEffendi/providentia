I really wanted to love this place...and i did love the story and the atmosphere.  Howeverrrrrr..... I really really didn't like the food.  Really didn't.  We decided to sample a few things off the menu that jumped out at us:  Bacon peanut brittle?  Yes please, in theory.  It was more like candied peanuts and maybe 3 microscopic pieces of bacon that added no taste or smokiness to the dish.  Next up was the pretzel with kentucky beer cheese dip.  The pretzels themselves were delicious and fluffy, but the dipping sauce was congealed and impenetrable. It seemed like they put it in the dish and left it in the refrigerator for a day or two.  The biggest disappointment was the fried chicken.  It was bland with a rather unpleasant crust.  It gave me the world's biggest sad face, though maybe I have too high expectations because i just had Momofuku fried chicken a few weeks ago. Anyway, with all of the Frank Bruni hype and all of new york trying this place (the wait was 2 hours for non bar seats), it wasn't worth the time.
