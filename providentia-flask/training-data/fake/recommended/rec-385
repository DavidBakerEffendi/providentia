Love this place. Tapas in the city can get very expensive very quickly but this is not one of them. Some of the best tasting tapas items I've ever had, not to mention their Sangria is off the charts. It's on the smaller side so on a Friday or Saturday night there can be a bit of a wait, but hey it's Manhattan what do you expect. Come during the week and you'll probably be seated immediately. And enjoy.
