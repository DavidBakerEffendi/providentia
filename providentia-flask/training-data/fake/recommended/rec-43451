I came here a couple times for lunch and was pretty disappointed unless I was sitting at the bar.  The wait staff was basically non-existent so I would say if you want good service to sit at the bar.   I only came here once after hours and it was your typically college crowd but it seemed a bit "stuffy" for my tastes, so I typically ended up at the Ivy.
