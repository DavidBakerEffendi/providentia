Our favorite meal during our NYC trip.  Thanks, Yelpers!  This was a great recommendation.   The Cuban beef stew and the fried fish filled us up twice: first for lunch, and then for breakfast the next day.  It was so good that when we couldn't get into the Met because of the leftovers (who knew food couldn't be added to coat-check items?) we opted to make the hour trip back and forth to our apartment rather than throw it all away.  Simply excellent food. Too bad they were so coy about the ingredients in that tasty green jalapeño sauce.
