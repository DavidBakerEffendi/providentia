I've had a thing for Kefi for a while, and was thrilled to finally go back after 3+ years.  We grabbed a table around 9:30 on a Friday night (no wait) near the bar in the front of the restaurant.  Does anyone else agree that Kefi uses that space really awkwardly?  Anyway, our server was great (brought me a free glass of wine after I ordered their pine-y Greek wine option, fully knowing that I may not like it, which I definitely did not), and the small plates were just as delicious as I remembered: kefi salad, grilled octopus (this is a game changer), mussels & giant beans, sheep's milk dumplings.  The food is fairly heavy, more so than other Greek places I've been to, but it's innovative and very, very delicious.
