Nice place, good food, but not the best. I had fish tacos, however, I have had better fish tacos at beach shacks in cali, and florida. The gucamole was very good. They have wonderful drinks. My favorite is the blood orange margarita, yummy. This place is always packed. Make sure to book in advance.
