I have eaten here a few times and I think it worth a review. I have had the seafood corn chowder, and I think they do a very good job. Nice amount of seafood and a nice cream flavor sweetened by the corn. The salads are fresh and the tomatoes do not have that hydro taste, actually they taste like a tomato. The salmon burger is fantastic, a good choice when feeling indecisive. I have had it several times and the best was when it was served on the bread that is from Mazzola bakery(that's what they said) and not the sesame bun. The last thing that I have had is the skate special in a lemon butter sauce. I would say that it was nicely prepared and the skate was not overpowered by the sauce, not sure if it warranted the 25$ MP that they seem to use as the blanket whole fish price since it's skate(inexpensive bottom feeding fish) !!!!
