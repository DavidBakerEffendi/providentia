nook is definitely small and therefore, can be a wait if you go at the wrong time. i think the food is good, esp. if you live in the neighborhood and want a quick fix, but i don't think its worth a special trip to hell's kitchen. the wait staff wasn't particularly friendly and tend to freak out if you stand in the doorway to even tell them you what your table size is (due to its small size) .. but what else are you going to do? agree that the rosemary fries are very good, but not worth a special trip to hell's kitchen.
