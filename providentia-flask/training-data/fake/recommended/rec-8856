Tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago.... definitely heading back here again. The service was great, staff were polite and the food tasted fantastic. I got food to go. I ordered two mixed falafel boxes, chips and a strawberry and basil smoothie. The falafel boxes were $12 each, but I thought they were quite good value and the chips were very tasting with the pesto and aoili dressing they came with. The smoothie was an interesting flavour and good consistency, I don't think will have that flavour again (the basil was a bit too strong for my liking), but will definitely try another flavour.
