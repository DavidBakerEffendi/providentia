What a disappointment.  I bought 3 dinner rolls today and the olive roll was hard as a rock.  I couldn't believe they sold it to me - an olive roll, worth $.70.  When I got home and discovered hard rock roll, I called the store.  The person checked the other rolls and agreed they were also hard!  Their response:  That is how we got them from the bakery this morning.  The person made no effort in dealing with me, nothing about an exchange, or a refund.  What poor service. So if the bakery sends them crap in the morning, they just turn around and sell it?   Thank God we have the Metropolitan Bakery in this area.  They get no stars from me.
