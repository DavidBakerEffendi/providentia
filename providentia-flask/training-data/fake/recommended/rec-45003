It's restaurant week again in NYC. Maialino has a perfect menu of choices. Appetizers of artichokes with a creamy anchovy sauce: subtle & delightful. Melt-in-your-mouth ravioli finished in a bright, slightly salty drizzling of brown butter. Sage custard for dessert. Fresh, foresty, and so cooling. As always from a Danny Meyer restaurant: excellent food, attentive service, and a modern spin on traditional decor. Go here now. You won't be disappointed.
