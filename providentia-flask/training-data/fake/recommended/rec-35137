The Farm was greattt!!! Friendly service and very good food! We got here at the perfect time at 5:30pm and were the first ones to be seated. Dinner tonight made my day. The bread and olive oil was amazing. My friend and I had to ask for seconds. My burger and fries were perfect. The meat was juicy and thick. It was good on an english muffin. The fries were nicely seasoned. I do recommend the Butternut Squash Ravioli too. We didn't have room for dessert but I'm glad we decided to try it for dinner. Thanks for a great experience.
