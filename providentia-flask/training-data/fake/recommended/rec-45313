Went for brunch 5/10. It was pretty busy. Service was lacking. Hostess was quite flippant about our need for a hi-chair: "Like I said, it's right back there and your server will be right with you to get it for you." Wrong answer, Missy. Awful customer service. Just get the hi-chair and make your customer happy. Also, 20 minutes for a hot chocolate with no apologies. Food was bland (eggplant sandwich and roasted asparagus with poached egg) and it took about 30 minutes for it to arrive. This place used to be a go-to for weekend brunch. Never again.
