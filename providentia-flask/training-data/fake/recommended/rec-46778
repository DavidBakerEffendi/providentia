This place is fantastic. The food was great (I had the second meal option; I admit, I wasn't really too sure what it all was, but I loved it), the pu'er tea was great, the ambiance and noise level were perfect--not too loud at all, even though this place does get crowded later at night (around 9 or so). OK, it's a bit pricey, I guess, but it's fucking New York City and I've overpaid for plenty of things I hated, so I don't mind paying for an experience that's this nice. I live nearby and certainly will be coming back. I'm just mad that I haven't been coming here frequently already!
