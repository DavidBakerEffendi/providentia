I've been looking for a casual place nearby (2 stops on the train or fewer) that had some legit food and some solid, affordable drinks.  Somewhere that is unpretentious and maybe there is a TV I can watch the Ranger/Yankee/Giants/Knicks game. Somewhere that has a great craft beer list and what do you know I stumbled upon this gem on Wednesday night.   Beers were fantastic, bartenders seemed like they couldn't be bothered but I know from experience they were just busy.  We had the BLT, the Kale salad and 6 sirracha-honey wings with buttermild dressing.  Everything was great.  Service was quick and seamless.  I thought the line to order food was real long then after 5 minutes I realized it was just people standing there...no one was on line and I walked up and ordered right away.   The Rangers game was on and the bar was packed.  Luckily my girlfriend and I got a perfect set of seats right in view of the game.  What was so great about this place was the other guests.  We made friends with the couple sitting right next to us, and in front of us.  People saying, excuse me? Thank you? Unbelievable!  Of course the tallest man in North America happened to be standing right in front of the TV. We asked him to move and he was friendly about it. After working in restaurants for my entire life it was a nice change to not have a waiter come by to the table, check on us, clear the tables etc.  Get in, order your drinks, order your food from the window, they bring it, eat and drink.  I'd much rather come here than Manhattan where I can't go to a pub get a couple drinks and two burgers for less than $100. Overall I love the concept, food, and decor.  Great spot and I will be back.
