As a Texan, I am naturally inclined to be a BBQ snob, but this place is a solid 4 stars! I am constantly on the search for great brisket, and this place has some of the best in the city! The burnt end baked beans and sweet potatoes are delish too. They definitely put an NYC spin on barbecue, so it's a little strange to me to see stuff served with dainty little pickles, but it works if that's what you're expecting. The meat was a little over salted for my taste and the person at the butcher block cutting the portions was not particularly friendly, but everything else about this place is pretty great. The smell alone is enough to draw you in from the sidewalk!
