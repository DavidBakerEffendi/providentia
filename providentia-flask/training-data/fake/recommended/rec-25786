Chose this restaurant because of the reviews and was not disappointed.  My wife and I had the caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, lobster canneloni and chicken parmegiana for entrees.  Ingredients were obviously fresh and prices were very moderate.  I am very particular about chicken parm and it was one of the best I've had.   The table next to us had the meatball entree which looked amazing.  I will definitely get that next time. Definitely get a reservation.  The only negative (which accounts for the 1 star deduction) is that it is very small and a bit cramped with seating.
