The food was awesome. I still don't love Hipster service, Â but the food far overshadowed the service. The chef was cooking with a young man who introduced himself to us as Ben. They were having fun and it showed in the food. Great flavors, great prices, and the Crispy Pata was off the charts great. This is truly a don't miss kinda place!! Yum!
