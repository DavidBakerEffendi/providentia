Waiting time: none. There were customers here and there but for the time we went at 6:30 pm there were no lines. Staff: Quick and friendly service :) very helpful. Couldn't ask for more from them Food: fresh. Just enough choices to choose from and easy to pick. Customization to suit anyone. Stone pot makes it very warm! If dining in, also get complimentary miso soup and staff assembles napkin with utensils. Price: I expected slightly less since it seems like a fast eating place. Regular bibimbap was $8.95, with the stone bowl it's +$1. Environment: cafe like, casual, between take out and dine in. Seats along the wall and three tables for party of 4. We had 6 people and so we combined two tables together since not many customers were there. Definitely not restaurant sit down quality if you're taking someone for formal dinner! Would definitely go again for the food! I know exactly what I'm expecting and bibimbap all the way! I am a hard critic with high standards so 4/5 is very good!
