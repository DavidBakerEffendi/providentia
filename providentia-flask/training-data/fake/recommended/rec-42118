So I call this area of Chapel St. "Little Thai" because there are several Thai restaurants right next to each other.  I've been coming here for years and this place is my favorite in New Haven.  Thai Taste has an intimate atmosphere and great food at a reasonable price.  Most of the servers are friendly and efficient.  There are a few that are all business and no fun but being a server myself, I know how hard it is to have your head in the game every single hour of every day.   Don't mistake the older glasses and silverware as dirty, they're just worn.  The only real complaint I have with this place is the booths which are worn out and uncomfortable.  If they sunk money into buying new ones or fixing them up it might jack up the menu prices.  They also make a mean long island at a great price.   I'm being really nitty to not give this place five stars, it's close... Oh and of course as far as the food goes, the curries are fantastic, the pad thai is to die for, and all of the appetizers are fantastic.  Anything that is fried is done right, never greasy, just crisp and hot.  The sampler appetizer is great, the fresh rolls are just that-- fresh (yum!)..and I can't remember the name of it but the puffs with the curry mashed potatoes inside are sweet and addictive and somehow twice as good when eaten cold for a late night snack.     If you're still reading, Ayuthai is the only place in Connecticut that I think truly competes with Thai Taste.  The service at Ayuthai in Guilford is always spot on.  The curries are delicious and cleanliness is clearly important to them.  All new sparkling white dishes, silverware and white napkins help boost presentation.  I don't know about you but I'm going to get some Thai food!
