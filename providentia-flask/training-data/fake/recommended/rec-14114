I just came back from dinner there tonight... it was my first time!  We arrived just before 8pm and it was packed.  We were told the wait time would be 1 hour and 20 minutes, but we were seated at 8:45pm.  The decor is really nice.... its kind of loud, but its a really unique/cute spot.  We were seated in this really cool booth, which faced the open kitchen.  But, it looked like there were other long tables that were shared by multiple parties, so I think that if you wanted a spot with some privacy, request the booth!   We ordered the pork buns as an appetizer and they were really good.  I've never had pork buns like these- they were assembled sandwich style, had mayo, and good spicy kick!  We each ordered ramen, which was beautifully presented.  But, I think that of the three types of ramen we had, all three soups were a little on the salty side.  This is unfortunate because I would be more inclined to go there more often if I didn't feel like I would get high blood pressure or something... Overall, it was decent place- nice ambiance and decent food, but I'll try other places before I go back.
