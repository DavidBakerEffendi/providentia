Kefi very much embodies the setting of a Greek family, if the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding can be believed. Two full floors of buzzing tables replicates the feel of a full family but is quiet enough to not make you feel like it's assaulting your ears. The Selection of Spreads is a vegetarian nirvana good enough to make me forget meat. The Tzatziki was one of the best tzatzikis I've had, and the Taramosalata, Melintzanosalata, and Revithia are like nothing I've ever had. I've only had the pastas here, but if they're this good, why bother trying anything else? (Or maybe I should try one of everything?) The Sheep's Milk Dumplings were a soft contrast to the rich lamb sausage, the Tubular Pasta was the flavor of the Mediterranean, and the Flat Pasta had so much pulled braised rabbit I think it multiplied like bunnies. I've been to plenty of good restaurants in New York, and I've been to even more good Greek restaurants anywhere else, but Kefi is the first to actually make me want to be Greek!
