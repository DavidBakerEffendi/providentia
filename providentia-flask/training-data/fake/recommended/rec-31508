Was recently back in Philly visiting the in-laws and determined to find an alternative to Marra's (which I adore by the way). How great was it to be squeezed in last minute Â for a table of 4 on a Saturday evening? Pretty friggin awesome actually. I loved L'Angelo from the sec we walked in and past the kitchen. Our entrees were stellar, the service was attentive and appropriate to a joint in the hood and the prices were so fair. BUT...the appetizers were a bit overpriced and stingy when being shared by 4 peeps. A slight reduction in price or a slight increase in portion would not kill them. The shrimp in the grilled asparagus/prosciutto/shrimp appetizer was pretty tough and the portion was far too meager but very very tasty nonetheless. The moral of the story is: get an easier to find and read on-line menu; tweak the prices and portions of the appetizers and I will love you all forever. A great place in a great hood in a great city.
