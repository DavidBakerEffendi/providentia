I don't know what possessed me to follow up vegan cupcakes with chicken tacos, but the service was great and the tacos were incredible. It was pretty busy when I went, but I was still lucky enough to get some directions out of them. I would've gone back if I didn't have to hightail it back to the bus. I ended up scarfing them all down within five minutes of taking my seat.
