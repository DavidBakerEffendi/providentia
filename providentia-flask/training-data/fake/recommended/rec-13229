I liked this enormous burger, but I'm not a huge fan of the place's ambiance. I came here on a Friday night and waited about 20 minutes to eat at 8 pm. The wait staff seemed rather stressed and didn't really check on us or even look at us much while seating us down or taking our orders. The tables around us all got their food before we did for some reason. I was starving by the time my cheeseburger and fries landed on the table, but I couldn't figure out how to eat it for a good long minute! The burger...is...HUGE. I appreciate the extra large patties but honestly I'd rather pay a dollar less and get 3/4 the amount of meat. Because the enormous patty + all the toppings made it impossible to eat, I ended up shoving as much of the burger into my mouth as quickly as possibly to eat it all before it fell apart. I succeeded but also managed to get condiments everywhere including the table, the floor, and I'm pretty sure some landed on my skirt. I was nearly breathless by the end from constantly eating, not enough breathing. The fries were okay - very standard. Our table was incredibly wobbly (which did not help the messy eating). The burger was good, but I still love shake shack and in n out more, which are both way cheaper and more delicious.
