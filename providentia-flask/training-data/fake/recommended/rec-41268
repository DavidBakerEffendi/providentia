Their kale salad never disappoints. Just do it. Excellent place for vegetarians. Always one vegetarian ramen (with or without egg) which is to die for. I never leave a millimeter of broth. I love that they change which veggies are in the veggie ramen based on what's currently in season. The wait can be a little long, so put your name in and check out any of the bars in the neighborhood while you wait. On a side note, the people who work there are always delightful and helpful.
