I frequent this place so much, I'm calling myself Empanada Papa. I've tried almost all their empanadas and it's like a mouthgasm every time. Their tutti frutti is also delicious that one time, after speaking so highly of this place, I came in with a friend just for drinks (after being so full from a previous dinner, but still not wanting to pass up the opportunity of coming here) and the waiter seemed annoyed that we weren't getting food. I can understand the feeling, being a waiter myself, but to automatically add the tip just for two rounds is a low blow to me. It's kinda like "hey, these two kids aren't even getting food, they're probably either cheap or have no money, so let me put the tip just to be safe." Not cool. I usually tip even for bad service so that hurt me, admittedly, a little more than it should have.
