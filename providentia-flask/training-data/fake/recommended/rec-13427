Stumbled upon this place after not knowing what the heck was opened in the Financial District on a Sunday and seeing a strip of restaurants lined up on a street with cobblestones and outdoor benches with umbrellas.  We ordered the old fashioned pizza with basil and garlic and it was DELICIOUS.  It was also the perfect portion for 3... for 2 it would've been a bit much.  The pizza was very flavorful and the crust was a bit flaky like a croissant. I would definitely eat here monthly if I were a resident!
