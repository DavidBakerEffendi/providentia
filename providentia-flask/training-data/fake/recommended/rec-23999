Oh, how I dig a family style BBQ joint that serves up tasty jams. I got to hear Nirvana, the Supremes Â Run DMC, Sly and the Family Stone, and to top it off, a little MJ. I was hooked. The food took 5 mins to come out, just long enough for me to text a friend, and damn was it good. Lean Brisk, Mac & Greens Memphis style dry rub Ribs and Green bean casserole.
