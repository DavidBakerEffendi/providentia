So disappointed!!! I have been to Bella's many times for brunch over the years. While on the weekends I expect to have to wait for a table, and that the service may be slow, I always left happy after enjoying a delicious meal. That was not the case when I met a few friends for lunch at Bella's yesterday. We arrived promptly at 12noon and were seated-waHoo. We received menus, and ordered our lunch choices by 12:10. We ordered 2 black bean burgers and a Mediterranean salad between the 3 of us. At 12:35 the waitress came to our table and informed us that they were out of the black bean burger. Since I am pretty easy going I shrugged and said "ok, everything happens for a reason so I will have the Mediterranean salad with no chicken." My friend ordered the turkey burger. We then waited. And waited. And waited. At 12:55 I asked the waitress what was taking so long. Her response, "well those people over there have been waiting since 12n, and they haven't gotten their food, so yours will not be ready for awhile!" WHAT?!?! Our 2 salads and turkey burger should be taking over 30 minutes to prepare?!?! We informed the waitress that we needed to leave soon, as our kids needed to be picked up at school. She shrugged and walked away. The restaurant by that point was only 1/2 full, so we expected to get our food in a timely fashion, but we were wrong. Our food arrived 20 minutes later. Two small salads and the turkey burger. No apology but instead the waitress put down our check and said I will take this when you are ready. I had convinced my friends that we should choose Bella's cafe since we were celebrating my birthday, they hesitantly agreed. I guess they knew something about this restaurant that I had yet to comprehend. We all left very disappointed in our lunch. The food was OK, and very overpriced. The wait was ridiculous and the service was rude! I will not be back.
