I was intrigued after seeing this place while going to Sweet Frog down the street - After reading the reviews, I thought it showed all the characteristics of a diamond in the rough - After actually eating here the best I can say is Meh, For the price there is much better around and in terms of Ingredients... I'm not sure what happened to my order but if everything is fresh it should taste a lot better than it did. Honestly has a very interesting menu but the two times I've been there (for dinner) the food has been bland - I've left twice now hungry and regretting my decision. The portions are relatively small for the prices you are paying, to me this place was just disappointing. The first time I ate at SGB I had the salmon fishsticks and a pork sandwich of sorts, The salmon sticks were very dry, they were served with a sweet chilli sauce that tasted like it came out of a bottle. The pork sandwich was incredibly soggy (normally I'm not one to complain about juicy goodness but the bread was falling apart and tasted only of salt and oil) The second time eating at SGB I believe I tried the Philly Cheese steak - I'm normally a fan of ANY Philly cheese steak but this one was just..... no..... I can't remember what I had as an appetizer but Â I do remember that I didn't want it after tasting and I passed it off to friends. This time I tried the Pomegranate lemonade? Tasted like it was strait from the carton. After my second trip to SGB I admit I've given up on SGB, It just isn't for me - Too much for what you get and what I got wasn't good. Nothing terrible about the service although the first time I went for dinner they were empty and our waiter seemed to forget about us for a while - It really shouldn't be that hard to wait on people when there are only 2 in the establishment, Just saying.
