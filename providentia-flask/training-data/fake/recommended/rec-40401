great place, you can almost miss it, if you walk to the "other" side of their business, which is connected to the restaurant. nice atmosphere, and decor, and tapas are excellent. I went with my special someone, off hours, before the late night  "dance-lounge" transformation, and it was perfect. Not crowded or noisy at all, good time to go is before 8 pm if you want a quieter dining experience and more cozy feel. We didnt even eat the main courses, just came in for tapas and they were a hit! Good portions and very reasonable prices. Food presentation and garnish was done well. Service was friendly, except for a hickup, when i was told "are you sure" if i wanted some sugar in my mojito. nothing major though :)   oh and not to mention the 4 dollar mojitos, until 7 pm. after that they double in pri$e..   The apple and cheese tapas.. recommended. til next time ciao yelpers!
