I had a great dining experience here.  The service was very attentive - water constantly refilled, the waiter kept a close eye but didn't hover, and friendly. I ordered the chicken noodle bowl with a crispy egg roll and it was delicious.  Crunchy cabbage texture, noodles cooked just to my liking, chicken was grilled and just a bit smoky, other flavors were bright and well balanced.  I also ordered the lemongrass martini and liked it.  The prices were very reasonable and the whole thing including tip cost me under $30. I also liked the ambiance of the restaurant with flattering lighting and warm colors although the tables are a little tight.  I went early so it wasn't very crowded and it was a good meal near the convention center.
