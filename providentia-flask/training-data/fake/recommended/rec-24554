This place was one of the best Spanish restaurants I have ever eaten at, since we are short of Spanish in Sydney. Â Heaven for vegetarians as I had quite a few choices, when most places are quite limited. My favs were the crispy artichokes small plate and the veggie rice dish which were to die for, as I've never had something like this! Love this place will defo comeback when I visit again.
