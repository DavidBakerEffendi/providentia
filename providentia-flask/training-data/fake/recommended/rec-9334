This place was pretty decent and the price was right.  We went in and were able to be seated right away.  The place was not the cleanest joint around, but it was not to bad for a 24 hour place.   I had a cuban and a chicken empanada, the cuban was amazing and the sauces were pretty good that they come with.  The chicken was a little dry but overall ok.  They brought us food twice that was not ours, it was meant for another table, this also happened to the table next to us.  All in all it was a cheap snack and wasn't bad.   If you only want to spend a few dollars on a snack in NYC, this is a good place.
