I think this is a great place for the food and ambiance. The food is interesting, fresh and does not disappoint - the restaurant is small but great for a date or just to catchup with friends (or one friend according to crowded seating). The sangria is always good. My only problem with this place is that - everytime I have been here it is always packed (which is fine) but the hostess (and I've been when there have been a couple different ones) have been a little abrupt/rude. But as a true foodie, that's the sort of thing that doesn't stop be from going back... because if they get me riled up I just go next door to the japanese restaurant for some Saki till I'm ready for my chorizo...
