I work in the Market East section of the city, so when a "Mexican" craving comes-on, I either end up here or the 12th Street Cantina in the Reading Terminal. Similar to Qdoba, they give you the assembly line overstuffed burrito. Basically a premature food baby wrapped in a tortilla. I go for the grilled veggie burrito. The burrito comes with grilled peppers and onions, cheese, lettuce, rice, choice of pinto and black beans, choice of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Feel free to customize as you wish. Their ingredients look and taste fresh and fill you up for the rest of the day. It's nice to have this place in such a convenient location. When the weather permits - take it over to Washington Square Park for some people watching.
