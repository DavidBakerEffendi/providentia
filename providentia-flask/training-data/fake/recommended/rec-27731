There is nothing bad to say about this place. From the service to the food to the decor. The food is absolutely the best ever. My boyfriend and I went to try it because we had heard such great reviews. Our experience far exceeded what we thought it would be like. Everyone who works there is friendly and professional and made sure we were completely taken care of. We haven't been back YET only because we are waiting for an opportunity to celebrate something. Although the restaurant itself is cause for celebration :)
