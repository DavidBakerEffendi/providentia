Only one night in New York, looking for Exactly the Right Table for Two, and chose this place on the recommendation of a friend who's a Manhattan native.  A great choice. Decor: very dim lighting, huge windows (all the exterior walls are windows) overlooking Carmine Street.  Wooden tables with no linens.  Small bowls of crude salt on each table.  Relatively close together, but not in a creepy eavesdropping-is-inevitable way.  Hey, New York is crowded.  Most of the decorations are wine bottles ready to be uncorked. Appetizer: Finally!  A beet salad that justifies my love of beets!!!  It was phenomenal.  With little grilled goat-cheese balls. I was tempted to try the pork porterhouse based on a review below, but I have bone-phobia, so went with the steak, which was very good.  On something I thought was mashed potatoes but turned out to be cheese.  The most delightfully flavorful, peppery broccoli I've ever had. Dessert: polka dot cheesecake, very creamy.  Yum.  And a chocolate pot-de-creme that was phenomenal.   Very friendly service.  Didn't mind a bit that we didn't order wine (although they have a very good selection).  Also didn't mind that I had no clue what pot-de-creme is. This was very expensive, but worth it for a special night out, which was exactly what I needed, and what I got.
