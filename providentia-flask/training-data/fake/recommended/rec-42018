I feel like I'm writing too many "5 star" reviews. Whatever. This is my second attempt at trying this place after Sunday yoga and run with my buddy. First time the wait was unacceptably long. This time table for two was manageable. The food establishment is next door to several others, and I gather because of the close location next to McCarren Park, business remains strong with the hipsters vying to sit in. It was a gorgeous sunny June day, and we sat outside under the shade. The brunch menus actually isn't labelled as such; one has to choose between "breakfast" and "lunch" options, yet both categories have a brunchy feel. Altho nervous doing so, I chose the arctic char deconstructed dish which was like salmon lox with capers and dee-licious toasted quartered buns and flavored cream cheese and chopped red onion. I enjoyed making a mini-mess of my fingers in putting together the tastiest of healthy dishes!! And because it was a very warm and bright nearly summer day, the "Six Point Crisp" was perfect accompaniment... I had two drafts!! My bud Wayne had a lamb sandwich type plate for which he said was among the best he's had. This is coming from a man who spent a few years in Culinary Institute of America (changed career before completion to pursue other things).
