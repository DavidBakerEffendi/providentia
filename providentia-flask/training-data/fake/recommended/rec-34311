I've been coming here for years- best Thai place ever! It's on Bloomfield ave next to cloverleaf- there's parking in back or on street. Careful- they will give tickets. Place is very small and does not take reservations. The service takes forever so just plan on that...but it's worth it. It's small owned mom n pop place so support them and respect that they can't afford many waitresses. Wings are delicious. I always get masammum beef and they have chicken available too. It's byob so stop at liquor store down the street. Love this place- support it.
