We absolutely loved this hidden gem. Very unique dining experience. Staff was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly. The decor is delightful and the garden out back is nothing short of amazing. The food was delicious, creative and unlike anything we've tried before. Perfect place for an anniversary, birthday or romantic evening out.
