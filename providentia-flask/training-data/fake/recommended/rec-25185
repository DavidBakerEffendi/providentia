I would say 3.5 stars.  I used to love this place, but now I'm wondering if it's just too pricey.   Had dinner here last night, but hadn't been in here in a year.  The food is fairly tasty, but some of the servings are so tiny.  Me and one other racked up a $99 bill with not a ton of food and only two beers.  The $20 steak was about 5 tiny slivers of meat.  I don't get sticker shock very often, but do consider whether or not the meal is good value considering all components of the dining experience.
