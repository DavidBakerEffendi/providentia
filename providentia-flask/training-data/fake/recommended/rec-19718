I really truly honestly love this place and the food! Omg, the food!  I really love the Mac and Chicharron.  The breakfast food is amazing too.  Only issue I've had is being served by Sandro.  Don't get served by this guy!  Ask for someone else!  It was 4 of us sitting for dinner, and we all placed our separate orders: 2 starters, 1 soup, 1 snack, 4 entrées.  He comes back, after quite some time, with 1 starter, 1 soup, and 1 snack.  Where's the other starter!? So we ask, and he said that we didn't specify if we wanted him to bring the other starter before the food.  I'm sorry, what?  It's called a starter.....we thought it was obvious.  He continued to argue with us, but none of us specified about our starters, snacks, and soups coming before our entrées, so what was he even arguing about?  To top it off, the restaurant has this ridiculous policy of adding gratuity to the bill after 10pm.  So, we were forced to leave him an amazing tip for terrible service.  Needless to say, it wasn't cool.
