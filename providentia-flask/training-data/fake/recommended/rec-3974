I love these guys. I don't mind the line outside, even in winter, because it makes the meal all the better cause you worked for it. Everyone is friendly and they bring you food to snack on while you're waiting. I got lemon chicken once!! 2 eggs fries and toast is great. The omelettes and burgers are good too. The coffee is hot, the kindly old lady manning the register is darling, and I want to eat there everyday and Sunday (which is impossible because that's the day that Gus tends to his garden and sings in his choir, according to the wall).
