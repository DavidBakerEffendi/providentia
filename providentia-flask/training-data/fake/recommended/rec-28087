After reading the reviews, I was excited to order some food here. That will never happen. I called to order a "To Go" order and was told they were too busy. I would have to dine in. Did they stop to think that maybe I too am busy? There is a reason I was ordering pick up. I am working from home and have no time to get dressed up to go out and eat a burger. Apparently my time is not as valuable as theirs. They are close to my house and the food sounds great, but they will never have my business. What a shame. I have to give at least one star to leave a review, and they don't deserve it.
