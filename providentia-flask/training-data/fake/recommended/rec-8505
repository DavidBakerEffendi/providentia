So great! The whole place was exactly as we pictured it-- total dive, cheap beers, delicious food! No forks are given with the plate, which I'm assuming is to enhance the cultural connection/experience; however, the bf made a mess of himself so we broke down and asked for the utensils. The #1 was my favorite. Could eat the lentils for days. Would absolutely come back!!
