The only bad thing that happened on my Shabu-Tatsu night was the 45 minute wait on a Sunday night. But after we sat down, it was smooth sailing. The restaurant is small, cozy and clean, and the service was great. We started with some appetizers of gyoza and pitchers of beer. We dove in to the seafood bbq and the prime eye beef. Ohh, the prime eye beef, how I love you. At the very end, we started slowing down and the sweet broth condensed over the fire and it became sticky sweet. But adding a little water would've solved it. After dinner, we had red bean and green tea ice cream. The great tea was strong, but not sweet or creamy enough to balance the matcha, but the red bean was pretty good. I'd go back there in a heartbeat.
