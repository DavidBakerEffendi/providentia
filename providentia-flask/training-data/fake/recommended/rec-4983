In all my travels i have not had a more tasty sandwich.   Pastrami is awesome.  Get it on rye to maximize the potential.  The pastrami is just saturated in flavor.  There is not a dull bite.  Went perfectly with the soft bread. I also tried the brisket which compared to the pastrami was okay.  On its own, the meat was tender and plentiful, but after tasting the pastrami, it left me hoping for something more. It was tough getting to this place by subway - it is closet to the A and C lines, as well as the LIRR.   The price was good - $6 for a "small" sandwich which was enough for me.  $9 for a medium.  $15 for a combo sandwich. There isn't much seating - just a couple tables in the back, but we went when it wasn't that busy and found a place to sit. If i'm in the area i'll definitely come back and try the corned beef.
