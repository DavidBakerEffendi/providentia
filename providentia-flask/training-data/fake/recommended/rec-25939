Freshness abounds in this storefront restaurant. Cool decor, quick attentive service and terrific food the rewards for visiting. Love their noodle dishes and their mango w sticky rice is as good as it comes. No liquor license so bring a flavorful beer that can duke it out with the flavorful food. --Thomas JerseyWeddingPhotographyâ€¦
