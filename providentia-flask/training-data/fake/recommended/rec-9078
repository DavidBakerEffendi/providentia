Good food and this place gets packed so it's best to have a reservation.  While I loved the food, i thought it was a bit overpriced. Appetizers: beet salad with goat's cheese, horseradish crème, soft herbs, hazlenuts.  I'm not big on beets so not a fan but everyone else liked it. fried east coast oysters with savoy cabbage slaw, cayenne-tomato butter.  I really liked the oysters. crispy and flavorful. warm octopus salad with fingerlings, chorizo, frisée, olive purée.  Super good.  the fingerlings were yum and so was octopus. Entrees: pan roasted chicken sweet potato salad, bok choy, hazlenuts.   Chicken was juicy like everyone said.  But not amazing.  I like the sweet potato salad though. For sides: Didn't like the broccoli rabe too much. But I really liked the brussel sprouts!!
