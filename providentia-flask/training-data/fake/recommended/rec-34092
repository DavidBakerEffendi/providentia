This place is great. I'm new to the area, but this may be the best Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to. The atmosphere was great, the margaritas were fantastic (especially for the happy hour price) and the meals were delicious. I picked a random item from the menu and got chicken tostadas, would recommend 100%. Everything about this place screams authentic. A can't miss if you're in New Haven.
