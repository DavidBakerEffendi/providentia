Cheesesteaks are alright but meat is not as juicy as Geno's. Went to both and the workers at Pat's are rude and nasty. When I went to Geno's across the street they knew how to talk to customers. Customer service is very important along with the quality of food. I'm sure with as many sales they make a day they don't care what I think but I will not go back.
