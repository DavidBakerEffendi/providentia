I almost wish I'd have paid twice as much for my cheese slices, so I wouldn't have eaten them as quickly. They were oily and salty, to be sure - but those two factors seemed to work in their favor, in a way that they never would in something like a Neapolitan pizza. Definitely the best pizza by the slice I've ever had.
