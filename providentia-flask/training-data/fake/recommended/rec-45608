My boyfriend and I have been together for both years today. We have celebrated both times at El Vez! The waitresses were so nice and helpful with picking out the meals. This year we had a waitress named Betty who was just wonderful. I love the drinks. I enjoy the Pibil Pork Tacos. The vintage esque photo booth is a plus also! Keep up the great work!
