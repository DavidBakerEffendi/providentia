My friend and I came here while we were walking around Soho.  We were starving and after we passed a restaurant where an employee begged us to dine there, we thankfully come upon Bistro Les Amis. We had brunch, so I can't speak for dinner, but everything was really nice.  The ambiance, the service and the food.  I can't complain about anything.  My friend had the Eggs Benedict and I had the French Toast, so we were pretty boring.  However, it was good and filling and we didn't eat again until late evening, so our purpose was served! I would definitely come back here again, especially for brunch.  The atmosphere was intimate and unobtrusive.  I couldn't help but notice how quiet it was when I spoke to my friend as if everyone spoke in hushed tones.  Loved it.
