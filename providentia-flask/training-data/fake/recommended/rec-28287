Sunny & Annie's is one of those wonderful places that reinforces how great living in New York City is. They are as well stocked as you might expect from a bodega-plus. That includes all the normal dry goods and cold beverages, plus some buffet items. But what really sets them apart is the sandwiches. They have an extensive gourmet sandwich list that will totally blow you away. For most of my friends, the piece de resistance is the Pho Sandwich. It tastes exactly like a delicious bowl of pho, but in easily digested sandwich form. I often wonder why more sandwich shops don't have some kind of specialty (like this, Italian subs, etc.). It's all similar ingredients but makes for a much more varied and tasty experience. On top of all of the wonderful food, the people working here are universally friendly. This would be welcome in any case, but considering they must deal with drunk monsters late into every evening, this is particularly noteworthy. This is one of the best bodega options in town.
