Holy Hell this place is delicious. I would have ordered more food had it not looked so gluttonous. Amidst a myriad hyper trendy families and sophisticated stylish individuals, there lies a menu with food as equally rich in character taste and health. In other words; This place is no joke. It's an order self serve sit "cafeteria" style spot with excellent healthy choices. Entrees are prepared when ordered, and it's 100% gluten free and soybean oil free canola oil free. PALEO all the way and you wouldn't even know it. Worth every penny.
