No.  Just no.  Seriously?  No.  How can...no!  It's just a little cart that serves lamb and chicken and rice.  Just a cart on the street corner.  So why?  Why and no! Of all the places that we were told we "have to go to" when in New York, my better half was told by multiple people that we absolutely HAD TO go to the Halal Guys.  We are not the people to buy into hype, but we figured we had to just so we could say we did.  We even saw it on the travel channel while we were in the freaking hotel room! So it was our dinner on one of our last nights in New York for our trip.  Who do these guys think they are to make something this good?  I'm serious, it was sooooo good.  We shared a gyro and chicken combo, which was only $6 for a very decent amount of food. I just...no.  How?  They were right.  They were right.  Tell you sister, they were right (paraphrased from Anakin Skywalker). Delicious food for an unbelievable price.  If we're ever in New York again, we will be back.  I don't care if there's a line, I've been in longer.  Go here.  All of you.  It is worth it.
