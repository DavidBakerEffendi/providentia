I have to admit I'm a little torn about this place. For the most part I've liked my food, but I wouldn't call it the best ever. The main issue I've had with food (and not just one dish) is the over abundance of salt. There's been a few pizzas that have been stellar though (one with pineapple and ham on it, delicious!....too bad it's now off the menu). The service is also fantastic. I wish the prices were a little lower for the appetizers. Seems rather high for the amount/quality that you get. Overall, it's a solid choice for East Falls.
