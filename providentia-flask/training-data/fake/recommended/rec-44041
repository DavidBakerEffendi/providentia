Excellent real ethiopian food. The food is well value as well.  I got the excellent chicken dish and there was plenty of the special bread to wrap up the delicious food. The spices were great.  The food was warm and the people were friendly.  This place truly is a hidden gem. I promise you, you won't be disappointed.
