This restaurant is beyond fantastic - For appetizers, I've order the Shrimp Manchurian and Chicken Lollipops.  Both are absolutely fantastic.  They're also really spicy  -  so ask for extra onions and lemon with your food! For main dishes, I ordered butter chicken (not too oily, great rich flavor).  And then - the ultimate dish: Crab Curry.  I've never tried crab prepared in this style before, but holy moly, it was fantastic.  The portion is staggering - I actually split it with someone! Arusavai has the best Indian food I've tried anywhere.  Skip all the other places and come here first!  This restaurant really deserves to do well, and if people give it a chance, I know it will deliver.
