This place AMAZING!.  My buddy and I went here on a referral and so grateful we went.  The server was enthusiastic and very helpful with questions about the menu.  When I asked her what her favorite thing on the menu was, she said chicken.  I thought "how boring"  It was absolutely the best roasted chicken I ever had.  My buddy had a seafood stew which was delicious as well.  The environment in the restaurant is unique in a good way.  Rustic, cozy, good mood lighting.  Oh yes, the apple crumb desert was perfect.  The pricing was good for the service and quality of food.
