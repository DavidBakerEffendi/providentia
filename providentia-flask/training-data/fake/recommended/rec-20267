I was in NYC for my birthday weekend and have been all over town for food with my foodie friends.everywhere we've been have been great,good food,good music and good vibes. We picked here according to the yelp reviews.we waited for bit more than an hour for table,that's was fine because it was a nice sunny Sunday and there are a lot of coffee shops and bakeries around.we finally got the table,host and hostese were friendly,the server was not.she pretty much hang over the menu and wait for us to tell her what we want. she didn't ask if we have any questions or try to up sale at all.we ordered orange juice and we down that 2oz of orange juice in a second due to heavy drinking the night before and we would like to order more but she never asked, she walked by us many times because we sat between the bar and the service station(where register, water..etc are), she took a glance but pretty much ignored us. food arrived.she never stop by and ask if we are doing okay,if we needed peper,sauce...etc or more orange juice..the coffee was never refilled. she must have noticed that everything in our glass,mug were empty but she just ignored us.she would take the empty plates away but won't ask if we need anything.she's more like a busser than a server.we left $3 tips for $42 bill.it was $3 more than her deserved... Other than that,food was okay,music was good but the brunch i had in other places were much better and so as service.
