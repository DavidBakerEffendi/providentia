Best margarita I've ever had: fresh lime juice, low sugar.  Tacos are all interesting and fresh.  I prefer the corn tortillas.  The veggie taco, al pastor, brisket, and shrimp tacos were quite flavorful and as well. Not happy with the lines and waiting, but when 2 cooks have to serve 20 people, what can you expect?  The owners are friendly and the prices are good! I also love that this place composts everything. They recycle the bottles and cans, and only foil and outside trash is actually thrown away (although they could do a better job of delineating the two, since I always see compostable materials in the trash.) All in all, a great place for a quick bite.
