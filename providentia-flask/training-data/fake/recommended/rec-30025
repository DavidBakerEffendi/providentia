It's a nice restaurant that has a really unique space and great energy. The food is super fresh and from local farms, which we really love. The wine list is extensive.  And the desserts are really delicious.  The service is pretty good but not excellent. For instance, no one proactively asked to take our winter coats when we arrived...they just stood and stared at us while we searched for the coat closest.  On the other hand, our waiter, although not the most knowledgeable, was very friendly and attentive. My only other qualm is that the portions are (much) smaller than we would like, especially given the price. Friends warned us of this in advance and said, "you'll love everything you eat, but you will leave feeling hungry and broke." I would say this is slightly exaggerated, but they were right. Also - parking is a joke.  I've been here twice, once for lunch and another time for dinner, and the lot is always full.  It's about 1/4 of the size that it should be.  They offer valet, but that's totally overkill for a restaurant located in rural suburbs.  We're not in NYC, just offer more parking. I would like to give this place 3.5 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt with 4 stars.
