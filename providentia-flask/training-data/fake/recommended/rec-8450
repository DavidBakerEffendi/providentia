Although they do have some good beer, it's not a place I would hit up regularly. It's a little sketchy outside on 4th ave. at night compared to places you can hit up just a few blocks up closer to the park. They turned the music up SOOOOOO loud between the live band that I couldn't hear a thing. Needless to say, catching up with an old friend that night was not an easy task and left before my vocal cords and ear drums popped!! Beer is an easy thing to find somewhere else!!! :-P
