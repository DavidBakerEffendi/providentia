Like everyone says...I have had better cheesesteaks but that not what going here is all about ..is it?    I ate at Genos prob about 20 years ago and talked it up big to my family.  Have to say, it wasn't near as good as I remembered...lol!   BUT when in Philly...   My husband got Pats across the street so we could do the comparison and both were equally as "good".  I think we may have preferred the fries at Pats over Genos.   It's an American Icon tho..so you have to give it a try.  Before you go make sure of a few things: Bring cash ( they only take cash) Know what you want by the time you get through the line or get the heck outta there...ha.   The line in the street moves fast because of the first two points.
