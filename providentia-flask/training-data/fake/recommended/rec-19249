Disappointed in the west side shop. The hosts are not very good at managing the wait list( tell me 90 min and you will text us, then when we check in after text you tell us we are second in line, then seat four deuces and when we ask what's up tell us we are second next again?). and none of the things we love measured up to the original store. Pork buns, pork was a bit dry, wings were off and the modern ramen didn't have the same taste or level of garlic oil. Not worth the 100 min wait..
