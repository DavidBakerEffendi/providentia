Started with samosa. Not the BEST samosa, but it was still very good. Lacked some spices typically found. Had dosa (some specific kind with potatos and stuff) which was absolutely enormous and delicious. Then had 3 orders of naan, an order of saag paneer and of some spicy chicken dish which I can't remember the name. Ate probably the biggest meal I've ever had. Over like 7000 calories I think.
