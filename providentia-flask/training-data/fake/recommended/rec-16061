Previous Ramen Experiences include: - Momofuku Noodle Bar - Ramen Setagaya Japanese Culinary Expertise: minimal, big fan of salmon sashimi and green tea mochi. I think I came here with my expectations set too high. After reading the raving reviews, I decided to visit this noodle shop to see how it compared to my previous experiences at Momofuku and Setagaya. I'll get straight to the point - the Modern was way too salty. I'm not gonna lie, the first 3 spoonfuls of chewy noodle bliss and soupy warmth were delicious and almost converted me to be a ramen fanatic. Unfortunately, after the 4th bite, my water glass was empty, and after the 5th bite, I started wishing that the bowl of soup in front of me was actually a big bowl of.... cold Snapple peach tea.
