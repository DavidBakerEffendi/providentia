Just had to post a review for the best place on earth. The beery aroma from the moment you walk in sets the mood, and everything you've ever imagined about a cozy, local gem of a pub/restaurant comes to fruition. Food is always delicious, the menu rotates and always remains fresh, the beers are exemplary, and the atmosphere is perfect. Just the right mixture of newbies and oldheads come together here, and it's nice to see them agree on one thing: this place is the jam. Huzzah!
