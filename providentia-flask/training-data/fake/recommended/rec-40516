We stopped in here for some pre-theater apps / sandwich on a Friday night.  My wife and I with our oldest daughter were on a tight schedule.  We told them the schedule was tight and they were very busy.  The hostess said it would not be a problem, did everything to accommodate, and told the server our situation.  Loved the food, and the drinks were awesome.  The tots...our 7 year old was in heaven!  Rarely in the Philly area, but we'll definitely be going back here.
