I had high hopes for this place following the chipotle style prep and ordering that has been extended so well to other venues. Unfortunately Agno comes up short. Unlike Chipotle, the serving size for each ingredient is carefully measured with a small spoon. This results in not nearly enough protein for any human being. The food also really lacks flavor. It's almost as if they've omitted spices and seasoning entirely. The price isn't worth it here. That said - it is BYOB so take advantage of that!
