This cart used to have a 5 star rating for me when the meat was cooked in front of you and not pulled out the back of a truck in foil trays. Also when you could put your platter down for a while and the rice not solidify do to the amount of grease they cook with. If you have never been its a spot to try, Â just so you know what the hype is about but, in all honesty the food is barely OK for a sober palate. And its really easy to understand why so many ppl love it after a night of drinking. It's greasy food and when your drunk nothing else could possibly taste better. Seriously though if your sober you most likely will not enjoy the amount of oil in your rice let alone the meat. And if you really insist on going get the lamb and rice. Lamb is seasoned and just the perfect crisp. Chicken tastes like pieces of boiled chicken with no seasoning at all. Make sure you try the white sauce with your platter and a little bit of hot sauce. Be careful with the hot sauce though. Its ridiculously hot. Oh and the place across the street (6th) is owned by the same guys. They even take turns working both carts so don't be a fool and wait on line an extra hour and a half because the food is no different. They pull the meat out of the same truck. And if you talk to the guys at either cart they will tell you the same too.
