Had been here for dinner a few months back...sat in the downstairs "cellar". It was an excellent meal, with lovely service, fine wine...and very romantic. All in all, a wonderful experience. Then went back just yesterday for brunch. And it was another great experience. Sat in the outside garden out back...very cool. The frittats's were done just right....a nice combination of veggies. And some good sides! They had a good special, which seems their normal fare, which also included a drink (NICE Mimosa!!) My only suggestion - add a simple charge for more drinks...easily done! 4 stars only because 5 has to GREAT, and I don't think I've had one of those anywhere yet...but then again, I could be just a jaded NY'er !!!
