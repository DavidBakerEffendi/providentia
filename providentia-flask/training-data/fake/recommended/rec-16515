If you are looking for a new experience, this is your place. Excellent blend of flavors that you can't find anywhere else. I tried most of the items on the menu. I recommend everything but the burger. It was dry and didn't come with cheese! My favorite dish had to be the pizza.  Be forewarned though, after the pizza has sat in it's juices for a while it loses its crunch and thus, its appeal. Portions are small, be prepared to share.  Also. Expensive! 15 dollars for two sliders (burgers) really erked me.
