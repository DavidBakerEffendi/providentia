My friend and I ended up here on a whim on a Sunday evening when the movie we were hoping to go to at a local theatre was sold out. Like some believe, everything happens for a reason because wow, this place was an amazing way to cap off the end of a great weekend. We walked into a dimly lit, comfortable, ambient not-so-hole-in-the-wall atmosphere. The waitstaff greeted us, telling us to sit where we would like. We both ordered the house red, which was a 2011 Vrabel (a wine that I was unfamiliar with). It was amazing and for $8 a glass, it was a good deal. We ordered the Crazy Baba, a Babaganoush with feta and basil, for an appetizer, which was amazing and I highly recommend starting with it. The pita bread that arrived with it was the perfect dipping agent. For dinner, I ordered the Fatoush salad, which the waiter kindly commented, "If you're hungry, I would get something else along with it" (which I'm thankful for because I was hungry and the Fatoush wouldn't have been enough). The Fatoush was awesome, fire-roasted onions, tomatoes, feta, and all. As a compliment, I also ordered the Falafel appetizer and OMG the falafels were FANTASTIC! Perfectly cooked with a crispy outer crust and velvety soft inner. My friend ended up ordering one of the special entrees of the night, which was a salmon dish that she absolutely loved. Besides the great food experience, the service was perfection. Our server was very charismatic and dedicated to making our evening as good as it could be. Side note: the background music is quite enjoyable and not what you would expect for a middle-eastern restaurant (The Weeknd's new album). So that part was obviously pretty cool, too. All in all, ZiZi's is a great addition to the williamsburg food scene and totally worth a visit (or two, or three, or four....).
