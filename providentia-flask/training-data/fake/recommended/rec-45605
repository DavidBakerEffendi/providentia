I came here with a couple friends last night who are well versed in Japanese cuisine. We started off with gyoza, karaage chicken, and takoyaki.   Gyoza was pan fried and tasted good. I appreciated the lack of watery discharge most places have (due to defrosting) so either they make them fresh or they are good at removing all that water! Karaage chicken was really moist and flavorful. Crispy thin crust and a great flavor. I think it's dark meat only tho. Takoyaki tasted ok, the potato filling was good, but there was only a really small octopus inside, so that was a little disappointing. I had the large miso ramen and it was quite good. The broth was really good, it was 'thick' and packed with flavor. I really enjoyed it.  The egg was cooked perfectly, like a slightly more cooked soft boiled egg. Noodles were cooked well, al dente style and the added veggies were a nice reprieve from just noodles being shoveled into my mouth. :)  The best part (obviously) is the broth, but a close second was the roasted pork pieces. you only get two, which is sad, but they are SO GOOD! they barely stay together so you really only need slight pressure from your lips and it just breaks down! salty goodness. While I'm not often in Philly, I would definitely come back!
