This place is exactly what I'm looking for for brunch. Great food, original pancakes/waffles, amazing flavored butters, cheap as all hell. Â Considering the quality and the price, I'm willing to wait in line for half an hour. The wait staff are very aware of the line situation and try to turn tables very quickly, but I never feel like I'm being pushed out the door. So what if it's not pretty? I don't need ambience to go with my $10 brunch.
