I ordered the pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon yoghurt and my friend ordered millet pancakes served with home-made chicken sausage and goat cheese & beet salad.  Both came with syrup, which I didn't think was necessary.  Both dishes had a wonderful mix of flavors.  The cinnamon and yoghurt flavors wonderfully complemented the fluffy, mild flavored pancakes.  The pancakes by themselves were a little bland, and it was hard to taste the pumpkins.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers who described this dish as a one note dish.  I prefered the millet pancakes dish, because of its melody of flavors and textures.  The pancakes had a great grainy texture and was fully of flavor.  Similarly, the chicken sausage tasted like a cross between a falafel (in its texture) and a sausage, and was chock full of flavor.  Beets and goat cheese are always a tasty combo, although I personally think a splash of lime would have been a great addition.  We came around 11:20am on a Sat. and waited about 10 min.  The service was quick and friendly.  The ambiance was nice, but somewhat nondescript and (perhaps depending on where in the room you are seated) noisy.
