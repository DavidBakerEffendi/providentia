I do think of myself as a burger person.  I will be honest and say I think Prime 16 in downtown New Haven, CT has the best burger in the area.  My second favorite place for burgers is right here at Rudy's.  I am a big fan of the Voodoo Burger and chipotle ketchup.  The french fries here at Rudy's with their dipping sauces are better than Prime 16.  It is an even trade off. I like going to Rudy's for lunch on Fridays.  It is far enough walk to get some exercise but close enough to make it back to work in an hour.  The service here compared to Prime 16 is friendlier.  I usually sit at the bar and the young woman has been very nice.  I hope things about her passport works out. I have taken some pictures of Rudy's here on Yelp and posted them.  Feel free to ask me any questions.
