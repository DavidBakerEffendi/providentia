So what if this place has not been a "secret" for years now?  Still great even if a few too many people now know of the bar behind the fortune teller and tourists can be found therein with guide books tucked away under their jackets. Come here for the cocktails which are amazing (this lounge definitely remains a core part of the City's mixed drinks establishments).  You'll also always find a good crowd and a great vibe.  Restaurant in back is good too but it's the atmosphere and drinks that really keep people (including me) coming back time after time (and year after year).
