The gyoza were tasty, moist and fresh. The pork bone ramen was dreamy. Nice, tender chunks of meat, lots of fresh noodles and a thick, well-seasoned broth to top it all off. I was pretty full by the end of the meal but couldn't resist taking more sips of the broth before I left. I will definitely be back.
