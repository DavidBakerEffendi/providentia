This restaurant is why I'm a foodie! Every dish from the lentil soup, toast with roasted whole garlic, Hawaiian prawns with Maine scallops, was incredible! Everything was so well seasoned without being overdone. The chef here understands food and does justice to high quality ingredients. The service was excellent with friendly, knowledgeable servers. It truly was a memorable experience. Â I will be back soon with friends!
