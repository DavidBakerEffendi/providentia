Popped in just to try a slice on our way home from picking up our take-out order from Star Tavern and was very pleasantly surprised.  Dough was just the right combo of chewy and crispy, sauce was flavored nicely and the cheese blend was stretchy and tasty.  Price for 2 slices (for my 11 year old pizza maven and myself) --$3.75.  Head to head comparison with Star Tavern?  This was better!  They've also got a bunch of sweet deals for every day of the week.  Definitely a take out place, only a couple of tables, looked clean.  We will be back.
