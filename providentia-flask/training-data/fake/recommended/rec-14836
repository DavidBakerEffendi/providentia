Maybe everything except what I always order (bottomless chips, seitan tacos, huevos rancheros, seitan texas cheesesteak) is absolute garbage, but camino is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Those 3 things are gold, and everything is pretty cheap. Happy hour margaritas are strong but not incredible, but they do the job. Best thing about outdoor seating season is its pretty easy to get seated indoors when it's nice out on the weekend. Also: mimosas and bloody marys are a mere $3!
