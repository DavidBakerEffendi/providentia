Pretty good, cheap.  A nice big burger patty but sort of under flavored.  The bacon was key, the bread was generic and whatever, with whatever fries.  Cool old bar, cheap beers, crowded and full of frat boys.  Which is a good or bad thing depending on who you are.   The burgers have nothing on shake shack.
