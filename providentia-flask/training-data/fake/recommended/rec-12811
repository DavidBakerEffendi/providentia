To Yerba Buena: was your kitchen running out of salt or what?! Â Everything from the appetizers (Picada: chicharron, yucca, tostones, chorizo, spicy rocotto) to the main dish (arroz con pollo) was mediocre and tasteless. The chicken was so dry that we had to ask for a sauce--ANY sauce--to be able to bear it. I went on a Friday night and place was quite deserted. That should have been a sign. Only the waiters and staff were very nice so they get two stars for attentiveness.
