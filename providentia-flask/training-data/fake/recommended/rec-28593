I used to totally love Hu Kitchen. I still do in some ways, but am noticing some disconcerting trends. I go here at least once a week, and lately have noticed that the roasted vegetables are more like charred vegetables. Blackened, dry, brittle. Overall I am starting to feel like food quality is declining. I also have noticed now every time I eat from the hot bar I end up bloated and gassy later in the day, which is an extremely rare occurrence in my life otherwise. I know it's Hu because it happens like clockwork. I don't know what they are doing differently now, but I hope it is temporary
