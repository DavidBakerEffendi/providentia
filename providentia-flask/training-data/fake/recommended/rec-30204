The food here is really excellent. It's all incredibly flavorful and not at all greasy. I know many people find that Indian food leaves them with indigestion, but that's not the case here.   The service here is very friendly, but it could be faster. The decour is fine, but nothing to write home about.   Two warnings: Firstly, if they claim that something is spicy, belive them. The spice never overwhelms the flavor, but it's most definitely there.   Second, this place is not cheap. Each main dish will run you close to $20, and you won't find any combination plates. Protip: go for lunch! They have an incredibly generous lunch special for just $10.
