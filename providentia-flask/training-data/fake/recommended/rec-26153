Second time here, same disappointment.  Service looks friendly but actually is very slow.  Waiter made a mistake with my order. He gave me a "free" salad but I refused at which point he got upset.  I ordered the steak salad which was overpriced and very ordinary.  It seems the descriptions of the menu items are better than they taste.  I left hungry.  This place is not a good choice.
