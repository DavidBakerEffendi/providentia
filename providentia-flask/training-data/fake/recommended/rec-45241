My wife and I love this place.  Every year we go and make a special night of it.   Great place to go before a play. They even ask you if you are going to see a show to ensure you get out in time!      The Food is amazing,  Endless pasta trio, and Veal Parm are my two favorites.   And to top things off they have a $25 wine list!  Fairly large list and good wines!!!    The Prices are fair for the food.   Ive been to places that werent nearly as good and paid almost double!     Entrees range from $18-$40....   Highly Reccomend.
