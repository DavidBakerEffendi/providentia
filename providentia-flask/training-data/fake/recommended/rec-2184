I came to Philadelphia to try their famous cheese steak sandwiches. Our group arrived to the destination and looked at the lines at Pat's and decided to go with Geno's, which had considerably much shorter lines...and for good reason. There is nothing special here. The bread is okay, they meat quality is low. The cheese is fake (cheeze whiz) albiet it has a lot more flavor than the provolone. I think you almost need the strong taste of cheeze whiz for some kind of flavour because the meat definitely offers none. It also doesn't help that the tables are dirty and the help is rude. I had to pour some bottled water on the table and wipe it down really well because it was so covered in cheese and grease. When I went back to the counter to ask for a bag to take back some extra sandwiches, the man completly ignored me. Here I am, standing in front of him, saying "excuse me sir. Sir? Sir can I get a bag? Sir?" Yeah....he just looked straight ahead and pretended I was not there. Now I know why people go to Pats!!!!!!
