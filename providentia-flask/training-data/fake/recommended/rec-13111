A friend and I went here for some great wine and cheese. You walk in to a great decor and ambiance. We ordered a bottle of wine and 6 cheeses, that the staff chose for us according to our wine pick. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable. We will definitely go back and try out the other small plates.
