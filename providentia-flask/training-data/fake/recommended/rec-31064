The place was very nice, but the service was very slow and the portions were small for the prices.  We had reservations for 6 on Wed Jul 10 at 815, finally got seated at 830. We were there 2 hrs which included desert; we expected it to be closer to 1 1/2 hrs especially since it was later in the evening on a weeknight.  The $18 cheese tray was very small and the cheese was just OK.  We had to ask for a 2nd container of chips/bread for our table of 6; I would have expected that to either be brought to us or suggested to us if we wanted 2.  The side dishes of potatoes and of green beans were very good.  Overall would rate it a 3 1/2.
