Best dining experience I have had in a while.  We started off at the bar while we waited for our table.  Two thumbs up for the bartender who made me an extra dirty Grey Goose martini to perfection and delicious cocktails for my girlfriends. The four of us shared several different plates, so we were able to experience a wide range of what Scarpetta has to offer.   Apps: Creamy Polenta (a must!) & Crispy Fritto Misto (Good, but I can skip this next time) Pasta: Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti (group favorite, will def order again), Tagliatelle (certainly did not disappoint, very delicious), Pumpkin Casonsei (again...it was good, but can be skipped next time) Dessert: Two of us loved the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the other two loved the Chocolate Cake - guess it depends on what flavors you prefer.  Both were delicious. My only regret is that I didn't try the spaghetti.  I will definitely be back and I'm bringing the hubby with me!
