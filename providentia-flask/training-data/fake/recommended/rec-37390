For New Hampshire, the sushi here is decent and people seem to enjoy the hibachi, but that's all Koto has got going for it in my book. The service totally sucks. The wait can be ridiculously long. I've had servers bicker and fight in front of my table about who is supposed to be waiting on us. I've had servers forget about my table, bring the wrong order, and be mostly unapologetic about their mediocrity. Â  go Yama, the Orient, or even Peking Tokyo before you come here.
