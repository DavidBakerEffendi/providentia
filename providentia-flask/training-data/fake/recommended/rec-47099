Johnny Brenda's is OK by me.  Been there a few times since they opened the upstairs. Best thing I can say about them is that I fell asleep at the bar...I wasn't drunk (had maybe two beers), just had been going for pretty much 36 hours straight and had promised to see a friend's band there...and they didn't kick me out.  So I looked around and said, "well if they didn't kick me out yet I'm going to go back to sleep".  They still didn't kick me out.  Since the stage is set away from the bar my friends didn't know I had basically slept through their set.  So that makes me like the layout that much more. Thanks JB's!
