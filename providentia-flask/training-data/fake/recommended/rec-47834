This is Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" gone pizza. It dispels the myth that NYC is the holy grail of pie purveyors. It also further reinforces that California pizza is two tiers above eating toasted Wonder Bread and Ragu sandwiches (not that I'm above eating said sandwich). Save for the fact that Connecticut is as interesting a place to live as California is to eat, this place is awesome. All the more awesome: Bar brews its own beer on-site.
