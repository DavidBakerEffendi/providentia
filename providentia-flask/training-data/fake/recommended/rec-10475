This place has potential. The food is good.  We ordered the scallops as an appetizer which was good, it also came with a side salad.  I had the veggie lasagna and my mother had the portobello mushroom salad.  All the dishes we had were delicious.  I loved the salad, very light, yet filling.  The lasagna was very heavy, but nevertheless, I enjoyed it [As you can read, I ate a lot of food. I blame my mother since she can never finish her food!]  We had the tiramisu for desert and it was good. Boy, after this meal, I was so full, I could've burst! Anyway, the inside is a bit small, but it's cute dimly lit with the small candles.  It's a nice place but not necessarily for an intimate dinner. I say that because there were a few groups of four or more so it can get loud. The service wasn't very good since our server didn't bring out our wine until after the appetizers and I had to ask for it. Nice place and I might come back if I'm around the area.
