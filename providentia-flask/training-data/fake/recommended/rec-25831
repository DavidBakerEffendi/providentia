have mixed feelings about reviewing Piccolo Angolo...but only cuz I don't want to blow this place up.  as good as it gets when it comes to low-key, no frills, just like mama made it, old-school Italian.  Get the linguine meatballs.  Go hungry.  have the leftovers the next day - still soo good.  Great service.  Very reasonably priced wine list.
