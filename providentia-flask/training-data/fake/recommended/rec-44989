Obi wan delivered on all that you saw on Top Chef Masters. He was even there at the restaurant checking in on a number of things on the the night before new years eve. Something you almost never see in New York with the celebrity chefs. As for the food the roast chicken was as great as everyone says. We also had the beet salad which had shaved goat cheese. A unique version that was fantastic. We tried the walnut gnocchi which was very light and almost a polenta graininess to it. Very good. My wife had the fluke which was breaded and fried, a surprise for her, but honestly was the best "fish stick" she ever had. Don't miss the flight of sparkling wines. Stick to the wines too as the bartender didn't make the best martini.
