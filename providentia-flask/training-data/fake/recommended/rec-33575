Slightly biased because we live down the block, but I'll try to be as candid and honest as possible... BEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD (kidding...sort of) This place has never failed to please. Service, food, location; all outstanding. Been many, many times; sometimes for socializing with friends over drinks, sometimes for brunch, sometimes for dinner. And, honestly, each time we leave we realize we shouldn't wait so long to come back. Lately we've become regulars for Sunday brunch, so we're reaching our goals. Note: Brunch is only served on Sunday mornings. Service is great from the moment we walk in the door. Always greeted with a smile, there is a spot to leave your umbrella if it happens to be raining, and rarely a long wait for a table. Ambiance and decor are inviting, warm, casual, and fitting with the neighborhood. For brunch, the best things we've had are the buckwheat pancakes and the monte cristo; both incredible, hearty portions, always satisfying. For dinner, we love the burger and scallops; and our friends tell us the bowl of mussels is great, too. For either meal, the fries here are really great; crispy, light, and perfect every time. Every drink we've had has been great; classic bloody mary, mimosa, bellini, and the Long Bottom Bramble from their signature cocktail list is one of the best drinks we've had in the city. If you're in the neighborhood (please leave...jk), and want a great place to sit, relax, and enjoy great food & libations, this is the spot. You will not be disappointed. Best things: ***Monte cristo (brunch) ***Buckwheat pancakes (brunch) ***Burger ***Long Bottom Bramble (cocktail)
