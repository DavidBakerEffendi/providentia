I went here last night with my boyfriend, his brothers & our group of friends after a trip to the bar. It was about 2 in the morning and some comfort food was needed. This was my first time seeing Mac Attack and it was a bright first introduction. The place is decorated in shades of yellows and oranges - all colors that are meant to just wake you up. Upon looking at the menu I was at a loss at what to choose. I'm not really a mac and cheese lover so I let my boyfriend and his brother pick out what to get. They decided on fried mac and cheese balls (which we got the last of), a grilled cheese, the original mac and cheese, and the burger mac and cheese. These names are probably different on the menu. Haha. We waited in their lounge area for about 10 minutes for our food to be done. We took it to go to enjoy at home and boy, was it enjoyed. The fried mac and cheese was delicious with the addition of one of their sauces that I don't remember was called. It was orange if that helps! The mac and cheese entrees were equally mouth watering as well. Everything was cooked to perfection. This is a definitely great spot for a bite to eat. My mac and cheese favoring has gone up because of them.
