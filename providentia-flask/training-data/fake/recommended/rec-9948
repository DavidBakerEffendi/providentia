Ice cream sandwiches here are worthy of trying. I came here per a friend's suggestion for dessert around 10pm on a Friday night, and was surprised as to how crowded the place was.  The trick is to skip the line and go all the way back to the take-out section, where there were only 2 people ahead of us.  It's create your own ice cream sandwiches style, where you can choose cookies and ice cream flavors pairing.  I had ginger cookies + vanilla ice cream because I wanted something light after a somewhat heavy dinner.  The ginger flavor isn't too prominent and the creaminess of the vanilla ice cream helped balance out the spicy aroma.  I highly recommend it even if you aren't usually a ginger cookie fan.  You might be pleasantly surprised!
