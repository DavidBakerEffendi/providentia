The kennet mushroom pizza was really good!! Their beer & wine selection was pretty limited compared to other places of its kind but that's ok! The atmosphere was great! Good music & very very vibrant. Don't miss their dessert special! For only $5 Â  We got a very generous portion of delicious chocolate mousse with a brownie bottom. A very delicious way to end our fun night at Zavino!
