I don't know what the big deal is. I got there at 630 PM and there was already a line outside (15 minute wait). The crowd was predominantly tourists. Because it's summer time, there were several large groups of teenagers visiting with their family from wherever. And other big noisy groups wearing Crocs or other suburban-like clothing. It's not the most relaxing dining experience when you get called inside as you have to sit elbow-to-elbow with other diners on little chairs. The service was curt and SLOW. It took a lot of eye contact and waving around for us to get the servers attention to get our pie. The pie was not even all that amazing. I've had better at Isabella's or Lombardis. It was not a pie I will be dreaming about. The general sluggish service, overcrowded/overhypeness, wall covered with framed photos of 'famous' people who have visited the restaurant, made an overall not so exciting or worth the train ride experience.
