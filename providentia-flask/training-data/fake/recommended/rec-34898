Our friend Lynn  T. booked a reservation and invited us to join her.  I don't watch Top Chef, so I am not versed in the background of the chef who runs this restaurant.  But, I must say it was a good dinner.   The decor is standard modern fare but retains a bit of warmth.  Actually, perhaps the warmth was from the lack of air conditioning.  They decided to stuff six of us into a booth made for four instead of the standard tables in the back, which made for a very hot and cramped experience (hence the one star shy of five stars). They have a good wine selection and an eclectic beer selection.  The BB Burgerbrau was kind of skunky, so it must not have been fresh.  The light wheat beer from Japan was interesting, but I must say the the Japanese don't know anything about brewing beer compared to the Germans.  I should have tried the hefeweisse from Sheiderveisse instead. For appetizers we tried the spicy duck meatballs, crab salad with avocado and beef carpaccio.  All were very good.  The duck meatballs were very flavorful.  They were served with what looked like a raw or barely cooked quail egg, which was interesting. For the entree I had the skirt steak with spinach, roasted onion and horseradish sauce, which was expertly prepared.  The flavors blended very well.  We shared sides of risotto, creamed corn and roasted potatoes.  The risotto was very creamy and almost tasted like mac and cheese, but in a good way.  The creamed corn was sweet but the kernels were still crunchy - very good. We all tried desserts as well.  I had a fig and berry crisp that was served in a tiny pan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Let's just say that it broke my heart to have to share a taste with the others at the table, it was so good. So, overall, the food was wonderful.  The ambiance was OK.  The seating arrangement sucked.  Total score:  4 stars.
