Pretty decent, I have been wanting to try a quality ramen place and that is what I got when I went.   I went the other day with my siblings.  I got the mayu ramen which is a pork bone based noodle soup and garlic oil, bamboo shoot roast pork, boiled egg, scallion, kikurage, red ginger, my sister got the miso ramen which is a soy bean based noodle soup and bamboo shoot, roast pork bean sprout, boiled egg, scallion, kikurage, and my brother got the terakawa ramen which is a  pork bone based noodle soup and bamboo shoot, red ginger roast pork, boiled egg, scallion, kikurage.  Out of the three I would rank them like this miso, terakwa, and then mayu, the broth with all three were different.  The mayu broth had a black sesame taste which was just okay, it was also kinda bland compared to the terakawa and miso. I woulda enjoy the other two. My favorite part of the ramen was definitely the egg, which was cooked to perfection and tasted real good. With the ramen we got the lunch special so we got to each pick one side order so we ordered the gyoza, charsu, and chicken curry.  My favorite out of the three was the charsu, which is braised pork they use for the ramen that they put over rice. We also got the takoyaki which was my favorite dish overall. I think this is a decent noodle place, and later that night I was thinking about it and wanted to go and eat there again.
