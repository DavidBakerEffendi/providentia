Amazing Oxtail stew with rice and peas. I don't know what they put in this but every bite melts in your mouth and even though the portions are huge, you will want to finish every bite. BYOB. Waited a while for the food and the service is a bit lacking but the food seriously makes up it. Only a few tables available upstairs and the stairs are quite steep. Owner is super friendly and kind. Very affordable prices.
