It had  a nice atmosphere. That's about it. A lot of things on the menu where not available. The people who got bibim bam were sorta happy. At other places we got to pick what was in the bibim bam but not here. The shaved steak was very fatty. The beef ribs were tasty but it ended up they got burned because we were not paying attention since we were all talking together. I guess cooking your own meat when you are paying so much $ is kind of silly. The appetizers were not so good and we were a party of five so they should have had enough for taste for everyone not just for 2. Some people asked for forks and knives for the food and they didn't give us any. It seemed overpriced and some of us had to  fill up just on rice. We all agreed we would not be back.
