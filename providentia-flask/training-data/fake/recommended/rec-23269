Excellent meal! I may have just experienced one of the most simple yet perfectly balanced and Delicious bites when I tried the mini cheese ravioli w porcini mushrooms butter and sage. Also, I loved the chicken liver pasta- hearty, rich pasta that takes you back to a childhood/ homey feeling- comfort food. Wow! I was in love with the pasta dishes... Then came the suckling pig! Mmm good!! Moist and flavorful with some cracklin! To finish the night, I had the banana gelato - it was just delightful. I was impressed by this place. I expected it to be good and it was great! Not to mention we had impeccable service. Our waitress Kelly was so friendly and a great waitress. I highly recommend and I will be back!!
