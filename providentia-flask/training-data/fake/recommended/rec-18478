If you know about or like authentic Mexican food DONT go here. Better off at a taco truck. I personally hated it and didn't get what I paid extra for... Which is never a good sign. Just wasn't a good experience for me. And I felt $18 for 3 tacos and salsa was steep especially when he didn't even put all of what I paid extra for and I had to go back.
