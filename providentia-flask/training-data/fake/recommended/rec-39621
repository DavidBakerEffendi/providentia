This is now the go-to place when I visit friends in the city. The two-pitcher sangria is the perfect size for a group of 3. The calamari is surprisingly excellent, as are the other tapas. I've had the platanos rellenos, mini-Cubanos, taquitos de pollo, and tequila mussels, and loved them all. It has a fun, lively atmosphere, especially on the weekends, and yet chill enough to be able to hold a conversation with friends. The only drawbacks are that the place is a bit small, so can get quite crowded, and the bathrooms need upgrading.
