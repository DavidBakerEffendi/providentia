Nice comfortable spot to enjoy some small plates with my loves. There were three of us, and we made our dinner out of a bunch of the small plates and really enjoyed them. We had the pumpkin gnocchi, Wagyu skewers, Pepper and Eggplant casserole, Chicken Gizzards, Smoked Trout, Roasted potatoes and a really yummy apple gallete with honey ice cream (YUM!) I think our favorites were the gizzards and the pepper and eggplant casserole, both really tasty!
