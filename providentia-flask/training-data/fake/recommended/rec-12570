What a nice restaurant with great customer service! I was walking aimlessly around Little Italy, hoping a restaurant would just "jump out at me" for dinner. Not the best strategy, I know, but I ended up following a fellow patron into the establishment and was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I was dining alone, and it is always intimidating walking into an establishment to ask for your "Table for 1". Will they judge me? Do they think I don't have any friends to eat with on a Friday night? All worry was put to rest by the gracious and accommodating personality of the servers. They greet you with a warm "Buonasera", and made me space at their counter when they had a packed dining room. I decided to go with the Papardelle Oxtail Ragu because...well because I've never had Oxtail before and I have heard good things. The meal is obviously homemade, which was the best part. The noodles were tender and firm at the same time. What a feat! The ragu was PIPING HOT! Must have just come off a flame because I nearly burned my mouth. That issue aside, the sauce was good. Not great, but definitely good. I would recommend a group check it out on a Friday night. Good company, good service and good food - you cant go wrong!
