Outstanding French cuisine in cozy homey atmosphere! We were visiting NYC in March which was frigid and we saw this adorable red door which called out to us.  We went in thinking we would order 1 drink & warm up. It was early for dinner so we lingered inside with our cocktails for a bit.  The French 75 was crisp and fresh.  We should have sat farther back to warm better but we couldn't resist people watching at the tiny front tables. We shared the coq au vin & roasted beets with crime friache. Since it was so early we just wanted to sample a few dishes.  The coq ua vin was slow cooked red wine goodness that made me try to convince my dining partner to order seconds.  The roasted beets were fresh & straightforward. We shared a tarte slice which was a thin custard pie with Creme friache.  This dessert did a good job of not being overly sweet or guilt inducing- though the non sweet cream was not our favorite. Our server was a relaxed blonde that looks exactly like a friend I have in Arizona so I felt like she already knew us!  She was patient with our lingering loitering style & helped us navigate the menu. When reminiscing about our trip I often day dream back to Buvette.  The cozy cafe style makes you want to become a regular.
