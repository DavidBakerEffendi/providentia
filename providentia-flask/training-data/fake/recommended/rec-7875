When I was in Los Angeles last year, it was recommend to my friends and I that we try Umami Burger and I absolutely fell in love. And when our waiter told us that they were coming to the East Coast in New York City, I was more than ecstatic. So when Umami opened in New York, I knew I had to go immediately but was only able to go recently. However, I always told all my friends to go haha. I went with my cousins and surprisingly it was as crowded as we expected it was on Sunday evening. We had the sweet potato fries, thin fries and had them truffled, the duck burger, the truffle burger and ahi tuna burger. And by far, my favorite was the truffle burger. It was nothing less than amazing. I loved how they had sauces served in soup spoons and how the soda was served in bottles with a cup of ice as well. It was a nice touch. However in LA, they had this special ketchup sauce I looked forward to but I guess they don't serve it here. That sauce made a huge difference I feel like but oh well. And although in the beginning there was a confusion about who our waiter and waitress are (two came to us and explained umami and the menu selection), it was a great experience.
