Just had dinner here a few hours ago... wow, I've been living in New York for the past Â 4 years and I can't believe I haven't been to this place sooner! The chicken and waffles were my favorite. A close second was the shrimp and grits... oh I'm so full but my mouth is still watering! Service was great. Our waiter had a delightful Aussie accent and was friendly. Our glasses of water were always refilled promptly. Just really attentive staff. I recommend this place to anyone, especially those who are just visiting New York City. This place has great food.
