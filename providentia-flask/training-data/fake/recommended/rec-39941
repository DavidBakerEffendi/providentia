Haven't been there in a while but I did remember that I loved their veal parmesan. Well, lucky for me that I ordered.  It was the best I ever had!  The breading was light, crispy and not greasy at all.  Our server was super sweet and attentive.  Please give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.
