I love the concept of this place; it's casual and sharp at the same time. The wine shop is an awesome idea that I wish would catch on. The staff at the wine shop are friendly, knowledgeable and always make a great suggestion; it's become my go to wine shop even if I'm not eating in. I've had several meals and been happy with all them; the duck fat fries are gross but I think that's my issue over theirs. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the service is almost consistently bad. I've only had one good server, everyone else seemed like that had something better to do. One bus boy always asks me if I'm finished while I'm still chewing, fork in hand and then proceeds to clear from others at the table. It's a big pet peeve of mine when the table is getting cleared and I or someone else is still eating. But overall, I really like it there, they just need to retrain or restaff most of the service staff.
