We've been going to this restaurant for a year or so and have always like them. It's always a decision between going to them or pho noodles. I've always like Nan Zhou, but honestly, sometimes it's really a hit or a miss. Their price is very reasonable (cheap). I have noticed they seem to have cut down the amount of noodles they give you lately and sometimes the clams are not fresh. I'd still go back for their beef noodle soup though.
