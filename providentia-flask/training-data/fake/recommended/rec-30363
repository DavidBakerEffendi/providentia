Hi, Mark at Kiwiana. At first I thought it was pretty cool that you answer the phone at your still relatively new Park Slope restaurant. I watched '"Top Chef." I rooted for you. Maybe you remember me? I'm the one who had the AUDACITY to call on a Wednesday at 7:30 to ask if I could make an 8:15 reservation. ... I know! For the record, an appropriate answer would have been, "I don't have 8:15, but I do have 9:15. Would you like it?" To that I would have thought, "Wow. Good for Mark! Those Marmite ribs really MUST be good! I've got to try this hot new restaurant!" So I thought it was kind of unnecessary when instead you said - with nothing less than disdain - "Did you ACTUALLY think I'd have anything earlier than that?" The answer is: yes. I ACTUALLY thought that. That's why I called. I came in for brunch and even though we were the only ones in the restaurant and the service was slow, I've been rooting for you. Again. But you know who's nicer than you? al di la. And Franny's. And Applewood. So congratulations, Mark. I'm glad that business is so good for you that you can afford to actively alienate customers. Tell me: is business this good when it's not restaurant week, too? The bottom line: [read in same tone you used with me:] Welcome to the neighborhood. ERF
