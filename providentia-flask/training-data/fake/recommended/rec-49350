What a unique idea!  Combining a bookstore and a dinerish restaurant is the best idea ever!  Somehow it all makes sense.  The breads are amazing!!!!!!  So many different kinds of fresh baked goods.  Different breads and pastries are available.  They also have pretty much everything else that is available in a diner.  The atmosphere is really great as well.  I am kind of dissappointed though that they didn't have magazines.  I was trying to kill some time with a Bitch mag and a good breakfast but found out that the nearest magazine store was around the corner.
