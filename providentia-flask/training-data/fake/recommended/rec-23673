The best ramen I've had in Philly yet. Almost competes with my favorite spots in NYC and SF, which says a ton. The place itself is beautiful - much nicer than most Chinatown locations. Their website alone shows how high-end the place is. The service is beyond friendly and helpful, with servers who can answer any questions which is appreciated for newbies (which I'm sure there are many). My personal favorite is the Tan Tan Ramen ($10), which is a little spicy. The Signature Terakawa is also great ($9). BYO which is another perk. Oh and they take credit cards!
