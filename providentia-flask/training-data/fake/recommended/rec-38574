This place was recommended by the people at Magic Hat as a good restaurant, I'm glad we took their recommendation because it was incredible. I love restaurants that pride themselves in home made, local, and happy food. Knowing where my burger comes from is the only way I'll eat one lately. The place is really nicely set up, there's a cute beer garden in the back that would be fun to just chill out in if you were only interested in drinking. When you were seated you got lots of room to sit down. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes after we ordered to even get our appetizer, and the waitress forgot to get my friend her root beer right away. Our waitress did end up apologizing and said our order got pushed down because of the big party that ordered before us. Even though they got sat after us, oh well. Everything on the menu looked amazing, I'm going to have to go back to try more of their food. We ordered a blue cheese toast for the app, and I wasn't a huge fan, it was three slices of toast with honey? and blue cheese. The others I was with really liked it though. I was so excited for my grass fed local burger, and I wasn't disappointed at all. Although I ordered jalapenos, and they put it on my brothers burger, he wanted them too so we split them cause they put on way to many. The food was absolutely delicious. I could have eaten 100 of those burgers The Salad was also very delicious, I had a bite of my brothers french fries and they tasted so fresh. Everything that was ordered was absolutely delicious. It was obvious by taste that it was all fresh local products. They also give you 4 samples of ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, and something else I forgot. Those were fun the play with, but they come in such big portions I feel like I wasted so much food because you obviously cannot reuse something people spoon onto their food. Perhaps they can find smaller trays to serve them on so we aren't wasting as much?
