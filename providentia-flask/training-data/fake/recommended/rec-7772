This place is just a fun place to go for lunch or a late afternoon snack.  The food is very good, but the desserts are wonderful. My wife and some of my friends had the type of very rich desserts which the Viennese are justly famous for.  As I have to be a little careful, I had the apfel strudel, which was also wonderful.  If you plan to come for lunch, you should check to make sure the museum is also open that day, as they have a very good collection of early 20th century Austrian art, especially the paintings by Gustav Klimt.
