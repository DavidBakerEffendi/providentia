I went for a late lunch yesterday.  Reservation for two at 2pm.  We both opted for the Tasting Menu, which is comprised of five courses of heaven for $48 per person.  Some of the dishes I had: sashimi-quality tuna, tender Maine skate, a chicken and ravioli dish, the amazing chocolate souffle.  The chef's canape, a tomato sorbet, was completely unexpected but flavorful and refreshing.  Also, the breads!  I had a slice of fig bread and tasted at least six others, including the garlic and the raisin.  My least favorite parts of the meal included the meringue and the asparagus sorbet.  Lunch was long, almost two hours.  The service was very good, attentive (almost too attentive?).  The portions were a good size because I had room to eat at least some of everything presented.  The decor is a little stuffy (floral chintz fabrics and antiques everywhere).  Still, highly recommended for a leisurely lunch.
