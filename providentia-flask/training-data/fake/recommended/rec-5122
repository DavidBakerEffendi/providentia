Seriously good soul food spot. It's a tiny place, but luckily the two of us came the day before Christmas and didn't have to wait. :) I couldn't believe how much meat I got with my hot chicken. I like spicy food, but I ordered it 'medium' hot. Shouldn't have worried, it wasn't too spicy at all, just really nice. You know, tingly. The Dark & Stormy cocktails were delicious and the others sounded great too. And everyone that worked here was so sweet. Thanks for keeping our shopping bag safe and sound after we left it there for an hour after we left!
