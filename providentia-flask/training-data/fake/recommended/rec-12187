I was excited to try Osteria because I am a huge Vetri fan, but sadly I was disappointed. To start the seating was uncomfortable because of how close in proximity the tables are to one another but that wouldnt have been a deal killer. Our server was super slow to greet & take our order even though the restaurant was not to capacity. The highlight was our antipasti of mozzerella in carrozza with olive oil poached pear & capers...delicious! The primi dish of porcini rotolo with parmigiano fonduto was good as well. For our Secondini dish my husband and I ordered the house aged rib eye "fiorentina" for two & it was one of the worst steaks I have ever eaten! Our server told us it was "marbeled" but 1/2 was literally gristle and fat!! We ordered it Med rare and I could not get my steak knife through it!!! I maybe ate 3 bites and filled myself with the turnip gratin. Then as a topper we were celebrating my husbands birthday which I had advised the hostess & the table next to us got a candle in their dessert and they forgot about my husbands!! The maitre de was apologetic and they brought a complimentary dessert but I was over it! Having worked in the biz I am understanding but for a $200 meal I expect at least good... Will not be going back!!
