we ended up here after hearing about the 40 minute wait at Sabrina's, and boy am I glad we didn't settle for that.  We walked right up to McCrossen's, were seated immediately outside, and enjoyed an amazing brunch on a beautiful Saturday.  everyone else got steak and eggs while I got french toast.  we all agreed this was our best meal in philly so far.  this was the best french toast of my life! topped with bananas foster and spiced rum syrup, absolutely delicious.  great service, great food, decent prices. o, and the waiters are cute too.
