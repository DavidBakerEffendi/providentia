Fantastic!  Nothing was just mediocre; literally every single thing was fantastic.  I tried the duck banh mi, three cheeses, chicken liver pate, homemade pretzels, quail egg toast, and seared flank steak (cooked perfectly).  All amazing.  Portions aren't large but it was enough for a few of us to share everything and walk out full.  Service was wonderful and they have a great wine selection, and a decent beer selection too!  They had my favorite beer on tap - Palm.   I had made a reservation for 6 of us on a Tuesday night and it didn't even seem necessary, though it got comfortably crowded.  We sat in the lounge area and it was like our own private party.  Very lovely place, I will absolutely be back.
