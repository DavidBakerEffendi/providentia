This place is perfect for a pre-theatre dinner. Even though it was restaurant week we decided to not go off that menu. They had a special that night of seafood ravioli, so I went with that and very happy with it. It was delish. It was crazy busy so our waitress wasn't the best, but we made do. As we were finishing up one of the managers came over and offered us fresh cookies from the oven. He was so excited about it, and he almost dumped the entire tray of cookies in my friends lap, but it was a friendly gesture and the manager was really fun. Next time I visit I will definitely try this place again.
