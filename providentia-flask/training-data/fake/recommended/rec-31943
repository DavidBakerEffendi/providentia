Once I walked in, I was immediately awed by the decor. The interior was similar to an upscale Asian restaurant (in some ways gave off the same feeling as a Tao or Hakkasan), but with affordable prices. The light fixtures and the sculptures gave it character. The place is dimly lit and nice which makes it perfect for a nice date. There is sometimes a bit of a wait but it's never too bad. The food is also pretty good. We ordered the pad thai, yellow curry, and duck dish. The food was pretty standard thai food. I would say I prefer Wondee Siam close by because the food is more flavorful and you know it's authentic because it's run by nice Thai ladies and more of the mom and pop shop. But Room Service definitely gives you more of that wow factor.
