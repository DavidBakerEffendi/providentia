Out of all the places I've dined at in Brooklyn and the city, Testo wins the award for best Italian restaurant (in my heart). Testo is small, relaxed, and has an undeniable charm. Service is always perfect. All of the workers of Testo do their jobs really well. The front of house staff is always warm and casual yet attentive. The kitchen never takes long to get the simple, delicious Italian fare to the table. Out of any Italian restaurant, I've never been so blown away by the consistency of perfectly cooked pasta dishes. My favorites are the Bucatini All'amatriciana, Rigatoni Con Funghi E Caprino with the rich, creamy gorgonzola sauce, and the ever-changing pasta dishes on their specials board. Prices are unbeatable for the quality and flavor of the dishes. It's one of my favorite restaurants in NYC, and I'm so thankful to have it in my neighborhood!
