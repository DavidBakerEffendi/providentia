I've ate here twice.  Once for Dinner on a weekday night, and once for a late brunch.  Both times I was blown away at how good the food was. When my friend and I arrived for her BDay dinner, it was late, maybe an hour before they were about to close.  It was pretty deserted for besides a few people at the bar and maybe one or two other tables.  Nice atmosphere, has that old time feel, black and white tiled floors, dark wood, adorned just so that it was hard to tell it was the original architecture or intentional. We split the seafood civeche special, hanger steak, and artichoke fricassee.  All totally delicious. We topped it off with Doughnuts and Ice Cream and the Steamed Lemon Cake.  That's pretty much the moment we died and went to heaven.  It was hands down, one of the best meals I had in the Burg.   Another time, my friends and I went for a late brunch/lunch.  I had the Braised Short Rib sandwich.  Yo... seriously... it was amazingness in your mouth.  Too big to pick up in eat, so I learned, I rec using a fork and knife.   I read some of these other reviews... my advice I guess is don't go at peak times.  I never had a problem with the service.  I actually had the same guy both times and he remembered me.
