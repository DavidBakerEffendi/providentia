Their berkshire pork katsu is great.  The cabbage and sauce is pretty good and their tonkatsu sauce tastes great as well.  It is a bit pricier than more low-key joints like Donburiya, but it's a nice treat when you're in the mood for some delicious katsu.  As an aside, being able to crush your own sesame seeds is a fun plus as well.
