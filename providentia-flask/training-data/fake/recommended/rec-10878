Brunch review This place was great!  I called earlier in the week to get a reservation and they were nice enough to work with me so that my group could get in for brunch.  Our original time of 1pm wasn't available, but 12:30 was as long as we were out by 2pm b/c they already had a group for the table.  Worked out great b/c their brunch special is for 1.5 hours of drinks and an entree for $25.   Also, props to the manager, he came over and offered us a place at the bar (5 of us) b/c we were still sitting at the table a bit past 2pm finishing payment.  That was great customer service on his part, and I appreciated it! The food was great!  We all had 4 different brunch items and one off the regular menu, and everyone loved their food.  I recommend the "divorce eggs" vs. the Huevos Rancheros, two sauces vs. one!   We had mimosas and bloody mary's and these were the best bloody's I've had in NYC for brunch.  A bit of spice, and rimmed with spice, salt and lime!  sooo tasty! Get to this place for Brunch!
