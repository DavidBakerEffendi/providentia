Great decor. Tasty food. No strange ingredients (i.e. pineapple in the panang curry that I had at another Manhattan "Thai" restaurant). Spice level was good, neither too mild nor unbearable. Everything tasted freshly made, and cooked to order. You could really taste the different layers of spice in the panang curry, and since panang is my favorite curry, I think this is a really really good restaurant. The prices were also very reasonable.
