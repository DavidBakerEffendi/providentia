Okay first off, IF YOU NEED TO ORDER WATER, DO NOT ORDER STILL/BOTTLED WATER -- it's like friggin $5.00 for a bottle.  Suck it up, drink tap water, add a lemon to sanitize it if you're a germaphobe! Second of all, came here for Sunday brunch to mix things up a bit.  We ordered the octopus which was a little charred to me.  I ordered the grilled chicken wrap which I thought could have used a bit more flavor.  The chicken itself was a little bland and the the tzatziki sauce didn't help much either. Ended the meal with two desserts: a walnut cake with walnut ice cream which was good.  The ice cream was actually really enticing!  The other was a baklava-like dessert called galaktoboureko.  I remember this dessert as clear as day because it sounds like galactic burrito! *har har har*
