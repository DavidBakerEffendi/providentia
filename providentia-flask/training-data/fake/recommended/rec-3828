This place is very unassuming. At first glance you won't think much of it, but the food is really fantastic. It is thoughtfully prepared, every spice, salt, oil. Every dish is made with love, and when you meet the chef who regularly comes out to mingle with guests, you'll see it in his eyes. I've been there a few times, and have ordered in, and it has never failed. Their martinis are always 2 for 1 and strong (can't beat it), the house one is a ginger martini and delish. Service is attentive and friendly. The cuisine is North African, and French, nothing too too exciting on the menu, but definitely makes you wanna go 'hmm I want that, or maybe that, or wait, I think I want this'. My go tos are the fried calamar and truffle mac n' cheese. My last venture was for the seafood risotto (overflowing with shrimp, mussels, calamari, and lobster) and my other had the lobster entree. They were cooked to perfection, not rubbery, not raw, each bite of the risotto more heavenly than the previous. We shared the mac 'n cheese made with truffle oil. Man that thing is sin in a bowl. Me thought a bowl would not satisfy one, much less two of us, but it is decadent and guilty enough. On a dirty night, I will finish it myself, watch. Without dessert, a meal such as this will run you an average of Â $30-$40 pp. Good for a date night, or comfy hug on a plate night.
