I'm from Detroit and wanted to have lunch with a friend in New York while I was in town. Didn't want a corporate or chain place so I checked Yelp for what's good in my area. Saw a lot of good ratings for this place so decided to check it out. The decor was off the chain. Clean, open floor plan. Food options were on point. Lots of beverages, snacks, buffet, soup, sushi, wraps etc. The staff - eh not so much. My friend ordered a turkey club sandwich. Simple enough right? It took him four times to order this sandwich and two chefs to ask him what he wanted. It got to the point where the chef walked away from me and my friend. So I said "Hey bro...turkey sandwich + bacon. It's F1...can we make this happen" the second chef looked so confused and stood there for a good two minutes staring at the menu trying to figure out what we ordered. Finally the big chef says "Hey we don't have any cold turkey lunch meat - just sliced and warm is that okay" - this is a five minute experience which should have been about 45 seconds. We get our food - which was decent, and my friend ended up getting exactly what he asked for. The place was nice. It would get a higer rating from me if the chefs knew how to communicate a little better. Also - I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The menu had a "HOT" warning. Yo - let me tell you I could have fed that thing to a baby and the baby probably would have laughed at me and said "this wrap is weak man" That's all! -adotdubble
