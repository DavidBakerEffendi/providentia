Best BBQ in the area - very friendly staff, tasty meat, reasonable prices - take-out is the easiest, but there are some tables inside and out.  I recommend the whole chicken, ribs, or pulled pork.  Don't forget to ask for extra BBQ sauce (they sell bottles of it), a side order of hush puppies, and some pecan pie for dessert if you still have room.
