This place was recommended to me by everyone at work...and I loved it. The noise level is high, but I'm sure that's only because of the bar. The atmosphere is cozy and the wood burning ovens smell delicious. I had an amazing glass of Riesling with Tilapia, and actually tried their bread (which was so worth it because of the parmesan). Our waitress was very friendly and competent, I will definitely be going back.
