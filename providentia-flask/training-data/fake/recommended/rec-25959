This is a cute little bar in West Village that's open late!  My boyfriend and I came here after a long night drinking/partying in Meatpacking for New Year's Eve and it was the perfect spot for munchies.  The place was full but we managed to score a couple seats at the bar.  They have a small simple burger menu but at that time of night, you it's best that we didn't have to make too many decisions.  We had the chili burger, the BLT and fries and it was delicious! The chili was a great add on to the burger and you also can't go wrong with fries.  It definitely hit the spot. May have to bring some other friends along next time!
