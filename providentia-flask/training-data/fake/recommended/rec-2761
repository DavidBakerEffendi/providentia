Definitely make a reservation - they are a bit quirky about reservations even when they appear to have open tables. The ambience is wonderful yet different depending on the room you're seated in or if you are fortunate enough to sit on the outside patio looking over the pond and sculptures. My mom and I started lunch with a review of the drink menu listing a variety of unique elixirs and cocktails settling on a pear honeysuckle martini and a tigers blood cocktail with blood orange infused vodka. For lunch I chose the pastrami sandwich on Russian black bread. I could taste the essence of the pastrami, celery slaw and whole grain mustard before I even took my first bite. It was served with with a mustard potato salad and a crispy green garlic pickle. Mom chose a traditional Cobb salad that was beautiful and fresh with terrific apple wood bacon as garnish. For dessert we shared the sugar doughnuts served with a berry dip, Nutella and vanilla custard. All aspects of the food were great-appearance, texture and above all the flavor. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable and prices were higher than an everyday lunch but a very special treat we will be sharing again very soon.
