In town for the week on business. Stopped in here for taco Tuesday. 5 tacos for 4.99, what a deal!  I went with the pollo option. Chicken, onion, and cilantro. Awesome flavor, and the salsa bar was a excellent compliment to the tacos.     Service was fast, and the food was hot.  Would for sure eat here again.
