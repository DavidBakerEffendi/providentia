I've been to Rangoon any number of times and it wasn't until I recently ate at a Burmese place in Maryland that I thought to myself, "Man, you should probably write a review!" I'll level with you.  Before Rangoon, I never had a favorite spot in Chinatown.  I used to eat at Ho Sai Gai and a handful of other places.  After trying Rangoon, I stopped bothering.  Weird, I know, but here's the thing.  SEPA is inundated with decent Chinese options so you can get the food anywhere.  Burmese, on the other hand... So, first the good.  I've never had a bad meal whether I was starting with Thousand Layer Bread or skipping right to an entree.  Jungle anything is killer.  Mango anything is awesome.  The soup is great.  The location is stellar.  Now, the not so good.  They charge a corkage fee which is crazy high, the minimum amount required to use your credit card sometimes makes it difficult if you're eating alone, and some of the sauces are a bit sweeter than I would like. Mostly though, I miss this place tremendously and wish they'd open a satellite location in North Carolina.
