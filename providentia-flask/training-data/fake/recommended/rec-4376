This is a cute little place. However, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not so great. I'm not a big fan of their sushi or sashimi. The spicy salmon rolls are pretty good (the spicy mayo they use is awesome) but I feel like their sushi rolls are really small in comparison to other places that I go to. I spent $7 on peppered tuna and was given two very tiny little pieces of fish. It was pretty disappointing. I've gone in for a quick lunch and it's good in a pinch since it's close to home. The staff are always very friendly and someone is always right there to help you if you need something. It's a nice, relaxed atmosphere. Every time I've gone in, the staff are sharing a shift meal together and whatever they're eating always looks so good. Their tapioca thai tea is delicious. Also, the pepper chicken dish is worth trying.
