A little gem for raw foods and juicing...I have been using this place on and off for couple of months as my method to lose weight (recently diagnosed as suffering from a slow metabolism due to a slow thyroid) and so far seems to be the only thing working for me.  The juicing, although a bit pricey for my wallet $7 for 16 oz, if I am not mistaken, but still go because of the quality.  Juice is as raw and as natural as it comes and the raw soup is simply amazing although I ask they do not put cayenne pepper on it.  The onions and herbs? make it spicy enough and delicious.  I am not a health nut by any mean but try to eat healthy whenever the opportunity comes and this is a great place to have around for that.  I only wish they would add labels identifying the ingredients for the juices and the soups so one knows the ingredients being consumed.  I'd much rather get these items here than at Whole Foods.  Way better!!
