Time for a reality check friends.  I admire the ambition but please keep in mind that you are not in Manhattan and 80s nouvelle cuisine is over.  A glass of wine should have a lot of wine in it.  Two flowers on a spoon do not an amuse bouche make.  And four tortellone do not make a meal.  The food is good but the presentation is über precious.  This is Gowanus Brooklyn and we want to EAT and DRINK.  We do, sort of, next door at Littleneck.  Next time, please feed me, OK?
