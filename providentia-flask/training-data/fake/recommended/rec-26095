So we went there for dinner on Friday night after about half hour deciding where to eat.  It was a wise decision; this place reminds me of being in my tropical paradise.  The decor is simple and cozy and with lively Samba playing but not overly intrusive, the atmosphere gives a feeling of being in Sao Paulo.  Rafael greeted us with a pleasant smile, warm attitude and gave amazing service to boot.  He promptly brought our caipirinhas (8/10 more crushed lime would be nice), and freshly made cheese bread (10/10 absolutely incredible).  We ordered traditional Feijoada (black beans with pork) and shrimp Moqueca both served with white rice and greens and both were exceptional.  Having had the good fortune of visiting Brazil and enjoying their unique cuisine, this little place in Billysburg is truly worth the trip.
