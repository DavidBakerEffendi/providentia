Hubby and I ordered lunch from Larb Ubol yesterday and it was soooo good!! Had the crispy pork over rice (kao moo krob), stir fried flat rice noodles with bell pepper and egg (pad kee mao) with pork, and papaya salad (som tum) with avocado and tomato. The rice was even good, not dry and hard like it often is. All of the ingredients seemed high quality and freshly prepared and the flavors were spot on! Beware, though: we ordered the papaya salad at level 3 for spiciness and it was too hot for me. My hubby can take a lot more heat than I and it was almost too much for him; his nose was running like crazy so he was sniffling and tearing up all through lunch. The flavors were great, so I would get it again, but at a level 1 next time. The other 2 dishes were very mild--I don't think they're intended to be spicy--and no spiciness level was offered for them. Maybe that's because they're lunch specials, I'll have to check to see if that's the case for entree portions. This will be our new go-to Thai place, so I hope they stay consistently good! So many places are good once or twice and disappointing ever after :(
