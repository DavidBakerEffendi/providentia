I really wanted to give a four or five star review, but I'm afraid average is the best I can say about the place.  We ordered the Chicken Parm and the Chicken Picatta.  They were both good, though nothing to write home about.   I will say that their food is a very good value for the money and I would definately go back to try other things on the menu the next time I am in the area.
