I'm so happy that I decided to go to Brooklyn for dinner at this wonderful restaurant!  The service was great, but the best part of the day was the food!  We started with Bacalaitos (cod fish fritters) and the Mofongo with Chicarron (pork).  The bacalaitos were so delicious, with lots of cod fish in each fritter.  The Mofongo was amazing, I especially enjoyed the broth!!!  Definitely try it with the hot sauce to add a little kick to it.  The pork and plantains were perfectly mashed together and each spoonful had pork! We then ordered the Camarones Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) with rice and red beans and the Bistec Encebollado (steak with onions) with boiled yuca.  The shrimp were seasoned very well, and the rice and beans were perfectly cooked!  The steak and onions was a tasty dish, though I really loved the yuca!!! We ended with the Tres Leche topped with guava and it was the best!  The red and the white sangria are both delicious!  In fact, my friend ordered a pitcher to go so she could enjoy it at home later that evening!   I will be making the trip back to Brooklyn soon, I want to try every dish on their menu!
