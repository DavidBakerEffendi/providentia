The apps were disappointing -- we had the pitakia kaisarias and the meatballs, neither was impressive. The entree that I had -- the moussaka -- was very good. I'm giving three stars largely because we arrived late in the evening, yet even though we had plenty of time before closing, we were continually pestered to finish eating and leave. My partner and I were attempting to have an important personal conversation, and every five minutes a server would attempt to take our plates, and stood around visibly annoyed until we eventually left... 10 minutes to go until closing time! I understand that the staff wants to get home late in the evening. When I'm working, I do too. But I don't let it ruin everyone's else's night.
