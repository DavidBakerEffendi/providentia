This is an awesome custom sandwich shop squeezed very, very tightly into a standard-looking, narrow-isled bodega. There are soooo many (too many?) creative and eclectic sandwich options available, and they're cheap, good quality and made fast. We rubbed shoulders with the parade of hungry drunks at 3 a.m. to order the Joe Biden and the Pho #1 (cold) for $7 each. Both sandwiches were tasty, fresh and had character. Plus, its open 24 hours!
