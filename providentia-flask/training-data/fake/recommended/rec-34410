This place was so good that I ate here two nights in a row while in Burlington. I had the special, a Caprese pizza with arugula pesto and pine nuts. So good I had it twice. I also had an arugula salad. The first time, I added a half carafe of white wine and tiramisu, both of which were great. It was busy both nights, but didn't have trouble getting a table. Good beer selection, nice wait staff
