This is one of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Moderately priced entrees, a huge menu (with several pages of vegetarian options +++), and absolutely DELICIOUS food. I ordered a margarita, the vegetarian drunken noodles (medium spicy) , and the mango sticky rice for dessert. I was VERY happy with all of my choices.
