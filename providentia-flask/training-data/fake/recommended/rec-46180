Came here one afternoon for a cocktail and a bite before a show, when we couldn't get into _____  _____ .  Jamie suggested we come back for dinner later and we did.  By then, the place was filling up.  While the hostess was trying to find room for us, he recognized us and got us a table immediately.  We've been back again and again.  Try the diver scallops--the chef's a genius!
