We were in Philly on vacation recently and were told about Spasso by our hotel's concierge.  We took her up on the recommendation and were not disappointed.  I had the gnocchi with bolognese sauce and it was delicious with pillowy gnocchi, the way they should be made, not little hunks of tough flour like so many places try to pass off as gnocchi.  My husband had the seafood risotto and it was loaded with seafood.  The risotto was cooked well.  The portions were BIG and we couldn't eat everything.  We did save room to split a cannoli and it was the perfect end to the meal.  Service was good and the prices were reasonable.  We'll go back next time we're in the area.  In fact, we recommended it to a mother and daughter who were staying at our hotel.
