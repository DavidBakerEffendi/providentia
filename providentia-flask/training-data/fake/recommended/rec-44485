I've actually been to this place a couple of times. It is a sister restaurant of Maharlika so if you are looking for an authentic filipino food this place may be a little too fushion for you. Honestly I like the fact that it offers something different. Maharlika kinda confuses me sometimes because their menu is too different. What I like about Jeepney is its simple but not plain. The price is pretty reasonable and the sarsi soda actually took me way back to my childhood. A friend recommended the place and I have been recommending to friends also.
