Decent spot for an on-the-go, healthier option. Wide selection of pitas and salads (my personal fave is the rotisserie chicken club). It's been touched on below but the salads don't quite meet the 5 star rating flavor wise. Pitas and paninis will no doubt fill you up though! As for the staff, I've had some days when they are super friendly, and others when they are colder (or clearly forcing a smile). All in all not outstanding every time, but not off putting either.
