I've been frequenting Bedouin Tent since it was called Moustache. The food has always been fantastic, and I find after all these years I am never bored or disappointed by the menu.  The spinach pie is a staple quick cheap dinner for me.  I love the combo plate of 5 cold salads for $9 (spinach and chickpeas, labnah and beets are my favorites).  The green and sun dried tomato pitzas are divine, as is the lentil soup.  Their pitas are soft and fluffy, straight out of the oven.  They are cash only, but the food is fresh, cheap and fast.  The staff are very friendly.  They lose one star because they used to be BYOB but stopped allowing alcohol a few years ago, so now I mainly have lunch there or do take out.  Back when they were BYOB I had a couple birthday dinners there which were incredible--$20pp for an amazing spread of everything on the menu.
