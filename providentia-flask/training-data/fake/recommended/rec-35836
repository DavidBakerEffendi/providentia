I have been going Â I am in the meat business and always enjoy Chicago. I went to Gibby's and the 1st thing they did on a 7 pm reservation was put 4 people on a small table for 4 in the corner with no room . They actually had to ask the next table to get up so they could move the table to get one of us in the corner . Then the other person had a wall and couldn't move. We had to wait 20 mins for a suitable table.The steaks were average. The twice baked potatoe was over cooked . The king crab salad was doused in dressing and not much dressing . Gibby's wont see me next trip . This is Chicago . there are a 100 great choices , why suffer . On the positive side the Stone crab claws were great , The server fantastic .
