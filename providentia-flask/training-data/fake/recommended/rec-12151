Months after this quaint, neighborhood restaurant allowed me to take my engagement pictures at their tables, I finally had the chance to sit down down and enjoy a romantic, delightful meal here. Our waitress was so kind and knowledgeable about the menu, from oyster questions to wine questions she was spot on. We started with the oysters which was freshly shucked and great way to start the rest of our dining experience. Next we shared the Farfalle with mushrooms and blue cheese, though we are not a big blue cheese fan, you can tell and see the freshness and quality of the cheese when you walk into the door of the restaurant. The cheese case is open for guests to view. I was slightly disappointed that the lemon pasta dish was sold out, as this was my first choice. . Next we were dazzled with perfectly seared scallops and the skirt steak which was absolutely amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked, seasoned and came with freshly mashed turnips in an Au jus sauce. Really Amazing, Romantic, Quaint Place. Â We did experience a delay in the service as we had about an hour wait in between courses at one point but the waitress ended up comping a round of drinks to make up for it. :)
