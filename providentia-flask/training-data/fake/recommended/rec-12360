It was okay.  Too pricey for what we got.  I feel like it's a bit hit or miss here.  I enjoyed the food but was a bit underwhelmed.  With tip we spent nearly 70 dollars and only ordered two entrees...no drinks or dessert or appetizers.  I consider that $$$ not $$.   don't get me wrong, the food was good, just not good enough for what we spent.
