I used to be a regular, both during the day for the restaurant part, and at nights for the bar/nightclub. For the restaurant, this would be the only reason why I chose to give 2 stars instead of 1. The food is good, and their brews are good too. I would go back for during the day for the food. However, when it turns into the night scene, I have one thing to say. THE BARTENDERS ARE EXTREMELY RUDE. I'm not a bar business expert. However, according to what I have experienced in many bars that deal with huge crowds, this one is bad. One of the bartenders gave me such attitude and grief about me asking for a cocktail, and asking for a beer as well when he came back with that drink. He yelled at me, 'why are you telling me to get a beer NOW? You should have said that earlier' along with very rude body gestures. Are you kidding me?? As a customer, am I responsible for ordering everything at the same time? I guess that bar staff didn't realize more drinks mean more revenue, which directly means more tips. This was a while ago, so I hope the management is doing a better job at staff training since then.
