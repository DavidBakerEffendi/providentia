In hindsight, I probably wrote my last review for this place after a night out at Bar or something. The pizza here is decent, particularly the specialty slices, which alternate every day. I'm not a fan of New Haven style pizza, but the simple slices here are definitely the normal type of slice and they do the trick. 3.5 stars rounded up because they're usually open till midnight or so and the pizza comes out quick.
