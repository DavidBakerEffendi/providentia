Service was good and the salad I got was more than passable but not worthy of 5 stars. The interior is a bit dark which might be fun at night but could be better for a lunchtime meal. SItting outside would be great on a nice day of course. Music was great. I would not make a special trip out to this place but I did enjoy my lunch and if i have another meeting with my client nearby we will be here again for sure.
