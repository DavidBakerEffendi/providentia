Ate here on a Saturday morning at 8 AM in late August, the day the freshmen were moving into Princeton University. Weather was beautiful, Nassau Street was calm. Sat outdoors, I had PJ's special omelette (with vegetables) with pancakes, wife had eggs and pancakes. Pancakes were fluffy and dense. I had to stop after just a few bites, too much for me. I found the flavor to be ok, my wife loved them. Next time I'll order my omelette with potatoes and toast instead of pancakes. Service was excellent. I will definitely return.
