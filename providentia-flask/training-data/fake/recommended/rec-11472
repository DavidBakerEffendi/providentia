Let me preface this by saying only that I LOVE THIS BAR. With that said, I do not like the food here.  I used to love the sandwiches and shoestring fries, but now it seems that the ciabatta bread is way too dense and hard to balance the sandwich innards, which just get lost.  The fries are not as signature as they used to be.  The desserts were always a bit of a hit or miss for me, but when they had bread pudding a couple of years ago, I was a happy camper.  It was damn exquisite. What I love here is the beer selection, always local and on draft, and the atmosphere.  Although it's not my favorite food on the planet, you can't fuck with a decent hummus plate to go with those Pale Ales. And another thing - 3 bucks for a Lionshead?  Come on, man.  The stuff is piss-tastic at best.  I'll stick with whatever's in the 4-5 dolla range. I still give the place 4 stars, based on just the good times I've had as soon as I've stepped through the door.  For me, Johnny Brenda's exudes the very essence of what a Philly beer bar should aspire to be.  They just need to work on that little detail...you know - the fucking food.
