After hearing about Â Underdogs from several friends who work in the city and had checked it out during opening week... I decided to take a bike ride from the burbs on Saturday and see/taste for myself. I was happy to find that it was everything I had heard that it was. Unique. Inexpensive. Delicious. Super friendly environment. And MANY great sausage and hot dog sandwiches to choose from. I no longer think of a hot dog as simply a pork stick... But a canvas to express many different and unique flavors and the themes. From Italian to Mediterranean to Mexican flare. The only hard part was deciding which direction to go. Luckily the staff was extremely helpful in guiding me and explaining the menu and all of the different options (including a plethora of homemade dipping sauces for the perfectly cooked fries). Order the combo... comes with a drink and fries and is a great value. The owner even came over to see how I was enjoying everything... And then went on to tell me about the ingredients and the various local Philly businesses that supply them. I thought that was very cool. Especially for a place called "Underdogs" ;) I did hear that there can be a long line at lunch during the week... But that it moves fast and once you place your order, your food comes right up. I will be back soon!
