You can't go wrong when you choose a restaurant run by one of the Iron Chefs on the Food Network. Food and service were impeccable.  We chose to plot our own course through the tapas menu instead of the tasting menu.  The pork belly, meatballs and the serrano ham were our favorites among many. You will not be disappointed here.
