Sooooo good. I'm a vegetarian, so I was a little worried when I walked in. But down at the bottom of the board I saw the veg egg soup.  Deal! A steaming bowl showed up in front of me a few minutes later, I loaded it with hot spicy stuff, and devoured it. Really hit the spot.  For $5, it's a serious deal. No alcohol is served, but you can bring beer in from outside.
