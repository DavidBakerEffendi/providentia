This place was one of the better dining experiences I've ever had and reminds why I've been so excited to move back to the NYC restaurant scene. The service here was on point--not too in your face but they made sure we had everything we needed and were incredibly polite. The food here was of course the focal point--we got seven dishes: Spicy Tuna Sashimi--loved this dish: good portions, incredibly fresh fish and well seasoned however I liked better the Salmon Avocado Sashimi--we almost ordered seconds of this. Try this. You won't be sorry. Gyoza--this was the only weak dish of the night--I would skip this. Nothing special Pork Belly Yakitori--generous serving of pork belly and I loved the sauce. This might have been a tad bit overcooked for my taste but my friends loved it. Sea Urchin Scallops--tasted like the ocean, a bit too salty but still good nonetheless Garlic friend rice: hands down the best friend rice I've ever had. Sounded really boring on an otherwise exciting menu but I couldn't be happier we tried it. Perfectly balanced and rounded out the meal. Hakata Shabu Shabu--this was amazing. I was skeptical at first because it looked like they just put a big pile of raw veggies in front of me but I could not have been proven more wrong. The broth was perfect and cooked the veggies/meat perfectly. Do not leave this place without trying this. Overall the tab came to be a little over 30 bucks a person (not including tip), not bad! I would definitely recommend this place and am looking forward to going back many more times.
