The West End is my neighborhood, so I tend to hit up each local place that offers different types of food. There are no other Japanese places within walking distance, Ichiban is it. I like the ambience of this place. It's pretty typical sushi bar but it makes me feel cozy. The fish tank, however, terrifies me. Try not to make eye contact with the one monster fish while you're eating, otherwise you could potentially lose your whole appetite. And the food is only okay. I've never been totally dissatisfied here, but the sushi is not the greatest. The prices are pretty good for what you get, but if you're looking to get more bang for your buck, drive a little farther and try something else instead.
