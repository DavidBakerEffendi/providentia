This is the best NYC Restaurant Week experience I've had so far (dating back to 2012). The restaurant is much bigger inside than you'd expect from looking at its storefront. You enter through the bar and lounge, then you get to the main dining hall. There is also a dining area upstairs with a small bar. Dim lighting. Faint mirror walls. Shiny leather chairs and red tablecloths. Dress to impress. Handsome staff. Snob? Yeah a bit. Background music and chatter amplified by the high ceilings. Ambiance - it's all about it. The experience of sitting in such an ambient space precedes the food. You get to choose two appetizers which is a delightful difference from most restaurant week menus. The appetizers and entrees are about the same size - just so you adjust your expectations. The perk of dining in a group is that I get to sample a variety of plates. Appetizers Kale Fattoush - it's a BIG, delicious salad. Kale, pita, tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette. Lebanese style. Kibbe - aka steak tartar. Burghul (high fiber, protein as a Middle Eastern staple), onion, mint. Refreshing flavor. Done right. Hommus, Mouhamara, Falafel, Moujadara - let's sum it up - they were all good! Entrees Branzino - filleted, very small portioned, good for light meal Lamb and its side of cucumber yogurt was the scene stealer. Wow. I wasn't a fan of the restaurant week crowd, noise, and flashy cameras (the dark lighting here is far from ideal for food porn or selfies). However, it'd be great for awkward dates - too dark to see your date's face and too noisy to actually have a conversation. I'd love to return for their regular lunch/dinner menus. Reservation recommended.
