To sum it up: I prefer Shake Shack. I ordered a California Burger (plain burger with house-made American cheese, letttuce, tomato, and house sauce).  It was cooked to the medium-rare that I wanted, but it was the greasiest burger I've ever had.  Burgers should be greasy - so they taste good!  This was crazy, though.  I'm not sure if they cook it on a flattop with a lot of fat to keep it moist, but mine was just a mess.  I patted it down with my napkin like a weirdo.  I also was happy to see one of my favorite beers on tap - Allagash White - so I had a glass. The others at my table had the original and the Hatch.  They liked their burgers but weren't screaming in excitement.  The Hatch burger was a little on the red side.  They were extremely busy and our burgers came out fairly quickly, so it didn't surprise me that one was undercooked.  We wound up splitting the regular fries (no truffle), the sweet potato fries, and the onion rings.  The regular fries were pretty average - they may've needed another minute more in the fryer  The sweet potato fries were quite good, as were the onion rings (although I still prefer the rings at Royale).  Each table gets their trio of dipping sauces - some sort of Ranch (not my thing), a diablo sauce, and a garlic aioli.  They weren't as great as I had hoped, but combining the garlic aioli and diablo, I wound up with something I liked.  For appetizers, we got the pickle plate, (which included pickled okra!!!!), and one person got the market salad.  It was a great price for the size. The service was ok.  They were packed but also had more than enough staff to be a little more on top of things.  Maybe I'll come back again and see if they've imporoved.
