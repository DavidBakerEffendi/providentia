This was some of the worst service I've seen. Three people in my party of seven showed up and they made us wait outside for the others to come before seating us even though the restaurant was 75% empty. Â After being seated, the server took 40 minutes to bring out our food. We specifically asked for the food to be brought out as it was ready... Never coming back here again.
