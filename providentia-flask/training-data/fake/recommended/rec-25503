Never coming here again! We had party of 5 come here prior to a show at the Bushnell. It was a slow Tuesday night, with about 3 tables occupied in the entire restaurant. Our waiter initially was fantastic. Amicable and accommodating. We ordered 2 or 3 bottles of wine and all had pricy entrees. We allocated about 1.5 hours for dinner and shouldn't have had any issues. Our dinner didn't come out for at least an hour! We politely asked the waiter if the food was coming out soon since we had to catch a show in about 40 minutes. We had been sitting there for over an hour, with our orders placed. The waiters demeanor quickly changed to hostility and he actually rudely yelled at us saying why didn't we tell him about the show before. The food came out cold, basically thrown in front of us and the waiter never came back until bringing us the check. I think he expected that we would sit around all night on a slow Tuesday ordering bottles. When he realized that wasn't happening he became the rudest waiter ever encountered. This place just lost 5 customers.
