Hands down the BEST sandwiches within all surrounding towns. E.Rutherford, Carlstadt, Woodridge, N.Arlington, Lyndhurst..! Forest Dairy is a long time business and a hidden gem among some of the Â over priced more elaborate eateries on Park Ave. Great quality REAL bread and the cold cuts are always ice cold so fresh and the sandwiches are layered perfectly into a mile high portion! Home style good stuff!! Hungry yet!? Order ahead avoid a wait. Like mom would make!
