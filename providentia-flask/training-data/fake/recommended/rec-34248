Excellent pizza pie with very spicy but delicious pepperoni, if you like.  The grilled salmon salad is my favorite.  The waitresses are all extremely nice and service is quick. We eat here at least once a week and my friend, Tom, from Baltimore says Brother's pizza is the best, and he knows because he delivers for a national pizza chain!
