How do you define perfection?   Perfection is not when you close the deal and buy a Maserati with the bonus.  Perfection is doing not 1000 sit-ups every day for 4 years.  Perfection is most certainly not my so-called fiancé.  Perfection is a plate of perfectly cured prosciutto washed down with a glass of Barolo.  Perfection is a very helpful and knowledgeable staff with perfectly trimmed hair-cuts, although not as good as mine. Perfection is every experience I have had at Barbuto.
