Love this place! The drinks are good, the space is cozy and the servers are wonderful. I went on a Tuesday and ordered the guacamole and Panzita tacos and they were delicious! My friend and I were at our table for so long that the owner/manager moved us to the bar with a free offer of prosecco. Uhm ..SURE! LOL I'll definitely take my other friends here.
