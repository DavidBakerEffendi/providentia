Came here for a birthday dinner party in the downstairs dining room. The food and wine was stellar, and the atmosphere upstairs was nice and "rich person-busy." (As opposed to poor-person-busy which is more of a mob scene). I was glad I wasn't paying for my meal here because it's not a cheap place!
