I am not sure how authentic Colombia food can be but this is definitely NOT a good place to enjoy. Food was awful. I had Colombian Fritanga, o..my ...god, it was so hard to swallow them. They over fire them and very very dry. My friend's pork chops were way too hard and bland. I also ordered Virgin Frozen Coladas and it had too much whipped cream in it. Overall, i am not very happy about it. I don't think i will ever want to return.
