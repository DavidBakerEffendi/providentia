I enjoy going out to eat as much as anyone.......but last time I checked my surname isn't Rothschild, so I can appreciate an affordable meal without cooking it myself at home. Joya provides tasty Tai food and a decent ambiance at a third of the price you would pay to dine out in Â the city. Not to mention that one plate can easily serve two people. Dishes are generally under $10 and I recommend the: Shrimp Fried Rice $6.50 or Pad Tai $6.95 Our bill was under $50 for 4 ppl and I got to let someone else clean the dishes when we were done (sweeeeeet).
