Lovely place for a date, fresh delicious food and a charming atmosphere. Nice wine selection (for a neophyte anyway) and pretty reasonably priced as well, I'll definitely be back again. Sit in the back away from the bar if you can. The word is out and it can get extremely crowded on the weekends, get there early or snag an online reservation. Try the veal meatballs, and don't be afraid to splurge on a cheese plate, it will be well worth it.
