After a disappointing exp. at Geno's, my friend and I walked across the street to Pats.  Pat's didn't have any of the flash that Geno's has, but when they presented us our steak, mushroom and whiz sandwich, we knew we were in for a treat. Most townies told us that the best Philly Cheesesteaks are at the small, mom and pop joints, but for us, this was good enough.  The steak was overflowing from the sandwich, and call me crazy, but that cheez whiz really hit the spot on that sandwich.  In addition to the sandwich, we got some cheeze friez and a drink (like the excessive use of Z?  Zure you do). Overall- While I'm sure there are better Cheese steak places in Philly, by comparison to the other place across the street, this place gets the higher ranking.  Go Pats (the sandwich place, not the football team)! Chuck Norris Rating- Ridge Hand.... to the face!
