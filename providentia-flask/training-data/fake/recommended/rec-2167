I'm not a big fan of burgers unless they're made on the grill at a cook out (by my bf who makes the BEST burgers ever!), so take my opinion for what it's worth.  I recently made my way in here for a lunch with my boss.  He'd been there once before and LOVED it.  I don't recall the name of the burger I ordered, but it had caramelized onions and blue cheese on it.  It was very greasy - even the bun was oozing with grease.  I try to eat fairly healthy so the grease kind of turned me off.  It was yummy, I suppose...just messy!  I tried one of his fries dipped in the whipped parm spread and the spread was quite good.  I probably won't go back, but if you're a burger fiend, give it a shot...you'll probably love it!
