Halallllll!!!!!!! What I was looking forward to most during my trip to NY!  I stopped by with my brother after we watched a broadway show (around 10pm) and their was a good line in front of this little cart. However, they are very efficient because within 15 minutes, we got our food! My brother and I shared a chicken and rice plate because it's HUGE! This dish consists of an orangy yellow rice, lettuce, slices of pita bread, and pulled chicken. They have their white sauce and red sauce on the side of their cart for your own disposal, so make sure you GO HAM on that white sauce man!!! cover every inch! This definitely lived up to expectations.  SOSOSOSO cheap, especially given its size!  The chicken was so flavorful and tender!!! & that white sauce....its magical. Every component of this dish worked so perfectly together, its almost ridiculous. BEWARE of the red sauce tho! It is for the mighty. NEW YORK RESIDENTS, consider yourself very lucky. NEW YORK VISITORS, getcho self there ASAP.
