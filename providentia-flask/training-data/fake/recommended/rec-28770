Delicious smoked wings and you can't beat the bottomless chips and salsa at $1/pp. The margarita pitchers are a great choice and you can get about 6 servings out of them. They offer them in a variety of flavors - my favorites are blood orange and pomegranate. That's about all of the food I would get there. Three stars because my husband ordered a burger that still had the wax paper attached to it and my steak tacos had big chunks of fat still attached to the meat. We called the manager over who was kind and apologized. He comped both of our meals. The service can be a little slow but they get really packed. Overall it's a good spot for a few drinks and some light bar food.
