for the tourist..... I'd say. Steak is good quality but I prefer it chopped. Also Who the hell says "cheese steak wit"... seriously I am from Philly and moved to La 7 years ago. I have never in my life said cheese steak wit. I say what I want and cheese steak with fried onions. If you are around the downtown are or south philly, this is not the place to get a good steak sandwich unless it's after 2am and it is your only option then I would still go across the street to Pats. They are better and with less attitude.
