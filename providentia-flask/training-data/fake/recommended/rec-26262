Originally went to Fonda to grab dinner for restaurant week, but ended up at the bar because they didn't offer happy hour drink prices at the table. My friend and I had 3 drinks each and were we tipsy (they were strong)! The classic mojito and rosalita were sooo good. We decided to order the guacamole (spiciness level: medium). Freakin' darn good and only $6 during happy hour! Will definitely come again
