One of my favorite restaurants, great classic and innovative Italian dishes.  Service is excellent.  They used to be a Byo, they recently got their liquor license, the wine list and cocktails are very reasonably priced, when we went recently we brought a bottle of wine with us because we did not know that they now serve liquor and the happily opened our wine at no charge. Some of my favorites are the polenta with mushrooms, grand misto salad, risotto with tomato, smoked Mozzerella and red onions. I have never had a bad meal there and the desserts are great too.
