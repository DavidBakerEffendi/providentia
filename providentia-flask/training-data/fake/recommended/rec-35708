I have always loved Jose Garces' knack for unique and delicious cuisines throughout the city and I was recently able to experience Tinto. I made reservations for a friend and I on a rainy Wednesday and when we got there (around 8:30) we were seated almost immediately and greeted by our server. He was more then helpful - since it was our first time - and answered our questions in a professional (yet not rehearsed) manner. The food, while yes it's pricey, is ABSOLUTELY worth it. Small tapas plates come out however you want to order or course it for yourself. The mushrooms were spectacular as were the artichoke hearts - and I'm not even a big fan of artichokes. I STRONGLY recommend the organic chicken because the sauce it's served with is out of this world and the chicken literally melts in your mouth - that's how good it is. I don't know a whole about wine, but they do have quite an extensive list of wines - we had a nice Spanish Rioja. Definitely good with a group of people.
