This was one of the first pizza places I tried when moving to Clifton.  The pizza was pretty good (large cheese) maybe a 5 out of 10, but a definite improvement over some of the competitive pizza place in the Clifton area.   The place always seems busy, and seems very family friendly. The only reason we don't go that often is, sadly, the location, the traffic on Main Ave, and the fact that they do not take credit/debit cards.
