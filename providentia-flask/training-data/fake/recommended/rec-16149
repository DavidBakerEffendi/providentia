I came here with MOM for Mother's day. From the real apples that decorate the entrance, to the french style bathroom, the decor is very detailed and almost distracting of the food and conversation (this can be good or bad...). We had the 5 course pre-fix menu and the food was what I expected -very good. However, it was just very good. I will probably not remember what I ate one week from today... The whole experience was great, with excellent french service (don't expect many smiles or kindness). Â  The food itself does not justify coming here again, which I may or may not. TIPS- Visit the bathroom If you are crazy about Coffee have the expresso If you like chocolate, have the chocolate dessert.
