Had a Blackboard Eats for this place but realized the ScoutMob deal might be better. Check out before you go. We didn't order much variety but I can comment the stuffed flounder was very good. Not the best I've had and I'm unsure there was much crab meat but a good size portion and flavorful. I liked the capers as they added nice flavor. And the fish was cooked properly as sometimes it's overcooked and dry. The pinot grigio and the malbec glass options were also good. What not to get - the serrano ham $16 appetizer. I probably should have said something - but it was some thick cut, too fatty, lack of flavor ham and some slices of a dried salami. The ham really was not very good. I expected the ham to be cured and quite salty - not even salty enough to make me reach for my water glass. Everybody else's meals smelled great and looked great. There were ample servers (maybe a few too many) but I was brought extra plates of complimentary bread when i asked and my water was continuously refilled. Solid neighborhood spot.
