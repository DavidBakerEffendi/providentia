I was really happy to learn that peppe rosso to go would finally open a larger restaurant. Located in a sea of little italy tourist traps, this restaurant is definitely a neighborhood gem. The restaurant provides a simple intimate decor and to be honest for the prices of their pasta, one really can't complain. We dined as a group of 6 and were easily accommodated. The one dish that you must order is the RIGATONI. If you are on a budget and looking for cheap italian fare that comes with good food and a quaint environment, I'd recommend this place.
