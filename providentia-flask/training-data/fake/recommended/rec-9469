Wow! The BEST Peruvian chicken EVER! I Â love the rice too. The beans were eh. We were a group of 5 and we ordered 1 and a half chicken with two sides and beans and rice and it was plenty! Couldn't eat more! We also ordered the chicken and vegetable soup, which had full pieces of chicken with bone so if you don't want to pick through your food, don't order it. It was also just ok. I mean the roasted chicken was so flavorful that it made all chicken bland! The green chili sauce was also sooo good. The chicken empanadas where also really good but like I said, it was WAY too much food for 5 people. The atmosphere was also really nice and the decor modern. My only complaint to management is: we were seated right at the entrance and apparently this is where all the staff hangs out. On both side of the booths we were at there were waiters/management on their phones texting and playing games. I know lunch is slower but we're trying to enjoy our lunch and having people on both sides of us was kinda weird!
