Went around noon on a Sunday during Memorial Day weekend, 2013.  Sat outside. Ordered something that amounted to eggs benedict with mushrooms, with a side of turkey sausage, and french pressed coffee.   Service was good -  attentive and friendly.   Coffee came out first.  Under brewed.  Brown in color.  Poached eggs were undercooked, barely.  Eggs were atop what seemed like an english muffin, which was not toasted, and chewy :-P   Turkey sausage, in silver dollar form, tasted funny.  Everything was tepid, except for the iced water. I didn't mention anything to service.  I don't think they asked. It's a nice space, and their coffee options are great.  I hope they get better at execution of food and drink.
