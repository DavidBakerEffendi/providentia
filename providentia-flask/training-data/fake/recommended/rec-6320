Only went to the bar at Rat's, but what a funky place! Middle eastern or Indian influenced decor inside, a western American theme on the exterior, with a French menu... sounds off, but it works. GORGEOUS garden lined with blooming flowers, a pond, art & sculptures. Romantic. Rat's really a find, I was not expecting it to be there. So different from the nearby restaurants in Central NJ. Happy hour is definitely a steal. The menu is a bit expensive for the area. A must go to during the summer months. Sit outside on their patio. Love it.
