My wife and I went there with such great expectations. She had done a lot of research, trying to surprise me for a romantic night-out. She had read many reviews and was raving about this place while we were driving. Every one was saying how outstanding the food was and giving it thumbs up for decor and service. Our experience was not as good as what we expected. the tuna was dry and the taste of humus outdid the tuna flavor. One of the plates was supposed to be with a duck liver, but if you do not mention that you really want the duck liver, they substitute with a shrimp and charge you $10 extra on top of the already overpriced plates. The chocolate deserts we opted for were blatant and dry. When I complained about the additional charge, the waiter did not even return with an explanation. So, in conclusion, the place gets 5 stars for decor, 3 stars for service and 2 stars for food.
