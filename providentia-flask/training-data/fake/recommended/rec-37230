Enjoyed a tasty and quick breakfast here yesterday. We were sat immediately (yay!). The booth we were sat at was clean and or server came by right away to take our drink orders. Total wait time for food was maybe 7 mins, that's awesome since there was a full house. The food was yummy, I had scrambled eggs w/cheese and bacon on the side and also wheat toast. My husband had eggs over-medium with sausage and rye toast. Diced potatoes were also served with each meal. My eggs were awesome but my bacon was ok. Not the thick like I like. I had a bite of the sausage and it was yummy. Overall I would recommend this place for a tasty and quick breakfast. Total time spent from start to finish 35 min.
