They manage to strike the ideal balance between dive-y appeal (cheap beer and shot specials, round-the-clock dimness) and a friendly, almost-family-like atmo.   Case in point, our daytime bartender (whose name I did not ask, bad reviewer!) took the time to point out the "healthy" items on the 'Vous expansive menu when I lamented my pudgy state.  Drinking beer at 3pm has nothing to do with this, thank you. Advised that the turkey was roasted in-house every day and not some lunchmeat drivel, my girlfriend and I ordered a behemoth house salad topped with said bird, a cheese-lidded crock of onion soup and a huge plate of their criminally crisp Spanish waffle fries gilded with chopped jalapenos and onions, all very thoroughly coated in more cheese. Of the three items, only the onion soup disappointed -- it was like licking a beef bouillon cube.  Otherwise, the grub was tops -- and cheeeep.
