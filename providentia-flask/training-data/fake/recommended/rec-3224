I had my birthday dinner at this restaurant and the food was delicious! Â I had a steak medium rare cooked to perfection! The crab cakes seemed to be popular as all my guests ordered it! The service was great, and the restaurant itself is beautiful! The staff was very accommodating to my large dinner party, and the server was prompt with everyone's needs! Definitely a restaurant I would recommend and visit again !
