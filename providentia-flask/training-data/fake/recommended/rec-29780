overall, not bad the octopus appetizer is to die for and honestly, probably would be the main reason i'd go back. sheep's milk dumplings were also very good, but they must've been sitting for a while because they weren't that warm when they came out. the lamb burger is pretty forgettable, which is sad since i love lamb. service is atrocious. that's the major negative to this place. they also seated us in the dungeon (aka basement) even though there were open tables on the main floor.
