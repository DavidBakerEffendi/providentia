This food was hella good (and yes I just used hella). We ordered 3 Arepas, one was the pulled pork (the best), second was the ground beef with cheese, and the third was just a cheese arepa and that was too much food for two people. All that and 2 lemonades we spent $25. Going back a second time I will know how to order to make it waaaay cheaper :) The only reason that I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the waitress looked at me like I had 9 heads when I walked in (strange), and when we asked her what she recommended she couldn't really say (major language barrier). But that's whatever. The food was delicious and seemed authentic, but I suppose I wouldn't really know, because I'm from Alaska..... not Venezuela. All in all I'll totally go back.
