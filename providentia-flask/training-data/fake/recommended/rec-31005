Every plate I ordered I couldnt get enough of from the cheese to start out to oysters with strawberries soo good. But I have to warn u goin in as two u easily get seated way too close to another couple and the server I had was mediocre. But bein able to hear the entire conversation of the couple next too u on a tuesday when its practicly empty. Seriously open another section or dont be so lazy to give up a table for four n do the extra clearing. That made me angry. But the food was good so the experience was all n all about three stars.
