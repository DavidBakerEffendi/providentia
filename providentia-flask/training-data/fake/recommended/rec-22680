Been here twice for dinner. Last time there I had the fried chicken and it was okay. First time I had the rice and egg dish and it was very good. I'll definitely get this again. I had several of the veggie apps and a couple of salads & enjoyed all. I've had the Old Fashion & Moscow Mule cocktails & both were very good. The space is nice, staff is friendly and I'll be back again.
