I usually do not write a positive review for restaurants but I wanted to write a small piece of comment about PT in williamsburg. PT has been one of my favorite places for dining out for quite some time. When I dine out, I look for quality food, quality service, and atmosphere. PT has it all. I love the food, atmosphere, friendly service and many more that PT offers. They have lobster pasta, which is my favorite (highly recommend). It is somewhat spicy but perfect for my taste. Their red wines can be perfect pairing! Also, their price is more than reasonable. Keep up the good work, PT.
