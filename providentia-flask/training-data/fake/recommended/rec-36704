I wish I had an outta park experience @ Riverpark - but it was just A-OK. Everyone has an off night here and there -  this night was "salty" -  on many levels. The  cocoa pasta w pork ragu - was promising but salty.  The flatiron steak (was a missorder) and was salty.  the side potatoes - you guessed it, salty.  Its tough be so brutal when service was superb  - (manager Richardo was very accomodating).  There were some highlights however:  avocado hamachi (amazing starter),  drunken pear cocktail - (very refreshing), and the highlight of the evening: porkchops  (oh so good - thanks Corinne for the tip!)  the espresso mouse, cheesecake and gelato trio was also  a hit. Ambiance was amazing and overall experience was fine.  Would Tom Collichio think it was Top Chef worthly?  Not tonight.
