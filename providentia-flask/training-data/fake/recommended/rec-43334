Fresh roll was really good although expensive and portion is small. Pad thai was better than other Thai restaurants around but wasn't exceptional One thing I found really strange was they don't have chopsticks... Noodle without chopsticks???? It was a nightmare eating Pad thai with a fork... especially since the noodles were cut short
