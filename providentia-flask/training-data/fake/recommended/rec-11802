Tuesday Night, 8pm. PACKED. What on earth? Waited 40min-1hour before we got a table, but drank some of their amazing sangria (get this!) while waiting. Nice intimate setting. Very nice servers. The place is small, so I'd probably put your name down and take a walk around the area and go back (it was too cold when I went). 2 recommendations: squid in squid ink (ask for bread!) and lamb skewers. YUM. Will be back to eat the rest of the menu.
