Wow, look all all these reviews!!! It's true! Joe's is amazing! It's been about a month now since I visited Joe's Shanghai ans I still can't get over the incredible meal I had there. I've been to plenty of Chinese establishments in San Fran and LA and NOTHING compares to Joe's soup dumplings. If you are ever in NYC, please make it a must and stop by Joe's . You will not be disappointed. Oh, make sure you have patience to wait for a long time (during holidays/weekends) especially if you're with a large group. I waited about Â 2 hours. Trust me, its sooooo worth the wait. :)
