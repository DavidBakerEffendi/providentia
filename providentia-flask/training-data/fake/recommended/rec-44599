Food was good, authentic. Average if you compare it to your mom or grandma's cooking. Reasonably priced, good and REALLY fast service. I was happy about the latter. Now let's talk about two of their desserts. We got a halo-halo and the leche flan (which i have to admit is a bit embarrassing, but wth). Though generous, the halo-halo wasnt anything special. The flan though, on the other hand, is another story. Great consistency and texture, which i think are two key things that you have to get right if you're serving leche flan. It was really, really good! I say, when in doubt, just get it. It's worth it.
