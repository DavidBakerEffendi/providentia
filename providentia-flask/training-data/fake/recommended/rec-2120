Huge disapointment. Some locals took me here to experience "The best or at least the most famous cheese steak is South Philly". I hope it is not the best because if it means trying anything worse I am done with the experience. As for it being most famous this is more likely as this place is lit up like a traveling carnival where you pay a ridiculous amount but still feel cheap after the experience. Geno's serves up three items: a steak sandwich with a choice of three cheeses, fries and sodas. So as specialists, one would expect something a little special. The steak is sliced, not chopped, flavorless and not seasoned. The sprinkled diced grilled onions added upon request don't add enough to the taste. If you want really bland go for the provolone, you won't notice it is there.       Oddly the worst cheese ever, American, is a step up. Finally the whiz, probably not an actual cheese, provides the gooey messy textures one might expect but the combined flavors again are absent. $7+ for sandwich $4+ for small cup of cheese fries + soda = $15. to sit out side underneath a white neon canopy. While we were eating, the nearby insect zapper stayed busy and the bugs continued to meet an unsatisfying fate while I dined.   I don't ever not finish my food. This once,  I left a quarter of my sandwich not because I was full or bloated, but instead I was bored and lost my appetite while eating.         If you have to go here, do not say "please" and/or "thank you" while placing your order. I was not pleased to fork out 15 bucks or thankful to have digested this bland "comfort food." Philly cheese steak, At least this Philly cheese steak is not a must have, must experience to appeciate the local flavor and culture type of thing... At least not this  cheese steak.
