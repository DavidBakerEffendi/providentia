I went here on an Epic Burrito Quest; which is to say that I was on a quest for an Epic Burrito, not that the quest was epic (thanks, Yelp!). I found an Epic Burrito. After a seven-hour drive (ugh, New Jersey traffic), I was hungry. Polished off the entirety of my veggie burrito. It was tasty - the black beans weren't mushy or overly wet, which can kill the texture of a burrito. The veggies were way fresh and props to them for using romaine instead of iceberg lettuce! Everything was seasoned and cooked well. The wrap job was halfway between 16-year old white girl (just order a bowl if you see one behind a counter) and licensed Mexican Burittoist. I dug sitting at the counter looking out the window. There was a dog looking back at me. A DJ was spinning some techno, a nice touch, though I probably wouldn't want to try to have an Intimate Conversation with that going on.
