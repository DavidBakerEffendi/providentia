Super nice friendly staff..... They really overdose on some of the things, the collards were really vinegary. Like I was drinking vinegar juice. Literally!!! The chicken with mushroom gravy was good.... But the chicken and pancakes is something that they think people will eat the whole  thing. I ate a piece of the pancake. My eyes are bigger than my stomach so ditched  the pancakes. I guess it would recommend the place
