Fresh!  Really great sandwiches.  Fresh, crispy bread.  Fresh cilantro.  Great choice for vegetarians (tofu/fake chicken/pork/or duck).  The counter people are always very nice.  And you'll have room for ice cream, right next door at Van Leeuwen's.  What a great Saturday afternoon in BK.  You're welcome.
