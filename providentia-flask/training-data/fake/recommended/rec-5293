I've been in love with the continental for many many years. While I think the food quality and taste has declined, the specialty drinks are always fun! And as long as you're drinking the food is still solid. I love the cheesesteak eggrolls, the calamari salad, the pad Thai. If you want something a little more decadent go with the lobster mac & cheese. I recommend this place for cocktail hour and apps.
