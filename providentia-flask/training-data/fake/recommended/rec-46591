I live in Israel for a year and became a snob about Israeli food -- I try all the Israeli food I can find, hoping I'll find something worth eating again, and am almost always disappointed.  I finally succeed with Zahav.  This was one of the best meals I've ever had, and certainly the best Israeli food I've had outside of Israel. To be fair, most of the food is not "authentic" Israeli food, but food with an Israeli spin or flavor.  Everything we had was delicious, fresh and interesting. The hummus, lafah (middle easter flat bread) and many of the salads are very authentic.  The hummus is probably the best hummus I've ever had. I'm a vegetarian, and there were plenty of vegetarian options. We did the tasting menu, which was a great way to sample many different dishes. The plates are small, but there was so much as part of the tasting that we ended up taking a couple of things home. The service was excellent -- the staff checked up on us without being annoying about it.  I always drink a ton of water, and my glass was never empty.
