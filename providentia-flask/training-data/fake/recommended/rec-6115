They call it intimate - I call it cramped They call it small plates - I call it small portions They call it wow! - I ask HOW!?! May be I am biased - but I found this place to be overhyped- and hype is the only reason, it attracts such great crowd ~ which is probably the best part about this place. I found the food to be just meh! When I order a pesto di noci, I expect something that tastes like basil - or look remotely green? Expecting too much? Well, it wasn't even close to what I expected. The vino brûlé I ordered won't qualify as my favorite drink either. The bread had butter oozing out of it - in proportions that I don't fancy! I did like the selection of fromage, though. Short list but flavors were sharp. Eventually, it's all about the food and I thought it didn't quite match up. P.S. I did NOT click any pictures - because the small-plates-place does not give you enough elbow room to even slice your bread. Clicking a picture is way out of question.
