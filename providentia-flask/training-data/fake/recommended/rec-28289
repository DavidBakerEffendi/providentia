Have been looking forward to eating here since I heard about their plans to open. It's so hard to find good cajun/creole in NY, it was exciting to know we'd have one in the neighborhood. It did not disappoint. Went here with a large group (9 people) last night and the service, despite being a rather full house otherwise, was terrific. This was a welcome change from a lot of new restaurants in Astoria that offer great food but seem to forget the service portion of their business. Started at the bar for a pint of Abita on tap, then ordered the Sazerac, which was perfectly mixed. For appetizers, the Boudain balls both pork and crawfish were very tasty, and while I preferred the pork, I've got no complaints for either. I had the broiled shrimp, which was deliciously spicy and cooked perfectly. The beans and rice side the right complement to it. There was also a little salad on the side. Bites of the buttermilk fried chicken was also a treat. I could possibly see people feeling portions might be small, but for me they were perfect. Desserts ordered were the chess pie and Dump cake. Two bites of the chess pie were enough for me, very sweet--as it is supposed to be--but those who wanted it seemed to enjoy it. The dump cake should not be missed though, can't think of anything I've had that comes close to it. The decor is absolutely beautiful. Fun without being precious. Nothing has been overlooked, it's a comfortable, welcoming space. As a prior reviewer noted, even the bathroom is terrific and worth a trip! Very much looking forward to getting back again.
