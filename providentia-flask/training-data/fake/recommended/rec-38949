When you've had enough of all of that Vermont farm-to-table/organic/sustainable jazz, Al's is the place to go.  You gotta love a place that sells fries (sorry, I mean frys) by the quart.  Especially when they're as wickedly perfect as Al's frys.  They serve hot dogs and some other fast food items here, too, but for me it's really all about the hamburgers, the fries, and the shakes, all of which are ridiculously inexpensive and ridiculously good (in that roadside diner/'50s throwback kind of way).  Ask for lettuce and tomato with your hamburger and they're served to you in the cutest plastic baggie.
