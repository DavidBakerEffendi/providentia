Love this place. The empanadas and the arepas are amazing. All flavors are good. The only downside is the wait. Since the restaurant is so small, you'll have to wait in line for 20-25 minutes even if there is only 2 couples in front of you. If it's not too cold out, I would highly recommend waiting it out.
