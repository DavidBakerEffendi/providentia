Agreeing with those who said that this is pretty good for what it is - a chain restaurant in an airport and the airport is Newark. Once you're through security, the choices narrow and even more so with the pre-9/11 design of Newark airport's terminal A where each concourse of a dozen gates has its own security line. So you can't really have a decent variety and they also can't have the usual knives and whatnot. The healthiest choice on the menu looked like the broiled tuna sandwich and it was pretty good. With two sides, I decided to cancel out any healthiness by going with the waffle fries (yum!) and the cole slaw (not much mayo - good!). I polished off the plate. My waiter was an interesting character. It was clear that his mind isn't on the job and he delivered his "welcome to Phillips" and "it's been a pleasure serving you" with no real enthusiasm or passion. Not that waiters should be passionate about serving, but hey, at least fake it better. There are power outlets under the seats and no one seemed to mind me sitting for an hour after my meal was gone. While it's paid wifi in the airport, my phone tethering worked perfectly fine.
