After going here many times over the years and always finding it excellent we were disappointed recently when visiting for the first time since the new owner took over.  The main dishes were still excellently prepared and delicious but the appetizers were not very good (calamari & corrozza).  The service was spotty and weird at first but got better towards the finish.  While the decor has changed I would not say for the better.
