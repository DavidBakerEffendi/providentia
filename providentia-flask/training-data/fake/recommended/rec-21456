400 reviews of this place? Why not one more.  First time I have ever been here.  We went before heading to a Flyers game.  I've actually sampled some of their BBQ at the Phillies Gary Maddox BBQ Challenge last year.  So I sort of knew what I was getting into. We started out with the chips and house made salsa.  Yay on the traditional salsa, nay on the salsa verde.  Wasn't digging the flavors.  Dos Segundos has the best in the city and they are right down the street if you are in need of the green.  We also got the chicken nachos with black beans.  The cheese sauce and the chicken were good.  The chips were seasoned and very tasty.  I'd order it again and could have easily been enough for a meal between the two of us. The girlfriend and I ordered both "The Chronic".  Delicious pulled pork topped with some of the cheesiest mac and cheese you will find and jalapeno bread crumbs.  It also comes with some tasty fresh cut fries, lightly seasoned.  The sandwich itself is worth the draw here alone.  It's messy, so bring your napkins.  The only thing it could have used more was BBQ sauce. The service while good, wasn't exactly friendly.  I always appreciate smiles and general enthusiasm.  Perhaps she was just having a bad day. Also if you can't stand hipsters, I wouldn't recommend going here.  You can cut the pretentiousness in the air with a knife here.  Yuck.
