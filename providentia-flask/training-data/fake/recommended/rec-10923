This was the first stop for my friends from Chicago when they got off the plane. We needed a hearty meal with a modern twist. The Brooklyn Star did not fail to deliver. First - you must order the cornbread. It will take some time to reach the table, because they are always made fresh - but your patience will be rewarded. Secondly - with mixology, and drinks being the current big thing in Brooklyn, you will appreciate the breadth of the bar options. For those who prefer lighter fair: The beer list is small, but compliments most preferences. Lastly, the ambiance is top notch. The Motown tunes play at the perfect level, and add that little extra something to the meal. I will be returning here sooner rather than later.
