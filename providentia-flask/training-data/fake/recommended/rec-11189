This is definitely my favorite music venue / bar in all of Philadelphia, bar none!  I don't live anywhere near here, but it feels like my neighborhood place.  I want to move to fishtown so I can walk here! The food is good (what I've had so far), the beer also, and the musical venue upstairs has unbelievable acoustics. It's intimate and can accommodate a variety of different acts.  They don't blow out your eardrums either, so you can actually still hear when you go home.  There's al fresco dining, and I'm a fan of most places with outdoor dining. It's a totally comfortable place, welcoming of all people.  It might seem to cater to hipsters, but really, a nerd like me can even have fun there.
