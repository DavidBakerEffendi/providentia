This place is amazing. I have no complaints whatsoever. At first glance, it seems like you are walking into someone's apartment. Once you enter the interior is very nice. I went on a Friday night with no reservations, but they were still able to seat us fairly quickly. Our waiter Jeremy was great. He was very attentive and fun. I definitely recommend the sangria it was delicious and strong! Down to the dishes. Lamb meatballs... So flavorful and delicious! Fried goat cheese balls with lavender honey... I have one word for this dish.... Crack... We had 2 orders of this deliciousness Foie gras Au Torchon. Really good, but then again I don't see how you can mess up foie gras... Braised short rib was very tender and delicious Â  Crispy Brussels sprouts. I never liked Brussels sprouts, they would not be my first choice of vegetables, but I definitely enjoyed this dish. I don't remember what dessert we got, but it was amazing. I definitely recommend checking this little gem out. I'll definitely be back
