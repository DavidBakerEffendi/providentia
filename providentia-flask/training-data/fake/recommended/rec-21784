We found Juventino while aimlessly wandering around Park Slope, far too early apparently, as most stores didn't open until 11am on a Sunday. All in all, this is a great spot - definite recommendation to friends visiting NY. Very fresh, open space with natural light. I was a little put off by the standoff-ish attitude from the staff, but the smell of freshly pressed coffee was enough to keep me smiling. --- On the table and in my belly: HUEVOS RANCHEROS - eggs over easy with mama's REAL home-made tortillas, heirloom beans, 3 salsas COUNTRY POACHED EGGS - Â wilted greens, apricot-chipotle chicken broth, country loaf bread, sesame, watermelon radish and roasted garlic cloves --- I have nothing but praise for both dishes and wish I could bring it back to Vancouver to show some brunch places here how it's really done. Keep on, keep on, Juventino. You're on my hit list for next time.
