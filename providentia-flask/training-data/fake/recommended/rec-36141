It was my girlfriend's Bday and after all the hype I was convinced this was the spot for dinner. Well, Not Really! Once we got there my first thought was where are we going to sit? The place was overcrowded and loud! They brought us to our table that needed to be moved out so one of us could sit. During dinner I couldn't help to notice it was an older french speaking crowd which was fine, but I expected a bit more diversity downtown. The food was ok but not sure I will spend that kind of money to go there again.
