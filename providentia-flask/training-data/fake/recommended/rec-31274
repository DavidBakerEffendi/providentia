Went here during the middle of the week for lunch and it was not full, so I don't know what this place is like when it's bustling (i.e. food quality, service, etc.) What I can speak to, is the food! I had a delicious brussels sprout/yogurt/raisin appetizer which is served with pita bread (which may sound kind of "ick") but it was sweet, savory, delicious, and definitely something that was worth it and I crave it even now! I had a salad, which was also good (hey, it's a salad--it can't be too terrible). You can ask for the dressing on the side, which I might suggest because they put a bit much on mine. Portions were generous--I had to share the brussels sprout dish, and even then we didn't finish it. The salad was also very sizeable, and I wasn't able to finish it (which is saying something, because I can pack my food away quite nicely). Would love to go again, if I had the money. Definitely a bit pricey. Ambiance was good, and I would love to treat my family to a nice restaurant like this. Professional service, even if they asked me too many times if everything was okay.
