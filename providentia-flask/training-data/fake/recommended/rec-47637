Hands down, THE BEST pizza I have ever had! The unique crust is something I could never get enough of. I also love the ambience of the original restaurant in new haven. Waiting in line for a table, the Italian beers and local birch beer, and quick, polite service. And just as they say, the wait is worth the amazing pizza they produce every, single time.
