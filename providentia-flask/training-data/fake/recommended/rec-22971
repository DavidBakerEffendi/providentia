A couple of weeks ago I visited Stone Soup for the second and final time. The first time I went, I got a bowl of bland soup  that was over $7. A bowl of good soup at an order-at-the-counter place should cost $5 (see New Moon and Red Onion, great soup). I was right to be weary of the pay-per-pound buffet - my boyfriend got a plate of food with normal dinner portions and it was at least $15. Not sure if the price is posted as it is at other hot bars (or if they don't subtract the weight of the plate?) but it just seemed outrageous for the amount of food. I don't know why this place is so expensive, you're not paying for service because you bus your own table and what not. It's not 100% local or anything. They don't have vegan or gluten free baked goods (or perhaps 1 item out of a dozen). And the food is just okay, easily replicated or made better in the comfort of one's own home. I'm at a loss. So -2 stars for the price. -1 another star because the second time I went, trying to give this place another chance, something bad happened. The hummus, folks. I tasted a bit and then laughed out loud because it was so beyond bland. Hummus is supposed to have tahini, lemon juice, you know FLAVOR. Pretty sure this was just puréed chickpeas from a can. A place that specializes in vegetarian fare can't do hummus? For shame, Stone Soup. For shame.
