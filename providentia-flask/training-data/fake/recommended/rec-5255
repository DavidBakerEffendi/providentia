Tip Top is in a cool building in White River Junction, the inside is cozy and nice casual, though there is no bar.  Service was attentive, and efficient.   Now for the food - bread service was a couple of slices of baguette or something white, couldn't tell cause when they sliced it they seemed to have squashed it.  It was nice that it was warm though, and the melted butter was a nice touch.  Wine was a bit overpriced I thought, and the malbec I ordered was on the too warm side.  Had a bowl of the tomato bisque, mediocre at best.  Entrees were: Sesame ginger meatloaf for the hubby, it was good, he was surprised that he liked it as much as he did.  A slice of meatloaf, grilled, and served atop mashed potatoes, and sauced.  It was pleasant, but kind of also weird that it could have been a slice of grilled tuna, and you would have a little hard time identifying.  But good.  I had the special, Venison, osso buco.  The meat was tough, it could have used another 1 1/2 hour simmering.  Osso buco should be meltingly unctuous, and this was kind of dry and tough.  The sauce helped a little, and the rapini and mashed potatoes were good.  For dessert was the caramel bread pudding, I do not recommend getting this.  It was rubbery, and very dense.  Too bad cause I was looking forward to it.   So in conclussion, Tip Top is hit or miss, ok corner bistro, but choose from the menu wisely.
