This place was awesome!  Delicously fresh omlettes, good mimosas and cozy atmosphere.  Only about a half hour wait for 2 at prime time on a Sunday which wasn't too bad.  The service was fast once we were seated too which was great.  I definitely want to come back.  I had an egg white omlette with fresh spinach and mushrooms, sourdough toast (which I love and can't get many places it seems) and really good potatos (not too greasy or spicy).  Wash it down with a few mimosas and you've got the perfect Sunday brunch :)  Will def be going back for more brunch and maybe some dinner soon!
