This is my favorite restaurant in new york city. I truly love this place. The lamb shank is huge and juicy, the lamb chops is to die for, and the saganaki tou merakli (three greek cheese melted in pot) is amazing. Words truly cannot describe how much I love this place. The service here is very nice. My only problem with this place is that the bus boys do not seem to understand the word no. They keep on asking me if I am done with my food and when I say no they come back every 2 minutes and they ask me again. This has happened to me 2-3 times and it is very annoying. I wish they would stop. Anyways you need to come here and try this place out once. You wont be disappointed.
