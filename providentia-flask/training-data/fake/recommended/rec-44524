Finally got to try this place and I would say it's a must-go! The beef bulgogi sandwich and fries were amazing. Their secret green sauce is super addicting. I would go back regularly for the fries and try the other sandwiches, too. The Viet coffee was decent. Lastly, Â I loved the interior of this place. It's a small spot but it was comfortable for groups of 2-4.
