I could only speak for the brunch.  It was quiet at the time we went.  Not sure why as I think this place is probably rocking during dinner time.  I've been here for dinner years ago but certainly wasn't memorable as this signature brunch dish I've tried recently. Signature dish - Spicy Duck Burger - a hearty burger that you must try....comes with cheese, avocado and spicy fries...all elements I love to complete a burger.  Forget the beef, go for the duck! Forget the donuts - Stanton Social does it better!
