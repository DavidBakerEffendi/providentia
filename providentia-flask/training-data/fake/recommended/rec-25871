A serious favorite, my wife left her own review a couple months back. You'll definitely want a reservation if you're not going in the middle of the week (and don't get upset if you still have to wait a little bit, it's worth it). The space is small and it can be a little noisy, but this family run restaurant makes my favorite Italian food in all of NYC. The meatballs are huge and delicious, reserve some if dining late as they run out towards the mid/end of the evening.
