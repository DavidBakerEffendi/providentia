Service was excellent, very friendly and the owner even asked if everything was good as we were eating. Great service and quick. The food was very good, got a Bi Bim Bab for lunch with beef and all of the vegetables with sesame oil and teriyaki sauce. Very good, I recommend getting the raw egg with the meal in a stone bowl. Stone bowl keeps everything hot until the last bit. Great place for lunch.
