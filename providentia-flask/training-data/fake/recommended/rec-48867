Had brunch here with two friends. We had a long wait and it was longer than they actually estimated. We waited outside because the bar was so crowded but on the other hand, the vibe of the restaurant was fun and busy. When we were eventually seated, our waiter was attentive and helpful with recommendations. I ordered the ranchero scramble which was awesome. Another friend enjoyed her burger, cooked perfectly. Besides the wait, which wasn't unexpected, this was a great meal.
