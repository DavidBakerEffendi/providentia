Yuca Bar is definitely one of my favorite restaurant/bars in the city! The sangrias are the best I've had in NY and they're strong! The mojito and yuca sunrise are also amazing. You definitely get your money's worth. As for the food, it's amazing as well. The platano relleno is a must have! Other favorites are the arepas, tuna ceviche, croquetes de cangrejo, the fish tacos and of course, yuca fries. The restaurant service is okay, but the bartenders are awesome, especially Carlos. This is the restaurant that always bring my visitors to. If you like good food, drinks and music, this is the place to be in The East Village!
