The food here is amazing. Look at the photos and you can see examples of the amazing food. Â  What really turned me on was the customer service. I'm new around this area and the owner could tell I was a little lost walking in. Told him I had a long day work and I need something good, after a few questions to me he got me the Kani salad and the "pain in the ass" roll. Both were amazing!!!! I couldn't really tell you what's in the dishes, quite frankly it was all amazing. I can't wait to go back and try other items!
