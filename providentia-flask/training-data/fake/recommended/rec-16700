I tried getting into Little Owl and because there weren't any tables available, a VERY friendly man (that worked there) asked me if I wanted him to call their sister restaurant Market Table.  I was a little surprised because a) I had no clue that they had the same owner b) I had tried getting a reservation there initially and they were fully booked.  Low and behold, they had a open table - I'm assuming it was a cancellation so all five of us trekked on over.  The place was very similar to Little Owl - warm, cozy, somewhere you would want to sit and enjoy yourself for a while.  The servers were really accommodating and friendly - he even helped to steer us in the right direction and everything we ordered was AMAZING and then some!  Another great restaurant I can tell my friends and family to go to - If you haven't tried it - I highly recommend doing so :)
