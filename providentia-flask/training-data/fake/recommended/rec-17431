great little place..first time trying peruvian food and definitely wasn't disappointed! very surprised by the flavor of everything. i really hate cilantro, but even though most of the dishes i had contained cilantro (and it wasn't really masked), they made it work. had the chicharron de pescado starter - delcious! fish was perfect, not too dry and the quinoa crust was delicious. for the lunch combo i had the quinoa-crusted oyster po' boy. flavor was great, but to be honest, didn't really taste oyster whatsoever. aguadito de pollo (their twist on chicken and rice soup) was so flavorful and delcious. again, the cilantro flavor was definitely present, but the overall flavor was so good. the staff was very kind and explained the dishes as i had never had peruvian food before. will definitely go back to try out some other recommended dishes. tres leches cake was a disappointment, but overall the meal and experience here was great!
