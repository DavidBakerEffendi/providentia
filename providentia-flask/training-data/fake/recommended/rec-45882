This is the healthiest most delicious food in Bayonne right now- so psyched about that. Finally, a healthy option! Great for vegetarians and non veg. Wraps, salads, dinners, coffee, tea, juice- Five star food for a great price. $10 for most wraps. This is uo there with some of the best food I've ever eaten. The Chef was Bill Clinton's personal chef post bypass! I almost gave AP 4.5 stars bc sometimes there is a wait, since the owner is pretty much the only one working there, making everything to order. I changed my mind, because it is without a doubt a 5 star place, it's impossible for me to rate it less than that. It's totally worth any wait- just be sure you have the time to enjoy this wonderful place. :)
