Reliable and well executed, classic Italian food at Luigi's. I have eaten dinner at Luigi's about a half a dozen times and always leave satisfied. Luigi's is classy inside, yet not uncomfortable, and is the perfect place for any occasion. The menu is traditional and there are always plenty of specials. There is a full bar and the service is always top notch. Luigi himself is a good guy. Be sure to check out the key to Morris Plains and newspaper article on your way in. Luigi was recognized by the borough for risking his own life to save a stranger involved in a serious car crash on Route 10 back in 2008.   nj.com/morristown/index.…
