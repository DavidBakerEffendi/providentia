If you're looking for a nice homey meal in Philly look no further than Giorgio's. This cozy BYOB Italian spot is the bomb. The pasta is delicious, the portions are huge, and who doesn't love a bowl of olive oil soaking giant cloves of garlic ? I do! Plus, you've just got to respect a restauranteur who's out there on floor when things are busy, not schmoozing Â with customers but actually taking care of them. That's right, Giorgio himself set our table. I felt as though he invited us to his casa for cena. He is a class act, through and through. Mi piace Giorgio!!
