Good Lord do I love Southern cooking. Even if Rex 1516 served mediocre Southern cuisine, I'd consider it a welcome addition to the Philadelphia dining scene. To their credit, they go far beyond that - they serve great drinks and great food in a super-cute little spot, with incredibly reasonable prices to boot. It was a warm evening so my dining companion and I both went with seasonal cocktails - I had a Southside, and in honor of the Kentucky Derby my friend ordered a mint julep. Both were excellent and the bartender seems to really know his stuff - I was impressed with the drinks list. Also in honor of the Kentucky Derby, the restaurant was offering a special on the mint julep - it came with an appetizer portion of fried okra with some kind of jalapeno dip. As my dining companion was recovering from a long-standing hangover, he was quite happy to begin the meal with some delicious fried snacks! Neither of us could decide among the many delicious entrees, so we decided to order two and share them. It was a brilliant idea, and I'd recommend either of our picks! The first was the 12 oz rib-eye steak served with caramelized onions and a demi-glace. It is normally served with creamed spinach, but they were able to substitute grits that were on offer as a side with one of the evening's specials - soooo good. In fact, I'd recommend asking them for grits with anything you are ordering. The other was a roasted pork loin stuffed with cornbread and served with collards. I initially found the collard greens a bit too sour (I have never been a fan of them) but by the end of dinner had cleaned my plate - consider me a convert! The dessert menu looked incredible, but alas we were too full to attempt a final course. I'm planning to return to check it out, hopefully next time I will manage to save a little room!
