I'm sorry to everyone that loves this place in advance for the one star.  My experience here was at the end of Oct. 2007 so maybe things have changed....I'm a nice person...I really am and it would take a lot for me to give a place 1 star, but here's my two cents. This place looks cute, has a friendly atmosphere, and I was totally digging the organic take on the food.   BUT here's when organic/environmentally friendly crosses the line for me.... I was enjoying a nice overpriced dinner with a guest.  We thought for the price the food is just okay, we've had much better elsewhere.  I had salmon and he had a fillet.  We were seated downstairs, and towards the end of our dinner I see IT.  What is IT you ask?   A HUGE cockroach the size of half my hand crawling up and down the wall above my friends head!  HOLY CRAP I told him to get up because it was crawling towards him.  The two of us stood up away from our table and just stared at it not knowing what to do.  We called the waitress over and told her dude you have a fat ass cockroach crawling on your wall.  By then the cockroach had walked up the wall into the shelf where they stored all the glass cups.  So it was in there mingling with all your cups.  The cups are also placed upside down so I'm sure it touched all the rims.  She apologizes to us and that's it...nothing...we didn't get our dinner comp-ed...we didn't get a discount...and the kicker... NO ONE WASHED THE CUPS where the cockroach walked all over... What are they trying to do?  Conserve water?!  I think in this case it would've been okay to not save the earth for the sake of sanitation.
