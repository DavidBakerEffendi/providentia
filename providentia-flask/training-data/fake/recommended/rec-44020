Loved this place. The shrimp lemon grass soup was awesome! The crab Rangoon wontons were good but not in the top tier of others I have had, but very unique flavor. It's nice and quiet. They leave a pitcher of water on the table which is nice for spicy lovers like me. The jungle chicken was great and was a big portion. They serve their soda out of cans ; ( so no free refills on tap. But overall a great experience.
