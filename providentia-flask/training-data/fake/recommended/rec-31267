I almost don't want to review this place because I want to keep it all to myself! Came here for my friends birthday and we were able to have all of upstairs to ourselves. I ordered the basil fried rice...ugh so good, it has shrimp as the protein just FYI. They are big juicy shrimp too. My husband had the duck noodles and he didn't stop talking about it until the next day. They also have a really good mixture if specialty drinks. Highly recommend.
