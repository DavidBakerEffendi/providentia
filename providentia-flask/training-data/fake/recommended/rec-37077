I've been here 3 times. Now let me say this ; I work at a bar myself, and I live just around the corner. One week last month, I brought friends and customers out to this bar for four nighhts in a row....we spent well over $200 each night. And then the fifth night, after the bouncer is super nice and by the way, he's the best thing about this bar!...I put cash on the bar after they have totaled up our tab - and we had already left tip. Â THEN. They changed the amount of the check. TWICE! After we had left our money. We obliged. But decided never to come back. The next week my girlfriend tries to treat me to a nightcap there, and I reluctantly agree, and! The same thing happens, they give us the bill - we put down cash, and they come back and change the price and up charge us. This time, we don't tip. And we don't come back. This place has no sense of hospitality or loyalty to its regulars. At all.
