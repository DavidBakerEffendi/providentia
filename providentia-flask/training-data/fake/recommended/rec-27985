Unless I didn't realize this is a raw foods restaurant, I don't think I'd eat here again. Onion rings that were more like soggy gummy funnel cakes, a spartan tomato salad topped with very rare, but not sushi grade salmon. A veggie burger the precise consistency of a fish cake (that repeated like Seinfeld after leaving the Wishing Well.) The hovery service disappeared like smoke when we sent our raw doughy onion rings back. Amazing, 2 orders of onion rings somehow shrank into one order after we sent them back. FYI-perhaps second time I ever sent anything back. Totally not worth the money. Â Decent bar and beer selection but it would be nice to get some edible food in this neighborhood. I blame the changing demographics of Philly kitchens for the massive fail on simple things like cooking fish or onion rings.
