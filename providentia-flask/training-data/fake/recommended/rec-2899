I visited this spot for my first time 2 days ago and had a thoroughly enjoyable time.  It was a Monday, so there was an ample amount of room to sit.  Nice bar, dark and cozy.  The bathroom was clean and maintained.  Our server was very good, she was attentive and made sure to check on us an unobtrusive but appropriate amount of times, and quickly brought out our food and drink.  The beer selection left a little to be desired, they were out of 2 beers I tried to order and nothing terribly exciting. As a vegetarian, I am impressed when a place makes their own seitan, which they do here.  I chose the Chicken Fried Seitan, with mushroom gravy, broccoli, and fries.  Sadly, this isn't vegan and can't be made vegan, which is a bummer for someone trying to transition, but I went with it anyway.  I am happy I did.  The gravy was creamy with small slivers of fresh cooked mushroom, the broccoli perfectly steamed, and the fries were on the smallish side and easier to eat with a fork but tasty and well cooked.  The 2 fried seitan patties were awesome!  The coating was crisp and mild flavored and the patties themselves were thick and hearty.  Just the right consistency for seitan, firm in between a chicken and pork texture.  Really a great main feature on an entree. I'll be returning here for sure, and fellow vegetarians should check this one out.
