The food was blah. I finished my shrimp salad (which shouldve had avocado but I only saw a cube) because I was hungry and the only thing on the menu that wasn't fried or drowned on cheese.  My husband Ordered the chipotle wings with Mexican chorizo and was highly disappointed. The wings didn't have chipotle sauce and the chorizo was dry and burnt.  On the plus side, the Nachos and salsa were great!  The $10 carafe of white sangria was yum.  I would only go back for their drink specials and the chips and salsa. This is definitely not the best Mexican in northern jersey.  Oh, the bartender was very nice.
