I like my coffee strong and can most likely consider myself a coffee snob. This isn't my top neighborhood coffee place BUT it's definitely a spot I would recommend. I have brought out-of-town friends here before, as well. The space is perfect for people watching, very relaxed (for groups or individuals just looking for quiet time to study). Very nice service and clean (despite of its rustic grungy feel). It is inexpensive coffee and just an overall, good experience. I would recommend any coffee option on their list.
