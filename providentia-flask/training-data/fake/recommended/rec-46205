As a kid growing up in Brooklyn in the 1960's, my father brought my sisters and me here dozens and dozens of times.  For the Spumoni.  Amazingly, we never came for the pizza.   As an adult, I continued to come for the Spumoni.  One day (about 30 years ago) when a Spumoni craving hit, I decided to try the pizza everyone around me was eating.  OMG!  What had I been missing all those years.  Just one of the best pizzas I had ever had.   And I have been back here about once every two months ever since.  (I live in Jersey now).  If this place only had Spumoni I would give it five stars.  I would also give the pizza five stars without considering desert.  Pizza followed by Spumoni is a not to be missed experience.
