I read the reviews, expected long lines, but still didn't expect the line that I saw! I was leaving after giving up when I decided to ask if there was seating for 1 at the bar since I was alone..and that worked. I ordered a pizza w/fresh garlic and a beer..it was pretty satisfying. I like how you can watch the guys work on the dough and make the pizzas by the window. I walked this meal off by making it across the Brooklyn Bridge..another great to-do list item!
