We love German Restaurants, and try them out wherever we go.  We have been here 3 times, trying to give this place a chance to shine.   Unfortunately, the food has never been anything more than average.   There is always a big crowd here, and it is a fun, loud crowd to go drinking with.  The beer selection is Excellent, and embodies the spirit of a good German bar.  This in itself, earned this place an extra star. The food has never been more than a 2, unfortunately.  We have had the wienershnitzel, rouladen, and sausage platters.  None have been great, and the sides of dumplings and spatzel also were very average.   I can see the appeal that this place holds for the neighborhood.  Lots of regulars, lots of friends, and lots of beer.  For that, it succeeds.  But for authentic German food, it is just average.
