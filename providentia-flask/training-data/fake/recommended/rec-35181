The only thing good about this place is that the food was ok. Service was absolutely terrible and shitty, blatantly ignoring customers requests, never came and cleaned the table or refilled water, we had to ask for checks even though when they walked by multiple times, they could clearly see we were done. When we asked for check, he even ignored us first then handed it with an attitude. We gave them bad tips , they even chased us out of the restaurant to ask for money...they deserved no tips whatsoever, and they should feel lucky we even tipped them.
