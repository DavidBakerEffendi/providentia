Giving Miya's a bad review is futile. The truth is that the owner gave sushi a good name. Miya's is a staple of New Haven, and certainly Yale off-campus dining. The rolls are exotic and the place is packed on weekends (no reservations for small parties). The service is "wacky" and are known to bring out sushi presents (or pitchers) for their many friends. That said, they disappear. Once my waiter returned only to sake bomb with another table while we were waiting on him for the check. The sushi's all right. There are a few stand-out rolls, and after sampling a few, you'll find the one that fits your palate. The late-night rolls are a steal--a grab bag of chef's choice and leftovers (available in vegetarian and not). They usually comp a Tokyo Fro appetizer on us, which I suppose is because it's not very tasty (but it IS fried). I'm not crazy about their signature pumpkin miso soup, and I'm a big miso fan. As another veggie, I admire Miya's (and Bun Lai) for their forward stance on sustainable practices and for engagement with the community. I don't know of another restaurant with such camaraderie and goodwill, so +2 for that. The veg rolls are standard. The classic rolls are more filling than the specialty rolls (usually eight pieces compared to four). I recommend the spicy broccoli. For what it's worth, I prefer the privacy of Samurai on College St. over the hubbub of Miya's. But if you can snag a table (closed Sundays and Mondays), Miya's is a must while in New Haven. A truly unique experience.
