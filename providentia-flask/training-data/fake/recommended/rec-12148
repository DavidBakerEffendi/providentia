For the past 3 years, my now fiance and I make it a point to go on one upscale date each month.  Now entering our 30th date night, I can say that Zahav had far and away the greatest service and hospitality.  From the moment we walked in until the moment we stepped out into the cold, Philadelphia weather, we were treated like royalty.  Having known it was our anniversary via a phone confirmation for the reservation, we were treated to champagne and appetizers on the house.  Our server, Gabriel, was highly knowledgeable about the wines and foods and even let us sample several before making our selection.  The hummus and appetizer dishes are outstanding, the meze were unbelievable, and the main dishes are mouth-watering.  And even though you'll be on the verge of bursting from eating so much delicious food, you've got to try the desserts.  The bread pudding was out of this world.  Do yourself a favor and make a reservation soon (as other users mention, they fill up very fast!).
