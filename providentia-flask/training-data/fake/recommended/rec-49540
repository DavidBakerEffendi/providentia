This place is lovely. Such a great restaurant-from the decor to the food to the service. Came here with Â friends on Tuesday night at 7.30 with no reservation. We sit immediately. We ordered 4 types of risotto to share and all 4 were delicious!! I'm from Italy and I'm a risotto- lover and I have to say that it was authentic! I really like the Amarone and Montenerone risotto. Absolutely TO.DIE.FOR. Very tasty. Second place: Funghi misti risotto. It was full of mushrooms. I loved it! Also Pere/Taleggio and Basilico/Pecorino were great and tasty. Tiramisu' and chocolate cake were also great! My friend ordered Sbrisolona but she did not like it much. I recommend Tiramisu'. Interestingly, they also sell their own rice and they have Vialone Nano, my favorite rice to make risotto. This place is a must go restaurant and I will definitely come back to try other kinds of risotto!
