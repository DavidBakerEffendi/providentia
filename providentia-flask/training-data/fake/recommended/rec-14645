4 words. DAMN THAT'S GOOD CORN! The corn here is downright amazing. Probably the best corn I've ever eaten in my life. I would definitely come back here just for the corn. The Cuban sandwich is also really good here. It's the perfect amount of juiciness and size. You definitely don't feel like they're skimping on the meat in the sandwich but at the same time it isn't so overstuffed that there's no way to possibly eat it cleanly. But there are downsides to this place and it's tragic because none of the downsides are food-related. The wait here is terrible. The place is pretty small and almost makes you feel like you're actually in Cuba. I'm sure that kind of atmosphere is great if you're actually in Cuba. But we're not. This is Manhattan and there are a lot of people here. Maybe it's better to come here with less people because I came with 6 other people and we had to split into two groups in order to get a seat. The people here are also not the greatest staff in the world. They all look like they love working here but they don't really seem to care enough about the customers. It kind of feels like the waitresses come here to hang out instead of coming here to work. But I just want to emphasize how amazing the food here is. The food is amazing and it's definitely worth going to at least once. I would definitely come back here...with maybe just one other friend.
