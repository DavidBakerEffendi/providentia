A go-to lunch spot for me and my co workers! Their specials are quick, delicious and perfectly presented. The service is really great; they even give you a hot towel at the beginning of the meal, which is great for those days when you just don't even have time to wash your hands before eating. The food, on the whole, is very flavorful but definitely on the sweeter side - typical of some Japanese food - but overall, a solid place to go. Took an out-of-towner there and they also loved it too. Way to go, Waj!
