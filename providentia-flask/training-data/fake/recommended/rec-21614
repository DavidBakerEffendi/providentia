The level of population ranges from pretty crowded to very crowded, and for good reason. They have excellent, creative Brunch specials that change all the time and are always worth giving a shot. I have never, ever, been disappointed by a meal at Sam's. Some of the best breakfast I have ever had. Not to mention their life altering Mac N Cheese. I still to this day sometimes regret leaving Philadelphia because of that tasty monstrosity. Perfect hint of pepper, cheese to noodle ratio...I'm going to start drooling just thinking about it. Even if you order of the regular menu and get a standard breakfast you wont be disappointed, everything is made with fresh ingredients and talented kitchen staff and it shows in the every last bite. Don't wait!
