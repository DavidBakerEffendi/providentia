3.5...it was good. I was hungry. Served just the kind of food I needed after a long car trip and just before a concert. I liked it, but I didn't think it was *that* special. The people I went with loved it though, and they're from Philly so I may have just ordered the wrong thing. I ordered the portabella burger. It was definitely good, but have I had better? Yup. American cheese... ugh. The mushroom was still very flavorful although I didn't love the bun. The fries were good too. There was a little confusion over my drink... as in I made the mistake of asking for the hot chocolate when I meant the Jones Decadent Hot Chocolate. Our waiter checked id's, so I assumed he understood that I wanted the spiked hocho. Nope. I was served a plain old normal hot chocolate. Bummer, but at least my bill was pretty cheap.
