new favourite place in my new hood. Went for dinner on the way back from cruisy pier 45 (I wasn't cruising but I did get busted for drinking a beer!), and loved the whole open airy rusticky buzzy thing they had going on. Plus they didn't seem bothered by my nasty day-at-the-beach-followed-by-beer-on-pier grunginess. Pared down menu which is always a good sign - pasta good and al dente, and I like that they plonk the tub of parmesan on the table so you don't have that awkward moment of nodding 'continue....continue....continue....' for 5 minutes while a waiter is grating the parmesan for you. At Malatesta you can over-cheese to your hearts content. The final star is missing just because the bread to start was a bit stale and the sangiovese a little acidic but I fully intend to come back and back and if I get better bread and wine next time that final star will be bestowed. Quite cute waiters too. Oh and remember to bring cash - no cards.
