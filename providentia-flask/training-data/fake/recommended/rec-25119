As a native of California I get serious craving for burritos. I lived on them when I was in school and have been a staple of my diet for 20 years. Then I moved to NYC, and I suddenly understood why the New Yorkers I knew freaked out of the Mexican food in my home town. I'd seen the reviews here and was deeply skeptical, but it's not to far out of my way so I took the plunge. Inside smelled right. I can't quite explain it. But I knew I had missed that smell. I had a Carne Asada Burrito with everything on there. Both the mild and spicy salsa, which combined for a great flavor. I wolf down the burrito in record time. It tasted like. In the Bay Area I might look for better. I'd give it 3 stars or so. It' no El Farolito in The Mission, But it is good, and head and shoulders above everything else in the city. On the NYC Burrito scale it's a 5. I need to go back and try the other meats, but the carne asade made this Californians heart warm
