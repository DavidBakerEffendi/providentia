Service was awkward - Since there was no host/hostness, I asked the waiter for a table for 4. He starred at me blankly and told me to  "grab a stroll anywhere and sit down wherever you feel like." & another one told me to "Grab booze from the fridge in front of the restaurant". Make a table wherever there's space, and no one cares. Strangely unorganized - but I like. A super casual space for the laid back carnivore & beer enthusiasts. Music is not absurdly loud. Great place to grab some beer, delicious bites, & catch up with friends. Not recommended to bring your vegetarian friends or weight watcher boys and girls.   Though service was bizarre, the staff was nonetheless warm & friendly. Besides the giant pigs head, my friends and I went for a few other dishes - Steamed artichoke - very typical/nothing fancy whatsoever about this dish. But strangely addicting and very refreshing to have on the table with all the other fatty meaty dishes. Japanese Eggplant - roasted with pine nuts and seaweed, topped with a slice of lardo. A lot of great flavor bouncing in my palate. Definitely my favorite of the night. Half of a Pigs Head was plenty of food for 4. the meat was tender & skin was crispy. Served with a side of yogurt sauce, arugula salad and pita bread. I do recommend this if you are hungry and craving for lots of fatty porky flavor. My guys friends and I enjoyed it very much with pints and bottles of beer.
