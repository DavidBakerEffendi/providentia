Just made my first visit here. Steamed veggies with soba noodles was simple yet satisfying. My wife and I shared the Fuji Royal sampler. Again, nothing over the top, but very fresh and neatly presented sushi/sashimi. Hamachi and spicy tuna roll were just a step above all the other tasty choices. Washed everything down with a few Sapporos and Kirins and finished off with tempura ice cream. Price was spot on for a good to very good sushi spot in Rittenhouse Square.
