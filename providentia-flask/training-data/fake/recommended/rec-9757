Wanted to love this place since I am famoso en Peru...and because the Yelp reviews would indicate it was better than average. T'wasn't. Very run of the mill flavors that didn't pop.  Peruvian food is so much better. The place is nice, classy and inviting.  Servers are ok.   But again, the food... Had a soggy, warm Cesar with a thick creamy dressing...At least the croutons were warm and crunchy...but they were like reheated store bought croutons. Lomo Saltado is to Peruvian as Pad thai is to Thai...and Pio Pio's was nothing special.  Mine wasn't even served hot, but warm.  Too many onions, not enough steak or fries.   We also had the seafood chaufa which was ok.  Shrimp were overdone and rubbery though.  They advertise it as a paella-like dish, but it's not really supposed to be.   Had a Chicha sour which was unimpressive. Perhaps we ordered all wrong, but Pio Pio was Pew Pew for me.
