This place is truly a gem. Toms may not wow you with it's appearance, but the food and hospitality is top notch. We had to wait in the line that wrapped around the building for brunch for about 30mins. However, the wait didn't seem too bad, as snacks and fresh coffee were provided to all of us to help make the wait out in the cold more tolerable. For brunch we went with two eggs over easy, turkey ham, grits, toast and apple cinnamon pancakes. The pancakes were absolutely delicious, especially when topped with the strawberry and brown sugar butter! Yum! Tom's does not disappoint, you will be glad you waited in line.
