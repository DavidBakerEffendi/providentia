Great place, but very small. I had a tostada which was okay. I also had enchiladas with salsa verde, yellow rice and black beans. The beans were delicious. They enchiladas were alright but nothing special. I liked it that some guests brought their kids. This means next time I visit I will take my son with me as he is a huge fan of mexican food. All in all, solid food and nice waiters.
