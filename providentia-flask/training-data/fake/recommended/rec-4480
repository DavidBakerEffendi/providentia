I stopped in here for a quick bit to eat, I was craving a lobster roll and after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. I have to agree with other reviewers it was great. They give you the option to have mayonnaise or butter on the roll, I went with the butter. The roll was soft and fresh, it tasted like a homemade roll right out of your grandma's oven. Then add the generous chunks of lobster and you have heaven on a roll. Accompanied by french fries and coleslaw this was a great dish. So why three stars do you ask? Well I ordered a second dish to bring home to the BF who didn't want to run errands with me in the rain. I got him the shrimp scampi on pasta, his complaint is that the food was very bland and the shrimp was over cooked. I did taste one of the shrimp and well slightly over cooked I found that it lacked seasoning as well. And the Pasta was just that, pasta, there was no sauce or anything on it. You would expect the scampi seasoning to run into the pasta but since the shrimp lacked flavor there wasn't much to expect with the pasta. So I have mixed feelings about weather we would go back, maybe for the lobster roll. However, I would be afraid to venture out and try anything else after the shrimp scampi ordeal.
