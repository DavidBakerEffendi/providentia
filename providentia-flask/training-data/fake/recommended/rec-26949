Caught a sidewalk table on a recent sunny day and had a small slice of unexpected perfection. The croque monsieur (with an excellent BÃ©chamel), the cajun crawfish special (with an excellent remoulade), and a basic, classic martini, upon which it is impossible to improve. Nothing fancy -- but just right. That plus a beer and an hour and a half in the sun in soho = lunch for two for $40. They offer three beers: Stella (if you care about the name but not the taste), Bass (if you care about the taste but not the name), and Bud (if you don't care about either). A very concise selection, which I appreciate. I get the impression that you're better off with simple stuff here. It's a bistro, and a good one, and I'm glad to know about it.
