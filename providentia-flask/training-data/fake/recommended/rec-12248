This review is from 4/26/12 I just was lazy and didn't finish it until now. Had my first bloody mary here.... ewe. It was SO peppery I couldn't breathe. Our waitress is was not great... Â she was super awkward and kinda dumb. Lol and didn't check on us at ALL. The food was decent but way over priced... not going back there.
