Went here last night with my parents for my Dad's birthday.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table, so we went to the bar.  Even though I'm 25 I look like I'm at least a decade younger, so I know the bartenders weren't too pleased to see me sitting at the bar, however short it was of a duration, and despite the fact I only got a diet coke.  They gave us free popcorn, and we munched on that.  My Dad got a wine, and Mom got an Appletini.   The beeper thingie they gave us to alert our table opening up was great-no confusion there.  I headed over to the table and then our waitress was there immediately.  She was GREAT!  Knew the menu inside-out, and was comprehensive and fast.  I ordered the Uncle's Tuna Tips Special (comes with onions, cherry tomatoes, and small pieces of toast on a skillet) and the spinach side side.  My Dad got the Prime Rib special with broccoli, and Mom got the Lobster sliders.  All our food was really good, and filling.  I boxed some of mine up and my Dad some of his.  Cute and comfortable inside, with a large, inviting bar.  I thought it was cool that they grill food in the open in the bar area-very different and nice to see. We've been coming here for probably 15 years now whenever we're in the Princeton area or for a special occasion.  It's a small place that can get crowded by the traffic light its at (in recent years that intersection backs up like you won't believe) but still easily reachable and good, accommodating staff.
