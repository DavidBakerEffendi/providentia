I went for brunch here a couple of weeks ago, and it certainly left something to be desired. The food and service weren't memorable. And the selection for brunch was pretty limited. The place gets pretty crowded - and hot. You kind of feel like you're eating over people. I also was kind of hoping that the Rose Water lemonade was going to be made with rosewater. So it goes.
