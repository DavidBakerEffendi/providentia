It's so good! I really enjoyed the fact that everything was vegan and gluten-free. It's very refreshing, because you don't have to ask about it; you just know right off the bat. Extensive choice of veggies, which is great because I'm picky. The only thing that was a bit off was the rice pudding. I expected something a tad creamier, but after the large portion of falafel and veggies, it was too heavy for me. That being said, I'd eat the rice pudding alone, so I'm not complaining.
