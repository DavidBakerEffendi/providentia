Hands down for the food at this hidden gem! Small place but with the the freshest and most tasty fish dishes I've ever eaten. I walked in on a weekday night at 8-ish and was glad to be seated right away. Nice ambient and cozy inside with an open kitchen where you can see the 2 chefs chopping, grilling and pan frying fishes at the corner stoves. Though no fishy smell at all in the seating area. I got the Cobia and my friend got the Skate. The server explained to my friend thoroughly that the Skate dish they make there is different from other restaurant. Cobia - Cooked just right before well done to keep the tenderness! So juicy and meaty with smokey flavor along with few small pieces of lamb brisket braised with delicious juice/sauce. Skate - There is seriously a reason why they cooked the dishes without filleting the flesh but with bone-in instead. It really keeps the freshness of the fish and most importantly the soft and stringy texture. The meat could easily be slid off with a fork. I feel so spoiled by this place that I'm sure I'll be so picky on the fish dishes at other restaurants days after!
