This was my first visit to a churrascaria north of Brazil so I didn't know what to expect, but this chain restaurant defiantly lives up to its hype.   I was very impressed by the elegant decor, huge wine selection, prompt service and excellent food.   Upon arriving your drink orders are taken and your directed to the salad bar for your first course.  The salad bar looked well kept and had several delicious options; fresh cheese, artichoke hearts, side dishes, and all your typical salad fixings.  Next comes the meats.  As soon as you turn over your coaster, gesturing to the Gaucho Chefs your ready to eat, swarms of sword dwelling meat connoisseur's rush your table to offer you tonight's selection of meats.  In no time your plate is full with a perfectly cooked and seasoned variety of meats.  Try to take it slow to make sure you get to sample everything atleast once.   Be sure to come with a big appetite to get your moneys worth.  I recommend taking it light on the salad bar so you can get in as much rare red meat as possible.
