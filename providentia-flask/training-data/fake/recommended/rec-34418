Was looking for another gluten free restaurant that has pizza. We called in for takeout. We ordered the Salsiccia e Rapini. The women on the phone said 45 possibly 30 minutes. She took down my number and said she would call if it took less time. I showed up 40 min later. As I walked in the pizza was sitting on the hostess table right in then open. I suspected it to be cold, and it was. They didn't seem to have anything to keep it warm. I might have been a little late, just as i walked in they were attempting to call.  but I wished they would have kept it warm. The gluten free dough was really tough to chew. Very disappointing. Ive had other gluten free dough that can be soft. Not sure why this was so hard. The size of the pizza quite small for the price of $19.00. The toppings were good and generous.  There wasn't a lot of options for toppings. I would possible eat there again and try a regular pizza.
