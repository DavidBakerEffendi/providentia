Plus: outdoor seating. Minus: Being ignored by servers for almost 10 minutes (don't at the 3 lonely tables on 2nd St!)/ Plus: Jalapeno mac & cheese (in theory) was very cheesy. Minus: They forgot the jalapenos. Couldn't taste/see them. Plus: Veggie of the day- locally grown fiddlehead ferns. Minus: They had no idea how to prepare them. Plus: Rootbeer on tap. (no minus here- that's all good) Plus: Tasty chips and salsa. Minus: Getting charged for them. Good but not great food overall. Was really turned off by the poor service, but will try sitting elsewhere next time.
