a quietly pleasant nook less polished than its older brother snack taverna in the same neighborhood. snack however is far more comfortable and on an afternoon lunch break is choice place to eat. memorable foods include: greek salad, beet salad, avgolemono soup, melitzanosalata, roasted and vegetarian souvlaki sandwiches. the entrees are more expensive and come in smaller portions, so be proud you are good to your wallet and love sandwiches, it's alright, no worries. they keep a small and selective menu meant for the soho pocket. expect fair to helpful service in a low key upper middle class environment. vegetarian and meat-friendly without a hitch as greek/mediterranean food normally is [3.5 stars].
