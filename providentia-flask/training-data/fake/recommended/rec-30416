I'm not sure if the word I want is disappointed or inconsistent. It's not just that I can make better breakfast at home. It's that I can get better breakfast at Denny's. The setting is beautiful. A very quaint old inn with comfortable chairs, understated design, and quiet dining rooms. The staff was great with our 14-mo old, too, which is always nice. The price fix brunch is $30, and comes with one appetizer and one main course.The appetizers were outstanding. I started with potato pancakes, which are actually hash brown balls (I expected more of a latke) perfectly crisp and well-seasoned. The caramelized apple dipping sauce was incredible. My wife's salmon with creme fresh, apple, and fennel was delicious in presentation and flavor. And our daughter's kid's menu pancakes were excellent when dipped in the warm maple butter. But the actual breakfast portion of the brunch was very disappointing. For mains, I ordered the seasonal vegetable scramble. It came with a light and crisp salad, but the eggs were a runny glop with some baby mushrooms and asparagus laying in a small pool of grease. There was no seasoning on either the eggs or the vegetables. The main flavor was oil. Her frittata was better on the flavor but also very greasy. And like the "potato pancakes" I doubt the naming--this was a thin pancake, not a light and fluffy mixture of eggs and ingredients like a good frittata. Both of our dishes included home fried potatoes that were entirely unseasoned. No salt, no pepper. Step two when making potatoes (step one is washing): season with salt & pepper. Then there are all those little things, like having to ask for more coffee every time. Based on other reviews, the general ambiance, and of course the price, we'd hoped for a better experience.
