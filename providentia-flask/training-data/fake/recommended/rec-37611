This is a great place for good Vietnamese food. After renovations, it's even better. The food is consistent and service is prompt, with plenty of seating. Further away from the other crowded plazas, they serve up their food a little differently than some of the other Vietnamese joints. I was very pleasantly surprised when I ordered the Vietnamese crepe to get so many different greens with it. There was the usual array of mints, but then shiso leaves (which I haven't seen served up with this before) and some other greens were included, maybe totaling a high pile of 8 different greens to top the crepe with. The spring rolls, loc lac and tofu bahn mi were also all very good. I did notice their dipping sweet fish sauce isn't as sweet as other places. This isn't a bad thing, but different. For the price, flavors and consistently good food, this place is a def. go to.
