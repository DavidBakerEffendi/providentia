A New York institution - probably the last burger, fries, and beer pub left in the West Village. Would I say the best burger I've ever had? No, very good, but no. Best goes to Goat Town in East Village. But it's cozy in a way that you don't see very much in this city. Other complaint is long line to get a table - if you go at prime hours expect a 20-40 min wait.
