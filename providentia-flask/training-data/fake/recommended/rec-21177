From 5 star to 4... Unfortunately my fav restaurant (yes overall if i had to pick) in the city is no longer on the top of my list. I ordered my usual, truffle cheese fries and manly burger, and my burger was perfect, absolutely no complaints. But my cheese fries came with too much cheese clustered in the center, the fries were slightly above lukewarm and this time I could not taste the truffle flavor AT ALL. And i am a picky person when it comes to using the diablo sauce because that is the only sauce I use (the others are fine but I just really like this one) and I absolutely need to have it for my fries (WHEN THEY ARE HOT/WARM). This is critical, cold fries with the density of the cheese they use tastes quite bad actually. I ask my waiter for more, he disappears for about 15 min and during that time I ask another waiter for a water and diablo sauce refill. This person refills my water and leaves, I thought to get the diablo refill but nope, just forgets our table just like our actual waiter. My friend wants the diablo as well for her burger so when our actual waiter comes by again we ask for 2 spoonfuls of just diablo. He remembers that he forgot our request the first time and goes to the back I think to get the sauce, takes about another 7 min or so and comes back with a plate of 4 sauces (one of each) so that was another misunderstanding and a total of 20+ minutes has gone by, now our food is cold and I already consumed just about all of the fries. Top notch service + the amazingness of the food was what made me give this 5 stars the first time but this experience definitely brings it down a full star.
