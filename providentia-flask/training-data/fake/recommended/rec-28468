been here twice, right after moving to Astoria... heard from some friends that its a great spot, and i would continue to agree! had good service, and the panini's were 'the bomb'.. i haven't been back in months, but i will look to change that in 2010, still lots on the menu i have not tried.. and apparently they have yummy looking Â desserts!
