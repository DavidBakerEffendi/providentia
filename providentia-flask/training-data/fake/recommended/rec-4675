What this place lacks in space, they certainly make up for with awesome food!  Our waitress informed us that they did not have the soup of the day or the oxtails, but we didn't miss either.  The chicken empanada appetizer was fantastic!  Our main entrees:  ropa viejos and pollo Sol de Cuba disappeared off our plates quickly.  Everything was very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend checking out Soul de Cuba!   I can't wait to go back.
