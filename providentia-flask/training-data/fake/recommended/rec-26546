This is a fun Irish bar to visit in West Hartford.  The place is lively.  The bar is excellent.  The food is very good.   Seating can be limited so get there early.   The bar can get packed and become standing room only (this is a good thing).   The staff is nice.  The bartenders are good at their job.   Overall, it's a nice spot to hang out.
