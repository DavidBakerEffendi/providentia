I've read the unrecommended reviews and I can say that I disagree. the only complaint I could imagine is the price, and yes it is fairly expensive but for the quality of all natural mostly organic delicious food in minutes, I think it's worth it. I am a vegetarian and there's plenty of wonderful options for me, and for non vegetarians. I have a doctor near there so every appointment me and my friend (not a vegetarian) get lunch. There's lots of pastas, salads, lasagnes, and daily sandwiches, pizza slices, empanadas, etc. Everything I've tried there (eggplant parm, Ditalini, Pasta salads) has been delicious. they also have tasty drinks, breads and the BEST kettle chips I've ever had. I wish it was closer to home or I would be there every single day.
