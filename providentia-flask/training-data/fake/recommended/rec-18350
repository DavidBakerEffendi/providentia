It honestly pains me to not give five stars here, but I have my reasons. As a venue, I really have a hard time thinking of a better atmosphere or better sounding room for a concert. It always feels dreamy and intimate and just... it's perfect. But the food is just OKAY. And even more than the food just being okay, I can't really handle a few small pretensions of the establishment. For one, they don't do cheese fries. What? Yeah. We just wanted some mofo cheese on our mofo fries. The waiter told us it was a principle of the owners' to not ever serve cheese fries. He wouldn't even give us an extra bit of cheese to put on the fries ourselves. Seriously, I get having gimmicks or whatever and it IS their restaurant, but I think this sucks. I didn't think it was cute. Also, having not-the-best eyesight, especially after a couple drinks and in a fairly dark bar, I didn't like that there were no menus. The menu, instead, is scrawled on walls,etc. in chalk. I could read it, but I was bitter about the squinting. Seriously? type it into the computer. hit print. Not everyone reads perfectly from a few feet away in the dark. After all of this, the food was just mediocre. I really do LOVE this place, but I wouldn't opt to eat there again. Â Except maybe for brunch, which I've heard is pretty excellent.
