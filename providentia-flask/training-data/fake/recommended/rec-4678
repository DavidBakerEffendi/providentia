Rudy's is pretty darn good. While, for some reason, I never tried it when it was in it's original location, I come to the new location around once a week. It's great people watching....not to mention great frites! The beer selection is definitely impressive. Seating can be a little hard to find on a Friday or Saturday night...but hey, who cares? Good fries, good beers and good friends in a chill atmosphere...what else do you need?
