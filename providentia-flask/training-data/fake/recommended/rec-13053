A very, very good burger but not the best I've ever had. I really enjoyed the creativity around the burgers, melding umami rich foods to come up with amazingly savory burgers. I had the classic burger which I really enjoyed but it is on the smaller side. It was a juicy burger and had some very interesting flavor components that you could really taste in each bite.  We also got the cheesy tots off the secret menu which were also good. I would try their truffle fries/sweet potato fries the next go around.  Beer is a bit overpriced here so i would drink elsewhere. I'll definitely be back to try more of their delish burgers
