Only eaten here once and it was packed! I didn't really like the fact that we were practically on top of the people next to us but I suppose they have to compromise on space. LOVED their pad thai, it was absolutely amazing. Very flavorful and not incredibly spicy like most other places. Prices were also very reasonable considering NY prices and the mojito was amazing. I'd definitely go back!
