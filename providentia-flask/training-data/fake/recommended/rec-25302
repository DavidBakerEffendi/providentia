The food in San Kee is mostly as authentic as the Cantonese Cuisine I had in my hometown, Hong Kong, although they still have a bit of mixed with American taste. Anyways, I tried the roster duck noodle, walnut shrimp, general Tso's pork, ribs/pork with black pepper sauce, spicy fish and spicy pot. These are all good in general, but need to be less salty. Btw, I don't really like the steam dim sum here, because of over steaming which makes the world shrimp dumplings softened.
