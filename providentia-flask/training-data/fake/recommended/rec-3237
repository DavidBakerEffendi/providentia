One of the best dining experiences I've had in Philly! My date and I did not have reservations (it was a kind of last minute decision), but the staff was very accommodating and even on a Saturday night we were seated within an hour. We spent our time waiting at the bar where the drinks were great (I had the Pear Grapefruit Fizz which came with a delicious slice of Asian pear in it). We had our appetizer (Ahi Tuna Tartare--highly recommend!) at the bar since it was full menu. We also ended up getting the Bubbles and Berries and the Black Orchid at dinner. The Black Orchid was definitely best tasting but Bubbles and Berries get extra points for presentation! The ambience was perfect for a fancier date and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ended up getting the Lobster Bisque and French Onion soups to start and for the entree we had the Salmon Teriyaki and the Chilean Sea Bass both of which were delicious. Highly recommend the sea bass! The truffle sauce on the mashed potatoes was perfect!
