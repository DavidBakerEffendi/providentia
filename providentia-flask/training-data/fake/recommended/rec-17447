I was in the city with my sister tonight and we had a serious craving for Thai so i looked up places on yelp on my phone that were in the village and found Pinto listed. We were having an early dinner and we arrived we discovered they were having a sunset menu special where you could choose a drink, appetizier and entree for $15!!! I had the stuffed tofu for an appetizer which was delicious and could almost be a meal by itself. It was a big wedge of tofu stuffed with zuccini, tomatoes, onions and the tofu was kind of fried and then it had a sauce on it that was kind of like a peanut sauce. It was delicious!!! omg!!! Then for the entree I had Pad Thai with Tofu. The portion was huge! and it was really fresh tasting and delicious. My sister had the Mushroom crunches were like their version of fried mushrooms. They were tasty. For her entree she had Chicken with 5 seeds and she said it was delicious. I did not try it because i am mostly a vegetarian. We will definitely go back there! it was delicious and super affordable!!
