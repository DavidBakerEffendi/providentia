I ended up stopping in at Hot Diggity on their opening day, during a trip back home to Philly. I was with my boyfriend and his friend, and the two of them ordered beef hot dogs and fries with curry mayo, which they loved. The fries were delish, and they loved their hot dogs. My boyfriend ordered the Saigon Fusion, and I forget what his friend got, but it was thumbs up from them both. I'm a vegetarian who now lives in Chicago, so it was a veggie Windy City for me. I have to deduct a star for taste and accuracy. I know I do it to myself, but it's hard to find a good veggie dog. The ones at Hot Diggity are actually two little ones sharing the same bun, and the consistency was a bit weird. Again, though, I knew going in that it wasn't going to taste like a hot dog--veggie dogs rarely do. I'd recommend a quick heating on the grill though. However, in order for something to be called a Chicago-style hot dog, there has to be a poppy seed bun involved. Hot Diggity nailed the celery salt, onion, relish, pickle, and mustard, but that roll is essential. And I might be wrong, but I don't remember tomatoes or peppers, which are crucial as well. The seating was tight, but it worked for the place. The tables have holes which I only now realize are for the cones that the fries come in. And the menu, which is above the counter and consists of a phenomenal illustration for each hot dog, looks really, really great. If nothing else, stop in for a peek at that. At $8.64 for a drink and a veggie dog, I'm a fan of Hot Diggity. I only wish I lived closer!
