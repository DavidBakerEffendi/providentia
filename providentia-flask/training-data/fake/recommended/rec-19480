I am sorry to say that this culinary fixture of Philadelphia is badly in need of a makeover. The decor feels stuck in the 90s especially the blackboard in the center of the restaurant where the specials of the day are written. However, the decor is not the only area that needs updating. The food also feels stuck in the 90s. For example, the overly rich cream sauce that drowns the subtle Lobster Ravioli is replete with overly sweet sun dried tomatoes. Who does sun-dried tomatoes in pasta dishes anymore? Another thing to avoid is the cocktails. I sampled both a Gin and Tonic and an Old Fashioned and found both to be weak and uninspired. If you do decide to imbibe I would suggest the wine list which is very reasonably priced and contains some interesting choices. One area where this restaurant does not fall down is the service. My server was efficient, well informed, and very personable. However, overall this restaurant is a perfect candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. I hope someone turns this place around because it is worth saving.
