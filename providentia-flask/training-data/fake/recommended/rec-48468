Got a Groupon so we went and checked it out on a Wed night. The service was good, the food was good not great. Calamari was pretty good and the aioli that came with it wasn't bad either. The fresh pasta was really tasty as well. The risotto was probably the best thing we had, very very good, but unfortunately the scallops that came with it were a little chewy (though by far not the worst I've ever had). All in all, I'd go back but it's a little pricey for the atmosphere and quality.
