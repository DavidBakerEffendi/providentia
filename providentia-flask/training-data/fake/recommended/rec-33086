Bad bad bad customer service. Places looks awesome BUT the hostess/Waitress/Bar tender/Cashier/busgirl LOL was unprofessional & miserable (owner makes her miserable) she got mad at us because she forgot our order lol... She asked twice and she forgot twice...She goes, "your food is almost ready"...did you order CBA? Me, "hmmm No, I have ordered ABC." Then she gets mad at me lol. OOOOKKK. And food never arrived...!
