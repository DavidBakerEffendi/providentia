I wanted to try this place for years and just happened to be traveling through the area the other day so I stopped in for lunch.  The place was busy  but the waitresses kept things moving nicely.  We ordered one regular and one pepperoni pizza with a side of fried calamari.  Everything was good and when I pass through the area again I will definitely stop in again.  The calamari was delicious.  I don't normally eat calamari, but the others at my table were raving about it so much that I had to try it, and it was delicious.    The crust is definitely THE key part of this pie.  It is thin with corn meal on the bottom.   it is crisp and slightly burnt in some places on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  It is very unique and I never had a crust like this before anywhere , surprisingly the sauce and cheese were just okay, but the crust more than makes up for what the sauce and cheese lack.   Next time I plan to try different toppings.
