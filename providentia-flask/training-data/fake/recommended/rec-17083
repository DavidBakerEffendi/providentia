Lovely greeting from hostess. Drinks promptly brought to table and refilled as needed. My lunch date ordered fish n'chips. I had the turkey and avocado wrap. Fresh and delicious. Management checked on us twice. This is my new go-to location. No more big chain restaurants. Here you get quality selections and exemplary service at very competitive prices.
