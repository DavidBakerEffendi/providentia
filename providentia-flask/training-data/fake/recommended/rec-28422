A destination restaurant. I've brought everyone here from my mom and brother, to business associates, to birthday parties, and the staff have never failed to impress.  I would go here for the whisky and beer selection alone, but the food is next level to boot. Whisky bread and whipped ricotta pot are my standard appetizer choice.  The shepherd's pie is hearty with delicate sensibilities.  I appreciate the veggie options so I can chow down with my bangers & mash friends.  Dessert rocks. I'm thankful the dining room wall is thick enough to muffle the west village bar.  Music selection may be the one weak link from my perspective - a French-influenced Scottish establishment could serenade us with a more interesting playlist.
