I like El Camino Real.  I'll admit that it has its faults, but overall, it's a relatively inexpensive spot to have a few drinks and fill your belly.  I definitely love how they take the term Tex-Mex seriously, and split the menu in half!  I was really happy with my burrito.  It was big, but not too big, and pretty yummy.  We also ordered a pork BBQ sandwich, which, once dressed with some sauce, was really good.  And huge!  The guacamole rounded out the meal, and the margaritas made me smile :)  So yeah, its definitely not the best restaurant around, but it'll fill your belly and not empty your wallet!  Not to mention, the weeknight 10-midnight happy hour pretty much just kicks ass!
