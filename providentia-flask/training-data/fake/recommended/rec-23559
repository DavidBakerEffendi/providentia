We were very excited to try this new joint done by the owners of August First. They have made space much nicer than it used to be when it was the Vermont Sandwich Company. They claim to be "Burlington's famous sandwich shop" and so far my boyfriend and I would say that they have a lot of work to do to reach that status. First off the service was friendly, but the 2 young men didn't seem to get along. For their first real day open we felt they needed some sort of management there to guide them cause they didn't really know what they were doing. Their hoagie roll was nice, but our Italian sandwich was lacking because there was about three times as much bread as there was filling. We also got the Italian beef which was ok, but lacked seasoning. It also seemed like they did not pickle the giardiniera long enough. We would have given this place less stars but we went on their first day do we added an extra star. We will give it a second chance, but I think we'll wait a while for the kinks to be worked out. All in all, disappointing but hopeful experience.
