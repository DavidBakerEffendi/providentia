*TIP* - GO DURING LUNCH HOUR ON A WEEKDAY! I walked in at 4PM and the place was near empty. This place is NOT worth the hype. I'm so surprised at all these great reviews from yelpers, and my friends. First off, the layout of this place is ugly and just not appetizing as a burger joint to me. Sorry if that doesn't make sense, but this place looks a little better than a diner. It's just not appealing when I'm thinking of a meaty burger. Secondly, the food just AIN'T good. Neither is that nasty homemade green tea of theirs. Oomph. I love green tea, but that tea gotta go. It needs to burn. My girlfriend and I ordered their cheese fries, and it came out cold. What a nice week for me. First I had lukewarm fries at Flex Mussels, now I get COLD fries at Umami? What-The-Freakin-A? Aside from the fries being cold, the cheese wasn't actually melted onto the fries. There was sort of like a blob of cheese just on top, and it was weird. My friend ordered the original burger, and honestly, found nothing to rave about it. Ok, it wasn't "bad", but definitely not what someone would expect after this big hype about Umami. We knew it probably wasn't going to live up to the hype, but we at least expected it to be better than Shake Shack. Nope. The original was no bueno. I ordered the truffle burger everyone raved about, and seriously? Are you people on crack? I might sound horribly rude in this review, but are you people seriously on crack? I know at $12.50 a burger, I wouldn't be getting real truffle shavings - but at least put enough truffle butter, oil, salt, whatever (it's all imitation anyway and isn't that costly) to get that flavor kickin in. Nope. All I had was a soggy medium-rare burger that was breaking apart, and dripping with oil and "truffle sauce". No Umami, NO.
