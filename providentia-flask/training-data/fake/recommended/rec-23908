I should be ashamed of how often I go to this place, instead the shame lies in my neglecting to write a review until now. So that I can go to El Camino regularly, I have made a point of having different groups of friends that don't really know each other that will go with me on different days. On one more embarrassing occasion, I pulled a "Mrs.Doubtfire" and went with one group for brunch and the other for drinks later in the evening. I can only vouch for the cheese enchiladas because they're so good I won't stray, but I have seen my niece order pancakes which were quickly devoured by the rest of the table while she watched in horror. The place gets really crowded later in the evening but if you're going to actually eat and talk like old ladies, I've never had to wait if I get in before 7.
