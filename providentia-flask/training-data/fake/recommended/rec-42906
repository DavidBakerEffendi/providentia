Dear The Meatball Shop, Thank you for still being so delicious, fantastic, and consistent through each of my visits. You are so great and you give me a great name time after time when I bring people and they fall in love with you too. I can't wait till I get to return and be in company with you again. Love, T PS. Chicken Ball w/Mushroom Gravy is still my go to combination. I want to try something new, but I just can't!
