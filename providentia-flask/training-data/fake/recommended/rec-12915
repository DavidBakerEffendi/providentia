rabbit meatballs... really moist and rich with the truffle broth. this is a must get lasagna was meat overload, so if you like that, go right ahead. Mac n cheese was baked, and the cacio e pepe flavor got a little lost. The top layer of pasta was a bit tough to eat as well. But once you get to the middle, it's a solid mac n cheese. Got a bottle of Birra Etrusca dogfish - carbonated just enough, bit malty and tarty, but it was refreshing and perfect for the heavy meal. would come back to try other specials.
