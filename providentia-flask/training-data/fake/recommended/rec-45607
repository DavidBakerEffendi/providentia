As others have said, 'if you like meat..........'  Pace yourself and take advantage of the salad bar.  Good advice to try for first time over lunch given price difference with dinner.   4 Stars simply for the meat, but not a traditional 4 star Mobil guide type restaurant.  A place well worth trying at least once.
