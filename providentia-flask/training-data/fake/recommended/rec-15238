The ambiance of this restaurant is unbeatable. Â It's upscale but extremely comfortable and inviting. Food was reasonably priced and had a wide range of options. A few members of my party enjoyed the build your own salad for $14, and said it was worth it because of the portion size and customization ability. The bar is small and doesn't fit with the theme but still looks nice nonetheless. Make sure you get reservations for this place-it seems to be very popular with both locals and tourists. My group was large and we made a reservation for 8 pm and were not seated until about 8:30. That is the only negative, because no one likes waiting, especially when this restaurant has no lobby or waiting area.
