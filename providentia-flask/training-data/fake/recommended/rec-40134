I went in search of Fish Tacos. Based on looking at Yelp reviews all over the city, I picked this place to be very promising in delivering me good fish tacos within walking distance of my job. (I work at the Comcast Center) As promised, Kite and Key did have Fish Tacos and they are good. Not the best I have had, but they show well. For 9 bucks and change you get three fish tacos. They are not small either. Since Kite and Key uses flour tortillas instead of the traditional corn tortillas for their tacos. There was good flavor, but I am a fan of a little more spice and originality. The fish breading was also a little strange to me. I like fried fish tacos, but the breading on this fish was almost like a cornmeal breading, producing a texture that I did not care for. All in all, it was a filling lunch at a good price. But I will continue my Philly fish taco search!
