When "Grille" is spelled with an "e", you pretty much know what you are in for - a glorified chain restaurant that is designed to make you feel like you are at a fine dining establishment.  Located in an office park off of Route 1, I was amazed to see that they offer valet parking.  In an office park. Where there is an abundance of parking spots.  The fact that those guys are stuck out there providing a unnecessary service while being forced to listen to the cheesy music pumped outside made me very sad. For what they are trying to do, they do it well, it's just not really my scene.  Someone obviously spent some coin building the place, but I failed to see the need to have the outdoor fireplaces lit on a freezing cold night..  It's a big space with high ceilings and no noise control, so it's very loud. I think it's designed that way so that you feel that you are at somewhere very popular and lively.  There is a large bar which includes a communal table, and a very large dining room.  The place is packed.  You can be sure to find the latest sports event on the TVs. We showed up without a reservation and sat at the communal table in the bar. Our server was great and the food was ok.  It's the kind of food that sounds a lot better on the menu than it is.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was good.  For my main course, I had their famous pork chop, which was much, much too salty. The portions were huge, but it didn't make me want to finish anything on my plate or take it home. I'd only go back to watch a game and have drinks and appetizers, or if I were staying at the Westin and didn't want to go very far.   Entrees are too expensive for what you get.  The best money spent at a place like this is the corporate dollar of your expense account, and the majority of it on alcohol.
