My fellow Elite Yelper Allene T. suggested Bao for our reunion meal. This was my first time walking down St. Marks place so it was comforting to have a veteran Yelper with me. We ventured into the Bao, where Allene suggested we put down our name on the waiting list and then go to pick up some milk tea from Kung Fu Tea, which was only a few steps away. We put our name down and were told there would be a 5-10 minute wait. Could our timing be any better?! By the time we picked up our teas and stood again at the hostess booth, we were ready to be seated. It was nice they allowed people to bring their own wine and beer. We went another route. Our own boba!! The seating is slightly cramped. I felt like I was intruding on a couple of dates, but definitely not as awkward as sharing a table at Chinatown restaurants with complete strangers. After careful consideration, we made quick work of the menu and decided on: Dan Dan noodles: deliciously saucy. Had a slight kick. Make sure to mix the meat and noodles properly. Scallion pancake with sliced beef: good call on this order, Allene! Sometimes the pancake could be cooked to be a little overdone and dry, but this was fried to crispy perfection, stuffed with the tender sliced beef. Regular Xiao Long Bao: this is no Shanghai cafe, but it comes pretty damn close. Extra soupy with juicy, flavorful meat and chewy dumpling skin. Super spicy Xiao Long Bao: Ok, it's not SUPER spicy. But the more you eat, the more it definitely burns... They look like little bao's of fire, taunting you from the steamer. There was a champagne milk tea that I was sad I didn't get to try, although I wasn't sure how that would turn out, and we took a long time deciding whether or not to order the Chocolate XLB. The more I think about it, the more I'm ok with not having tried it... Thanks for bringing me here, Allene T.! Definitely recommend for a change of scene from the usual Chinatown atmosphere for Xiao Long Bao.
