If you ever need a reason to visit New York, then Grimaldi's is it. A better pizza just does not exist on this planet. We got there at the perfect time and luckily didn't have to wait too long for a table. I literally have no words to describe how this pizza changed my life. I compare every other pizza to the one I had at Grimaldi's. And I'm a not a hard person to please when it comes to pizza, I'm a cheese only kinda girl. But wowza, even the cheese pizza at Grimaldi's will change your life. I really feel sorry for any other pizza I encounter, it doesnt stand a chance.
