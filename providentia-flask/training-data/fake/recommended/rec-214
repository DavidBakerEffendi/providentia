These plates here are meant for Godzilla! Let's be honest, they serve you food on huge serving platters. That's what they're really meant for! The red sangria is strong. You can really taste the alcohol in it. There are little to no vegetarian options so I had the monkfish and shrimp rice stew. It was really good (though watch for bones). I kept eating it even when I was beyond the limits of full. I ended up taking half of it home for lunch the next day! Also, it was only about $13 for that whole dish! Everyone around me had steak and they were exclaiming how good the beef was there. For dessert, they ran out of everything except tiramisu and flan. We tried both of them. The tiramisu was pretty awesome. The flan was good also but the tiramisu definitely won in that battle. I'm only taking a star off because it took them forever to get us the check and then their credit card machine was done. We weren't informed for a while and ended up sitting there for 30 minutes waiting while they tried to fix it. We ended up paying in cash.
