On a Philly scale, I would give this 4 stars, but on an absolute scale it deserves only 3.  In all respects, Nom Nom is a welcome addition to the Center City food scene.  Since I moved to Philadelphia 8 months ago not a week has gone by where I haven't kvetched to a friend about the lack of noodle shops (save the abundance of Pho places) in Philadelphia.  Nom Nom loses a star based on the quality of ingredients.  Granted, it  may be unfair to compare it to NYC where the competition drives quality, Nom Nom has missed the mark slightly.  The Pork Belly is slightly over-cooked, the buns have too much mayonnaise, etc.  With that said, while it is not "great", it is certainly "good enough" and I see myself returning frequently.
