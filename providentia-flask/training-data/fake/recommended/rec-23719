Went there Saturday night. My man had made reservations for us to celebrate our one year anniversary and apparently had informed them of it being a special night for us. The place has a great ambiance; warm, spacious and with a great view. We started off with Syrah wine. Since I am a vegetarian our waiter helped us select vegetarian dishes and guided us through out our whole meal. The portion sizes are quite small... its like eating at tapas bar. We started off with cheese dish called Crispy Haloumi. It was one of our most favorite. Then we got some fried caulifower which has a most delicious yogurt dip I have ever had. The third dish that we ordered was Galil eggplant. The dish was flavorful and appetizing. The two things which were our least favorites were stuffed pepper and hummus. It was the best hummus ever but just that in front of all the other new flavors it fell short. It was as good as  hummus can get and neither of us are die hard fan of hummus. For desserts we ordered almond baklava... the filling melted in the mouth. But what made our night spectacular and mind blowing was the on the house champagne and chocolate sorbet. It made our night so extra special and well it made us change our mind about sorbet because that was nothing short of heavenly.  We left the place so happy that it was unbelievable. Yes the one year together was special and Zahav made is so very extra special. I am glad we took our chances with it for the night. Entire staff was genuine and made it a great night for us.
