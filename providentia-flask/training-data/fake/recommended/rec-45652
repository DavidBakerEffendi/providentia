Shiao Lan Kung's menu isn't daunting for an American; you'll find most of the usual suspects.  But it also includes a wide number of dishes that you won't find in menus outside Chinatown.  This review is subject to editing, as I've only been here a handful of times, but my current favorites are the pork-and-turnip soup and the scallops in ginger sauce.  There's a real subtlety and kick to the flavors here, and I find the overall quality reliably better than Wong Wong. The service at SLK is swift and competent, although the atmosphere is typical Chinatown: bright lighting, red lunar calendars on the wall, prominent fish tank.   I look forward to future forays deeper and deeper into the menu.
