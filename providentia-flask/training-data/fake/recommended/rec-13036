This place has a really nice ambience and impressive food. Not a wide selection, but the dishes are well made. We got the Coq Au Vin, which had a really nice flavor. The wine sauce was delicious, but not overwhelming. Also had the Mussels, which came with crisp toast that unfortunately didn't taste as good when it became soggy from sitting in the sauce. But the mussels, and the sauce, were amazing. We also started off with the Pesto di Parma tartinette to share, definitely worth a try. The plates are on the smaller, tapas-style side, but they also have an extensive wine listing that makes this place a great hangout.
