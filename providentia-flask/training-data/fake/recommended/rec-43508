If I could give this place a lower rating than one star....I would.     Sweet waiteperson, but overpriced mediocre food.      Arrogant chef unwilling to correct mistakes gives incredibly lame excuses for food that doesn't deliver.   Totally insulted.   Menu overly complicated.    Few things came out of kitchen as described. I would go again for a beer....but NEVER for another bite of food.
