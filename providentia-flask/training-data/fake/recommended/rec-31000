Yummy yummy is the perfect name for this little Chinatown bakery. I would say their signature item is the egg cakes (which come on 4 flavors, in my opinion the original is the way to go). I have been to most of the Chinatown bakeries and have only found that these egg cakes are sold in Yummy Yummy. As far as their other items, I have tried some of their boba tea. To my surprise it was pretty darn good compared to contemporary tea house places in Chinatown. If you like rich tea flavor in your boba tea then I'd suggest trying it from here. Unfortunately I haven't tried much else at Yummy Yummy, but I'm sure their items are worth trying.
