Literally on of the best thai places I have ever been to in NYC (and I love me some Thai...). I got their Pineapple Fried Rice, it was only 9$ and it was the best Pinapple Fried Rice I have ever had! The bacon was fantastic, the ground pork was interesting and flavorful, and the pineapple was ridiculously sweet. The decor is adorable and very appropriate to the name. I would recommend Noodies to anyone, and will definitely go again.
