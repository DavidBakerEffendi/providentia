After dinner, we walked around Soho and decided to yelp a dessert spot. We decided to come to Eight Turn Crepe. Omg what a find, a hidden gem. This place is great. I decided to go for the NY blueberry cheesecake crepe. It was so delicious. A nice scoop of ice cream plus fresh blueberries all around, custard cream and whip cream. Utterly delicious. They also have savory crepes. It was delish so I am definitely trying a savory crepe next time I stop by. The spot is a lil small but they do have seating. The staff was friendly and I loved the decor. If your in Soho and have a sweet tooth, go to Eight Turn Crepe!!!!
