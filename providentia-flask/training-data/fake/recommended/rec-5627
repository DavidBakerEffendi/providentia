Went there last night for the first time, and really enjoyed it. The blood orange margarita was delicious to start out and the classic guacamole was fantastic. The chips they serve it with were warm and yummy on their own. Since I hadn't been before, I went with the taco sampler. All were good, but the sea bass was by far my favorite. Service was good, our waitress was patient while 8 girls tried to split the bill, most of us using separate credit cards (I know, a server's nightmare). And the atmosphere was great, energetic, but not too loud. I would go back.
