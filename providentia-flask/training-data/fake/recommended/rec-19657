I had a phenomenal eating experience at Chowder Pot IV.  Ironically, I ended up there by happenstance, given that I was staying at the Hartford Hotel & Suites next door and was too tired to find a place to eat elsewhere. Here's what makes this restaurant top-notch: **FOOD** If you like lobster, be sure to go on a Monday night, aka Lobster Night.  They serve Monday-only lobster dishes and also lower prices (slightly) on lobster dishes available every day. I was incredibly hungry and so I ordered the lobster bisque and the "Catch of the Day" (in my case, Mahi Mahi, which came with two of these sides: fries, coleslaw, vegetables, baked potato, rice). First things first, the sweet butter bread (baked fresh and fast and served on its very own bread board!) is phenomenal and (as it turns out) incredibly filling.  Even just half of the bread and the piping hot (and absolutely delicious) lobster bisque was enough to satiate me...which surprised me, given how hungry I was. By the time the Mahi Mahi arrived (at the perfect temperature and balance of flavors), I was nearly full.  Needless to say, I brought the leftovers home, convinced that even Chowder Pot's reheated food would taste delicious. **SERVICE** If the service I received from Jayne K. is a reflection of the service one always gets from Chowder Pot, then I can confidently say that it doesn't get much better than this.  Jayne was incredibly professional yet 100% down-to-earth.  I felt like I was getting personalized service at a 5-star restaurant. Jayne was also great in getting my food served quickly and was conscientious in asking how I was enjoying my meal.  I didn't have to wait long for the check, either. Furthermore -- and this may seem completely insignificant -- Jayne was incredibly considerate in the way she prepared and laid out the boxes to put my leftovers in.  The fact that she put such care and thought into such a minor task proved to me just how much the little things matter when it comes to great service. Needless to say, I tipped generously, which, being a cheapskate, never happens. **ATMOSPHERE** I love the look of this place: overall dim (mood lighting) yet bright enough (with a lamp at each table) to not make eating an eye-straining task.  The aesthetic design really embraced the "out to sea" theme without being tacky, with each table being an enclosed case of sand, shells, and "treasure". The music, too, was very nice: instrumental versions of well-known songs at a volume that was neither inaudible nor overbearing.  Overall, the perfect eating environment. **COST** I was going to give this place 4 stars, until I looked at my check.  I was UNDER-charged for the quoted price of my meal!  Given that I took home enough leftovers to make another meal out of it, I essentially got 2 restaurant meals for less than $13 each! Highly recommend seafood lovers check out this place.
