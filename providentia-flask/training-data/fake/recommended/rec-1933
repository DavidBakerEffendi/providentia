A nice intimate place to grab sushi in Olde City.  It's extremely small so reservations are recommended! I think I'd heard a little too much hype, so my expectations were through the roof.  We arrived and were seated at our reserved table (party of 4).  We had our menus and the server took an inordinately long time to take our order (along the lines of 20+ minutes).   We ordered a multitude of rolls and I got miso soup as a starter.  It pains me to say the sushi was just above average.  I don't know if it's a California thing, but I am missing a certain taste or texture or sensation in my mouth that I just didn't get here.  Maybe it's because it was the end of the day on a Thursday?  Is that old joke about fish being flown in on a Monday really true?! Anyway, seems like a good place, but between the very slow service and the meh quality of the sushi, I probably wouldn't come here again.
