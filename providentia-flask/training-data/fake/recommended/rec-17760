In one fell swoop, Hot Diggity has put Philly on the hot dog map! I'll get to the food last, but first: - excellent, attentive, friendly service - from who I suspect must have been the owner - clean, welcoming atmosphere with clearly written, simple, easy-to-understand menu -- nothing confusing about this place Okay, now on to the dogs. I'm not a dog expert, but - - excellent variety (dogs named by city, with options including coleslaw, jalapenos, chili, mayo, etc. etc.). I ordered one that was a hot dog interpretation of a Bahn Mi - jalapenos, carrots, cucumber, and a vinegar sauce. Tangy, spicy, hot. The beef dog itself was really good - well cooked, nicely grilled, and full of flavor. Sign says beer coming soon. I'd rate this the best low priced dining option opening in Philly in years. Welcome to Philly Hot Diggity!
