Let me start by saying the service here is VERY good and the decor has a homely and inviting feel to it.   Drinks were pretty good and the food was decent but I expected a bit more.  I had the linguine with shrimps, cheese, and clams which was not bad but will add it was nothing to cry over.  I'll return in the near future and try something different.  MAYBE.
