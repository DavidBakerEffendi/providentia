HOLY30 is what I call it... lol I'm on the whole 30 diet and Hu Kitchen is my Holy Grail!!! It's AMAZING... Their Elk Burger was to F*#$&(@($*# die for!! and their root mash bowls are the bomb! Their Kombucha seriously should be served in bars across NY!! I'm addicted to their "Sweet Kale Crunch" which is totally WHOLE30 compliant - I eat it like granola with homemade almond milk!!! my only complaint: I can't order them through seamless because I live too far:( I love HU Kitchen so much I wanna be their cook when I grow up:)
