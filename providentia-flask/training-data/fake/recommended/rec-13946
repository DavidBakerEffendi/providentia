Ok Ok Ok.  They have burgers!  I moved across the street not too long ago and everyone who came over said, OMG!  You live near the Bistro!  I said yeah, it  looks like a happenin joint.  Open til 4 AM and they still serve food, got baseball games on, always a good sized crowd of people waiting for a table.   I was told by several people that they are the "scene" for the best burger in all Manhattan.  Well, it was around 1 AM and still unloading boxes and about 6 beers deep with nary a buzz my wife and I decided to get these best god damn burgers in all Manhattan. The verdict:  Excellent burgers!  but we also didn't wait in the line for an hour + for a tasty burger.  We got the takeout so we missed out on the "scene".  We will be back I am sure! I will add though that the best burger in all the land is in New Orleans at a place called "Port O Call".  Not even a contest. I give the Bistro 4 stars and not 5 because it did not topple Port O Call.
