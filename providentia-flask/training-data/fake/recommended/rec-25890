We were in NYC for one night only, and I was super stoked to eat at a legit upper tier restaurant. Sadly, and much to my dismay, we were very let down by this place because the service was absolutely appalling, and some of the food disappointing. Like any good restaurant, there was a wait - I understand that, no problem. We finally sit, then it takes frickin' forever a server to even TAKE our drink order, let alone bring a glass of water. It was busy and the restaurant was huge, so I let that slide too. After getting my sad green tea from a bag, we order. The food takes absolutely way too long to arrive, and come to find out our server forgot to put the bloody order in! At this point I am not happy, but wait there's more. After our food finally makes it way to the table, there is STILL a dish missing (softshell crab), that the server failed to put in with the rest of the order. That dish arrives after all the other food has been almost finished, and was nothing special to boot. All hope is lost now, it doesn't matter how good the food is. If you're getting some of the worst service possible it does not makes a shits difference. After all that, nobody bothered to bus our dirty dishes and there was not even a breath of comping anything. It's a damn shame because some of the food was really stand out (although some was very average), but it's impossible to enjoy when you're being treated like a leprosy infected peasant. But, after 700+ reviews this probably will never be read anyway. Lame-sauce.
