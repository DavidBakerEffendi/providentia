Char, I coaxed two Manhattan dwelling gf's and two out of towners to you with the promise of excellence on a plate and all you did was embarrass me with terribly rude and erratic (straight up emotional roller coaster--waiter w/ the navy and white stripe polo waiting on the first 6 person booth on the right yesterday around 1pm, I'm looking directly at YOU.) service and sub-par quality food. We need to take a break. Char is one of the only restaurants we regularly return to for brunch in Brooklyn. I've mentioned it in every and any conversation re: Brooklyn dining since they've opened. And while the service we've received in the past has never been stellar, it's never been less than good. And up until yesterday, I honestly thought that all could be forgiven by the chopped pork sandwich (with a sunny side up egg--it's not breakfast w/o some form of eggs, pancakes, gravy or grits) and shrimp and grits. But it can't. And it won't. Especially since the pork sandwich was not at all as good as it normally is/has been (extra salty, lack of sauce). It's time for me to find a new brunch standby. Back to the service. Navy/White stripe polo toting waiter, you seriously need to work on your attitude. I understand that shit happens, especially when things get crazy busy during brunch and dinner hours. And perhaps something happened w/ your coworkers or at another table (tension b/w the staff was obvious to any onlooker), but that's no excuse for the sass you brought to our table from the get go. Walking away without even acknowledging or answering a question about an order is not acceptable. Your lack of even a modicum of patience while taking orders was unacceptable. Sure, you started smiling towards the middle of our meal, perhaps you remembered that American waiters work mainly for tips? Or did that stick up your behind loosen a bit? Whatever it was, it was too little and much too late.
