Ordered a half craft of peach sangria which came out in a ceramic flower/tea pot looking thing (not what sangria should be served in)  I poured exactly one glass out of it and it was empty.  Wanna guess the cost $15.00 I could have ordered a single glass for 8.00. The half portions that they offer are not half the price a seafood appetizer that was 20.00 yep for an appitized I ordered a half portion and it cost 14.00 which it dosent state anywhere till you get the bill The chicken savoy was dryed out and had so much herbs on top of it you couldn't even taste the chicken.  I told the waitress it was terrible and got no satisfaction.  They I asked how a tea pot full of sangria was 15.00 and she told me she don't make the prices.  that would have been a good time to try to make your customers happy.  Guess she was busy with other tables.  I wouldn't go back if it was free. One night a week I go out for a nice dinner with the hubby and it has to get ruined.  By the way the prices aren't on the website for a reason. 2 people including a tea pot of sangria was 95.00.  the average entrée price was 20-30.00 and appitizers were 15.00-20.00. Congrats on ruining my night
