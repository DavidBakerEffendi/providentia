Our Order: Stuffed Mushrooms Mixed Pickles Oysters Apple Crisp Molten Lava Cake Coffee Stuffed Mushrooms: They were ICE cold. When I say this, i mean it tasted like it was microwaved then left to sit for 25 minutes. My group absolutely hated them. Mixed Pickles:This was interesting to me, because last time I was here they served us 3 different kinds of normal pickles. 1 Small kerby, 1 bigger normal style pickle, and 1 other half-sour pickle. This time we got something completely different. 2 pieces of pickled cauliflower, 4 pickled string beans, 1 normal pickle. Really nothing special this time around, mainly because i was expecting different. (and there is no description?) Oysters: These were served with a small side of pickled onion. Honestly we didn't even get a spoon to put it ON the oysters! I asked for cocktail sauce....they don't have it. Apple Crisp: For those who have never eaten apple crisp, it is sliced, baked apples with a cinnamon crisp topping served warm, with a healthy scoop of vanilla ice cream. Sounds delicious, right?.....This was served cold, with a teaspoon of ice cream on top. Edges of the topping were burnt. Was jut poorly done. Very upset with the way it turned out. Molten Lava Cake: My sister ordered this, and was complaining that the "lava" was cold and the edges were also burnt. Coffee: we ordered 2 coffees. One of the members in my group asked for a small refill. Turned out they were totally out of drip coffee. (and didn't seem to be willing to put another pot on. They close at 1AM. Why not?) I will never return here.
