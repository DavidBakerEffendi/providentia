Honestly I have mixed feelings about this place. Some dishes are great, others are simply not that exciting. The chicken burrito was very filling but lacked spice/cilantro etc. I recommend the beef tacos, comes with guac which makes it perfect. Complete with beans and rice. Chips are meh. When choosing salsa, do not be afraid of the labeling, the volcano salsa is perfect even though they consider it to be extremely spicy ---not the case.
