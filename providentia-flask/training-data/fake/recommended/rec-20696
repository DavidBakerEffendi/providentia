This place has one of the best roast pork (cha siew) and roast duck! Although it could get crowded during prime lunch/dinner time, the wait is usually pretty quick. They are one of those quick authentic cantonese cuisine. I love their cha siew, so I always come here to get their cha siew lai fun (roast pork with pearl noodles). Yummmmm!
