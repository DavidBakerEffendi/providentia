I left Vail, CO at 3am, flew to La Guardia, shuttle to the hotel, walked 18 blocks to Balthazar and my long day felt short after walking into this classic brassiere with that terrior of a brasserie that so many others miss; jumping on a stool at the bar revitalized my whole body. Started with a cognac/chartreuse based cocktail at the bar, which was truly delightful on that warm day. Order the Salade Lyonnaisse which was perfectly assembled, dressed and top with a poached egg that had to be dropped into swirling water, perfect texture and temp, nothing like this salad which you toss the egg into the salad. Lardons where lardons! Most say Caesar I say Lyonnaisse! It's so good to go to a French restaurant that serves amazing French wines from all areas and at all price points. I wish I was there with my wife or a friend, because the Half Bottle list is small but exceptional. Then on to the Bar Steak Frites, ordered a glass of Chinon and asked the bartender for a bit of sea salt which brought the whole plate together, (sorry Mayor Bloomberg), the skirt steak is harder to cut than a NY, but it melted in my mouth! The frites, well I had to stop myself from ordering another order . . . the barman served a lesser cru of Bordeaux which too was quite good to wash the steak and frites down with. Bouchon is excellent but feels brand new, where Balthazar gives you the feeling that you are in a 1930s Paris brasserie, the surroundings seem historic like its been there for 100 years! Don't change anything!
