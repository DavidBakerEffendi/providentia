Chicken over rice!   I tried the chicken over rice this past week when I went to NY for a road trip back to LA with a buddy.  After a night of drinking, I had to try this cart that I've heard so much about.  It was kind of funny cuz I saw about 50 other "halal carts" with chicken over rice on the menu but I figured, there must be a reason why 53rd and 6th is famous.. So we arrived there around 2-3 am and there wasn't much of a line.  Got our food quickly and started chowing down.  In the moment, I was thinking to myself, this is good but I didn't understand the hype.   btw, the red sauce kicked my ass... CRAZY spicy... Anyways, it was pretty good in the moment but now, back in LA, i find myself oddly craving this chicken over rice plate...  good stuff!
