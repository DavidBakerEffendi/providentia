I'm not sure my review will be adding anything new, but Southwark is a great bar and restaurant. George and Kip are knowledgeable and congenial.  Southwark is the perfect place to bring a date or sit alone and read a book.  A good conversation with those around you is sure to spring up.  The crowd is an interesting mix of those who live and/or work in the neighborhood. If you like classic cocktails or have a taste for rye whiskeys and the like, definitely go and try Southwark.
