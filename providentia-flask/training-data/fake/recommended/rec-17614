Extremely friendly staff with extremely good dessert. They have a very very extensive coffee menu with a lot to choose from. They also serve food which is pretty good. They have a lot of events going on every night like comedians and open mic. Very cute little coffee shop overall. Recommended dessert: Ridiculous
