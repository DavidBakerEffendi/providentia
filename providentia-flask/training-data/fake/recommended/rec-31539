Hands down best Italian BYOB.  My husband and I don't get out much these days with 2 little ones, but B.K. (before kids) we were real foodies, spoiled by all of Philly's great food. Food is terrific and well-priced. Love, love, love the antipasta.  I can still taste it. Not the usual meats, cheese, olives, but delicious marinated vegetables of all kinds. Each has a unique flavor.   All vegetables, love it, and I'm not vegetarian or normally fond of cauliflower. And who doesn't want to get called "Bella" by a waiter with a genuine Italian accent? Can't beat it.
