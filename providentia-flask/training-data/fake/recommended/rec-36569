Service was oddly mixed, with some attendants friendly and attentive, and others acting as if we were not good enough to be in their restaurant.  My biggest complaint with Balthazar, though, is that we were overcharged on our bill.  Granted, I should have paid more attention to the itemization before paying; but after a shared bottle of wine and being eager to find a taxi back to the hotel, I just glanced at the tab and handed over my credit card.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized that we were charged for a glass of wine that we did not order.  That might be easy to forgive and forget, if the charge for the ONE glass was not $28!!  That being said, the food was delicious and the environment was lively and very New York-ish.  I would go back, but my expectations for friendly, attentive service would be lowered, and I would carefully review my bill before paying!
