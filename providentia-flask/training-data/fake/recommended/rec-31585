As someone who HATED Diners before Tops, I have to give this "diner" a quality review.  The place  and food resemble nothing like a "Diner atmosphere" with "Diner food."  Instead, the atmosphere Is always lively and the food is actually very good!Unlike most diners, the food does not give me the vibe to be frozen, and the presentation of the dishes are shockingly stellar!   The one major flaw I found at Tops is that the fries could be hit or miss.  The service as well could really be great or really be bad, but this tends to happen at other restaurants on occasion.  It is pricey for a diner, but this is a prime case of "you get what you pay for." But don't come here just for the food. By far, their name to fame for me is their desserts!  They have a wide variety of desserts to choose from, and they are well presented behind glass cases.  Oh, the temptation!  Believe it or not, I always get the Tiramisu cake there (I know, who gets Tiramisu at a non-Italian restaurant!) and it is unbelievable.  It is by far one of the best desserts I have ever had.  It trumps all other tiramisu I have had, and I have eaten tiramisu at many ventures!  Plus, I am Italian, so trust me on this one and order a slice of tiramisu cake (and try some different desserts while you are at it).
