You can't go wrong with casual, cheap soul food. I've either ordered or tasted a good majority of the items on the menu - from the chicken wing on a burger to the kale and egg whites scramble and everything in between. Even when I decided to try a healthier option and get the egg whites and roasted tomato, asparagus and broccoli, I was pleased. Certain things I wasn't crazy about - the bbq shrimp with crispy grits was just odd together. It was literally just steamed shrimp in bbq sauce and cubes of deep fried grits. Actually, in general their grits are hit or miss to me, but those two things alone wouldn't stop me from coming back. I've also never had to wait but the place is super tiny so be prepared.
