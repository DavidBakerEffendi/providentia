HOLY BEJESUS. This place was amazing. I came here with a date, and was promptly seated outside in the beautiful, rustic, outdoor patio. After getting our delicious cabernet, one of the waiters pulled the retractable roof closed because it was windy as all hell (the patio has a retractable roof! WHOA!), and then it was candle-lit sexy time under the roof for the rest of the night. Even though our waitress was super busy, she managed to promptly take our order, and did a great job checking in with us throughout the night, even though she was a bit hurried. She didn't even say anything when I started screaming after I took a bite of my appetizer. That's right. Food orgasm. The ricotta, truffle honey, and bruschetta appetizer was so good I would probably request that if I had to pick something for my last meal. That was followed by a delicious artichoke and goat cheese ravioli (made in-house) with this unbelievable red sauce that had me telling my date how awesome the food was every five seconds. I topped off the meal with a deliciously foamy cappucino. Grazie, Uva. You are my new favorite italian place.
