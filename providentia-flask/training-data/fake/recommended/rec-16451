Went to Cafe 55 to have dinner Friday Night 5/16 it was pouring out Husband and I live close by and heard great things about it - well it's not great it's Superb We are both foodies and we were beyond impressed the service was wonderful for starters Sandy the waiter was a joy I ordered the bone marrow omg it's a must the perfect dish go ahead and order it you will not be disappointed my husband ordered the Hanger steak it was perfect and plentiful we also had the duck salad and it was refreshing and so tasty then we had the bread pudding with the dulce de leche topping excellent ! I hope that this place stays open Forever make it a point to dine here . We met the chef Vinny/owner this man is the real deal and his passion shows !
