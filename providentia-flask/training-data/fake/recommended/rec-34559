I eat lunch every working day. Kati Roll is one of my 2-3 go-to places, where you can feel confident of quality ingredients at a reasonable price and a great taste. Scott, Â who may be the manager there is possibly the hardest working service professional in NYC. He maintains a very high standard of customer service and does it all with a smile in a very busy lunch spot where the line goes out that door between 11:30 - 2pm.
