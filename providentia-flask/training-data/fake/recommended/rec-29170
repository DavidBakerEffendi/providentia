After some extensive research, I decided on Dalessandro's for the one place I would have a cheesesteak on my brief work trip to Philly.  I looked through the menu well in advance so that I could at least appear to have the sensibility of a local, but there was almost no need as the waitress was super nice and patient.  I got a cheese steak with cheez whiz, fried onions, extra crushed hot peppers, and mayo.  I dressed it up a little bit with salt and I have to say this thing was phenomenal.  The bread was nice and fresh and the perfect texture, and the cheez whiz and mayo combined to keep the moisture level absolutely perfect - not too soggy, not too dry.  I hardly stopped to take a sip of my drink before I had packed this one away and was looking for more.  So very glad I did not waste my time with Pat's or Geno's; I would definitely come back cause I just don't think it gets any better than this when it comes to cheesesteak.
