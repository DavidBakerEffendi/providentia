I agree with other reviewers that give this restaurant an outstanding rating. This restaurant has to be one of the best values in the city.  Staff are friendly, and we were seated within 5 min of arriving without reservations during peak dining hours on a Saturday night.   Our server was a true professional, and thoughtfully suggested ways we could stagger our dishes for the best overall dining experience.  Food was fresh and expertly prepared; would highly recommend the whole grilled fish.  Bill was very reasonable for the incredible quality of the food. This alone would have resulted in 4.5 stars for my rating, but as we were walking out, a gentleman (owner?) came from behind the group table where he was working, and shook our hands to thank us for coming.   A personal touch like this during a crazy Sat night causes the score to go up yet again to max number of stars.
