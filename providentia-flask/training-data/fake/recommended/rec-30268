Did not live up to expectations. The burger itself was good, and unique, and might tempt me back. However, it was way overpriced ($15-16 without any fries!), the place was nearly empty, the music they were playing was cold and weird, and the service was TERRIBLE! Our server had a smug demeanor and seemed to be annoyed to have to pay any attention to us, even though we were one of exactly two tables in the whole room. The food was very slow, and our sweet potato fries came out half-cold, half-hot. So yeah, bummer! This was a promising stop on the burger tour! Pick up your game and I'd happily give it another try!
