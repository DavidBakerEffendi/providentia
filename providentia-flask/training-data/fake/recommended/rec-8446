Too fast.  That's my complaint.  lol I asked how long an order would take, and I was informed 30-45 minutes.  That was perfect, as I was expecting my boyfriend home in 25 minutes, and he was paying.  Truth be told, they showed up in about 15 minutes, and I was stuck there, feeling like an ass for holding this guy up as we waited the extra ten minutes for my boyfriend to arrive to pay.  :P He was very polite, despite this, so we gave him a good tip.   But be careful, don't make any plans during the delivery time, or there's a good possibility you'll end up seeing them earlier than you expected. Food was good, too, if you're curious.  :P
