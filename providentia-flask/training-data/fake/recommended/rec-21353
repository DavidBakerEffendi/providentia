Average Yelp rating of 5 stars, after 112 reviews?  How is this possible?  Some of the 3-star Michelin restaurants don't even have 5 stars.  I had to see it, smell it, and taste it to believe it. Food (9.5/10) = As someone had mentioned in their review, forget the chalkboard menu, which by the way is a bit overwhelming.  Let the Hassan work his magic.  I had no idea what chaat was, but whatever it was, Yelp told me it was crazy delicious.  I informed Hasaan this was my first trip to this place, and wanted something with chicken.  With just that info, the alchemist proceeded to construct my chaat.  The product was very colorful.  Every bite had a different flavor, owing to the multiple layers of different ingredients.  Different textures (soft, crunchy, etc.)  Different flavors (sweet, salty, etc.).  Incredible.  I was informed that the chaat he would make for me is "basic," and on my next trip he would go "crazy with the next chaat."  My next visit?  This guy already knew I would come back! The man has full confidence in his product.   I also got the kiwi lassi.  I've had lassi before, but never liked it.  However, since it was a frequently mentioned item on yelp, I decided to go for it again.  Happy that I did.  Despite that my kiwi lassi, is not traditional, I enjoyed it a lot more than the other stuff I had in the past that were supposedly more traditional.  The kiwi tartness was not overwhelming, but well balanced.   Ambiance (8.5/10) = Bright cool environment.  There are a couple of benches against the windows for people to sit and eat.   Service (10/10) = As many mentioned already, Hassan is awesome and super friendly.  Telling you his story about chaat and his approach to his food and this little shop. Overall opinion = I am now a believer of the 5 yelp stars.  I look forward to Hassan going "crazy" on the next chaat he makes for me, the next time I'm in town.
