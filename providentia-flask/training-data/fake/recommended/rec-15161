I love a simple menu. This place has 5 items on the menu; the pork buns and 4 types of Ramen(shio, shoyu, miso, karai miso) and there are add-ons, like an egg, or extra meat, etc so that you can customize type bowl.   I had the Karai with extra pork. It was spicy and provided the right amount of heat!  I enjoyed this large portion of ramen. Out of curiousity I tried the melon creamy soda, and I did not enjoy it's artificial taste.   The free charging station for my was a plus being that my phone had died. It was a good meal in the summer, so I can only imagine how great this place would be for a meal during the cold winter months!
