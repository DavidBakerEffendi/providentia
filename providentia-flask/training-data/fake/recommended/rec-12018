Iris serves Stumptown coffee; which is a welcomed addition to the not-so-great coffee choices Brooklyn Heights residents have been dealing with up to this point.   The cafe sits on a quiet residential block; it's decor is both imminently pleasing and homey feeling.  The owner is there 95% of the time and she's friendly, helpful, and relatively cheery. The menu is sparse but everything on it is delicious.  Their ham and cheddar biscuits have me rerouting my daily activities in order to swing in and grab one.   They also sell a variety of organic and local grocery items: breads, milk, eggs, and cheese. However, like any good coffee spot with free wifi: come past 10am and every table will have one person at it with a laptop.  Meaning: if you come with more than one person in tow, looking for a table, you'd better hope you find someone that will be okay with sharing a table with you and your party or be okay with reassigning themselves to a table with a fellow laptop user.   In the summer this won't be such a problem as there is a park at the end of the street with benches and tables and it will be easy enough to grab coffee and biscuits and head there, but during the winter when it's cold and rainy I just want to be able to sit down in the warm and not have to play musical tables to do so. All in all this place rocks.  It is a well needed addition to Brooklyn Heights.
