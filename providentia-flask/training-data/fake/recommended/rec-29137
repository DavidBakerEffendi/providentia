Met up with area friends for dinner. Service was good, the bartender was nice, and our server, though a little quiet, was fairly attentive. It made me laugh that all the registers had "World f'n Champs" as part of their resting mode. The guac is a little limey for my taste, but still pretty good. The brisket burrito was big, tasty, and filling. An extra star for the Hard Pear Cider. I've yet to see anything like that in the Boston area, but I'll definitely be looking. It was light and refreshing, and allover goodness.
