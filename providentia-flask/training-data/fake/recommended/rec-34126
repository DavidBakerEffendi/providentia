I was in New Haven overnight unexpectadely and needed food late night. I did a quick Google search and ended up with Black Bear Saloon, across the street from this place. I called, they said they had late night menu. I got there and after I was able to get the bartendresses attention she gave me the option of wings, maybe.... So, I ventured out again and found Kelly's. Lino at the door got me past the cover charge for a band on a wednesday night. He was paying attention and a good door man. I was able to get a pulled pork qesadilla and some Berkshire Brewing Cabin Fever Ale. And it was allllll good. I was so happy to find a place to get food late night in CT. Considering that getting beer at a store is impossible after 8p. Fuckin stone ages. Â  Kelly's is an urban feel for sure. They had a DJ and a band that night which was great. I was the only white person there basically, aside from the bartendresses. That was fine by me. Lino took care of me and I will definitely be back.
