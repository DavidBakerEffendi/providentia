I would give it one star, but the food was actually decent. The wait time to be seated was short but the service was awful. They ran out of mostly everything, the waitress forgot I ordered coffee and then we were given the wrong bill by our waitress who spent more time talking to the bartender. Please hire more competent and customer service oriented employees.
