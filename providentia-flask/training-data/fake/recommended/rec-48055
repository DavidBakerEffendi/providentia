I'd say 3.5 stars. The location itself has amazing decor but I wasn't pleased with the service. It was a Saturday night so I did expect the service to be lacking a bit but waiting and waiting and then sitting to the most immature/noisy seating neighbors who probably had one too many was no fun. Getting hit in the head with a bag because of a narrow seating walkway is not cool. My poor friend was seated in a corner under a wall decoration. The food was good, not amazing but better then ok. I think it's best to go to this restaurant with 2-3 people. But then again I was with one other person and well I guess I had more expectations. Ah I'll give it a another try, till next time!
