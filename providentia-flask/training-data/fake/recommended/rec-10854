I hate giving aussie restaurants/cafe's bad reviews. I almost don't want to write this because I am heavily biased but. When I first started coming to Ruby's with my old office mates nearly a decade ago the food was fresh, amazing and you were always served by gorgeous aussie blokes straight from their surf  with their dirty blonde hair scrunched around their cute faces. Fast forward to yesterday and not the same experience. They've always had like two tables but the service was fast. Now you wait FORVEVER. And you could see why. There were two chic's an aussie and a yank and they spent more time having their mother's meeting in the back than serving anyone. The burgers were not only absolute rubbish the Whaleys burger had the weirdest texture like burnt vegan cardboard. I guess Ruby's has gone the way of Eight  Mile Creek across the road. It's Over.
