Stopped in with a friend for girls' night out. We were pleasantly surprised at how good it was! We started off sharing the chicken sate appetizer. It was generously portioned, just right for two to share. The chicken was perfectly grilled, very tender and flavorful. For my main course, I ordered the Spicy Thai Basil with duck. SO GOOD! The duck was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and there was a good amount of it. The sauce was spicy, but not overly so. I'd like to go back to explore the rest of the menu.
