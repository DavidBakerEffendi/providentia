this is one of the better thai places in hell's kitchen, it's pretty popular and usually crowded for dinner. I came a few times with friends, they can actually accommodate a large group, you just have to call ahead to reserve and they won't seat you until most of your party's there. I think I went once with maybe 20 people and they gave us seats in the back, we took up half of the section inside the restaurant on one side. I think their food is decent, standard thai, you can't go wrong with their pad thai, pad see euw, spicy basil noodles, fried rice, or curry. It's really really dark inside so you kinda have to eat in the dark, and it's also super loud.
