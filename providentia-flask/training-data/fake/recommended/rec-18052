I've been here a few times now, taken by my "friend," who frequents this gastropub. I've eaten here once and just drank the other times, and I've had quite an enjoyable experience each time. The time I ate, I had the grilled short rib banh mi, and my "friend" had a chicken salad sandwich (fancier than your average chicken salad sandy) and local corn with sweet chili sauce. My sandwich was great, albeit a bit messy, and my "friend's" food was also tasty. The standout dish was the corn to by frank - it was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing! The beer selection is impressive, and although I stick to liquor, I'd definitely recommend coming here if you like beer. Shout out to Fred the bartender, who is both hilarious and makes a mean Long Island Iced Tea - it's not often a bartender remembers my name throughout the course of a night!
