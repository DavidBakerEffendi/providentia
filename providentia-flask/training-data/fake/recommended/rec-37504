Don't get me wrong the food was quite lovely. There is a HUGE however. I can get spectacular quality food within a brisk walk of Fond in a more pleasant environment & they are pricy. I think I liked the old location better. The new location has a liquor license but you can BYOB on certain nights still. But there is something very wrong about the acoustics in this place which I find really distressing. It will probably be wonderful in the summer when they can open all the windows (on two sides which I'm looking forward to and will definitely return for!) but with all that class and some pretty but resonant tile it felt overly loud and crowded. It wasn't that busy. I suddenly realized why New York restaurants have all the Big curtains everywhere esp. the big long drapey Velvet ones. To dampen the noise, duh! They have noise blocker things on the ceiling, which I think are just painted canvases The food like I said was lovely. I had the lobster risotto with hazelnut and truffle. It was rich and creamy with chunks of lobster. I don't think I could have eaten a dinner size portion. If I had a gallbladder it would have been crying, it was rich with a beautiful lobster flavoured creamy goodness. OK, drooling now. My boyfriend had the short ribs which he practically licked the plate clean. They were obviously delicious. He offered me like the second to last bite, at which time I was stuffed. I had an oyster appetizer also. Wonderful champagne vinaigrette on top but they cracked one of them and I had to pull shards of shell from my lips which was really unpleasant. Yeah, I tip my oysters. Not very ladylike. I don't care. All in all if they can dampen the din I'd add a star.
