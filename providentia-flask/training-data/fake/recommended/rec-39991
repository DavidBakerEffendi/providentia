After a long morning of exploring the city during the wait for my passport, the atmosphere and food was exactly what I needed. The food came up quick, was fantastically freshly made, and went perfectly with my Strongbow :) The bartender (who was super friendly) recommended the tuna melt with bacon. At first, the idea of a tuna melt was gross, but I am *so* glad I got it! By far the best tuna sandwich I've ever had! Don't forget to add the bacon because, well, why the hell not?!The building is really neat and I love the vibe on the inside. It's a little oasis in the city! I wish I lived closer so I could come up more often!
