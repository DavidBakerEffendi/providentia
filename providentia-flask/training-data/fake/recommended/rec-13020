I don't know about you but whenever I visit NYC, I just have to stop by this place to get me some yummy lamb/chicken over rice! I was skeptical at first when my boyfriend recommended it to me on my first NYC visit. I wasn't a lamb person because of the muttony smell from lambs. However, I just couldn't pass up on something that everyone and their mother's loved. So I tried it. And I LOVED it. Their lamb was more like ground beef and it didn't have that normal smell or taste that lambs usually have. It's either beef or they seasoned it so well that you didn't even know it was lamb! For $6 you get a huge platter with rice, some lettuce, pita bread, and of course, lamb or chicken or both! DON'T forget the white sauce OR the hot sauce! You have to pour BOTH of them on there! Use caution for the hot sauce though -- it is super spicy! You will feel that burn in your tummy later! I usually get the combination but I'm beginning to love their chicken over rice more so than their lamb. But you always gotta have the lamb or it just doesn't seem right! This place has got so much business that they opened up 3 other carts around the same area., or at least from what I could see the last time I stopped by in NYC. So if you see dudes with yellow jackets/shirts, no worries, they aren't imitations -- they are legit. They got one across the street and two down the same street. If you go to NYC, you HAVE to try this. It doesn't matter if you don't try anything else but THIS, THIS YOU GOT TO.
