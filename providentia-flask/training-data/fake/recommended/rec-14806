I see a lot of bad reviews for this place, but I tend to disagree. They have a pretty decent selection of drinks, average pricing, and one HELL of a steak sandwich. "The Bourbonic Steak" sandwich is an incredible mix of steak, onions, bourbon infused sauce, melted cheese and a crunchy hoagie. For bar food, I am blown away. The sad part of this perfect creation is that it is only offered on the summer menu, and I expect it to go away once the seasons change. Until then, I will continue to get drunk and wonder into Mac's for this magical creation.
