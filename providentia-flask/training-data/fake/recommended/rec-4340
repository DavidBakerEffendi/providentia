This place is really nothing special. The last time I ate at a Red Lobster was five years ago and my food experience there was more memorable than at Doc Magrogans. I'm actually only making this review to warn you all of two things: 1.) Someone in the kitchen of this place is completely inept at steaming crab legs. 2.) We had the displeasure of having a server who didn't know how to take constructive criticism (of the food, not particularly her service) and proceeded to completely ignore a specific member of our party because she was the most verbal about it (i.e. asked to refill drinks for everyone at the table except her, offered to bring out more crab legs for everyone at the table except her, etc). She even made a back handed comment to the table next to us along the lines of, "It's so great to actually have kind, decent customers. Thank you so much for not causing any trouble". Her passive aggressive attitude towards us was disgraceful. I'm not sorry that the first time our food was brought out it wasn't edible and we wanted something done about it. If that's causing trouble in her book, she might as well quit her job now.
