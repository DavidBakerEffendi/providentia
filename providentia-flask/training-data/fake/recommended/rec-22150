I recently had my baby shower here, and it was so great. Let's first talk about the food. I've been to brunch at Palo Santo 2x, and had brunch served for my shower. Their menu is very focused and delicious. Honestly, I prefer that  - focusing on what they're good at - to them trying to do too much. The menu has enough innovation that I do think it really is unique in terms of Latin restaurants. I think this is one of the reasons it must have been voted best brunch in Park Slope. They do have the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had in the city. Not that that is saying much, because chilaquiles are kind of a rarity here - but the mole poblano chilaquiles are soooooo tasty. Right on par with something you would get at an upscale restaurant in Mexico City. For the baby shower menu we chose French Toast, Huevos Bañados, and the Slow Cooked Heritage Pork. My guests loved all of the food and drinks. Now let's talk about the event planning and service day of. This is really what is pushing this to 5 stars. The event planner, Gonzalo, was very responsive and flexible and sweet (and has a good sense of humor) - he was really lovely to work with. The service the day of was amazing - you couldn't ask for better service. The package we got included unlimited mimosas/sangria and no one's glass was ever close to being empty! Their back room was perfect for my party of 15 people - you could fit 2x that if you wanted, and they let us bring in our own flower arrangements for the tables. Highly recommend for an event, OR just a meal!
