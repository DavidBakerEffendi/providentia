First of all, there is NOTHING mediterranean here!! This is an italian cuisine and I have no idea why they emphasized mediterranean.. I work at a pharma nearby and my team had food delivered to our office. I had ordered a caesar salad and garlic cheese bread.  The salad was straight limpy, old and had a weird smell to it. The dressing was doused in parmesan cheese. The garlic cheese bread came in foil packaging and the entire cheese was stuck to the foil.   I was so upset as I had paid $12 bucks for this not so special food! I drove down there and showed the lady at the counter.  No one was sympathetic or in the least apologetic. They agreed to re make the bread but refused to understand my concern with the salad. They went on to lecture me on how so many companies choose them for catering blah blah......... omg!!! After much arguing they agree to exchange my salad. I chose garden salad as I didnt care for anything else after that.  They made a face when they had to refund a dollar difference. Fine dining?!?-----Not at all!! For the price, Ive had much better tasting food. Highly disappointed with taste, service and price. Never eating again!
