I'm giving this place 3 stars because of my two coworkers who I went with loved the food. This was my first time having Thai food and i was very disappointed. My friend raved about the place for years and i have heard about it from other people as well. I think it might just be something that I don't particularly care for, I had some shrimp in a red curry sauce and my two friends had chicken in a green curry sauce. I tried both their dishes and i just didn't care for the aromatic flavors. I would describe it as "flowery tasting" Â I've had Jamaican and Trinidadian curry dishes and i am a fan but I just didn't care for this type of curry. I love to try new things so i had to give it a try. Perhaps i could try a different place or order something else. the chicken wing appetizers had a good flavor very sour and spicy but they could have used a bit more cooking.
