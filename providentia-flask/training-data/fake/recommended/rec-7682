Dined at La Pulperia tonight for my friend's birthday. As I arrived at the restaurant, I literally walked past it because its not very noticeable. Walked into a tiny restaurant pretty cramped by the bar area where I found two out of ten attendees for the birthday dinner. Then they seated us down at the reserved table. The Birthday girl ordered glasses of Sangria. Mine had huge blocks of ice which water down my Sangria. There shouldn't be so much ice in Sangria. Me and one of my friends shared the PARRILLADA ARGENTINA and Sweet Plantains! First time trying Morcilla (Spanish Blood Sausage), it was a weird feeling but not like how we were disgusted of taking a bite of Sweetbreads which I though was Chicken. The Skirt Steak and Short Ribs were very delicious out of the entire Entree. I tried some SANGRIA-BRAISED SHORT RIBS and that was a very tasty dish. Boy the bathroom was hot, smelly and small! Overall the experience was NOT amazing and I finally cross this restaurant off my list. Our server took forever to give our table the check since we were in a hurry.
