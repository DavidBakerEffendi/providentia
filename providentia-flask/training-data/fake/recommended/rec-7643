It's definitely a rewarding and fulfilled Sunday lunch after a whole morning workout! The line could be mile long, but it will be never too long if you know how amazing the food is. I started with peanut butter hot chocolate. My heart is melting when I only smell it. After a sip, my friend even couldn't say no when I poured half of the cup for her! There are so many choices of crostini and panini on the menu. We literally want to try every single one. With a few rounds of debate, we ended up with crostini with egg salad, smoked bacon and spicy mayo. For panini, we had weekend debris (Italian sausage, scramble eggs, red peppers and chili oil) and roasted mushroom (caramelized onion, dirty chips, truffle spread, fontina). It's really hard to say which is my favorite because I enjoyed all of them. I could have finished everything, but in terms of weight wise, I saved some panini for dinner, which made my weekend food joy even lasted longer;)
