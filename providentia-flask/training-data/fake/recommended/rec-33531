Went for my birthday celebration with a few friends. We sat in a booth next to the wall- a mistake it was cold and drafty. The food was pretty good. Small portions but that is expected for Tapas. I liked my mini sliders although I was told they could only be cooked medium well which seemed strange. The cocktails- that was what I was excited about especially because they are sold in carafes so I thought that would be a good way to save a little $$. We tried 3 drinks and none of them wowed me. I was especially excited about the JALAPENO BUSINESS drink but it wasn't spicy at all and then when the waitress brought extra Jalapeno liquor it made it taste worse. As my friend said it tasted like paint thinner. The Tequila Mockingbird was overly sweet and just tasted cheap. I would give NIX one more try because I like the atmosphere and location.
