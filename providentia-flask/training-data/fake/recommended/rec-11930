As I was walking around Reading Terminal Market this weekend, I noticed quite a few people gathered around this place. I thought, hmm, maybe this crowd understands something I don't, so I decided to give Beck's another try. After ordering the étouffée of the day to-go ($7.51 including tax), I rushed home to devour my find. My dish was much better (read: spicier, more flavorful) this time around but still a bit too sweet from the corn. I think if they served the étouffée atop a bed of dirty rice (versus plain white rice), it would kick up their rating considerably. Both times I've visited, the girls at the cash register were curt to the point of rudeness. The first time I visited, the Market wasn't even crowded, so I don't think the hustle-and-bustle was the issue. I'd prefer not to visit this place again, but alas, sometimes I just need a convenient (and cheap) Cajun fix.
