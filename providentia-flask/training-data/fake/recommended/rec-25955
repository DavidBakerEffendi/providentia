Good southern comfort food, with a rotating menu, right next to the L train.  The location is nice and quiet away from the hustle of Bedford or Metropolitan.  This spot can get busy real quick in the evenings so get here as soon as you can.  The food is filling and tasty, without being too greasy.  We've had the catfish, the pulled pork, the chicken and Mac N Cheese.  Mostly were good without major complaints.
