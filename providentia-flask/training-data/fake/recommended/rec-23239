Great place! Friends and I went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. We were able to sit inside but close to the window so we had a view. The waiter was great at explaining the menu and offered a nice bottle of Riesling. The bread is amazing! I soaked it in my friends broth that came with the mussels and that was perfect. Ordered the Norwegian Salmon which was cooked perfectly with some beautiful red cabbage. Also had some Vietnamese coffee, which is recommended and ended the meal well. Will definitely be coming back.
