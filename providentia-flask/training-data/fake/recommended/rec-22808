I came here for a large dinner party for the first time and an okay experience. The room we were in was extremely small and hard to maneuver around. Considering we had a large party I was surprised the service wasn't better. We only had two water jugs being shared between 16 people and they only refilled them once. They didn't teach us how to use the grille or turn it off. The room was so small that our waiter couldn't really move around. The room became very smoky and it was hard to breathe at one point. The bbq was extremely expensive considering you cook it yourself. I tried to order bibimbap without beef but to no avail (don't eat meat) so I ended up ordering sushi. I got the Jamaican roll which was not that good (it was warm and super mushy) and the soft shell crab appetizer, which was a lot better. They did let us stay past 10, which is when they close so that was nice of them.
