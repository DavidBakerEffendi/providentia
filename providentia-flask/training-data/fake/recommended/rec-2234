This is still by far the BEST halal cart ever. I waited in line for about thirty minutes to get chicken and rice and it is worth it every time. I don't know why it's so addicting, but if I was a drug addict, this would be my drug. I'm not sure how they go about their pricing; I usually pay 6$ for a chicken and rice, but there was one night where I paid 8$, and tonight I was charged 7$. Still, for under 10$, this famous halal stand is well worth the wait and the money. If you order to go, you get a bag with their logo on it plus little packs of their white sauce.
