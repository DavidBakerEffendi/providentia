We came and got the tasting menu, added some dessert wine (the nectar of the gods), and had them tack on some dishes from the choice menu as well. Overall it was a fun experience. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and for the most part professional without being stuffy, observant and attentive without being suffocating. We were quite late, and they were very understanding. The sommelier didn't seem that knowledgeable, but I didn't really care. The food was tasty, mostly hits with a few misses (which weren't for lack of trying). The style is more French I'd say than anything else... with many Asian ingredients. I won't do a laundry list itemized review description and ruin the surprises, but I would recommend the bossam (pork belly over rice), the sea urchin, the crispy red snapper, the squab, the fried oysters, the Jungsik steak. I would stay away from the bibim and wagyu gomtang (although the wagyu gomtang I was not impressed as much because it tasted similar to very homey stuff an Asian mom might make... if you don't have an Asian mom it may be worth trying). I would recommend Jungsik, and would potentially come again to bring a friend!
