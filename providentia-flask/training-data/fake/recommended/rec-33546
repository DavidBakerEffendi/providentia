I have ordered from here numerous times, never really having a problem. Not the best food I have had from a chinese restaurant, but pretty good for this area. The last two times I have ordered, it took over an hour to arrive, the second time they forgot something. Â I ordered one more time, and this time it took almost an hour and a half. This is very unacceptable, and I even called after an hour inquiring where the food was, and they had said the food went out and would be there any minute. 25 min later, the food arrived, and the delivery guy was so rude. Never ordering from here again. I am sure I can find another place with too-thick of wontons and dried out brown rice.
