The sangria is DELICIOUS, and so is the food.  I've been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed all of the tapas, and the chips (including plaintains!) are also really good.   Be prepared to wait a while if you go on a weekend night, the hostess was very frazzled but we made sure she knew we were there, and eventually she got to us.  For being so busy, the service was not too bad.   Overall, a really big fan and I will definitely go back!  Fun place for a date or a group of friends.
