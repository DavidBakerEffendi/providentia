I walk by this little restaurant every Sunday on my walk home from the Farmers Market at McGolrick Park and always wanted to stop in for a meal.  It took a few months but I finally did it and I am more than pleased.  I'm actually ecstatic to finally find a wonderful restaurant that's veggie/vegan friendly so close to my apartment!   I was a bit skeptical at first...I mean, what do ice cream making hipsters know about Balinese cuisine?! Apparently LOTS! My boyfriend and I ordered 4 dishes to share (all vegetarian) - - Sambal Deviled Eggs: great twist on the classic deviled egg, love the flavors and spice - Terang Balado: was a little confused at first, is this an appetizer, an entree? a side?! who cares! It's so flavorful and SPICY, this could have easily been an entree for me if I had ordered a side of jasmine rice. And I think I'll do that the next time I go for dinner :) - Long Bean Lawar: Long beans cut up into little pieces with lots of crunchy bits in there. Served cold.  Again, could've enjoyed this more with a bowl of rice. - Nasi Goreng: The crown jewel of this meal!!  So perfect in so many ways. The fried rice topped with a perfectly fried egg, the sliced cucumbers to cool your mouth that is probably on fire after eating all of the above, and the shrimp chips. OK, maybe not strict vegetarian, but oh so tasty! Ended the meal with 2 desserts, the coconut creme brulee is a must have.  I was bummed they were out of their signature Van Leeuwans ice cream but that just means I'll have to go back again. The atmosphere: My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night, around 6:30 for an early dinner.  The restaurant is small with a small bar as well.  The entire time we were there, there were probably only 5 or 6 other tables, not crowded at all.  Super comfortable and nice service.
