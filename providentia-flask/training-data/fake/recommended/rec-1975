Cool looking place in South Philly (about 15 min cab ride from downtown.  Lot's of activity going on all around the place.  There's Geno's across the street and a seafood restaurant and bar on the other side.  A public basketball court is on the other side...it's a diagonal intersection, so a lot goes on.  The steak is chopped really fine and has a lot of flavor...and a fair amount of grease.  I had onions and provolone on mine and it was devoured in 5 minutes.  I sat at one of the benches as I ate and had sparrows and pigeons eating every little bit of meat/onion/bread that fell to the ground.  They do a great job of keeping the corner clean.   Pricing is $9 for a sandwich and condiments are located on a stand right across from the order window.  All in all, fast service, good food, and cool environment.  I will be back. Read Geno's review for comparison.
