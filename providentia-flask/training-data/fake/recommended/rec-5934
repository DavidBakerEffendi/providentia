Tried the shoyu and a side of chashu buns for my first visit.  Easily the best buns I've ever had, and this is from a Chinatown regular.  The broth for the shoyu was creamy and delicious, the chashu melt-in-your-mouth tender.  Noodles are nice and al dente.   A friend of mine knows the owner and indicated that he makes his own stock from scratch and it really shows. Entire staff was friendly - that's a rare find in Philly.  Will definitely be going back soon!
