Probably the ONLY Japanese owned sushi restaurant in the state of Vermont. A great variety of sushi and comfort Japanese food that is very authentic. However, I can tell some of the dishes are frozen / microwaveable e.g. shumai The bento combos are probably the best deals here. They usually change up the entree in the bentos every few days. I've only gotten California rolls here and can't really speak about the quality of sushi here. I only have two complaints about this place -The portion sizes are insanely small. I understand this is a Japanese restaurant but the portion sizes are perhaps only big enough to feed a 3 year old. They might as well call themselves a Japanese tapas place. -This is a family owned business and the staff is usually attentive. They occasionally have a part-time worker here who is extremely rude. Often brings in her boyfriend and starts talking while customers are still around. Unacceptable.
