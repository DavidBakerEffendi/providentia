Now here is a one stop shop that has upbeat energy, nice niche dining atmosphere, very good food, take out and various markets from fish, to meat, to cheese, to pasta and more. Whether you want to drink ( do not forgot the bar and restaurant upstairs) and / or eat this is a fun place. You can go from high to low with cost here.
