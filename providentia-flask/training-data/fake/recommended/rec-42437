Best Italian food in the city!  Best service!  Ample portions, and moderate prices.  Went here recently with a buddy, so ambiance was not a requirement, but will go back with a date.  It is a beautiful warm decor, with lots of wood. This is definitely a place where 2 could share a pasta dish, but it's so delicious, you may not want to.  There's a reason this restaurant has been around for decades.  Actually, several reasons.  Great food, great service, and an old world feeling that tells you when you enter that you are in for an awesome experience.
