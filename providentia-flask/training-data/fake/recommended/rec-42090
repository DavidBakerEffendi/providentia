I don't know what happened but this was not a good night for Cheryl's global soul & Cheryl (since she was here this night). First, I waited 10-15 min be4 anyone said anything to me. This was NOT a busy night(Thursday) when someone brought water it was another 15 min b4 the one waiter came from outside (patio) to take my order. Meanwhile Cheryl's sitting next to me ordering "cocktails". A table of four was sitting waiting b4 I came in and their food came 20 minutes after I sat down. I don't know how long they waited b4 Â I came. Finally my catfish came and it was dried out and the sides had no salt & pepper(flavor). Meanwhile, I table that was also there b4 me was wondering where their food was and so was Cheryl because she started asking about it. I asked for a side of tater sauce for my fish & Cheryl chimed in, "oh, we don't do that here". " oh, ok. But your fish is over cooked and tasteless" no one asked me how my food was. I guess since I was asking for every condiment to make up for the bad food and terrible service. Shame on you Cheryl's for not living up to your potential.
