Was very disappointed in this place. Should have turned around when they wouldn't honor the Yelp check in offer but decided that I would stick it out. Based on all the reviews got the chongqing chicken. Not sure why people rave about this. Hardly any chicken. Just a bunch of fried little chunks of skin or breading or chicken sliced so thin was hardly any meat to it. Flavor was fine with a nice spice to it but after trying to find any real pieces of chicken and failing I had to dump it and will now have to order room service. Very disappointed.
