The best pizza in Philadelphia. Despite being a Philadelphia born and bred Italian boy, I can admit that our pizza sucks. I spent years trying to find a pie in Philly that I actually enjoyed. A lot came close, but none really hit it, until I found Francoluigi's. At that point, it became my absolute go to pizza place. I cannot speak highly enough about Francoluigi's. Unfortunately, I've never been to the High Note so I can't say anything about that, I've always done strictly takeout or delivery. But if you're anywhere in their delivery radius and you get pizza from some place else, you're wasting your money.
