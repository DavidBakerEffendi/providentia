4.9 stars! Like we landed into some brassiere in Paris, is pretty much the ambiance here at La Sirene.  Did our research and could not deny the high stars being awarded here.   We were the first to arrive and was graciously greeted by a slender French beauty who attended our table for the duration of our fabulous meal.  Service:  5 stars. We started with the Tartelette De Chevre Frais Aux Echalottes of truffles, raisins and Confit Et Voile De Vieux Gruyere goat cheese tart with shallots, grapes and a veil of 90-days aged Swiss cheese.  A splendid start to what was to come:  4.5 stars. Our entrees were:  Tournedos Rossini or seared Filet Mignon over brioche with foie gras (pate style), shallots, port & red wine truffle sauce. An absolute luxury that was recommended to "eat this like a hamburger ...to get to the point!":  5 stars. Also the Magret De Canard Poele Sauce Montmorency.  A signature dish of seared moulard duck breast with cherry, port and red wine sauce.  Moist, tender medallions of duck graced in a luscious to die for sauce:  5 stars. BYOW, no corkage fee.  Wine service available (arrange in advance). Tally: 5+4.5+5+5= 19.5/4= 4.9 stars!
