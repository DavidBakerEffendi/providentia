I've been to several of the top of the mountains in culinary dreams, AND YOU, YOU ARE STILL MY FAVORITE. I don't even live on the same coast as you , and I think about you every week. Any time a friend says," I'm going to New York, where should I eat?"... I bark if they don't go to you they are stupid. During nice weather sitting on the patio is such a treat . I miss you
