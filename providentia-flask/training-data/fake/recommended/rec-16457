Here are some facts: It's across the street from my house. It's a bit out of place on my block. There is no sign. The halibut was delightful. The food takes a while to cook (especially the chicken). Our dessert came out in 30 minutes the other night. 3-0. I guess I'm just not all that impressed. The food is good and I like that the Brooklyn style of American food is pretty much taking over the culinary world (well, that and arepas), but it was all pretty buttery and the food didn't feel right with the ambiance. I understand it's supposed to be pre-prohibition-esque but does that really mean we have to have exposed dull light bulbs and bare walls? There's a mismatch going on and I'll chalk it up to beginner blues. I also feel really strange about the same amount as I pay at Dressler at a place that feels much less fancy.
