There's some serious magical thinking at work here.  Like we all so want Bonnie's to be amazing -- because it's quirky, because it's local, because it has a ton of great word of mouth -- that we transform what, objectively, is a mediocre burger into something transcendent through some kind of group delusion. Look past the open grill spitting flames at the rickety bar.  Past the rockabilly design touches.  And way past the looks of bliss on the diners around you. Focus instead on that burger.  The bun is a massive and unrelenting hunk of dry bread.  The lettuce and tomato are halfway to icicles.  And the burger, while substantial, well seasoned, and perfectly cooked, tastes like lighter fluid. I wish it weren't so.
