I have to say, I had been enjoying my weekly Sunday dinners with my dear friend for over a year at N 3rd.  The food was good, the staff was nice--which is why I was surprised with how they handled the situation when my purse got stolen from the restaurant when I was eating.  They offered the appropriate amount of concern, but they also offered me the bill.  Mind you, it was only about $30, but c'mon, it would have been the classy thing to do.  Can't say I have been back since, not for fear of getting robbed again, but out of some serious lack of respect.
