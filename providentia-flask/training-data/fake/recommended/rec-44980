We went there with friends on a Friday night. You definitely need a reservation if you don't want to wait. The place was dark, packed and not too warm. The service was good, although it seemed they were trying to rush us in the beginning. (A waiter took away my plate before I was done!) The food, however, was amazing. I loved the grilled calamari, and the spinach gnocchi. The appetizer with different cheeses and prosciutto was also delicious.Everything tasted fresh and authentic. Overall, nice experience.
