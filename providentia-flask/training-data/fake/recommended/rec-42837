Ambience, interior decor, service and the food were absolutely amazing. Simple but delish plates combined with extraordinary fast service. I need to admit i had times that i waited way more for a simple sandwich at lunch. Only advice is find something around to kill your time for an hour or two if you don't have reservations on a fri/sat night.
