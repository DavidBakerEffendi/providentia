The food is amazing as is the beer selections! I've come here for lunch many times and am always blown away by the food.  The brisket is AMAZING!! The only thing I didn't like was that it was a bit too dark ~ but that's me being nit picky.  Bring some friends and have some drinks, you're going to enjoy yourself!
