We tried the others down the street and this one here is hard to beat. Visiting this place during a hockey tournament doesn't give us much time to try a real live Philly Cheesesteak.  So who do we ask for advice?  The locals of course.  The famous places up the street make a decent cheesesteak on South Street but Sonny's beats them hands down. Others complain about the wait but I noticed that they made each cheesesteak as it was ordered.  No mass production of steak which is then piled off to the side to wait for the next order.  They also placed a metal lid over the steak while it was cooking to keep some of the moisture (or was that grease) from escaping.  The meat was definitely moist and not dry like down the street.  The bread was soft and chewy.  You can't go wrong with American cheese but I thought the cheese wiz was pretty good too.  We liked Sonny's so much that we ordered two to go for the plane ride back home.  The nice lady double wrapped our precious cargo for the trip.  Now I'm spoiled with Sonny's and will look at the cheese steaks out  west as 3 stars, maybe.
