My wife and I came to the Monk Room before a concert at Prudential. They seemed to be very short staffed and definitely frazzled by how busy it was. That said, they were very friendly and our server, Niassim, apologized for the wait every opportunity he got. As I said, they were clearly overwhelmed, but they did not take it out on the customers which is refreshing to see. We ordered the Three Trees salad and a Betty pie. Both were pretty good. They had a bunch of other pizzas that looked interesting. My hunch is that this place is either dead or slammed with nothing in between. I would come back here if I'm ever in the area, as it seems like a better option than the standard bar food places.
