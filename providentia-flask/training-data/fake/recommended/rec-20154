Nice people, so-so food.  Went with a friend, had some delicious appetizers & salads, then a disappointing lamb shank.  It was dry and only marginally tasty.  It was also HUGE, which would have been fine if it were delicious.  You know the old saying; the food isn't that good, but the portions are large!  I might return for brunch or drinks, since that's what most people seem to rave about.
