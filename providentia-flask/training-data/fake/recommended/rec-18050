I would come here often if I lived in the area or this part of the US for that matter. Really good looking beer selection with staff that can hold their own talking about it. The menu was awesome, lots of options for both meat and leaf eaters. I had the fried brussels sprouts which came in a huge portion and were absolutely addicting.
