Fantastic.  Outstanding.  Fabulous. Get there early and enjoy a drink at the bar which is uber cool white marble with friendly servers. The tables while cramped hold some of the best Italian food I have ever feasted upon.  The house special of the night Oxheart and Sweetbreads through me (and i declined) but the meatball appetizer and two pasta dishes were so light, so flavorful, that from the moment they touched your lips and moved onto the tongue it was such sweet pleasure.  We had a side of aspargus with some cheese on top. Perfect doneness and flavor. Because the tables are so close to one another we made friends with our neighbors.   He traded currencies, she was pitching him business, and because of that fact we got to see an enormous amount of food ordered and consumed.  All first rate. I shall return many times - although perhaps next time with a reservation.  Lucked out BIG time and got one of the 3 tables held for walkins.
