Eating at Riverpark was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning. My friend and I went for Restaurant Week. Once we found the restaurant, it was a terrific experience.  We both had the kombacha custard, a perfectly cooked piece of merluza, and the most fabulous dessert--Beer Sundaes, which absolutely blew my mind with their perfection. My cocktail was perfectly made and extremely unique. Not only was the food great, the service was really unparalleled. I ordered the testa tortellini and when it came, I immediately realized it contained an ingredient that I can't eat. A manager came over immediately, noticing that I wasn't eating and insisted on replacing it with something else. The waitress came over and apologized  to me, clearly upset that my meal wasn't perfect.  I was really amazed by the attention to detail and the efforts by the staff to make sure we had a great meal.
