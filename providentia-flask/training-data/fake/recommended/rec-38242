Wowwwwww is all I can say. I get the same thing every time I stop in which is once a week. the Chicken / cheese / guacamole burrito w/ mild sauce $7....I have to say theee best burrito I have ever had. (really the best). Just the right size, but loaded w/ flavor, and freshness... I'm only going 4 stars because I never tried anything else here. If I start to try differant items and like them, then I'll bumb up my stars.
