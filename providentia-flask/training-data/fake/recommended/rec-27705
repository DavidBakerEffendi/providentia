Talk about Customer Service! A friend of mine lost her father recently, and as a token of support, a few friends and I decided to find a local caterer to deliver a meal to the family.  I live in PA, so I was making arrangements via phone.  Initially, I called Mama Mary's and had a horrible experience.  I was given the run around for two days (the credit card machine was broken).  I spoke to 3 people there including the owner and I ended up asking them questions that they should have been asking me ie. Don't you need an address for delivery? Do you need to know our budget? Do you need an email address to send me a receipt?  After speaking with the owner, who was rude and disrespectful and got nasty when I requested an email receipt, I cancelled the order. Enter Cassandra.  I contacted the restaurant and was connected to Cassandra herself.  I explained the situation and my frustration and apologized for the late notice of the order (I called at 5:00pm on Wednesday and needed the food delivered at 12:00noon on Thursday).  Cassandra said 6 words that made all the difference "I'll take care of you...PERSONALLY".  We completed the order and she verified all my information throughout the process.  We settled on a menu and she ensured me that it would be delivered on time.  Cassandra even called me the next day to confirm all of the information again.  She knew I was anxious because I was conducting business from out of state.  I received my receipt promptly, as well as a follow-up phone call from Cassandra to make sure everything went well.   At about 12:10pm on Thursday, my friend called to say she received the food and was  so appreciative.  When I asked how it was, she replied EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!! A HUGE thank you to the folk at Sandra's Next Generation for excellent service and for being sweet and kind!  Whenever, I'm in New Haven, my first stop will be this place!
