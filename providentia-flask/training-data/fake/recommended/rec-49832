This is one of my favorite Turkish restaurants! They serve some of the best adana kebab, and I've tried adana kebab at many restaurants. Their soslu patlican is amazing and the lahmacun is also quite good. On a cold night, I always start with the lentil soup. The interior is very quaint and nicely appointed, though the neighborhood isn't too enticing. Whenever my parents come to visit (who are both from Istanbul), we make sure to visit Saray.
