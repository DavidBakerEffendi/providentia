After hearing a lot of hype about this place, I finally went with my cousin. It was a good pizza, but it certainly didn't blow my socks off. We got a regular small with sausage and shared it between the two of us. The bottom was a bit soggy when I expected some crisp. The ingredients were good, but I don't think it's very hard to just put fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce on a pizza. If the price was a little cheaper I would have given it 4 stars, but it's going to stand at a 3 for now. If you come with mediocre expectations, you will be pleasantly surprised, but given the price tag and the reviews/hype about this place - I was just a little disappointed.
