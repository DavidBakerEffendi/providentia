Great, simply put. Like the menu and beer selection always right on, just installed new tap lines so the drafts should only improve. Good during happy hour for small bites and discounted drinks. Great to sit outside too when weather is nice. Also, other good spots are close- Xochitl, DarkHorse (depends), Zot is decent, anyway, go here.
