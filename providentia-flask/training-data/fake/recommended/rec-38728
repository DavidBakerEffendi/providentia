I've been for brunch four time and lunch once. I would give it 5 starts for brunch and coffee and 3 stars for lunch. The coffee options are great! Try getting syphon coffee. They are perfectionist with the coffee. The breakfast is so great. My favorite is the savory waffle special that changes (cheesesteak waffle, huevos rancheros waffle). For lunch you must get the turkey panini - it's to die for! Â My only feedback would be to expand the menu a bit.
