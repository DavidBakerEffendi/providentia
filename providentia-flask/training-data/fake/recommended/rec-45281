I"ve been having lunch in Lebanon, NH. for almost 10 years but today I looked at Yelp for some suggestions, saw the reviews for 4 Aces Diner, and decided to give it a try especially when I read that they serve breakfast all day long. Holy Mother Battleship Missouri! This place is crazy good. I love corned beef hash and theirs was the best I've had in years. No Dinty Moore junk here...these guys make their own...big chunks...oh boy, was it good. They bake their own biscuits and muffins too. My wife had their pancakes, which were superb. Our waitress was terrific. She took the time to explain the unique items on the menu and even suggested some other restaurant in Ludlow, VT, that she thought we would like. I can't wait to go back. Thank you Yelp and thank you, my fellow reviewers, for helping me discover this wonderful diner.
