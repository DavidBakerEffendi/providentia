Not sure where all the good reviews are coming from. For our appetizer, we ordered the regular guacamole and the fig and bacon guacamole. They were very average - I could easily make the same at home and there was nothing special or memorable about it. Moreover, I expect corn chips at a sit down Mexican restaurant to be at least as good as Chipotle quality, which is not a high standard. These were not. Next, I got the Baja fish tacos for my entree. Again, it was pretty disappointing. Firstly, quantity - there are only 2 tacos, and no sides that come with it for $14. Usually less quantity means better quality, but not this time. First bite - the fish was dry. It's pretty difficult to mess fried fish up, cause if you just put some fresh fish in batter and oil, it's pretty foolproof. But they did, and it wasn't until after the meal that I figured out why. I'll get to that in a second. The fish itself also had little to no flavor and was very overfried. Most of the flavor came from the 2 sauce cups that they give you, which was passable. Finally, we got the check. For a party of 6, they added a 20% gratuity charge to our bill. I'm all for leaving generous tips, but a mandatory 20% tip for a small with under $15 dishes is just a little pretentious. Granted the service was actually very good - we were served very quickly, food arrived quickly, waters filled multiple times, check arrived quickly (we actually in and out within 50 min) - Â so I probably would have left something close to 20% anyway, but by making it mandatory, the high quality service is no longer commendable, just expected now. As we were walking out, we were able to see the kitchen preparing the food because their kitchen is right in front on the lower level. So I see the chef pull out a bag from the freezer with battered fish and throws some fish in the deep fryer. And that just completely explained the taste of the meal.
