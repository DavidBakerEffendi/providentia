This place won points for every tap being something awesome and perfectly appropriate for a pub: Smithwicks, Boddingtons, Harp, Bass, Guinness. Domestic fanboys fear not. They have your Bud in a bottle tucked behind the bar in its seat of shame. Also, points for having several relatively quiet nooks for good socialization around a table. This place lost points for a total lack of pitchers. Sure pints are great, but a discount for a pitcher's worth of pints would be nice. Or just pitchers. It also lost points for the music. While I don't require Celtic music or Flogging Molly or somesuch, JayZ and Brittney are not really my pub companions.
