I've been to brunch here about a dozen times (and dinner once or twice), and while this isn't the healthiest dining option in the South Slope, it is absolutely one of the most delicious. There's something for every palate and every appetite on the menu. Most of the offerings have an Eastern European, stick-to-your-ribs sensibility, but under that umbrella there's a lot of room for variety. Service can be slow if it's busy, but most of the time the waitstaff couldn't possibly be nicer. While the menu looks very carnivore-oriented (carnivoriented?) at first glance, the best thing on the menu is actually meatless - the portabello mushroom sandwich with two kinds of cheese and chipotle mayo. It's big enough to share and full of awesome flavors.  If you'd like to send yourself to an early grave, go for the langos (fried dough covered in either cheese or sugary things), or - even better! - get a burger fried inside of a piece of langos. Seriously.  Other favorites - the arugula salad, the pierogis, and (dinner menu only) the squash gnocchi with pulled duck confit. Okay, I have to stop writing this review because it's going to be at least two hours before I get to eat anything, and when I do eat tonight it won't be this, and that makes me positively despondent.
