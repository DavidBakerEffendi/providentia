I went here for brunch with a friend last weekend and it was a great food experience! We got there around 12 and was told that the waiting time was 40min and we were okay with it because we thought, if people are waiting that long then it must be really good. There are so much to see around the area so the wait didn't feel like it was too long. The weather was nice considering that it's winter so we sat outside. The service was great. I had the home made ricotta with the fruit nut bread, and it was sooo good. My friend got the Moroccan scramble. That was great, as well, esp if you want something heavier. We felt full, but not bloated so that was really good. Over all, it was a great food experience and would def come back and try other things from the menu.
