Ilili is out of this world amazing!!! I have only ever come for happy hour but I must come back for dinner based on how amazing the happy hour food is! First things first...I have never had a problem being seated for happy hour because there is ample seating and people usually share tables/couches with other groups. I love the layout of the bar area! It is so comfortable and relaxing and the low lighting truly allows you to unwind after work. I get there between 5:30-6 pm and seating is no issue; however, it slowly starts to become crowded. The food is just great! I usually always order the beef shawarma and the mini falafels! My go to happy hour drink is the black, blue & bubbles. I don't drink often so one of those drinks definitely relaxes my central nervous system. :) It is easily accessible via the 6 train and is an easy walk to Penn Station (which is where I catch the train home). The staff is always pleasant and attentive. I LOVE the restroom! It is so modern and upscale. It feels very comfortable. There is an attendant there to offer you whatever you need to refreshed after using the restroom (e.g., perfume of cologne). This may not seem like a big deal to most but a great CLEAN restroom sets a restaurant apart from the pack in my book! Overall, I really enjoy ilili and will always return!
