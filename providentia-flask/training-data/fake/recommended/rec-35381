Everyone says it for a reason, and i agree: the best pizza in new york. Being that it is one of the last remaining coal brick oven pizzas, it is also of historical significance. These guys make the best, thin, crispy crust pizza with delicious toppings that are top notch. The lines are insane, but well worth it. i usually get the regular, which has fresh mozzarella slices and basil on top. They do not do any single slice sales anymore (shame). this is my favorite pizza ever - every few times i go up to new york, i'll have to feed my craving for perfect pizza by going here.
