Probably the loudest bar/restaurant we have ever been to and we sat in the back, as far away from the bar as possible. The appetizer's are extremely pricey. We didn't notice the price (our mistake) when we ordered the hummus, ricotta and eggplant appetizer. It came in a nice three tiered serving platter but the serving was actually very small and none of it tasted very good. The cost was $29, which is just insane. We also had the flat bread pizza app, which was about the size of a pita and while it tasted OK it was not worth the $15 we paid. Service was fine.
