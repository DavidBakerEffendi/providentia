I lost 125 pounds and want to keep it off!  In my book, Goodbye Fatness, Hello Gorgeous, I look for eateries that will allow me to enjoy a meal without all of the guilt.  This is a great place for my eating plan.  I order the spinach crisp salad with dressing on the side. I usually split a dessert or half it and take the other half home.  The mini chocolate bundt cake is one of my favorites.  Unsweetened tea is a good selection. The calorie content is posted, which makes it easier to choose.  It is a nice café for lunch and the table setup is nice and roomy.  Give it a try for lunch.  It is worth a shot!
