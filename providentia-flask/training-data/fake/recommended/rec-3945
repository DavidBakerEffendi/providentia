Hands down the best and closest to authentic sushi I've had yet in NYC. Don't go cheap and get their set items, which are chock full of cheaper fish. Definitely go a-la-carte, even though you can easily spend about $100 per person. I like the fact that they have fish that's harder to find on the menu at other sushi restaurants. The look of the place is that of a typical higher-end sushi restaurant in Tokyo except for how the managers dress. I think it's funny that they look like they belong to the yakuza or something.
