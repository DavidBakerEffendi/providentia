Let's get the bad stuff out of the way. I noticed after coming to this place...one of my FAVES in the city...that the bartender may have accidentally served a minor. She gave him an ID that said she was born in 1988. Ummm how? Unless she drinks unicorn blood she looked like a high school student. It didn't help when he walked away to bartender stuff she blatantly said to the guy next to her "I'm not even sure who's ID I snagged, it was just in the room near my bag." This guy did a great job making drinks but come on don't lose your liquor license or your job because some chick wants to chill on amateur hour. **THAT IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT THIS PLACE IS AMAZING** The food, the atmosphere, the staff being actually nice in of all place northern liberties and they can come off snobby all the time! Other than this one incident we will come back. And by the way that guy (and the hot one Matt) makes a meannnn margarita! There is plenty of tequila in Delaware (near my house) but I would rather make the trip for REAL.
