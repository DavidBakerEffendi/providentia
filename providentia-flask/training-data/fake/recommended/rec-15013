Sat at the bar last night and it did not disappoint. I had a few cocktails which were excellent and very unique. I rarely order cocktails out because I feel like my tastes are different from most people (but I do love a good margarita) but I found 2 that I loved on their menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find they had real Creme de Cassis available, first time I have seen that in PA. Also the baked sweet potato fries were delicious! Although I am a sucker for anything with sriracha, so that may have had something to do with my loving them. I also had one of the cheeses they have on the bar menu and they give you about 3 times what I would expect for $4 so that was an excellent deal. Still my favorite place in the neighborhood, will definitely be enjoying their cocktails and bar snacks again soon.
