Saturday night blahhhhh :P  My friend lives close by and said she wanted to try this place.  Is waitstaff partial to regulars?? (know a place like this well in my home town....RON'S!!!)  I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered the macaroni and cheese and trout.  Nothing really sounded good, and that sure wasn't....okay, so I'm not that bitter.  People have bad days.....  2.5 starts....a hopeful MEH......
