Extra Virgin is DELICIOUS ! I'm so happy I got to eat at this restaurant on my visit to NY, when I return I will definitely need to eat there again. Since I was with a group of 9 (and we were starving) we ordered a lot of food, and I got to try a little of many different things. Extra virgin & Greek salad were delicious [ So was the wine we ordered, I cannot recall the name but they did have a nice selection] Mussels and scallops were good as well. Tomato & mozzarella salad was SO good! I sampled the special which was spaghetti & meatballs .. OMG zoo good & my mushroom crusted chicken with risotto was to die for, I ate EVERYTHING I would definitely return & if it wasn't as cold, I would eat outside.
