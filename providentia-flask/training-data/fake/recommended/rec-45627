My friend and I were complaning about how it was hard to find simple healthy food out in Philly, and then lo and behold we walked by Pure Fare!  The food was delicious, the staff was helpful, the aesthetic was lovely.  It's often almost empty for dinner so they don't have pre-made stuff, which was fine by us!  We sat down at the long table in the middle of the room and played on the floaty chairs and chatted while we waited.  Will definitely be returning.  Like, tonight!
