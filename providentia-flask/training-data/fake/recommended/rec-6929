Just made my first foray to Siggy's for brunch. The food was clean, well balanced, simple and well defined. The atmosphere was airy and comfortable and the prices were modest. Especially considering the all organic/local ingredients and the locale. I work in the neighborhood, so I am thrilled that there will be healthy fare and organic juices available at lunch time. Good, good food!
