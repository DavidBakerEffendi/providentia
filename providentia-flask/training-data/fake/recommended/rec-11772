I'm willing to give this place another shot, but it just didn't do anything for me. Got in here with two friends, close to peak dinner time. They far exceeded their estimated wait time, while we just sat there, and proceeded to sit a couple other people right in front of us. Finally, they gave us a spot in a tiny cramped corner (right next to the giant chandelier). We didn't want to wait any longer, so we just dealt with it, but asked to be moved to a more suitable place when they had a chance. They had multiple chances, but we were too hungry, so we didn't say anything. I disagree with many posters on here. Would never take a date here (over the top with its "trendiness," but not really a super classy (i.e. pricey) place). The food was mediocre at best. We had the Room Service Pad Thai, a regular Pad Thai, and a Pad See Euw (not the adventurous of meals, I understand, sorry, sorry). I asked for mine spicy. I emphasized really spicy. It didn't come out spicy. None of them did. Not even a little. And not even a "this-was-so-delicious-I'll-forgive-the-lack-of-Â­spice-due-to-the-explosion-of-flavors" sort of food. It was just mediocre Thai food. You know what I mean. (PS My review does not reflect the atmosphere/ambiance -- just the food. )
