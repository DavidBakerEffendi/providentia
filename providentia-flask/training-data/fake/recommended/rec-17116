I have been a repeat customer of Cuban Pete's since it opened.It's such a beautiful place full of life, wonderful food, wonderful staff--great atmosphere.  I found Lillian M.'s review of 4/25 particularly disturbing and confusing.While my experiences with the staff have always been great-everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  I just don't understand why the woman you were with felt the need to say her "husband is a state official".  I would also take that as a threat-I think many people would.  What bearing does that have on the situation?  What difference does that make?  The guys who work there are great people..I am sure that statement made them nervous and uncomfortable.It was a really unkind thing to say.  Then in your review you tell them you work for a newspaper!!  This is almost a form of being a bully--If you weren't happy just talk to them about it--no need to threaten!!  Your review has not changed my opinion of how great Cuban Pete's is--I will continue to go-and judging by the fact of how busy they always are---I think a lot of people feel the same way I do.
