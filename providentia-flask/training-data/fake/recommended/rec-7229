Potatopia is delicious. Even my leftovers tasted great. You can either order their premade options or make your own bowl. I got the tater tots and they were a perfect amount of crispy on the outside. The workers are really nice (they all seem like friends) and they are helpful if its your first time in. You have to wait a little bit (they make your order when you order i) but it's definitely worth it. Give Potatopia a try!! Not the healthiest option for sure but your tastebuds deserve the treat.
