I can't believe I've never reviewed this place before.  Corner Bistro is right across from the apartment I am soon to be vacating and it's my very, very favorite late night snack.   It is grungy, the staff is surly, it's always too cold or too hot in there, it's really freaking loud....and I love it.  The burgers are too big to fit in my piehole and the fries are crisp and greasy at the same time.  The perfect hangover prevention strategy.   And to avoid the wait, call ahead and pick those bad boys up to go!
