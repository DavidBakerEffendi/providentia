How do you rate Pats? Well, you compare it to it's nemesis, Genos. So, the winner of the food feud is definitely Pats. This place is run by a bunch of dicks and I'm not entirely sure the cheesesteaks are all that fabulous, but it was better than Geno's. Mostly because Genos doesn't shred their meat while Pat's does, and the wiz and WIT get mixed in with the meat. It was a fun experience, but I don't have a need to do it again. I'd rather go to Tony Luke's. :P
