To compete as an Italian place in NYC, you had better bring it, and they did/do.  Like many NYC neighborhood restaurants, you can barely tell its open from the outside, but once inside, the place was hopping.  Seating is tight, but not uncomfortable.  Noise was less than I was expecting.  Food and service were fantastic.  Highly recommended
