I love this place! Just had brunch and it was incredible. It met and exceeded my expectations. Our table got the guacamole to start, and as a picky guac lover, this dip was amazing. Then the complimentary sweet bread was equally fantastic. I ordered the Huevos Ahogados (Mexican version of Eggs Benedict) with the chorizo and it was incredible! Everything was perfect. Not only was the food excellent and at a great price, the service was super friendly and quick. Had a perfect experience here and cannot wait to go back.
