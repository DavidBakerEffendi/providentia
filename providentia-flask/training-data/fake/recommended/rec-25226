Disappointing. Minus one star for the wait and staff. Waited 45 min which wasn't too bad but then an entire hr for food to come. Â  Apparently slip was 'lost' and they initially weren't going to comp part of the meal but it seems like common business courtesy because we both lost an hour of our lives. Anyway, I'm all about the food anyway so would be willing to forgive. But not for a mediocre meal. Maybe I was expecting too much or maybe waffles were soggy from how many waiters spit on it but I only got through a quarter of it before it became too unappetizing to eat. Omelet was great and fluffy, but so are omelets at any random diner. Minus one for food. Bloody Mary was raved about by staff but had an unpleasant ratio of sour to salty. Keep your sour sake Mary and soggy waffles, I'm sticking with the east village who knows how to do a good breakfast.
