Here's how my experience went down. 1.  I went to Philly for some cheesesteak 2.  Got to Geno's 3.  Stepped on the 20-minute line that wrapped around the block 4.  Got to the counter and saw the sign, "This Is AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING PLEASE 'SPEAK ENGLISH" 5.  Another sign, supporting the new immigration laws in Arizona 6.  Yet another sign, "honoring" a police officer who was killed in action, but it was more like a propaganda poster when the murderer's Middle-Eastern name and the word MURDERER took up 80% of the poster 7.  Contemplated whether or not it was worth it to make a big scene about the issue 8.  Not worth it, I got to the register, I turned around and crossed the street over to Pat's. The food quality?  Everyone at Pat's say Geno's isn't as good.  I haven't had Geno's but I don't plan to give them a penny. Save your money, go across the street to Pat's. I've gotten a bunch of suggestions on my Yelp box saying these are the gimmicky tourist spots and to hit up the legit Philly CS places.
