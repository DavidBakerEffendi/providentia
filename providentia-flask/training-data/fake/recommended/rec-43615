Had a fantastic evening here on a girl's weekend in NYC.  To start, they were kind enough to hold our table, even though we got lost and were 20 minutes late for our reservation.  Oops! They requested we do the Chef's tasting menu since we were a "larger group" (of 6).  What a deal!  Our server was fantastic - as she seated us, she said "all you need to do is order drinks, and I will worry about the food!"  And that we did :) We were treated to patatas bravas, pane con tomate, squash with pralined cashews and crema, fried pequillo peppers, Brussel sprouts with chorizo, sautéed spinach with chick peas, pork chop, prosciutto and machengo cheese, and seafood paella.  It was all spectacular.  Then they topped it off with churros & chocolate dessert.    For $40/head, how can you go wrong???? It also has a good, fun, buzzy vibe.  I definitely recommend!
