I think I expected too much based on the past reviews. 4 of us visited Alta over the weekend and were disappointed in many of the dishes. We tried about 10 different dishes and left liking only 2; the pork empanadas and the beef short ribs. I was really disappointed in the fried goat cheese and the skirt steak chimichurri. The service was good.
