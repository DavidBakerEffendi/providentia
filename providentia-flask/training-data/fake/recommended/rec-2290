This Halal cart is right outside the Hilton and holy crap was there a line of drunks waiting for their fix. I waited till the line died down and stepped up to order you just tell them if you want combo or only one kind of meat. It comes with pita and rice on the bottom. Make sure you use the white sauce and hot sauce too! But man this is a TON of food for 6 bucks that 3 people could probably share. Let's face it though, you're going to be lit up and you will eat it all yourself so don't feel too bad. If you see one of these, run towards it. You will not be sorry.
