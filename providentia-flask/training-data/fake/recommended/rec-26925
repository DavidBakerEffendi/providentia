This is a small, unpretentious, quiet bistro with a relaxing ambiance, attentive service, reasonable prices and simply wonderful food. This is not a bad thing for a place I'm visiting for the first time. Came for lunch and were immediately warmly greeted and seated. In an instant we were provided with warm, crusty bread, a friendly smile from the waiter and menus. Then, water glasses were filled and our wine order was taken. For me, the star of the show was the mussels...lots of 'em...swimming in a butter and garlic broth that begged to be sopped up with the crusty bread, which I did. This may have been the single most delicious dish of mussels I've ever enjoyed anywhere. They were tender without being mushy and the butter to garlic ratio of the broth was spot on. My friend ordered the hangar steak, which arrived done exactly as he had ordered and which he pronounced as excellent. We couldn't review other dishes on the extensive menu since the other members of the group all also opted for the mussels, which, apparently, have earned quite a reputation. Desserts were uniformly excellent with special mention going out to the huge portion of chocolate sorbet I enjoyed, chocolate sorbet being a particular addiction of mine. From the friendly and pleasant waitstaff to the quiet, simple yet elegant decor to the superb wines and food available, these people are doing it right and apparently have been for quite some time. The prices won't terrify you either. From now on, Bistro Les Amis is my "go to" place when I find myself in SoHo.
