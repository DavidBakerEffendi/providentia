First time coming here last Saturday evening for dinner.  It was divine!  Great service, friendly staff, and delicious food.  Ordered the filet mignon on the hot stone--was thoroughly impressed; it melted in my mouth.  The prices were awesome and the sangria was tasty.   My sister has been coming to this establishment for years and always raves about it; totally worth the drive for the stellar food!
