Excellent tacos.  I have spent considerable time on the Baja Peninsula in Mexico and the fish tacos here, along with those up the road at Chavella's, are the best I have found in NYC.  The margaritas, made from scratch on premises are also excellent, as is the fried avocado and jalapeno taco.  Have been happy with everything on the menu.
