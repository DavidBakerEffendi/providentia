Hands down one the best restaurants in Philadelphia. The ambiance is casual and relaxed. Food is authentic, and flavorful. It's inexpensive and quick customer service. I order Rangoon at least twice a week if not more, and always bring large parties. I recommend getting the coconut chicken noodle soup, thousand layer bread with potato curry (a little bit spicy) or the coconut chicken curry, lentil fritters, mango salad, and ginger salad. Be prepared to have your mind blown!
