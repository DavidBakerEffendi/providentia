Came here with my boyfriend and was an overall good experience The restaurant itself is really nice. Kinda funky and in a great area We got the sheeps milk ricotta and the crab cakes. Both were amazing!!!!!!! Loved them both!! Â  For dinner we got raviolis and the squid ink linguini dish. Both dishes were yummy My one complaint about this place is that the prices are high and the sizes of the meals are tiny!!!!!! I would try to brunch but probably would not come back again. Not enough bang for our buck.
