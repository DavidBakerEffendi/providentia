We passed by this place so many times on our way to joe shanghai in the past, and never walked in due to the lack of decoration or customers within. This time around, with my trusted yelp app in hand and fellow yelper's reviews in mind, we walked into a completely empty restaurant. The menu was suprisingly large with many different kinds of noodle soup and stir fried noodl. With 7 different kind of noodles to choose from, it was a hard choice. beef noodle soup with narrow ramen - REALLY good soup base and chewy ramen. YUM! Even the beef slices were nicely done with a combination of meat and tendon. roasted duck soup with knife shaved noodle - loved the soup base even more because it was more flavorful. the duck pieces were ok, but the knife shaved noodles are chewy and yummy. however, they have to be eaten quickly otherwise they become soggy. will definitely come back to this "dive" for the super yummy noodles for under $6 dollars!
