This is by far one of my favorite places in Queens. Not many places can offer you a great whiskey or bourbon and fantastic food. The staff is suberb and knowledgeable.  Nate was our waiter and he was super accommodating,  funny and just all around a cool guy. I would recommend this spot for drinks with friends or a date.
