This place actually does have a "happy" happy hour. Its right across the street from the "S" train and through its warmly lit store-front windows, its hard to miss what looks like a fun and lively party amongst friends (where you would likely be welcomed) usually around 5-7pmish. The food is pretty outstanding. I've had the fish, shrimp & veggie taco's. I'm gravitating toward a vegetarian lifestyle so I might be biased in saying that the fried avocado taco was my favorite - but it was pretty superb! They have a pretty cool staff too. I especially enjoyed the warm welcome my first time there from their manager Sam, and how attentive he was. While i'm not much of a drinker, I did get to try a small sample of their Margarita, and its some pretty tasty stuff! Go with a few friends and eat well in a fun, relaxed, and warm low-key vibe.
