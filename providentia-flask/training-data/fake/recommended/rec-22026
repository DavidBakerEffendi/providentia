We had a great time here on a Tuesday night. I tried a raspberry ale and the Mr had a snakebite and an IPA. The food was good: toads in the hole for me and a cheesesteak for him. Both came with a big heap of fries on a too-small plate. Dessert was apple cobbler with an oatmeal topping and a slab of Vermont cheddar on top. It was about $45 all told - a nice night out.
