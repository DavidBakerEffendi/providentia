Looks like these yelp reviewers are some critical SOBs. They say "so good" and give it 4 stars, c'mon son. I'm giving in 5 just outta spite. I'm a cheap bitch but this place is the tits. Looks like I've found the spot for my Korean food fix. The food is very well balanced in flavor, not too salty, not too oily.  The options really make this place. You can do buffet after 5 (split in half, hot on one side, cold on the other), or pick up some meals that are shrink wrapped, there's even a microwave to heat it up if you'd like to.  It's mostly vegetarian, but the meat dishes are also well made. There's a great choice of beverages, including some Korean delights. It's a miniature cafeteria, or I guess in Korea it'd be normal size. Come in and grab a little of this, pick a little of that, get healthy!
