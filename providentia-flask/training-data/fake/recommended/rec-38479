So delish!! I always get the falafel bowl. I keep telling myself to try something new but I just can't resist the amazing falafel. So crispy on the outside and soft inside, not to mention they're so flavorful! Big portions of yummy food for a great price... What's not to love? Plus the staff is super great and it's always very clean. My go to spot for something quick and delicious... Highly recommend
