I frequented this place as I was in work training in NJ. This place truly reminds me of Bangkok. The decor is themed by bamboo/wood like chairs and tables. I had the Tom Yum soup and Pad Thai for the first time and the calamari salad to go. They were all amazing. The staff is cordial, just as most Thai restaurants are and if you're in for some authentic Thai cuisine, Tuptim will not disappoint !
