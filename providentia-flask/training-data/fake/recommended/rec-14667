One of my colleagues highly recommended this dosa stand to me, so on my visit to NYC, I specifically planned my itinerary so that I could make it for his weekday lunch hour. One of the things I noticed was that the cart was posted with all these newspaper and magazine reviews of the food from international sources, including France and Japan. Quite impressive! My boyfriend and I shared a Pondicherry Special and Jaffna lunch, which Thiru helped us split up into each of our take-out boxes. He was so sweet... he even also threw in an extra samosa for us so that we wouldn't have to fight over one :P
