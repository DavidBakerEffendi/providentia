This place was fine when my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant; then when the place began to fill up it became so loud that it was truly unbearable.  It was so noisy that we had to shout at each other from across our two-top and eventually stopped our conversation altogether. Mediocre food, mediocre service, unacceptably loud.  Will not be returning.
