I generally don't eat street food in NYC, but chicken and rice from 53rd and 6th is a must when you're in the area! They have opened up a few additional locations in the past couple years, but the line still gets long during dinner and late night hours. Definitely a late night snack/after clubbing type of food... I normally get the chicken and rice platter. It comes with pita bread and always ask for extra white sauce! If you're eating it there, they have bottles of the white/hot sauce on the side of their carts; however, would recommend asking them for extra white sauce if you're taking it home. The lamb is also okay, but too salty for my taste. BTW, make sure you go to the right cart(s)! They are other carts nearby that wear the yellow shirt/sweater, but make sure it says "Halal Guys" And, YES! The chicken and rice taste different! I think it's the rice and the white sauce that makes this place the best!!
