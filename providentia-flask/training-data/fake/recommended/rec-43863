The atmosphere of the place is very dynamic: cozy seating area, bar, and a shopping area to buy their homemade hot sauce among other items. You get a lot with what you order (at least with omelette I got). The fries are amazing, because they don't skimp on the seasoning. Tip: Eat your fries with a concoction of mayo, ketchup, and their homemade hot sauce . If it wasn't for their amazing service and friendly staff I would have given 4 stars instead of 5. But the people who work there are super friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to, so if you demand more of that damn delicious hot sauce they will bring it with smile on their faces.
