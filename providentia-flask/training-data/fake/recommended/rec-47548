We are used to the excellent Portuguese food from the Ironbound district in Newark and were leery when we decided to try out Paulo's. Boy were we surprised! We ordered a nice sampling so that we all could try a little of everything. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly- so nice and juicy! The garlic shrimp was delicious- just as good as the Newark restaurants. The chicken and pork was flavorful. Each meal came with rice and french fries. We ordered an extra side of red beans to go over the rice and boy was that so worth it! As I stir from my food coma thanks to Paulo's, it is clear that my family will be back again!
