I found this place by accident through their sister restaurant Land Thai Kitchen. We love Land and figured this place would be just as good. We visited on a weekday evening at 6:30pm. The place was packed but the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. Warning though - the restaurant is tiny. Just like Land Thai Kitchen's UWS location, the restaurant is narrow. There is limited space to wait for a table when it's raining outside. So you have to wedge yourself along a bench. They do have hooks for your coats but you have to maneuver your way around other people to get to it. Our hostess did take our order while we waited. So that helped expedite things a bit once we sat down. The other thing - since this place is so small, you are seated at tables with other couples/groups. Anyway, enough about the space - now on to the food. We ordered the Shrimp and Calamari Salad to start in addition to the crispy tofu. We loved the salad! So fresh and full of flavor. The crispy tofu may be something we may not order again. It just wasn't what we expected though we did finish the dish. For our entrees, we ordered the ginger curry with calamari and the wok charred with calamari except we substituted the calamari for shrimp. Unfortunately the ginger curry was a little too bland for me. It was tasty but it could use some more flavor. The wok charred with shrimp was excellent! My husband loved the dish and still raves about it. Despite a few misses with some of the dishes, we still enjoyed Pure Thai Cookhouse and will still come back to try other dishes. Definitely recommend giving this place a try if you get the chance.
