I was visiting NYC and found this place thanks to Yelp!  OMG the food was delicious, we had an incredible fondue.  The service was super good, classy but not pretentious.  We lingered for so long at our table enjoying the food and wine and the waiter was never bitter.  In fact he recommended this incredible pear infused conac.  It was seriously the best thing I've ever tased.  If not for Yelp, I never would have found this place.
