I was recommended this place by a friend who lives around the corner and after reading the yelp reviews I just had to try it. I swung in on my way to meet a friend for a drink a few blocks away (thinking it would be a good meal on the go). And I was right. Since the empanadas are pretty inexpensive (and I was starving), I ordered 3 empanadas: (2) spicy chicken & (1) pernil. The order came out in about 10min and both types were spot on and delicious. I didn't even make it to my second spicy chicken. Since I was on the move I didn't get too much use out of the salsas but the order came with a red and green. Oh and it's open 24hrs! I can't wait to go back!
