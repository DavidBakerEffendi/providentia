I have been chomping at the bit to try Hu Kitchen! I live in Florida and came to NYC this past weekend on business and ate at Hu Kitchen for all but one meal over the course of the four days I was in the city. I came to know most of the employees by name; Greg and Adam in particular are awesome guys! I follow the nutritional principles HK adheres to. The food is great (duh)! The ambiance and overall vibe is cool as well. Food taste and creativity is second-to-none! I can't wait to return to NYC, if only just to eat @ HK!
