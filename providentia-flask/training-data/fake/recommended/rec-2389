First and only time I went to Philly, I went to Geno's and Pat's in the middle of the night with coworkers, but I don't remember Pat's too well.  Although, the cheesesteaks here are as good as it gets.  Don't remember ever having better cheesesteak elsewhere!  If you can't decide on which one to go to...just eat at both of them!
