First impression: Nothing new, Steven Star knock-off interior. Staff was slow to greet us. Drink menu was solid, especially for craft beer enthusiasts, only issue was that they were out of my top 2 choices. Bar tender was slow to the point I though it was their first night. They forgot to take money for drinks and had to flag them down.   Tables were turned around in a respectable amount of time. Once we got to our table, almost finished an entire drink before server even made contact. Slow slow. Not overly impressed with the menu, but a vegetarian or vegan might be. I got the Reubens. I have never had a bad Reuben before, but this was an abomination unworthy of the name. Cold turkey, cheap sauerkraut, and generic Russian on paper-thin white rye. The fries had potential (potato and yam) except that they were soggy and, IMO, way under salted. The meal itself was unsatisfactory to the point that if it were not for the fact that I had just dropped 10 bucks for it, I would have left it on the plate. Tipped the server a little over 20% because he was clearly hustling. (He had broken a sweat when he brought our check.) Overall, it seemed pretty disorganized and like they were charging for quality that isn't there. I'm going to give them a few months to get their act together  and iron out the wrinkles before visiting again. .
