If you ever find yourself incredibly hungry this is the place to go.  The waiters walk around the tables with different cuts of meat.  You only have to flip your chip to green to get them to stop.  My first lesson was that its okay to say no and wait for the really good cuts of meat.  The lamb and bacon wrapped filet were my favs.  All of the meat is great though and cooked however you like.  The salad bar is also wonderful but you won't want to eat much of it or you'll easily fill up before you get to your meat.  You also receive several sides.   If your a meat lover then this is the place for you.
