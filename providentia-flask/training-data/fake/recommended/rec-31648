Ate here for the first time. The place is small and intimate. The staff was great and the food was ooooh sooo good. Me and my friend really enjoyed it. If you are looking for good Cuban food so that you don't have to patronize that rude, nasty and over crowded Cuban restaurant in Montclair this definitely for you.
