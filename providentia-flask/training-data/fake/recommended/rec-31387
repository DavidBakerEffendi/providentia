Great food! Consistent every time I go. I have brought many different groups of friends and they are all impressed! I'm Very impressed with this place. Super Small place but the food is a way above average for Jersey. Good for a big group cause then you feel like you are with all your friends and a personal cook! Keep the Good Food up! BYOB love that part too!
