I am in love with this place. The woman who runs this lovely restaurant with her husband is one of the nicest people I have ever met. The staff obviously takes pride in what they're making, and it essentially feels like you're a guest in their home. The kitchen activities are extremely transparent, and everything on the menu I've had thus far has been amazing. Also, as mentioned before, the crazy Indian soap operas are something I enjoy every time I stop in.
