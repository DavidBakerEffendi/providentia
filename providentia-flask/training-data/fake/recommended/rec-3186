Note that I am reviewing Char no 4 as a non drinker. I know the bourbon and whiskey selection is suppose to be what brings this place to the next level, so please keep in mind that my review is based solely on food eaten in the back portion of the restaurant. Went on a Mon night and was surprised to find the bar pretty packed at 930. Everyone was doing whiskey tasting methinks. My bf and I were able to get a table right away. Unfortunately our waitress was sloooooooow. She would pass by and make eye contact with me but not stop in to see if we were ready to order, how our food was, if we needed more water, or whether we were interested in dessert. Every time we needed her, we had to wave her down- thats an automatic annoyance in my book. To her credit, she was nice every time we stopped her. As for food, I expected a lot more. Everyone on foursquare raved about Pork Nuggets and I was disappointed with deep fried balls of ground, dry pork served with a whole lotta hot sauce. As for entrees, I had a chopped pork sandwich which was good but nothing to write home about. My bf had the hangar steak which was also good but he left hungry. My side of swiss chard was also just good. I think if you want to be a scenester sippin on fancy liquor, this place is for you. If you want amazing food, there are a bunch of better places on Smith.
