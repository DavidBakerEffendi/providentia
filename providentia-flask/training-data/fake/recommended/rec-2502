Like I said in my Geno's review, the difference between the two places is so minute for me that they are basically even. I just wanted to comment on my experience there. These two places hate each other and I love it. I got a cheesesteak at Geno's and walked over to Pat's to do the same. I then sat at Â one of the Pat's tables and sampled both. One of the workers there saw me with some Geno's and told me to get that crap out of here. It was awesome.
