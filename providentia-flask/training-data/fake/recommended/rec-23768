Wow. Just made an order for pickup on grub hub. Ordered two completely opposite things, the Cosmi's Jacked up cheesesteak with provolone and the Porto Burger(vegetarian). I've got to say they nailed them both! Very moist, tons of flavor, cooked perfectly. I have this place and Del Rossi's in Northern liberty as the best in Philly so far. Great Job, I will be back.
