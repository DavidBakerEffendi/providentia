My wife and I were married at the Mill on September 25th of 2010.  Overall we had a great experience.  We had eaten at the mill earlier in the year with my parents and had a great meal.  I had oysters and some seafood and it was great.  The food was equally good at the wedding.  All of our guests raved about the appetizers and the buffet we had was great as well.   This venue was reasonably priced and the staff was great.  I would highly recommend this restaurant / event center to anyone that asked.
