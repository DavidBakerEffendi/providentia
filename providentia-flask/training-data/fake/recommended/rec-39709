We came here for a Blackboard Eats promotion.. We made a reservation and the table was available right away. Our server was friendly and we had three amazing courses. The portions were very generous and the promotion had a drink pairing with every course. We finished our dinner with salted caramel ice cream paired with bourbon. So good. We have not been this happy overall with a meal in a while. Everything was flawless. Thanks for a good night, Char No. 4!
