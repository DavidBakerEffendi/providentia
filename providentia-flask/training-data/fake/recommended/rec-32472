Really, really good pho! If you don't ask for more, pho tai is what you will get. If you want more, ask for what you want and you'll get it. (shrimp, tendons, meatballs, etc..) Don't expect white glove service, but expect prompt service. If you can make it on Saturday, their Bun Bo Hue  is extremely good. Also, their chicken pho on Sunday is  very tasty. One minus is that their summer rolls have too many noodles for filler. Note: At times they are very busy. They are worth the wait!
