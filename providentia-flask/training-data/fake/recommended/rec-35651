Got dinner here this past weekend. I must say I have a hard time saying "Best burger in the city" because in my opinion you either get a burger right or you don't. Butttttt Village Whiskey makes a darn good burger! So juicy and cooked beautifully. Drinks were great. The Whiskey Flight was an awesome addition and the pickled beets were tasty. I will definitely go back. ***Plan on waiting to be seated***
