I had the chicken parm, and my taste buds were in eternal bliss for about 5 or 6 minutes. Best hoagie ive had in years. Im definitely a fan! ill be hitting this place up for  lunch every day now.  The only sucky part is they take cash only, so have  about a 10 dollar bill handy you might find yourself tipping them the price of the sandwich its so good!!!
