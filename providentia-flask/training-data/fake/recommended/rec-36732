I saw an article of The Meatball Shop in the NYTimes and the review was quite good. It was more of a celebration for two dudes that decided to create a restaurant that caters mostly to...well.....meatballs. Besides the fact that one of the owners is HOT...lol...my curiosity was sparked by the simple fact that I, too, love meatballs. I love meatball sandwiches, I love making them at home simmered in marinara and mushroom sauce for a long time on the stove, and I always have a pleasant experience when I eat them. I finally decided to come here last night with a friend of mine after getting wasted in the bars. I figured, what a better way to indulge my body than with pure meaty protein. The place was very enticing and lively, and when we sat down, we saw the menu and a couple of black markers. These are to be used to make our own combination as for how we want our meatballs. You can mix and match the type that you want(beef, spicy pork, chicken, and vegetable). You also get to choose the cheese(if you want) and the sauce to go along with them(Marinara, spicy Marinara, Pesto, Mushroom sauce). To make a long review short, I had the three sliders(beef w/Marinara, Chicken w/ Pesto, and Spicy pork with mushroom sauce). The brioche bread was light and toasted, and it complimented the burgers really well. I wasn't too crazy about the regular beef patties, but the Spicy pork and the chicken were just divine. I accompanied the sliders with the polenta, which was light, fluffy, and cheesy. I must say that I wasn't BLOWN AWAY by what I ate, but nonetheless, I will still come back here to try the other varieties. Also, very cool place to hang out in after partying hard in the city.
