After venturing out to what can be described as a "sketchy neighborhood", I was ready for a quality lunch.  I was disappointed at the taste....I ordered one wit  wiz and all I really tasted was this really strong flavor of cheapish meat.  This was my most disappointing Philly cheesesteak experience.
