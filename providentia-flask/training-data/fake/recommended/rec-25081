went here for a 30th birthday party, we had the pool table room blocked off for a few hours. we had good view of the mechanical bull. it was fun to watch people try to hop on the bull and get thrown off. they delivered food for our group, the food was very good. i loved the chicken fingers, pizza was pretty good. we then ventured out from our blocked off room to the games. thats where things went down hill. we got 20$ on a card. attempted to play skiball. swipe, button lights up, press button.. nothing happens. tried several different machines, didn't work. kept taking points off the card. others people were playing.. not sure how. so we kept walking, found minigolf. played a round, all was good. there are 2 airhockey tables right in the front of the place and boy did i want to play. so we make our way to the tables, and one puck is missing. no one can find it. so one machine is out of commission. we went back to skiball and by some stroke of luck it worked. played 2 rounds and we were spent. we left, and gave our points card to a young girl playing air hockey. granted i'm not exactly the target audience of this place but things should work and work well enough for children.
