Has to be one of the best values in Center City.  We stuck with the Sichuan offerings mentioned in other reviews (thank you for excellent suggestions) the Chongquing chicken and the fish filets in hot spicy oil--both dishes among the best Sichuan food we have ever had. The pea leaves are a must as a vegetable compliment.  Way too much food for two for one meal. We will savor the leftovers for days. And all this for $65. Highly recommended.
