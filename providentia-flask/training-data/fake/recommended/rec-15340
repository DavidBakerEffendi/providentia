Jimmy got a cheesesteak to go with American for the walk back to Independence Hall.  We let the time slip away from us, and found that we really needed to go inside to make our tour time.  They let us through the security line since the food was sealed.  We found ourselves a convenient park bench, and with 15 minutes to spare, decided to enjoy the meaty cheesy goodness in pseudo-secret, hoping the park rangers that were seemingly everywhere wouldn't notice.  We're not sure that what we did was against the rules - after all, we were outside, not in the statehouse itself.  And we did politely wipe up the whiz that fell from Keith's off the park bench since we didn't want to ruin it for tourists who find themselves in a similar situation.  Because no one wants to wait for Terri the Terrible tour guide to talk about 300 years of history in 30 minutes while your cheesesteak gets cold. When I go back to Philly in the future, I believe I'll one of the others.  Sonny's wasn't bad, but it was just meat and cheese and bread, so I wasn't impressed.  While it was huge and fresh, my Philly friends tell me I can do much better.
