As far as food carts go this place is definitely worth the wait. $6 meat and rice plates ,doesnt get better than that, my fav is the lamb and rice, chicken is a little bland for my liking. You get the option to add the creamy white sauce and the spicy red sauce to the dish. It also comes with side pita and salad, Â I usually ask them to hold the salad, it doesnt really do much for the dish. My roommate literally ate here everyday during Ramadan. Packed on Friday and Saturday night with club goers till the wee hours of the morning. A useful tip for people wanting to avoid the lines : The cart on the South East Corner has the exact same food and almost no lines, its run by the owner's brother and at times you will see his them moving food from one cart to the other across the street.
