What a great place!  I brought my friend here for a bday dinner.  Food was some of the best thai I've had.  Delicious and not greasy.  We had the pad see ew and green curry, both delicious.  If you like spicy food, ask for spice on the side and they bring out 4 different spices to try.  Décor is so nice and a really nice atmosphere.  The staff were so nice and attentive, not pushy at all and we didn't feel rushed.  They also brought out ice cream with a candle for my friend, making it a special night.
