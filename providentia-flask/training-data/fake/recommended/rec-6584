Incredible. Perfect. Fantastic. I am at a loss for words. REALLY fair prices, too. This restaurant is a gift from the gods. What a find! Special thanks to my awesome co-worker for telling me I have to go here when I'm in NY. The best moussaka I've ever had. Wow. Wonderful service, beautiful atmosphere. Oh how I wish this place was in Los Angeles.
