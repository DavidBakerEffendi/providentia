My favorite dessert spot so far! I LOVE the atmosphere - it really reminds me of Japan. Their attention to details from the decor to the presentation of the desserts is amazing. My favorites are the black sesame Crème brûlée and the toast with red bean and ice cream. Even though i've here many times already, it never gets old! Would love to try the lunch sets one day! CASH ONLY!!
