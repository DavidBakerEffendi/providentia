I took some friends here a couple weeks ago as I'm very fond of this place. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best first experience for them and now I'm rethinking going there every again myself. One of the servers went to get an ice bag from the back. She proceeded to break the ice on the floor which is normal but the issue came when she put the bag on the serving counter (where they orders go before serving or packaging for take away) and continue to try breaking the ice. I was so shock to see after she accomplished her task, that she never cleaned the counter off or even washed her hands. Â She when straight back to serving people outside and packing food for delivery/takeout. This was so disappointing as she never even thought about it in anyway. This is the only reason I've given this place 2 stars. Health should come first most of all in a restaurant. It's important that you stress this to your staff especially since you don't know who's a health inspector. Lucky for them my GF wasn't there at the time. CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN!!!!!!!!!!
