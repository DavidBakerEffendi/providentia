This place should really be more popular than it is. Came here for a group dinner, and Everything we ordered was excellent. Standouts were the squid tagliatelle (amazing!) the black bass and the hens of the forest mushrooms. The hamachi, lobster toast, cauliflower toast, and eggs and caviar were also delicious. Octopus was very flavorful too, super tender and cooked perfectly. Just a tad on the salty side for my tastes but still wonderful. Will definitely come here again, as the chef is super friendly and I could eat this type of food all the time.
