Such a great spot. I've been here twice, both with big groups, and the service is great even for large parties. We've tried arancini, bussels sprouts, crispy polenta, and orrichiete and everything was so fresh and flavorful. Sizable portions and DELICIOUS gelato/sorbet to finish. Great meal from top to bottom.
