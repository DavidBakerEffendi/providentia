Very nice feel when first walking in: red lanterns and a big fan. I came for Valentines Day with three girlfriends. Much nicer ambiance than I expected. I expected pho dang small run down place but it has nice clean red tables. The ambiance is nice - lighting isn't too dim and I love the mellow Chinese traditional music. We came around 7 pm on Friday Feb 14th and most of the place is empty except for two other tables. Seating is definitely not a problem. Food is mediocre. I was disappointed. I got the beef sukiyaki ramen and it was not good. The beef and bok choy is soft but the noodles are too soft and soggy. The broth wasn't bad but the ramen definitely leaves much more to be desired. If you're going I would recommend getting sushi or order fried rice (not on menu but I heard its really good). For dessert, we got fried red bean and fried green bean ice cream. This isn't on the menu but you can order it. I was disappointed in both. The red bean wasn't as sweet as I like. The green tea didn't  taste like green tea and had a weird aftertaste. The service was not good. We had to ask to be waited on and go up to the counter to pay. I expected the service to be better, but I guess my expectations should never be high at a small Asian place.  The waiter wasn't helpful when I asked for recommendations either.   All in all I'm not inclined to go back and if I do I definitely won't get the noodles.  I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't.   Decor - 3.5/5 Service - 1/5 Food - 2/4 Price - 3/5 Overall - 2/5
