Head full of art from the MoMA and belly in need of stimulation?  Walk the few blocks and treat yourself the Bengal Tiger. Verging of fast food Indian, the lunch special is tasty, hearty, hot and fast!  At under $10 it is more than enough for one, we added in samosas (get some) and papadams (skip 'em) and we left stuffed and happy, ready for more art!
