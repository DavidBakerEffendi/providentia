I had this 3 days in a row! I can't believe how good their sandwiches are. I've tried Paris in chinatown which is pretty darn good but this place takes the cake. The meat is plentiful (for a Vietnamese sandwich) and the flavors are done well. I tried their Pork, Classic and faux Pork. I could easily see myself converting to a weekday vegetarian with these guys. They are pretty fast but not fast food fast especially during a rush of people.. I've waited on line longer at a Starbucks though.
