I came here with my brother and mom for my mom's birthday lunch. All three of us are vegetarian. Wow. The food was so delicious. My mom and I got the California burger and Yuka fries. It was the best veggie burger I have ever tasted. Even the ketchup was delicious. It's a laid back atmosphere during the day. Plenty of seating and space to bring a group of friends and hang out.
