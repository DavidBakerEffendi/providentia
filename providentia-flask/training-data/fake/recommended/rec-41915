What's going on?! Girard Avenue? Tuesday night? Packed restaurant? ModoMio is special. In our party everyone was offering each other tastes of this and tastes of that. Everything was delicious. Great ambience, no attitude. Friendly waitstaff, amazing value -- $35 tasting menu. The only nit, the Tiramisu was a disappointment. If they don't make it there, they should find another source. Otherwise, a great evening. Would definitely go back.
