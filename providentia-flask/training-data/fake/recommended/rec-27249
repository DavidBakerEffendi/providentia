Warning: you may get addicted to their guacamole! Its simply amazing. The restaurant itself is so tiny, can only fit 10-20 people at most. The food here is not bad, not the best Mexican restaurant in the city, but not bad at all. I have enjoyed the meal we had here with my brothers. Its a great place to come and have lunch or branch. For a dinner however, you might need to wait for an hour to find a seat, so I'm not sure if this will be worth it. They have a good bar, friendly barman, and great margaritas - so fresh. Great tequila list! I have tried their: Arrachera- taco with steak with avocado (4/5) Calamari - squid with avacodo salsa (4/5) Ensalada De Mango - salad (mango, mixed greens, shrimp and you guessed it - avacado) (3/5)
