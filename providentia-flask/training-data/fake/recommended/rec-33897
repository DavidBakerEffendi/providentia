I normally sit at the bar. LA (laurieanne) is an excellent bartender and adds to a great dining experience!! The frogs legs are tasty and so is the steak tartare, also enjoy the duck breast. They have a unique foie gras doughnut that can give you clogged arteries and a diabetes but worth it. LA is also helpful when you navigate their beer & wine selections. Go enjoy some of the new Bed-Stuy. I was surprised you don't get mugged out there anymore.
