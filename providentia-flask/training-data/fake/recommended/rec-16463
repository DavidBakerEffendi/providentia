Had the Kobe burger and spicy tuna burger. They were tasty but not omg amazing. The buns, the mayo sauces, and the Asian slaw in the burgers are good, but prices are too high for a fast food styled place. Also I couldn't really tell the "Kobe" from regular beef. Seems more like an excuse to jack up the prices.. Overall, its a nice place to try once, but I wouldn't come back.
