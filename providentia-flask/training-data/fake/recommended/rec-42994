when i say bad experience.  i mean HORRIBLE.   went with friends.  were sat promptly.  drinks delish.  ribeye was a slab of fat with some meat.  was sent back.  they did not offer a new one but offered to slice the meat for me.  i said no.  they still brought it back in a to-go container.  they did this, as we later found out, to be able to charge us for it.  when asked for it to be removed, the chef grabbed the bag from table and said "ill f'in eat it"...we were apalled. the service started off wonderfully and ended in disaster.  this is not how a restaurant should operate.  AT ALL. the doorman, bartenders and maitre d deserve 5 stars.  everyone else should be fired for the way they acted.
