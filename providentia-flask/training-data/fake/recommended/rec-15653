holy wow, this place is great. we arrived and found there would be a 20 minute wait but we were able to quickly get drinks at the bar. the margaritas were absolutely fantastic and they made our waiting time fly by. the food was just as amazing. we got a cheese plate and then two pasta dishes. while one of the pasta dishes was only average, the cheeses and cavatelli with pesto were amazing. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great Italian food on the UES.
