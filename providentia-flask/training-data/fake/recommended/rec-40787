We went the other night with some friends . The place was tastfully decorated the Menu offers something for everyone I had a sausage in a puff pastry appetizer very tasty,for the entree I ordered a Shrimp Dish with Artichoke Hearts over Pasta in a Garlic and Oil Sauce well seasoned and beautifully presented. The only issue: Service staff really needs to be better trained in upscale dining and Menu items I look forward to returning for another amazing meal. We welcome this wonderful Restaurant to the neighborhood. We look forward to many meals with you
