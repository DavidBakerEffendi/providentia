Came here this past Friday with 7 people. While the bar area is extremely tight, the upstairs dining area is open and airy. Sat by the back window and had a wonderful view of the entire restaurant. It seems that 2 out of the 7 of us HATED this restaurant but the other 5 LOVED IT!! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants an upscale Steven Starr dining experience. Had the fava bean bruschetta, which was outrageous and the Corzetti, which was some what spicier than I had anticipated. The restaurant was packed, which provided for a great vibe. The other people with us had the arugula salad, cauliflower salad, pappardelle, tortellinin and ravioli. The portions are not huge so if you are hungry order the full size pasta dishes. Also, the drinks were delicious!
