I had breakfast at this quaint cafe over the weekend and it was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. I ordered the juevos rancheros waffle, which was absolutely incredible. The concept and tastes together made this meal out of this world. I had a ducle de leche latte as well, which reminded me of Argentina.  My boyfriend ordered the pumpkin waffle which was also fantastic because it was made with attention to detail regarding taste and texture.  The ambiance and decor were comfortable and cute and they had the food to back it up. We found ourselves wanting to go back there the next day.
