When you think of Cheese Steak think of Geno's Steaks in Philadelphia . I would come in on the 2 o'clock train just to have a sandwich here before my girlfriend got out of class at Penn. Later that evening while she was asleep I would go and get another sandwich. Cheese Steaks are better than cuddling. Do not order fries with it, this is not a hamburger. Think of it as an Italian American gift to the world similar to the Burrito in California.
