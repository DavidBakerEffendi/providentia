Fried. Chicken. Wow. This is the fried chicken I've been looking for. Somehow the seasoning seeps deep into the meat so even if you don't get a bite of the crunchy skin you still get a mouthful of yummy. My girlfriend had the risotto which was also fantastic. The portions are on the small size, but the prices are modest so it's hard to complain. The drinks were also great. I had the Bad Habit which substitutes a frozen grapefruit cube for ice. We went on a Sunday night fairly early. The ambiance is chill, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. It started to fill up around 8, but it looks like this place might still be flying under the radar so I'd check it out before the word gets out.
