Recommended by our New Yorker friends, The Little Owl was a delight. We OpenTabled for the last-available 5pm reservation, so had our pick of tables when we walked in. The host was very gracious and personable, and our waitress was knowledgeable not only of the menu, but also wine pairings, of which we took full advantage. My wife and I split the meatball sliders - they were a perfect appetizer to split or share (3 on the plate - who gets the last one!?) I had the steak, which was perfect, and we also had roasted asparagus and brussels sprouts - also excellent, but a tad buttery. Finished with the chocolate mousse and would have licked the china if my wife had let me. Many of the tables around us were trying to eat and run to evening theater shows, and the kitchen and wait staff, clearly pros at this game, helped them get their food in plenty of time to enjoy it and make their curtain. Great space, open window into the kitchen, top-notch staff; this is a great restaurant and well worth your NY food dollar.
