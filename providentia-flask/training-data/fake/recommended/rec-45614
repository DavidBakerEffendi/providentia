I head to this place for brunch every time I'm in Philly (it was recommended to us by a friend who is a native). There is usually a wait, but when it's nice out you're hanging on the patio so it's not too terrible. The service is good considering how busy they always are and very apologetic if you have been waiting. We've always had the same waitress even, so maybe she's just really on it. The lox plate is to die for and is huge. We always split one and just order an extra bagel. The white fish spread in unbelievable. I also got a blueberry muffin which was ginormous and tasted like heaven. We had the breakfast pizza last time that was meh, way too much cheese and not super flavorful. My only other complaint is that the place is super hot in the summer, open cooking area and no AC. Sauna. But it is so worth it!
