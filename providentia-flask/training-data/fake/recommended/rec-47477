In my 21 years of existence, this has been my favorite restaurant. The combination of the crowd, vibe and food is an unreal mix. EV has character and portrays down to earth sophistication perfectly. The food is frickin awesomely tasty. The menu leans toward italian dishes, but most of the entrees are well prepaired pieces of fish. this place is on my favorite street in NYC (west 4th). If I may, I'd also like to recommend the 55 Bar (on Christopher) down the street for some after dinner jazz - perfect night. -pk, pkafka.com
