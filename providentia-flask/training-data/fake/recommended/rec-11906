shared the mac n cheese, artichoke and spinach dip, and the brie and green apple sandwich. the sandwich came on while grain bread and honey mustard, which was nice and tasty. the mac n cheese was a little small, but i do love it when there are bread crumbs baked on top. last but not least is the spinach and artichoke dip which came with toast and pita bread drizzled with olive oil. what i liked about the dip was that they added some chunks of red onions and something else i couldn't quite figure out. overall, had a nice lunch with my friend. but i did think that the music and place was a bit loud. even if it was the good mariah carey playing in the background (pre glitter time).
