I lived in Woodside for 10 years. Peking, in my opinion, is a landmark in this small town. I usually order the #3 which is chicken, pork fired rice and a salad. The rice lacks a lot of flavor but the rotisserie chicken simply melts off the bones and the green chili sauce is what really completes the meal. The amount of flavor it provides to the whole meal is simply amazing and the salad is the perfect way to end your meal. For $5 you get a meal that does well to the stomach.  Over the years this place has started to change; everything from the place being renovated to the flavors of the food. My last experience with Peking was the worst, the food is over seasoned and it didn't taste the way it used to. I hope this isn't a continuous trend and an one time occurrence. If you ever pass by the Woodside, you have to try Peking. It's a must! Become a fan on facebook! facebook.com/pages/Pekin…
