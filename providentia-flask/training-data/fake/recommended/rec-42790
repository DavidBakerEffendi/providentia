Not sure if this place needed another review. Oh well. I was excited to come here after seeing the great reviews from everyone. Took a special friend here for his birthday and we feasted on several mini dishes instead of getting main ones because we wanted to try as much food on the menu as we could. Firstly, it was uncomfortable when we had to stand to wait to get seated. There was barely any space for us. But we got the table in the corner that we had our eyes on, so that was cool. Our server, Rob I believe, was a pretty cool guy. He always says, "You're welcome" after we thank him. That can get exhausting after a while. So props to him for keeping up. He always smiled and made us feel relaxed. On to the food: Edamame (because we just have to get them at a Japanese restaurant) Age Takko-Yaki Shumai Mackerel (their specialty, forgot what it was called) Fried Oyster Croquette Yakitori Set Ika No teriyaki ( teriyaki squid) I'm sure I am missing some dishes. I guess they were forgettable since I can't remember them. The only thing that stood out to me was the age takko-yaki...and croquette... I prefer the shumai at Oh Taisho. Theirs is much softer. The mackerel was too fishy for my taste. I was a bit disappointed, actually. Overall, it was a fun experience. We downed our food with a pitcher of Sapporo and some sake. I would go back if I happen to be around the area again. The wait can be long, though. But it is a cool place to hang out with friends and grab a beer. I like that it is close to Times Square so this is a good alternative to the pricey and touristy spots in TS.
