What Steinhof is, is a decent, inexpensive, neighborhood spot. What Steinhoff is not, is MORE than a decent, inexpensive, neighborhood spot. Many of the reviews of Steinhof seem to miss the mark by examining this place a bit too rigorously. You should not travel far for the sole purpose of eating Steinhof; it is not a "destination" restaurant. If you're nearby and want something easy, warm, happy, and simple, by all means go have some goulash and beer.
