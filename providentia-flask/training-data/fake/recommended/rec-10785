Empanada's 24 hours a day?! What's not to love? I came here by chance a few years ago when my dad and I were over an hour early for a jazz show and wanted something small to snack on. I didn't even know what an empanada is, but my dad convinced me. Ever since, I've been hooked. Not a good place for groups, or if you're in a hurry to be seated... the place is small, but in my opinion, worth the wait. The booze list is good, the menu is never ending. I love that you can pick just one of whatever you want so you can truly try a little bit of everything. Though they are small, they are constantly busy, so the customer service can sometimes be lacking slightly. Not really enough to leave a negative comment about though. A great drunk stumble, or for a mid day snack. I'll definitely be back for more, many, many more times! :D
