Well the wine glass was sticky the dirty martini was very dirty could only taste the olive juice Clam chowder tasty lots of clams and bacon so would say good almost very good Salad was tasty nice size Waitress not really attentive waiting to order another drink NOT a martini Ordered salmon medium ... Not where are my Brussels sprouts when they did come not bad could have been steamed then sautéed Full rack of rib. Falling off the bone not to bad a little less smokey sauce is my preference  but not bad No desert thank you Take what you want from this review but can honestly say will not come back
