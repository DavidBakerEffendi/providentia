I did my research and confirmed the cart on the SE corner and SW corner at night are the same vendor so we waited 5-10 minutes instead of the long ass line. Split a combo (chicken and gyro) as a late night meal. I'm not sure if it was cause it was late or it's THAT good, but damn I devoured my half. For $6 measly dollars you get chopped chicken and gyro meat on top of yellow rice with a few leaves of lettuce, aka salad, and maybe 1/5-1/4 of a pita. Â The white sauce is creamy, kind of like ranch but that red sauce, hot damn it's spicy! Literally 4-5 drops on the plate was fine. Solid food at a great price, definitely yummy!
