Another tough one for me to grade down. Although the place and the space itself is well renovated, and the vibe is quite nice. If you cannot fill the place with a nice group of friends it is a little hard to navigate. I have been there in large groups, small groups, and on my own. The bartenders are always on point. Self service has its ups and downs. And the beer selection is okay. Their rotating tap is my favorite part. The food itself is not great. Remember, it is a beer garden, go in and grab the classic burger or a brat. They really should just simplify the menu even more. Great happy hour. Feels a bit big, slightly intimidating and the host staff is almost always clueless.
