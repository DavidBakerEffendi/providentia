Consistently good and fresh and actually pretty amazing considering the price. The veggie quesadillas are awesome--really anything with their sauteed mushrooms.  The  people working there are cool and very patient when you try out your pathetic Spanish when ordering and picking up. Their cart on the corner of Elm and Bway is great for lunch--fast and reliable.
