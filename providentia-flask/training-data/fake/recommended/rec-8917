I was really excited to have an opportunity to eat here after watching Harold's strong performance in Top Chef.  And after reading all the great reviews for Perilla on Yelp I was ready to have a memorable anniversary dinner with my girlfriend.  Unfortunately, the dinner ended up flat and unmemorable. The meal did get off to a very good start with the duck meatballs and scallop appetizers.  The meatballs were tender and flavorful with a delicious sauce which was enriched even further with the quail egg yolk.  The scallops were seared to perfection and tasted fresh and sweet with the chestnuts adding a nice texture contrast and the little crisp adding a little saltiness.   After this great start we waited in great anticipation for the main courses, veal osso buco and confit of sturgeon.  While visually appealing both of these dishes failed completely on taste.  The sturgeon was cooked well but when combined with the other components of the dish (soju sauce and daikon) it was a confused mix of creaminess and strong off putting flavor (daikon or cabbage?).  This dish needed acidity or something to cut through the richness, there was just no balance in flavors and the crispness of the daikon was a strange addition.  The veal osso buco, which I thought would be a guaranteed winner, was the weakest example of braised beef I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  While the meat was tender, there was no richness in the sauce and it was not seasoned!  I feel that the shank was missing a strong sear and the sauce was lacking a good reduction to bring out the flavors.  The polenta underneath was also poorly executed, with a flavor of straight butter (no cheesy goodness) and resembling a dense clump of mashed potatoes instead of the creaminess I associate with good polenta. The service was fine but after paying the large sum of money for these dishes I will never return.  :(
