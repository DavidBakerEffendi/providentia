Be prepared to wait...we had a reservation for 8:30 PM last Saturday (10 people) and at 9:20 we were still waiting OUTSIDE for our table.   Someone from the restaurant kept coming outside to tell our group - "only a few more minutes, they are paying now"...then to say "so sorry, i'll give you wine on the house - just a few more minutes" - we played this game at least 4 times before unanimously deciding this place didn't deserve our money.  10 minutes understandable, 20 minutes almost forgivable but 50 minutes (and who knows how much longer we would have waited) is completely unacceptable.  The guy had the nerve to say "Please come back."
