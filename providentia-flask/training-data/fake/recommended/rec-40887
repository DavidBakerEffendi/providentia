First time trying this place. Got the lobster roll (based on all the good reviews) and the fried green tomatoes. Lobster roll was great! A little small but super tasty. Good bread and the perfect amount of toppings. Glad I got the fried green tomatoes too (also pretty good!) or else I would've been hungry again later.
