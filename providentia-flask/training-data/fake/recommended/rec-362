I should have walked away as soon as I saw the Health Code Pending status on their window.  But it's been a while since I've been to Room Service and I was craving their green curry.  I don't know what has  happened to this place in the last year!!  They must have changed mgmt or at least the chefs.  The chicken green curry was AWFUL. I don't even know how to describe it but just looking at it made my stomach churn.  The taste wasn't any better.  And their vege dumplings were COLD.  I know they serve them warm normally, but perhaps b/c of the weather they served them cold (God, I hope so)?  Just praying I don't come down w food poisoning...  I'm never coming back here again!
