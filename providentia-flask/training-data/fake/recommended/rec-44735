As a Canadian living in NY, there are a few things that makes me miss home and one of those things is the Poutine. When I first moved here back in college, I was shocked and saddened to find out that this savory treat is a rare find, even in a city that's known to have everything in excess. Pommes Frites fixed that for me, their take on the Poutine is authentic, hearty and delicious. For $5.5 (small), they use real cheese curds and have good portion sizes.
