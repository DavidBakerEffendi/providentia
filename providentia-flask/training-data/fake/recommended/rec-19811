The food is good, not great (with the exception of the popovers, which were brilliant). Unfortunately, it took an obscene amount of time to get that food to us, and the service in general was slow and lacking, e.g. During our over one hour wait for a table, the hostess disappeared inexplicably for 10 minutes on at least 4 occasions.
