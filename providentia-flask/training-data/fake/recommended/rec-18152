This place offers some of the better breakfast foods and sandwiches in the W. Philly area. The portions are huge. The prices are low. I definitely agree with Matt S about the area being overrun with unjustifiably higher prices for rather mediocre food. This place is definitely a refreshing change from such places. Also, the owner is also very friendly as you wait for your order.
