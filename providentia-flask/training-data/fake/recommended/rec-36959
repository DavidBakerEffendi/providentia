Was out there this past weekend and went to eat based upon my sister's endorsement. Was with a group of seven. The hostess was kind to seat us immediately after we mentioned we were out of town and looking to grab a quick meal. The smoked salmon for brunch was superb and well prepared. We also shared a Foie Gras pate plate. I am not a fan of it, but I must give a compliments to the quality of Â it. The service was quick and polite and the waiter was kind enough to give me pointers on the best way to order scotch. Always order it neat any other way is a shame. Btw the scotch was great. Not your typical brunch time drink, but I liked it so much that I had two. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the drink, but it was aged 12 years and was fairly valued. UPDATE: I finally check my receipt and the producer of the drink is Highland Park. I highly recommend it. I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the SoHo area shopping, people watching, or whatever is your fancy.
