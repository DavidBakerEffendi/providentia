We had an 8:30 pm reservation and the restaurant was packed.  Nevertheless, we were seated immediately.  The food was good, the service was efficient, but I left very disappointed. I guess my expectations were that this was a high-end restaurant with a great vibe given the fact I heard the concierge recommend it to another couple, Eater has it listed as one of 38 essential New York restaurants and Yelp gives it great reviews.  I left feeling like I had just eaten at a high-end chain restaurant.  The place just didn't have any real ambiance.  This is a place I would stop in and eat if I was shopping nearby, not a place I would make a reservation or spend a special occasion.
