Hey there I have to say I've heard so much about this place. My freinds swear about this place. Guys- friends of my I have to disapoint you friends.. I was enjoying my drinks and food at a table.  Normal tuesday night low key, Relaxation. Etc etc etc...... Let me just say you know the song " the freaks come out at night" for all u old school cats? Well the new song for 2014 is the roaches come out at night". As I'm finishing my food, I'm about to take a spoon of rice when I saw a baby roach look up at me. And be pissed like I woke up the mother f**ker! Up!   I was like we pay rent for this bill at the end night.. Just because u got moved out of ur old place cause the landloard exterminator moved your ass out, has nothing to do with me enjoying my food.... Ok.. To make story short now cause I'm enjoying this.... Hostsess is advise. Chef comes out and was very apologetic wth an explanation that the exterminator was there earliern like if hey its ok, u found the roach cause of A B C, now eat up and finish........... Word of advise.... If u want to eat there..... On tues, please first ask if the exterminator exterminated the same day............ OHMYGOD. ............ Not good people..
