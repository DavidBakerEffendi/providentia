Celebrated my dad's citizenship at Fornos. Everything deserved 5 stars! There's only been a few times where I experienced top notch service and top notch food. This place is truly a treasure. The waiter and the busboy were nearly perfect in regards to service. The food and wine were amazing! We shared several apps, entrees, as well as a desert. We started with some tapas, baked clams, and camarones al ajillo; solid portions and solid flavor. We were also given fresh bread with olives. Amazing! For our entrees we ordered the Paella Marinera as well as the special of the day; a generous portion of pan-seared Halibut with veggies in a citric garlic butter sauce. "WOW" its all I can say. We ended the night with a slice of their amazing Tres Leches as well as cappucinos and Sambuccas. By far one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. Keep up the good work, Fornos of Spain. I will definitely be back.
