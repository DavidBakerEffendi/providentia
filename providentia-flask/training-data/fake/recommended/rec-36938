The panchan here is great.  I haven't eaten so much panchan in a long time.  Luckily, we went at a good time because it wasn't busy enough to form a line.  I got the Kimchi Jung Gol with my friends.  It also came with an omelette which I loved.  The meal was great.  The place was good too.   I don't give out 5 stars usually, but I can't help myself.  The service was excellent.  The price was worth it.  There was nothing wrong with it, and hopefully I'm not jinxing myself for the next time I go.  Hopefully everyone else will be as lucky as I was when they go there.
