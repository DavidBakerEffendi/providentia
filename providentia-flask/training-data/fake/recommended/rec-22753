This is a great spot and potentially easy to look past. It's a mild Asian fusion with burgers and tacos. And they quite literally have every kind of hot sauce in the restaurant. Super cool interior too, with exposed brick Totally go here if you're in the area and are looking for perfectly done American staples done better.
