So i just went to Jim's Steaks tonight and words can not describe my experience. It wasnt sure what to expect since it is on South Street in an area that feels a little like Bleeker street in NYC. When I walked in my eyes lit up. The staff was fun and eager to tell me what to get. They were adamant, meat, wiz (aka Cheese Wiz) and onions. I threw some mushrooms and hot peppers on and it was one of the greatest sandwiches I can remember eating. I ate one sandwich at the restaurant (or should I say counter) then as I was about to leave I saw a sign saying the record for most sandwiches in an hour was 15, so I was intrigued and felt slightly embarrassed, that being said I felt one was enough for me, then I saw my inspiration. A 14 yr old kid had the previous record of 14 sandwiches in 1 hr, I had to get a second and what a great idea that was. By the time I opened it up in the car, the bread had slowly soaked up the meat, wiz , onions and everything combined was perfect. It is a MUST!
