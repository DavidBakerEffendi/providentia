Sorry to see all the negative reviews. Ive been eating at this place for about 10 years, back when they were in Montclair (and they were one of the best on a street that had 4 indian restaurants). I really enjoy the food. The lunch buffet uesed to be killer (I havent gone to the lunch buffet in a long time so I can only hope it is still as good). This is definitley a greasy spoon type of place, so if you are looking for refined Indian food you might want to go somewhere else. You will not walk away with an empty stomach! I have ordered from here many times and have never had a problem. Yes they rush you off the phone, and only sound like they are half listening, but they always get the order right, and I have never paid for a delivery charge (as per their advertisment). In fact the devery man is ussually very fast. I have had my food at my door faster than I can clean and set the table! Overall a great little hole in the wall comfort food type of Indian restaraunt. Probablly not the best place to take a hot date to (the decor is really lacking), but otherwise great.
