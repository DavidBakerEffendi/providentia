Going into Sabrina's I did not know what to expect. My brother and sister who both live in Philly chose to go there. I am still hesitant to make a judgement of the establishment until after the meal. One bit into my sandwich and it was supreme. French fries were crisp to perfection. The service wasn't overbearing nor was is non-existent. There was just enough items on the menu to please me my brother and my sister with no problem. I would recommend this place to any person, food lover, vegitarian(good options), and person in the area. As a cherry on the top, Sabrina's music choice for the lunch shift seemed to be a surreal choice. The album they played was J Dilla - Donuts. I cannot name one other restaurant let alone establishment who has played such a good/non-pop album from beginning to end. It made the meal that much better. The 70 year old man across the way had no idea who was playing, but he didn't seem to care. Going back to the neighborhood soon for my second visit.
