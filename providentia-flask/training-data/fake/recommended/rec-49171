Quintessential West Village. The restaurant is intimate and looks like the bones have been updated without upsetting too much of the original detail. For meals the place is best suited to parties of 2-4 tops. We showed up at 615 and sat at the bar for a drink before sitting for dinner and there were a few other couples scattered throughout the restaurant. By 7:30 the place was full with people standing 3 deep at the bar. By 8 there were so many people clambering to get in the door wouldn't close. Despite the crowds the service was extremely friendly and not-rushed. It felt as if they wanted us to linger and enjoy the meal and the environment and not turn the table over. Our waitress was helpful and pleasantly chatty. Added to the positive experience. Cocktails were interesting, well made and reasonably priced. Their wine list is very well put together and accessible from both selection and price. The food was the clear star of the evening. It was innovative without being weird and off-putting. There were so many tasty selections it was actually a challenge. The food was expertly prepared, well seasoned and nicely plated. The portion sizes were actually larger than expected and neither of us finished what we ordered despite repeated attempts. Highly recommended.
