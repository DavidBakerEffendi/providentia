The decor of this place was so beautiful and really made me feel like I was dining somewhere special.  Our server was very knowledgeable about all the entrees and was helpful in answering our questions and making suggestions about what to order.  For the main course, I got the salmon with Forbidden Rice as a side (what a name!).  It was absolutely delicious.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the rice was really flavorful.  Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would love to eat here again.
