The menu here is pretty limited but the food is very tasty. Â The side dishes are all very good. The kim chi is a little sweet but goes well with the rest of the food. I had a tofu soup with seafood and it was even better than BCD tofu house's. Hot enough to be good but not so much that I couldn't handle it.
