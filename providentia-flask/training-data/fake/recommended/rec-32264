Today was my first visit to Sketch. It was lunch with my two daughters and a friend. I love the look of the place with the drawings all over the walls and tables and the mix of chairs and what look like church pews. We all ordered burgers and fries. The waitress was very nice. The fries came first and they were hot, crispy and seasoned well. The green goddess sauce was tasty. The burgers were big and juicy. It was a good burger. I can't say it's the best in the city but I intend on going back to sample other menu items. I would recommend people who haven't been here to give it a try.
