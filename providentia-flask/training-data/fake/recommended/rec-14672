Momofuku Ssam bar is a frenetic spot buzzing with shoulder to shoulder patrons gushing over David Chang's creations. When the Bo Ssam comes out heads turn sharply and food jealousy sets in. I loved the casual nature of Ssam bar, it's energy and vibe are a far cry from many heralded culinary institutions and like the cuisine, this is refreshing. Chang's treatment of ingredients such as honeycomb tripe are inventive and flavourful and his ability to lift and brighten flavours which are often bogged down in heavy dishes is exceptional. I left happy and contented and perhaps I ate too many pork buns but I will be back for the Bo Ssam.
