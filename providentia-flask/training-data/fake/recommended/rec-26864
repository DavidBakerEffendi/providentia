I came here for brunch on a Saturday and the service was great. My glass was never past half empty before they refilled it. The food came really fast. They had a decent sized menu. I couldn't even decide what I wanted. The prices were reasonable and the portions were large for a French restaurant. The food was very good. I have no complaints. I would definitely come back again.
