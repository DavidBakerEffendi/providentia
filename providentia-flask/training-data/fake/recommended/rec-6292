Now for a really fun dining experience, Robataya is a must do place. Our group made reservations and fortunately were sat at the bar. Wow, what fun time watching these guys cook and serve. Everything is part ceremony and part celebration. The food was great and did we try stuff but use caution because it can add up quick. From what I can see and how I enjoyed myself, make this one of those "fun" nights out. You could make this a romantic dinner but, "why would you want to?" So go celebrate something at Robataya.
