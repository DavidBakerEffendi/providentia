The scallion pancakes and wonton soup are decent, everything else I've had was pretty much sub-par. Yes, it is cheap, but no, it is not good for much more than sudden midnight Asian food cravings that are the hallmark of college students like myself. Mostly low-quality, bland, generic and rubbery versions of classic noodle dishes and soups. The decor is non-existent (water is served lukewarm in little plastic cups, the walls and ceilings are bare). The waitstaff do seem patient and friendly for the most part. It somewhat bothers me that so many seem to choose Ivy Noodle over superior and similarly inexpensive offerings at nearby York St. Noodle, Bangkok Gardens and even Dee's Asian Kitchen. Also happens to be a cash-only place, yet the ATM on the premises is almost always out of order; what's up with that?
