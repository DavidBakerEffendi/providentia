Read the New York Times article by Frank Bruni. dinersjournal.blogs.nyti… I've felt this about the restaurant and the Chef a while ago.  And now it is official.  Marc Forgione is a Jerk.  I dined at this restaurant a month ago and I ordered the hangar steak -- issh...oy let me tell u it was like eating leather.  The Chef  I think is overzealous about his restaurant and his ego has taken the very best of this restaurant.  Sorry Forgione, I think I can get a better Hangar steak elsewhere in the city with better service and a wait staff that is appears to be normal and not scared of a jerk like you.
