I've only had appetizers at this point and I am already rating ilili. As everyone else suggest (coming from a non-brussels sprouts fan), get the brussels sprouts! It is fab when paired with the Lebanese thyme salad. Humus and pita is fresh with a simple, true taste. We are waiting for duck shawarma and phonecian fries...mouth is watering in anticipation (the tatse buds are primed with saliva ready to explore). Ohhh shoots the fries and shawarmas just came...and the verdict is: FOOD-GASM! (I RARELY give these out!) ilili has mastered the fusion of flavors, ambiance, Â and great service!
