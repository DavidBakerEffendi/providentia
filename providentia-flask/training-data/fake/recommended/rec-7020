As a New Yorker from Texas, I can honestly say this food is real and good! Evidence the chicken fried steak.  The owners are genuinely nice, the place is clean, design is pleasing and the food is worth a trip from Manhattan.  I'll be back to try the red velvet cake and the chilequiles for brunch ASAP!
