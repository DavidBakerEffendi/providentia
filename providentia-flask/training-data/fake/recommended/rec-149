I recently visited Chao Chao with some friends for the first time. I have only gone this one time, so this review only reflects on that Sunday afternoon lunch.  We were seated in the lower level, which was comfortable, but kind of too dimly lit for my taste. I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which was tasty and a good-sized portion for my appetite.  It was a little spicy and flavorful, with generous pieces of beef. However, I still felt that for a noodle soup, the price was a bit steep (around $11.00), especially compared to the other local Asian restaurants, which would charge half the price for the same size item. I also tried the soup dumplings - my dumpling did not have any soup in it, so while it was tasty, it was just a normal dumpling. The other items my friends ordered, which included appetizers and sauteed noodles, looked good and the portions were satisfactory - but pricey for what they were. Service was adequate and generally not memorable, either good or bad. In short, I found this place to be decent, but I will unlikely choose to come here again on my own. You're definitely paying for the decor and atmosphere more than the food. The food, while tasty, is not really worth the higher prices on this menu. Still, I guess it is an improvement to the pho restaurant that used to be here.
