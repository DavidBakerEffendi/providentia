A gem!!! Outdoor + BYOB + fantastic BBQ combined with prompt and informed service. We were a group of 8 and everyone was very satisfied with the quality of the meal and the overall ambience of the restaurant. Don't be put off if the restaurant itself is empty when you walk in- most people tend to sit in the outdoor area towards the back of the restaurant. Great if you're dining with a big group!
