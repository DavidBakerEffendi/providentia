Two words: Free-range kangaroo. Have been here a few times. Big place; never been full while I've been. However, its offerings are unique, its cocktails stellar, and the overall experience more than enjoyable. If you need a fantastic place that's a bit off the beaten path, you're willing to pay a nice bit of coin, and you don't have a reservation anywhere, come here, and you'll be more than satisfied.
