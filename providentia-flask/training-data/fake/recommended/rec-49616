LOVED the sushi here. I am no where near a vegan or even a vegetarian but everything was delicious. I like the quick grab n go options but it was also great to sit and try every roll on the menu! the mushroom one was my favorite. The manager came over and introduced himself and asked if we liked everything and was SO friendly! I really recommend this place and will definitely be going back lots!
