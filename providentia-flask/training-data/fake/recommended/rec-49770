This was a real pleasant surprise! I had the lampreri (?) and it was excellent! Portion was amazing! Please do not cut down the portion! The waitress told the cook not to make the portions so big after I told her I'd need to go box :-( Â it was a compliment, not a complaint! Location isn't the best which is truly unfortunate because the food is a true gem. I've never had south Asian food so good. I hope it survives!
