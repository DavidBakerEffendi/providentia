We've been looking for a place to have a mic e dinner without going to Montclair. What a find!  My husband and I had the coconut shrimp and scallops, pork ravioli with ginger sauce (really dumplings) for starters and porterhouse steak (he had blackened, I had Marsala sauce). We split a side of snow peas. Comes with a house salad-- perfect amount of dressing. Everything was wonderful, other than the salty Marsala sauce, but since it was in a dish on the side, no problem.  The service was friendly and efficient. The waiter knew the menu and was able to make good recommendations. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it was our first visit and the place was pretty empty-- we were there early. Will definitely be back to see if they are consistent.
