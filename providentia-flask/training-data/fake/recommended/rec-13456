Came here for brunch and it was an amazing experience. I've never had a savory crepe before, but I love how this place serves salad with each dish so I feel like I'm eating a balanced meal. I forgot what I ordered, but as long as you go with whatever you feel like (which is what we did), it shouldn't go wrong. At first, we happened to be seated in the back next to the speakers, and the music was pretty loud, so we moved to the opposite wall and it was much better.
