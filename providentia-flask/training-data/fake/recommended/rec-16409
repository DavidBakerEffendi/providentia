Great place. Good food. Good choices of sake (true to it's name). It's a cute small restaurant in right around times square, nice change from all of the generic food in the area. If you have time to wait, put your name on the list and wait for a table, it's worth the wait. We order seafood pancake and octopus balls whenever we can and the ones at Hagi were great!
