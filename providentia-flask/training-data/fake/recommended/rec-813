Dos Segundos is my favorite bar in Philadelphia! The Margaritas are perfection, and the Chilequiles are savory and bountiful.  The nachos are outstanding and i highly recommend the Tinga Poblana De Cerdo.  The bar has a great laid back vibe and prime outdoor seating on sunny days where i like to sit and eat sunday brunch with my husband and dog.
