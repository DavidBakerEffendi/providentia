i would give this 3.5 star for the main courses, but definitely four stars for the appetizers and desserts.... would i go out of my way from jersey to queens for some treats for thai food?  ....no.  would i go to this place every other day if i were to live in queens?... probably  yes.  this has been on my list to try for some time now after reading all the raving hundreds of reviews in yelp.  we had green papaya salad and cripsy watercrest salad as appetizers, and they were so great i couldn't stop devouring them and was probably full before we got to eat the main courses and we actually didn't make it to the dessert and had to pack them.  and i would put these two dishes in the same category as the thai foods at my number 1 favorite thai restaurant "thai chef" in montclair in jersey.  as for the main dishes, they're well executed (i.e. we ordered chilly basil sauce fried red snapper - and the fish is not soggy at all and taste fresh) and it was good, but it didn't blow me away.  and for the desserts, they had a lot of variety, which was pretty cool and amazing.  i ended up ordering five different types of desserts to go, and i was very excited to find out that they have black sticky rice with coconut milk  and sugar... which i couldn't find elsewhere but in asia.  and lastly i also like their outdoor seating too decorated with lively yellow awnings and flowers.
