I've only been to Fare twice. Once for dinner and again for lunch. But both times I really enjoyed it. They have solid options for vegans. Their drinks menu is unique. And their seating area outside is great if the weather permits. And if you're indoors, they do a great job selecting songs for the background music they play. Â I also like that it's a well lit restaurant.
