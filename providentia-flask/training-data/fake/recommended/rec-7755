Fresh salads and panini with ingredients of the utmost quality. Everything is delicious. The atmosphere is congenial; the staff extremely knowledgeable. It's a good thing I don't live in Astoria, because this can very quickly turn into an addiction. Then again, since I quit smoking, I kind of need a new addiction.
