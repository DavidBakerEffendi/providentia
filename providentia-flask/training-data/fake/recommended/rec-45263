The restaurant itself makes some things well - the Irish soda bread and the meat pie I had were good. Butoverall  nothing special and I found the prices high for the quality they offered. Though the waitress was nice, the look of the place and her attire suggested they needed new uniforms and desparate refurbishment of the place. it is clean but very tired looking from wear.   The fish and chips batter was good but I agree - hardly any fish. The gift shop though is 5 stars and prevents this reviewer from demoting it to 2 stars.  Well-maintained, nicely stock gifts of knick knacks and t-shirts from Ireland and Scotland.   So, I advise: Offer a side with your dishes such as meat pies, improve the food, and renovate the place - if some of the older Irish bars in Kearny that had been OK just for locals but basically tired dive bars can be refreshed, then why not the Argyle?  It is well-situation with the Piper's Cover kilt and gear shop down the street. Is worth traveling to Kearny for?  No. Better to go to Stewart's Meat Market for that and then take out food from here if you feel like some basic Irish/Scottish fare. The exception may be worth a trip out here when they do Robbie Burns night and serve traditional haggis.
