The service was great, but the food and the crowd were terrible.  I actually had a stomach ache after my spaghetti bolognese, but it is my fault for ordering a pasta dish at a mussels place.  But the stuff shouldn't cause stomach cramps, right? The crowd was pretty trashy as well.  I have to ignore a very drunk white female berreating another female 3 feet across from me.   Overall, stick to the mussels and beer/wine then you will be fine.  Also look straight ahead ... eyes forward and you won't notice the single white females bombs around the bar.
