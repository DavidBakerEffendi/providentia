I come to New York five or six times a year, both for business and personal reasons.  I was introduced to Les Amis almost ten years ago by a friend, and now whenever I come to the city I make it a point to have dinner there.  It has a relaxed Parisian bistro atmosphere.  Roy and the wait staff are warm and welcoming and, amazingly, he remembered who I was after my second visit.  I am a red meat type of guy and the steak frites and filet mignon are excellent, and I also love the French onion soup.  And the ahi tuna dish is very good with the ahi seared perfectly.  The service is attentive but not overbearing and is timed just right so you don't feel like you're waiting for your food but you don't feel rushed either.  The prices are reasonable for a New York restaurant of this quality.
