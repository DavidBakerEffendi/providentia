I don't usually write reviews, but I was compelled today.... DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT order on-line. I ordered online about 15 mins before I was able to walk through the door. When I got there, the person behind the counter said he had not even checked for on line orders, and once he saw that mine was waiting for him, he then realized they had NONE Â of the items I had ordered. I was forced to choose from other items available, which would be fine, except that the things I ended up getting were neither what I wanted, nor all that tasty. I'm gluten-free and it's a big deal for me to find a place with a bunch of options. I will give it another try, but I'm pretty disappointed at first visit.
