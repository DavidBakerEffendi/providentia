So, I was getting a tattoo done by Lance Hayes at Adrenalin Rush which is right down the street from Hellz, and he told me to go here after my tattoo to unwind and relax. Wow. I never thought Newark would have a really cool place like this! This place is awesome! The mixed drinks are really good and my girlfriend was having her favorite beer, and the prices are just about right too! Also the atmosphere is pretty hip too, and they get quite a crowd in here as the night goes on. Really popular must mean good... So I figure with all that, the food can't possibly be any good right? But I was starving because I was getting my tattoo for like 4 hours, and I could really use the calories right about now... Well I'll be damned if the food wasn't just good, but really great. I had the Brick City Burger, and it was juicy and perfect. I would call this place a really cool fun spot, a great place to eat, a nice bar, and a cozy comfortable place to relax and meet friends. Hellz Kitchen deefinately rocks, and after my next tattoo, I know i'm coming back here again! LOL!!!
