This is my default Portuguese restaurant.  We do take out from here (veal in Madeira is amazing as is their general bbq selection) and on occasion will go in for dinner.  It's always packed to the gills so we happily will sit in the bar area and we always order the filet mignon on a stone.  Sure, I leave needing to shower because ever last fiber of my being smells like steak but it's totally worth it.
