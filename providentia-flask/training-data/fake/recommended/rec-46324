Had a Blackboard Eats discount so boyfriend and I came here to use it before it expired. The restaurants that we go to through BB Eats range from okay to amazing so we never know what we're gonna get. We went with the scotch egg, whipped ricotta pot, a side of broccolini and the beef wellington. The scotch egg was a great little snack, it was our first time trying it so I had nothing to compare it to but it seemed pretty perfect. The whipped ricotta pot was standard as far as ricotta spreads go and the honey comb and fried jamon were good compliments. It's a nice filler since it comes with thick slices of toast. The broccolini was the only green we had. It was very basic, nothing special. The beef wellington came in an unusual presentation. It was unlike the sliced beef filet with a thin layer of puff pastry as you probably are used to seeing at cruise ship dinners or on Hell's Kitchen (the tv show). This one came completely enclosed in a pouch of puff pastry. At first we were confused as to whether or not they had given us the wrong entree. Inside the puff pastry was tender beef cooked perfectly. With that and the side of potatoes, it was a large enough portion that we were both full from one order. The beef wellington was definitely the best part of our meal. My boyfriend would not stop raving about while taking bite after bite and has already suggested we return soon. The only thing about Highlands was that it was extremely dark and loud. I tried my best to take pictures because I think that's one of the best ways to judge a restaurant on Yelp but it was a struggle. It was probably because we went late on a Saturday night, so avoid going late on the weekends if you want to avoid noise and darkness.
