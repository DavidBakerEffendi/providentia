This place is great for friends, for parties, for small groups and everything in-between. Open late which is super useful in otherwise sleepy BTV and no matter whether you've got a group that'll drink you under the table or ones who'll order chocolate milk (in a mug no less) the staff at VPB ensure that every time I've come here, we've walked away happy.
