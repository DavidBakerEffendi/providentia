Have only been here for the dranx and wifi. Night-time gin cocktails are bomb, but pass on the bloodies. I love that it doesn't get too crowded, which makes up for the ditzy baristas who are probably still drunk from the night before (hey, we've all been there). This is the place to take your friend who lives in Midtown and likes to pretend she's "adventurous" but is secretly afraid of people. It sure as hell beats Little Caesars.
