Went with a few friends on Sunday for brunch. It was quite empty, probably because it was really big inside. We did make a reservation but I'm pretty sure you can be seated right away even if you walk in. Servers were very friendly and I really like their decor. I haven't tried a lot mid-eastern/greed food before so I can't really comment on the authenticity. But the dishes were very tasty! We all had the brunch prefix (main course + side + drink), which was a good deal. I had the Fresh Fruit Atayef (lebanese pancake) with Hommus as the side. It tasted like a crepe and quite good, but I couldn't finish it because I ate too much pita with the Hommus and Baba Ghannouj. I love the Baba Ghannouj!! My friends had Lamb Dip, Chakchouka Eggs in Cocotte, and Truffle Eggs Benedict. They all enjoyed their dishes very much. The Lamb Dip smelled great. I tried a piece of eggplant in it and it was amazing! The only complain I heard was that the benedict had two very small eggs in it and my friend thought there was only 1 at first.. Compared to many other brunch places that require hours and hours of waiting, Ilili definitely stands out. I would want to go back and try their dinner menu.
