I went here for the first time a few weeks ago. The place is small and decorated simply. Service was excellent and friendly. We each ordered the original fish and chips, which was a hearty portion of battered cod and French fries. The fish was ok. My friend and I felt it lacked flavor, but it wasn't bad. The coleslaw was also just ok. I would like to go back and try another dish.
