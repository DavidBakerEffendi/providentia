Not as good as it use to be. When Kevin ran the kitchen the place had some of the best food in the city with a great crowd of people. They still have good late night bar food here and fabulous home made ice cream, but the sit down meals are not worth the price in my opinion. I strongly support the Â liberal causes the management stands for and Judy Wicks is a poineer entrepenuer in West Philly who opened up the White Dog when Sansom Street was nothing more than few lonely row house across an empty open field from Penn.
