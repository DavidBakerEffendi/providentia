Great addition to the neighborhood across the board! Came at 5, started eating & sippin tequila. Classy act... food is solid.. left at 9, barely coherent enough to hold a conversation with Cramer. Can't tell you the last time a restaurant gave a few complimentary beer backs. Great partnering of neighbors and businesspeople delivering the goods in this perfectly-appointment personal tribute to a city south of the border.
