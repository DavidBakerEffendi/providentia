Loved it the second I walked in! The filipino boxer Nonito  Donaire had a boxing match that night and I was searching for a place that would show the fight. Unfortunately, this filipino pub did not have a TV set up and the match was not on. Boo. Maybe the owners can take this into consideration next time Manny or Nonito is boxing-- would LOOOVE to go to a filipino pub, watch boxing, and eat filipino food with my San Miguel beer like a true filipina. Nonetheless, I  loved the dark sangria- cinnamony and delish and loved the in your face decor. I am filipino and growing up in america, a hip Filipino bar with Filipino writing on the walls just  doesnt exist outside of filipino homes and families. This factor alone is worth recognizing Jeepney for all their work in making a statement about filipino culture and food through their venue! It  is amazing to see people from all races and see filipino decor in popular places- not just in the philippines. Jeepney truly embraces that. Not to mention, the food is phenomenal!
