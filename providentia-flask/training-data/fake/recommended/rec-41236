Thanksgiving dinner for two with tax and a generous tip total: $180.  It was the smallest -overpriced dinner I've eaten in a long long time. The closest thing I could compare it to would be a first-class dinner on a quality airline like SingaporeAir.  But with no endless anything or free whatever. Details: No bread or rolls. Small glass of  sparkling cider (whatever). Choice of four appetizers; I had a tasty but  tiny watercress salad my girlfriend had the pork croquettes, which she hated. Choice of three entrees: We both had the turkey entree. Small cuts of breast with tasteless gravy, tasteless mixed greens and whatever mashed potatoes. Best thing was the  stuffing. Dessert: I had the smallest piece of mediocre pumpkin pie I think I've gotten in a restaurant or diner. And my girlfriend had a delicious serving of bread pudding. Anyway, I haven't been this dissatisfied with my Thanksgiving dinner/feast since 1971 when my loving but cashless mom served me and brother Swanson's turkey TV dinners.
