I've been here about 4 times now since opening in my 'hood - and every time it gets better and better! most recently, i dined for brunch this weekend. I enjoyed a lovely Americano while I waited for Steak and Eggs. The coffee here is Tobys - a local roaster originally from Australia. I really like Toby's coffee a lot. I know the Van Leeuwen's were always into Intelligentsia, but ever since their switchover, which i admit i was nervous about at first, im now HOOKED on the new beans! Then our orders came out -- my friend got the banana coconut pancakes - which were light, fluffy, and NOT TOO SWEET (which i always fear with early morning brunch 'cakes). it came with a housemade palm sugar syrup which was sooo tasty. my steak and eggs were just what i was looking for. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, which was just the right size portion to fill me up for hours, without feeling ill and overly stuffed. It came with 2 pieces of homemade roti bread - which i loved to wrap up as little steak tacos with its sambal (sauce, with just enough of a kick). and the green that day was bok choy which was so pleasant paired with the meat. It included some bits of shredded coconut on top to break up all the spice with a shot of sweetness. as if that wasnt enough, we could never resist the coconut creme brulee. ive gotten this dessert each time ive come here and never had a single regret. I spend many nights in fact, dreaming of this dessert. Staff is always super friendly and stylish. the records played are enjoyable and not too loud and the nighttime atmosphere SCREAMS date night! look out for bali music in the bathrooms as well! (just a quirky bonus for your lipstick re-application)
