I was visiting in NYC and wanted to visit the original Lombardi's Pizza for lunch.  Unfortunately or fortunately they don't sell by the slice so I had a whole pie to myself.  I went with the traditional pepperoni.  It was excellent as you would expect.  The heavens didn't sing and the angels didn't appear, however it was still very good. I think the issue with "classic" places like this is the build up of expectations and lore.  I will go again if I am in the area but it wasn't Nirvana.  But then maybe that is good that it wasn't.
