I'm not ashamed to admit that one of the things I looked forward to the most about visiting Philadelphia for the first time were the cheese steaks and Sonny's did not disappoint! I got a cheese steak with provolone, hot peppers and onions and I loved every single bite! The fries were delicious also. They were cooked perfectly and came out hot. There was a line since we went right at lunchtime and a small wait for the food, but Â I would have stood in a line of 100 people to eat there! If you are visiting Philadelphia then this is a must to add to your list! A little tip is if you go at a busy time, have someone save some seats while another person orders. The restaurants is on the small side so seating may be a little hard to find.
