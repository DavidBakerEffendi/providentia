This is a fabulous place to sit and work. The staff is warm and generous and the food is great. I just combined the vegetable sides for my lunch and it was fabulous. Lots of flavors in the grilled veggies and sauteed kale. Brown rice and black beans made me sad when I ate the last bite. Come here and eat! Good food, good prices, Good people!
