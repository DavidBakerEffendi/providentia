I moved my business, CJ's Barber Shop, across the parking lot from Ramuntos on Nov 1st of 2010. And since being here I have ordered from them many times as I don't always have my lunch with me. To make a long story short, from my first order I was "blown away" with the food! The "portions" are generous, the flavor is always mouth watering. Whether you get their pizza, subs or whatever, it is ALWAYS worth your money. These folks know how to deal with a persons hunger! Highly, highly recommend this place. -- CJ of CJ's Barber Shop
