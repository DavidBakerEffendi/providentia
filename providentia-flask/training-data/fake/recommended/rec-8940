Juniper is an excellent casual dining restaurant where the price is right, the service friendly, and the food on point.   I had the jambalaya which was perfectly spiced and filled with savory chorizo and fatty mussels.  I had some of the fries from my friends' plates (regular and sweet potato) and they were a perfect cut, lightly fried, but crispy and seasoned in a really unique way (spicy, salty, and maybe a little old bay(?)). The place is BYO which is a great bonus to add to the already reasonable prices.  They will put your beer in the fridge while you eat and serve it to you as you eat as if they were ordered drinks. My only complaint is that we waited quite a long time for the food to come out, but with BYO drinks in hand, who really cares anyway?
