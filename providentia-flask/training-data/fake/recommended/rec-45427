I read all of these hundreds of reviews and thought, "Cheap and good; I'm game." I got #14 (pork soy), but I should have specified that I wanted shaved noodles instead of pulled noodles. Tasted good at the time, and couldn't beat the price, but, Yo, did I have wicked heart burn that night! My companion had the seafood noodle soup and had to add fish sauce, hot sauce, and soy sauce to try to get it to have any flavor. However, the U Toy in oyster sauce (Chinese vegetables) made a really good appetizer. If you wanna get full cheaply, then this is worth that much.
