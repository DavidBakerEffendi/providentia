I almost never give out five stars, but this place deserves six. Just walking in, I felt like I was in Europe again with the delightful small tables and the coziness of the restaurant. We ordered about ten tapas and they were all delicious- I could never complain about them. The ones I can remember the best (we ordered a bottle of Temperallino) were lentils with eggs and some kind of mushrooms- I inhaled them. I think this is one of the best restaurants in NYC, especially for tourists tired of lackluster Italian places and Mexican restaurants trying to pass off as Spanish, and this place is well worth the price.
