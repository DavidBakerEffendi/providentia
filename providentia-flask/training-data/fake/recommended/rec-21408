My husband had been waiting a year to go to the Edgar Allan Poe Museum which is right down the block from here.  I was responsible for finding a place to eat so out came my trusty yelp app.  Near the top if the list and so close we decided to give silk city diner a try.  We got there around 12:30 on Saturday and rather than wait 15-20 minutes for a table we sat at the counter.  Service was great.  The cocktail list was very tempting but as we were headed to Yards Brewery after the museum we passed.  We both had sandwiches.  My husband had the breakfast sandwich and days later he is still raving about it.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich:  the bread was perfect and it was spicy with the right blend of flavors.  We will definitely be back even though we live an hour away.
