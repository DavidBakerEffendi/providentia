Very fine food and an excellent selection of wines. A lively atmosphere and good service. All worth the expense. The appetizers were delicious. The entrees of a chicken roulade, a veal chop simply grilled, and veal oso buco were cooked to perfection as were the mashed potatoes. A fine Barolo complimented well the food. Ending by sharing a creme brûlée rounded off the meal as did the espresso, which was piping hot (too often tepid in many restaurants), and a glass of Sambuca. Although expensive this is a restaurant worth returning to, which I will do when next in New Haven. It almost deserves five stars.
