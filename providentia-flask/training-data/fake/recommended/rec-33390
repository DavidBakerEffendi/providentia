Okay so I ate there about three hours ago and the last thing I want to do right now is brush my teeth and kill the remaining flavors that still linger in my mouth.  Such a quaint, cozy feel, good ambiance, could have stayed all day, but not sure if my very attractive waitress would have preferred that.  The food is very fresh, and nice size portions.  I ordered the Huevos Banados for $11, but I suggest the Pre Fix Brunch for $15 comes with a cold & hot beverage.  The  dish was simply great, came out hot, with fresh avocado, and crispy bread, the homemade hot sauce on the side is one of the best I've had in quite sometime.  My brunch date ordered the Tortilla Cubano dish with bacon & a salad which was equally as good and cooked to perfection.  Always have to try anything with the word "hash" in it, so I ordered a side of the "potato hash" for $4.  It was more like home fries and less like hash, but they were really good, the caramelized onions added a nice sweetness to it.  The coffee was nice & hot and the waitress was attentive on the refills.  My sangria was okay, and the fresh squeezed OJ on the prefixed menu was a big serving. There was a big festive party going on in the large sunlit back room that looks out onto a garden. My only issue that I have with many wine & beer establishments is the lack of Bloody Marys.  It's a must for me and many others during brunch.  One way around it that I've had before is to make Sake Bloody Marys, I was told that they fall under the Wine licensing. Can't wait to go back and try their dinner!
