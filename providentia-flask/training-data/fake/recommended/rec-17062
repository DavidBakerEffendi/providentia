This place was delicious!!! Being PuertoRican had to have the shrimp mofongo & Â it was exceptional! Service was very pleasant! Ambiance was delightful. I will definitely will go back again. Thee only downfall is it's a little pricy..'really' & that was not including drinks we had water forgot the tea part 'crap'! LOL (Holy SHIT! I just realized from prior feed back I didn't even acknowledge if the tip was included now I feel like a dummy cause I tip cash!)
