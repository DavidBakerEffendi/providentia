I absolutely love this place!  The staff is always super friendly.  The food is cooked relatively quickly and all of the ingredients are always fresh.  The chips are homemade and taste great with the homemade salsa (they're thick so they don't snap in half when you're dipping them).  The breakfast burrito is HUGE!  They listen to customer feedback and have changed their recipes in response.  The dragon salsa was reformulated without me knowing it.  I ate my chips & salsa really fast and my mouth was tingling for quite some time afterwards...and I'm an avid hot sauce person.  The shredded pork tacos are delicious and fresh.  The food is not greasy at all and it is very consistent.  The inside is very small but I will sacrifice decor for high-quality food any day.  It makes the ordering/dining process a lot faster which is perfect when I'm just running out for my lunch break.  I'm so happy there is finally an AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant in the area!  I hope they are around for a very very long time!
