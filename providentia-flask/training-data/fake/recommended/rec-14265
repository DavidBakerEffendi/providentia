OMG the breakfast here is incredible. The hostess is very sweet and the servers are excellent. Everything we had - the waffles, pancakes, eggs, bacon were all so delicious. Suggestion: make sure to get there at least 30 minutes before the place opens and ask to put your name on the list when you get there. For $10 a person; the food is absolutely incredible! I wish they had a place of this quality in So Cal! Cash only
