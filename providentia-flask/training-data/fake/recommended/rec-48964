Cannot say enough good things about this place. The food, service and atmosphere were outstanding. Ariane does a phenomenal job at combining simple ingredients together, creating new delicious flavors. A few of us sat at the bar while a few sat in the annexed quiet, intimate dining room in an adjoining space.  There is full food and drink service at both parts of the restaurant. There is also a fun snack menu only available at the bar area that we really liked - the Cuban sandwich and potato skins with goat cheese  were a great start to our meal. The group in the dining room had some appetizers off the dinner menu and loved them. The mushroom ragout over cheesy  grits are a must have off  the appetizer menu. The dinner menu had many outstanding choices. I had the chicken pot pie and loved it. You won't be disappointed by the dessert menu either, they are small so get a few to share! Last but not least, the drink selection was great here. The cocktail menu is full of drinks with unique fusions of flavor. The pomegrante moscow mule was amazing. The beer selection is also great including many local brewery choices. Since we are from Chicago we had never tried many of the beers. If you haven't had it, the Brooklyn Blast beer was great. Mike, the owner circulated around the whole restaurant during the time we were there. He was making sure everyone had a great experience, and we did! The servers and bartenders were also extremely attentive. Also, the prices are reasonable considering the quality and time put into each dish and drink.
