One of the best restaurants I've been to. Print is farm to table and you can definitely tell the difference. The vegetables served were so crisp and fresh, I could have had them as my meal. The tuna tartar was great to start. I then had a pork chop with apple and my boyfriend had a fish dish with lots of fresh veggies. It was a wonderful meal and atmosphere. I believe the menu changes daily depending on what's available locally. I'd love to go back seasonally to see how dynamic the menu is.
