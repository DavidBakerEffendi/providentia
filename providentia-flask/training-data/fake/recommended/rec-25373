Just had a great meal and experience even with a couple big flaws! We waited for 40'mins to be seated even though we could clearly see tables in the dinner room that were empty. Then they entered in the wrong order on my moms lunch but apologized over and over and comp'd those dishes. The service was good and the staff was nice. The good can stand in it's own it's really good and some interesting combinations. New favorite in the area! I would definitely recommend and come back!!
