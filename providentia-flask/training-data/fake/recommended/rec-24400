Food was delicious for the most part, I am posting pictures of the deliciousness and it was overall amazing ! I came with four people and almost all of us had a tasty meal ! Except for salad entree one of us got, green goddess something which sucked and was basically a bag of green leafs - mixed arugula, spinach, lettuce with croutons and dressing. Now service - definitely lacking. We came in and waited good 20-25 minutes minutes before even being acknowledged for our drinks. By that point, we had long studied the menu and were ready to order. Few more minutes and we would have walked out. The waiter said he was slow because he had a rough night. He looked like he's been out all night Â and was totally cracked out. Hey, I'm all for partying as long as it doesn't interfere with me getting my food on time. Worst part about this place is DRINKS. I never really encountered such watered down weak cocktails in NYC. I had 3 sloe gin fizzes and I was not even buzzed. Not sure how much alcohol they add to their cocktails but my husband had tried several variations of their bloody mary and said they were very weak and watery as well. Will not return, there are literally dozens of superior places in the city.
