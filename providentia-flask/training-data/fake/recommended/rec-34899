One of the most pleasurable indulgences in this world is to sit outside in a garden eating delicious Thai food on a warm spring evening, while a cat stretches languidly in a tree near your table and the gentle sound of falling water masks the roar of jets overhead.  (Okay, while the airplanes definitely do not add to the ambiance, you will be too sated to let them ruin anything, either) All this, quick, attentive service, and two versions of the menu (one with words and prices, one with words and photographs -- plus a vegetarian menu for good measure) -- and with most entrees in the neighborhood of $7.50?  Yes, it's real.   God, I love springtime.  Oh yeah, and Thai food.  And Sripraphai. P.S. If you're in the neighborhood and want to check it out without sitting down for a meal, there are a couple of fridges in the front with sweet and savory things for takeaway, as well as several shelves of dry goods.
