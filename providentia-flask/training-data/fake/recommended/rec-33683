I came here after work for happy hour on a Tuesday.  My first impression was a good one - the space is beautiful, and was mellow enough that we could easily snag two seats at the bar.  That first impression quickly soured, though, as my friend and I waited over 30 minutes for the bartenders to acknowledge us, despite the fact that the bar was not very busy.  We finally flagged down someone, but the lack of service was consistent throughout the night.  We each had four drinks, and after each one, we sat with empty glasses for about 20 - 30 minutes waiting.  We had to cajole the person sitting next to us to give us his food menu, since the bartenders weren't even making eye contact with us so we could request one.  It was frustrating and completely ridiculous.  I would be willing to chalk up the terrible service to the fact that it's a new bar, and it's possible the bartenders have no idea what they're doing, except that I checked my credit card statement the next day and found that they had apparently charged me for two separate tabs.  I'm currently in the process of disputing one of those charges with my credit card company.  All in all, an absolute disaster of a night.  I'm glad I discovered on yelp that the proprietors of this business own another business, so that I can save myself the trouble of going through another bad experience and avoid both.
