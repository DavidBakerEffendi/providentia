This restaurant is located on a busy corner of Williamsburg facing McCarren Park. Popular for people watching and pooch-sitting, this eatery serves up tasty food and drinks. The wait times can be up to an hour during prime weekend service, but there are enough places in the area to check out before coming back for a table.
