I almost took a star away due to frostbite (my poor fingers! a 30 min. wait outside! brr!), but realized that wouldn't be fair. They say no reservations, so it's your fault if you go at a popular time and have to wait! Other than being half-frozen by the time we got inside, I really enjoyed the evening. Boy and I shared the green bean salad, he chowed down on at least 2 bread baskets, and we then went all in and ordered both the soft shell crab special (him) and the full branzino (me). His soft shell crab was really good, although perhaps a little too fried. It moved just a tiny bit past fried crab to fried food in the shape of crab, but you kind of can't go wrong with friend anything so still tasty! I snagged quite a few bites, and thought it was a good dish overall. Same for my branzino--a good dish overall, but I wouldn't mind seeing a few tweaks! Fish was really really nicely cooked, but could have used a little more flavor. It had a bit of tomato relish on top, and I wish it came with a side bowl of that, as it added a lot of much needed flavor. Still a nicely cooked fish that tasted great, but could have been 5 stars with just a few changes! We shared the flourless chocolate cake to end, and both agreed it was good if nothing special. I think perhaps the restaurant was just too darn busy that night, and perhaps a few quality control issues slipped through. Our waiter was also very sweet although overwhelmed with work. He ended up forgetting to put in our dessert order, and then comped it when he realized how long we waited. Not a problem, and he was very gracious! Overall a great restaurant that I'm excited to try again (at a less popular time)!
