The food here is really great, all meatball inspired But plan on being packed in here like a sardine. There was a bit of a wait when we showed up, so we grabbed a bite a nearby diner (brunch #1) until we got a call from the host at the Meatball Shop (brunch #2).  You're able to mix and match the different meatball offerings which makes for a great meal to share with the ones you're with.   As I said before, they really cram you in here. This place is so popular, the dining area is constantly packed which makes it kinda hard to maneuver around.
