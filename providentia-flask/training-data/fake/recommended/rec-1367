perhaps i went to the place at the wrong time of the day, but the kid who took my order was retarded.  he messed up my order and thought the other half of my order was to-go.  (mind you, i ordered in chinese not english).  how the hell do you mess up 2 bowls of noodles?   i think property dumpling was a lot better!
