By far the BEST restaurant we ate at while staying in NYC. Our apartment was right down the street and we had walked past here earlier in the day so we decided to do a late night dinner here. We got there at 10:30pm and it was busy but not crowded. The noise level was high but not obnoxious to the point where we couldn't have date night. Our waiter was fantastic and so nice. He made us feel like locals and was super attentive without being invasive. I had the duck which was SO GOOD and my boyfriend had the pork and then licked the plate clean. I hear the brunch is amazing there and had we had more time, we would have come back for it. We would definitely do dinner here again. It is a little on the pricier side but it is worth it. The chef lives in the apartment above so you know he is always "around" and making sure things are up to standard.
