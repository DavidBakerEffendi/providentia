Once you discover the Green Rock you never want to leave. Just stop by on the 1st to finally see what all the commotion was about with these darn pierogi's.  10+ different varieties plus two dessert versions! Absofreakinlutly the best!!! I think they should have this event twice a year. Second time in the summer with tents  and grilles. Call it Pierogi's on the Street!!!
