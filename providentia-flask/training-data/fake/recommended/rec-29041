Not like this place needs another review, but... I do love this place. I have had breakfast here three times and I've never been disappointed. The specials are incredible: the portions are huge, they always have cute names, and they're always delicious. Since it's all made fresh, you can customize it to your liking (vegetarian approved!). The reason I'm rating this four stars is due to the staff. While they all look adorable in their hipster clothing, some of them have quite the attitude. Granted, I understand working as a waitress has a lot of downsides that may make someone irritable, but no one is holding a gun to your head telling you to do this job. You do want a nice tip, right?
