I went on late December last year and what caught most my attention was that I completely forgot how cold and white outside. It really took me to another place definitely far from winter and New Jersey. It felt warm and tropical. The music was in tone with the decor, as well as, the lighting. I think all this, even, enhances Â the taste of the food. One experience through your 5 senses. Just get Diego Luna as your date and, you'll have it all, your own "Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights" kind of night, without the dancing of course! (who would be able to dance so cool, right?)
