YESS!  The corner of Bank & Hudson has finally been put to good use.  While the area is my fav residential district of the city, I've found it difficult to have a truly delicious, yet comfortable restaurant to call - 'a local spot'.  Well wait no longer - Meme, the best local spot south of the MPD - has finally arrived!   Serving sized small bites of deliciousness (I have to admit - I adore oil though), there is never a wait and always a smile.   Mmm and the corner cushiony seat by the window is perfect for some 'people watching' (aka mild people stalking).
