If I could only give this zero stars. It is more infamous than famous at this moment. Service was slow. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat late-night, don't stop here. Food was horrid. Hair in potatoes, sandwiches missing key ingredients (proteins), chocolate milk that looked like creamer in a glass. Never again. I'll happily drive the few extra miles and head to the Pompton Queen Diner.
