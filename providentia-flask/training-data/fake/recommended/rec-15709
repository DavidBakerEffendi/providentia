This review is being written with trepidation. If I add one more great review to the list I may not be able to get in!  Just rest assured that everything is tasty, the portions generous, the prices reasonable.  The only negative is that it is crammed tight with guests, just like an old fashioned diner, which is exactly what it is, but restored to beautiful condition. Enjoy the matzo ball & bone marrow soup, the vegetarian lasagna is light and flavorful, the pork chop is magnificent. I'm a New Yorker, and I don't use those words to describe food very often.
