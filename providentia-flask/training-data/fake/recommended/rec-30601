Stop reading this review...just do yourself a favor and go! I love this place.  No, they don't take reservations, tough- this is New York.  However, I've never waited more than 30 mins, and there are plenty of bars nearby to grab a drink while you begin to salivate over the sweet thoughts of what awaits you. My favorite part of Westville is their plate of sides.  Everything is always fresh and well prepared.  The vegetables taste like vegetables- they don't lay there swimming in sauce, butter, and cream.  This is not haute cuisine.  It is simple, tasty, healthy food served in portions that fill you up but dont weigh you down. The atmosphere is bright, bustling, and loud.  It's not where you take a first date.  It's not where you take your parents.  It's where you go when you want food as healthy  and delicious as you would make at home but you don't want to wash the dishes.  Show up in your jeans and a stained t-shirt, you will fit right in ; ) From entrees to drinks to desserts everything is fairly priced and delicious....Go!!!!
