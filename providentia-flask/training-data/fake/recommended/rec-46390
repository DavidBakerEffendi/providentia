I had dinner here with three friends on a Friday night (around 10pm).  Our waiter was super helpful and friendly.  Really couldn't have been nicer.  We had an elevated table near the open kitchen.  The place is a bit loud but our group didn't mind it. We all decided on a three course dinner.  I had the dayboat scallops and thought they were excellent.  They are raw but incredible.  I had the citrus salad next.  Wasn't a huge fan (too much white onion).  I had the pork chop for an entree.  Huge serving and it was cooked very well.  The waiter said the braised short ribs sold out in an hour.  So I'm assuming they are good...ha. I would go back.
