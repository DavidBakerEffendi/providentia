My first concern about this place was the line being long.  I was in no rush and actually had some time to kill so I decided to wait in line.  The line wrapped around the entire restaurant and ended by the tables that belong to the neighboring restaurant.  My experience was that the staff was very organized and that things moved smoothly.  I had a few options to sit at the bar (the seats go quick and get served faster) but decided to wait it out in line because as I said I had time to kill.  In total I waited in line for ten minutes which is really not bad at all.   I got the Italian pulled pork with provolone.  All around the sandwich was unquestionably worth the short wait (think of how long you would wait at any normal sit down restaurant).  The meat was tender, flavorful and juicy.  The cheese added a great snap and I loved my sandwich.  I read some reviews knocking the meat not having much substance flavor wise.  As an avid meat eater and cook I can appreciate meat that has been well prepared and cooked to bring out the flavor of the meat itself and not drowned in seasoning.  If you would like to have sauce drown your meat there are many shops near by that you could do this.
