This place is solid. I'm not ready to call it the "best" cheesesteak in Philly, but it's up there. So, I went here based on Yelp reviews. Many of the reviews I read mention the neighborhood being bad. Bah. I'll admit, it's not the most eye-pleasing neighborhood, but I wouldn't classify it as being "bad". We are two little white people from the suburbs, and we were fine. It was expected that we would come across some fine Muslim men peddling scented oils, and such. We did. These men only added to the ambiance, as one offered me a free sample "sniff". I felt like a VIP. The guy on the grill is fantastic. He was busy, had a great memory, and still remained friendly. There was a bunch of people "working" behind the counter, but this guy was doing 95% of the work. So yeah, we got a cheesesteak. My normal order is extra whiz, with. This place seems to like to put mayo and American cheese on everything. Mayo? Wtf. I thought, when in Rome... So my order was light mayo, American, whiz, and fried onions. Yes, it's a big, glorious steak. The roll was fresh and soft. The meat was cooked perfectly, and moist. I think the mayo threw me off a little, I wasn't really feeling that part. Not anything to take a star away though. Go here. It's a great steak at a great price. They load that thing up with deliciousness. Don't be turned off by the neighborhood. It's not that bad. On a side note, this thing reheated perfectly. I had a little less than a half leftover. The next day I threw it in the microwave for about a minute. It then went into the oven set at 375 for another 10 minutes. It added some crunchiness to the roll which was just perfect.
