I love this place. Love, love it. Yes, being from the south - it's just grits. But the toppings are great, and grits are always great, so you simply cannot complain. But to address portions (which many non 5 star reviews have noted recently): they've definitely started skimping in the past month. Perhaps it's because of the new hiring or shift switches, but the last time I got a large grits, the container was significantly less than 3/4 full - and that was including a soft egg and protruding (half-burnt) bacon. Really unfortunate. I'm hoping this place brings it back.
