Super cute little brunch place! The wait is not too long if you're a pair. Plus, you get to see the server write your name in chalk on the door frame as you wait for your table. There's a little bench outside, beside a vintage bicycle with a basket full of cork. "Throw in a cork for good luck!" said the wine menu. Ordered the Croque Monsieur, tartine, and eggs with prosciutto. Oh, and the little croissants with clotted cream and scones. WAY too much food. But definitely not a mistake. :) Food is heavenly. And the service was a little slow, (it was especially torturous because we were seated beside the bar where they were preparing all the food!) but they comped our croissants for that. So all is forgiven. Yum, delicious, yum!
