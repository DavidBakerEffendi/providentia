Had a great restaurant week experience here last night!  We got really lucky with the weather yesterday, since it was low 70s, breezy, and sunny, so we opted to sit in their nice outdoor seating area which was beautiful. The restaurant week menu here is an amazing deal because they offer their entire menu, with only a few dishes requiring a supplement.  I got the bigoli pasta as my appetizer, the grilled chicken as my main course, and the chocolate mousse as my dessert.  The standout from these three courses was the bigoli pasta, as the pasta was nice and al dente and the tomatoes were really juicy and flavorful.  The chicken was also really good and was cooked perfectly, and the chocolate mousse was light and fluffy (the liquid chocolate center was a really nice surprise!). My favorite part of the meal actually did not come from any of the dished that I ordered, but from the pork chop that my mom ordered.  When the dish came we saw that the pork chop was topped with something very dark and sticky looking, so I tried a bite to see what it was.  After taking one bite, I didn't want to even eat my chicken anymore because it was so delicious!  We asked the waiter and found out that it was candied barbecued pulled pork belly, and it was just as amazing as it sounds.  I honestly would've been perfectly happy with a bowl of that for my main course, but unfortunately it is not its own dish!   The whole dining experience from the food to the service and beautiful outdoor dining area were great, and I would definitely return!
