This is one of my favorite places to take out of towners when they come to visit the city, but not if they are thai food aficionados.  I will admit the food is not the greatest, but it is pretty decent, and at a great price, so you definitely get what you pay for here.  It is by no means bad food.  The ambiance is my favorite part.  I would love to decorate my apartment in the style in which the restaurant is decorated!  I agree D G below that the Chelsea location has better food.   The service in general can also be a little slow, but the food comes out quickly.  It's a fun scene though, so definitely worth a visit.
