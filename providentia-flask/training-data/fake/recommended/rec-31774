Went there on a Saturday night for dinner. You seat yourself so you gotta wait for someone to get up. Good ambiance. Ok service. Great beer selection. Nothing special about the food. I got the Spanish burger. Did not ask me how I wanted it cooked and the meat was very dry. My girl got the lamb pita special and she said it was nothing special.
