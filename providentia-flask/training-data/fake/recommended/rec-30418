I definately will not be back, too many other great places in NYC to want to spend here again. Ambience is good and the bar is a nice place to hang out but other than that no reason to visit. Ate here last night. Really slow service and I didn't enjoy the food at all. I sent back my main which was cooked ham, honestly I've had better boars head from the deli. It arrived cold and was flavourless. I never send back food either, unless I am really unhappy, that ham and potatoes was $28 bucks as well. My girlfriends pasta was okay but very salty, so again not good. Starters were extremely average as well. I dont understand how everyone else seems to like it though!
