I have eaten at this restaurant at least 30 times.  It's close to work, super fast and the food is good.  If you are going for the service or the decor, look elsewhere. I have never been more rushed along by a wait staff like I have here.  I don't mind since I am often here at lunch time so being speedy is a good thing.  There is one grumpier old waitress who sometimes can seem rude.  The others are friendly enough.  The place itself is in need of a new paint job and some sprucing up.  There is a good amount of wear visible. The good thing about the food, you can order it exactly how you want it.  I often will get steamed chicken, broccoli with sesame sauce on the side.  A lot of other Chinese restaurants will just act like they don't understand what you are asking and just say no.   If you are more interested in the food then the vibe, give this place a try. At lunch time it is mostly a business crowd and it is a fine place to bring coworkers.
