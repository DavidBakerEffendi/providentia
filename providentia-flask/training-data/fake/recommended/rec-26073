So happy to be there on opening night, although the restaurant looked packed on the days leading up to their opening. I was so impressed with everything that hit our table last night. Based on the old location reviews, we were going with a past reviewers star system as follows: the jam, monster jam and the motherfucker. So here you go: Oysters: the jam. i liked them, but I wish I could have tasted more of the oyster. The vinagrette was a bit overwhelming for me. Cornbread: Monster Jam! Not too spicy and super hot in that skillet. Brussel Sprouts: Monster Jam! I have never met a sprout i don't like but these were cooked perfectly. I almost wanted to lick the bowl. Dr. Pepper Ribs: Motherfucker! These were like delicious, like so delicious. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was mucho bueno. Loved it. I had this as my main dish and it was more than enough. Chocolate Bread Pudding: Totally a motherfucker. You have to have this. And as of right now it's the only dessert on the menu, so really..you have to have this. Other things my table enjoyed / Devoured: The Chicken..word was a total motherfucker. The meat was cooked perfectly. The country fried steak and the trout: devoured. I didn't see one last drop on the table of food. The only weird thing was that I ordered two small plates for my entree. Those came first and everyone else's meals came about 20 minutes later. Sort of awkward for them to all sit there and watch me eat and then for me to sit there and watch them eat. Then coming back together to enjoy the bread pudding together. The space is a total motherfucker!
