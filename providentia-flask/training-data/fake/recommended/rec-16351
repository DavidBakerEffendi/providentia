This has easily won the title as my favorite Greek restaurant!! Yes, the wait time is super long (I waited an hour for a Sunday dinner for a table for two) but you're right in the heart of Astoria's Ditmars, so put your name down and go find yourself a bar to dwell at to build up that appetite because you're going to want to be hungry for this one. The complimentary bread. Oooooh my -encrusted with olives dripping with rich, golden olive oil! I just couldn't help myself! I literally had to put the dish as far away as possible. We started off with a small Greek Salad. Fork up a piece of red onion, lettuce, a crunchy cucumber and crumbles of that beautiful feta cheese and you'll have yourself the perfect bite. Then came out our order of the Baked Stuffed Clams. This was probably my favorite dish -so rich with flavor with an unforgettable, citrusy aroma. Next came the Chicken Kebabs, Broiled scallops and Lemon Potatoes. Definitely overdid it but hey, I have lunch for tomorrow! All in all, everything was perfect - great vibe, great food and great company. Dishes may seem pretty pricey but please keep in mind each dish comes with generous portions. Additionally Â the service was on point despite the restaurant being busy. Cannot WAIT to come back!
