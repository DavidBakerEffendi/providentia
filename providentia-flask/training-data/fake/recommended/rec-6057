I am by no means a connoisseur when it comes to Greek food as I have only had it a handful of times in my life, but I know one thing for sure, I'll be back to Stamna soon! My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for a while as we live close by and tonight was the the night. We were able to sit outside since it was such a gorgeous day out and we started with a Tzatziki appetizer which came with pita's. My girlfriend had the lamb stew with orzo for a main course and loved it, and she is a tough critic, I had the feta stuffed chicken breast which was a special and it was awesome, very juicy and had great flavor and was a big portion. Our waiter George found the perfect balance of being attentive while not being at the table constantly. Overall it is a must try for anyone in the area, glad to know this little gem is just blocks away!
