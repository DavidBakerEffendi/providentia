If you want a seat and you want to eat, it's best to arrive early. A friend and I met for dinner here last night at 6:30 p.m. Luckily, we beat the rush, and the place can get quite packed. In fact, if you get a table in the back room, don't bother struggling to leave through the front, just duck out the back door. No need fighting the later-evening crowd! The food is basic, relatively inexpensive, and served on paper plates. I got the Bistro Burget, which is a bacon cheeseburger served with lettuce, tomato, and onion. When you order, they don't ask how you want it done; trust the cook! I also got a side of French fries, which were a cross between old-school KFC fries and grade school lunch room fries. Bill came to about $10 for each of us. Not bad! I wouldn't eat here all the time, but they've got a great burger.
