My first meal in NYC! I was not gonna let a little rain stop me from crossing off my first bookmark to do off my meticulously planned NYC trip itinerary! After hoofing it about 20 minutes to get there thru the drizzle, dude and I looked for the long line leading to the Halal Guys in yellow shirts, as several of my yelp friends reviewed that this is a must stop. On the corner, we did see a cart with yellow shirt guys but no line. I knew we were at the "wrong one" even though most people say its the same guys. But like the lemming that I am, I convinced dude we need to go to the "real" cart where we found a small line. I guess coming on a rainy day did have its advantages with less people waiting. Unlike some other reviewers stated, our guy who took our order was super sweet, not surly. $16 got us, a gyro sandwich, a mix beef and chicken over rice combo and a gyro over rice plate. Sandwich was very tasty. The combo plates were very filling and we loved them. I liked having the colorful saffron rice, the lettuce and pita bread. The yogurt sauce was delicious! After warnings from Janice C and others about their hot sauce and dude sprinkled carefully. He loved it and of course I was burning at one drop. After just half way through our meal, dude was asking if we can squeeze it into our schedule a second time. I was totally up for it but sadly it didn't pan out. But it's definitely going on our next trip back!
