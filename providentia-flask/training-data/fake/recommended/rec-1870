great noodles, i definitely see what the hype is all about! the broth is delicious and way better than the pho places i have been too...we went to this block in search of some pho place that we never could find so we ended up eating here since we had heard good things. i got the shrimp noodle soup with the hand drawn noodles which i could barely eat half of it was so big! Â we also split seafood dumplings which were delicious, we got steamed but i think pan-fried is always the way to go! the waitresses were all nice and it was a cheap and filling lunch!
