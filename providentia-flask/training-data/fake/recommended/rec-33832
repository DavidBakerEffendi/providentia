Just go and give it a try. It is an pretty good experience. Make sure you go with three or four people. No point in adding a long review. I figured to right an up to date review for newcomers. It is a lot of food so go hungry and prepared to eat. Not a place for small eaters. Make sure you go with plenty of time to find parking. The place is pretty hard to find if you are not familiar with the area. It is in a small little ally way off of South Street, and looks like you may get robbed, but its safe. Make sure you use the metal door knocker because the door is solid and will hurt your hand. lol Also, if you are a rather large big boned person. good luck with the bathroom it is very very small. Lastly, if you are on a date, the place is pretty pricey so I hope there is some procreation going on. All-in-all this place is freaken awesome!
