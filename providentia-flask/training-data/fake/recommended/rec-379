My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We had a reservation and had to wait around 30 minutes. We had just arrived to the restaurant when the manager said our table would be ready in 2 minutes. Just as the 2 minute mark was up, 2 horribly snippy females strut in the door right past us and look at the open table and go "I see our high top awaiting us!!!!!" and walk right over. The manager was extremely friendly and apologized for the rudeness of the girls, offered us a free pitcher of sangria and a spot at the bar while we waited. We were in no hurry so this was fine for us. The place was pleasantly crowded with a good atmosphere (Friday night around 9pm). We had trouble picking out things on the menu cause everything seemed appetizing. We ended up going with the garlic shrimp, chicken croquettes, beef empanadas, meatballs in brandy sauce, and the patatas aoili. Everything was amazing! We were happy with every single dish and it was very difficult to pick our favorite. Great staff and atmosphere, and good food! I'll definitely come back sometime.
