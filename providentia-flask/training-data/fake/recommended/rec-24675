Don't go here if you have any allergies, they make no menu adjustments and no accommodations. I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars only because the staff was really nice and the restaurant is really cute, nice looking and set up perfectly for a date. I really only want to give 2 stars because the chef/restaurant refuses to make any adjustments to their menu even for allergies. My boyfriend is allergic to dairy and if a fish or meat is cooked in butter, usually a chef/restaurant will adjust to cook in oil. They wouldn't do that. We asked if they could serve a few of the entrees without the part of the dish that had dairy (like potatoes under the chicken) and they wouldn't do that, they wouldn't even agree to bring all elements just serve on different plates. Just pretty selfish of the chef. He could only eat 3 side dishes. Their wine bottles are also pretty expensive, most around $50, cheapest is $40.
