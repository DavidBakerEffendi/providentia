I frequent the Wishing Well semi-regularly after discovering it when I moved to Bella Vista near the beginning of the year, and I'm glad that I decided to go in that first night. I think they have some of the best wings in town.  I've had all the sauces and think they are all fantastic.  Make sure you try the dry rub!  I was more than a little disappointed when wings were raised from .50 to .75 for game specials (along with upping the Kenzo specials by a buck).  Still more than worth it, however.  The grilled cheese is fantastic - make sure you get it with bacon!  It is true that the Shame Burger is a little bit on the dry side, but I still found it decent. What I enjoy the most is that it is fairly unassuming and does not seem like a place that is trying too hard.  Maybe that's why more than one reviewer has chastised it for not knowing what it wants to be.  I think it knows exactly what it wants to be - a decent corner bar that also happens to serve more than just fried food.  Is the food jaw dropping amazing?  Not quite, but it's definitely above average.  When you pair that with a large beer selection that is very reasonably priced and a friendly staff, you produce a winning combination.  The only thing I don't like is how packed the bar can get on weekend evenings as I prefer to sit at the bar to eat and drink.  But hey, that's only because they're good at what they do.
