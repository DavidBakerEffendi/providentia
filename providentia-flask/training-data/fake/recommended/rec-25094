Excellent food and even better service. Finally a place I didn't feel rushed! The prime rib was to die for, a affordable wine list and Mary is the most amazing server in town. Jen, the owner, is super friendly and always remembers your name. A nice casual spot with a nice traditional brunch on Sunday and great bar space to watch a game with family and friends.
