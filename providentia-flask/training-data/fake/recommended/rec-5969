Not crazy about the ambiance... can be a little stuffy, but without a doubt most dishes are typically great.   The lobster mac n cheese is on the pricey side but it's the best I've had anywhere (it's actually the first place I've ever had it as well.)   I actually crave it about once every six months and have to go to Rittienhouse to get my fix.   Favorite cocktail.. the Buzz Aldrin (rimmed with Tang!) UPDATE:  Ok, I've upped my rating after a couple more visits.. the upstairs lounge is definitely a fun place to be for Sunday brunch.. much more chill than the downstairs main room if you're looking for a little more quiet space. The Tiramisu Waffles are a fantastic "guilty brunch" selection, and the Lobster Mac'n'Cheese is still the best in Philly.
