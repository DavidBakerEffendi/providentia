I haven't had an OMG Takeout Sushi night since Robongi in Hoboken (check out my past reviews) Enter a night in Brooklyn Heights for Gossip Girl and wine and a quick take out is due. This place is right next to my friends apartment and he RAVED about it. I went with the Sushi dinner which was more than enough. And fresh? Fresh doesn't describe it. Mouth watering best sushi I've had in a long time. As I can't rate the service, the take out was QUICK. 10 minutes and we were good to go. Impressive for a busy Japanese restaurant in the heart of BK Heights.
