I've been to a lot of bars in my life and have done my fair share of drinking and EO's drinks have been the best I have tasted by far!!!  They are just all sooooo good and sooo different...you really can't go wrong.  I don't know where the hell they found these bartenders, but they are like Mad Scientists!....and to top if off...the drinks work!  After my second drink i was feeling nice and toasty :)  Best drink in my opinion was the Amelia.  Atmosphere:  Perfect...just a bunch of mid 20's to 30 somethings hanging out and drinking, not totally dressed-up but dressed "casual-cute".  It's a little on the pricey side, but at EO you definitely get what you pay for.   I'm going to NY again in a couple weeks...and all I want is the Amelia!!!
