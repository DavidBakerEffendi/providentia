They were a little pricier than what I'm used to and on the cozy side, but, were great. I went here for dinner with a group of 7 other people last night Â before heading out for the night and the service was still quick and courteous. Very good food. I decided on the miso soup while the majority of my party got sushi or the ginger chicken along with edamame. Everybody was satisfied with their meal, though. Bill came to about $90, which, is about $12-something a head . The bottle service for BYOB was also on point. Would definitely come back.
