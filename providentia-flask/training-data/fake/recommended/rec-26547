As a regular, I'm a little biased.  La Petite France is the definition of small and quirky, and I think some people are put off by that.  None of the tables, chairs, plates, mugs, or cups match.  They might run out of croissants, baguettes, chicken, greens, or quiche depending on the day.  There might be one person working to get food and drinks for a line of five or six and it could take a while.  Who cares? The food is good, especially the sandwiches on their fantastic baguettes.  Quiche is amazing.  Great desserts and pastries and locally-roasted coffee for the same or less than the chain coffee place.  If they don't have what you want, get something else.  The few times I know I've needed something (like a number of baguettes for a party I'm hosting), I've called ahead the day before and they put them aside for me. For West Hartford Center, the prices are more than reasonable.  You can get a sandwich or salad special for around $5.50, you can add a drink onto a regular priced salad or sandwich for $1, and a quiche is $5.  I can get lunch here for less than it costs at Chipotle across the street, with the benefit of not feeling like I ate a small city afterwards. I also like to bring home a baguette, slice it up, add some sauce, pesto, fresh mozzarella and toppings, and make a platter of mini-pizza to serve 2-3 people. The atmosphere is relaxing, and I love to come here to read and write on weekday mornings if I'm off work.  Alexandra is incredibly friendly, and always open to feedback. The only real negatives I would say (beyond spotty availability on some items, which I just say roll with - it's a small business, operating on thin margins, I'm sure), is that most of the staff can't pour a good Americano or Long Black, and that if you pay by credit card there isn't any way to tip.
