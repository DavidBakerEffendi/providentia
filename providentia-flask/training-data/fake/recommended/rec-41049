Not worth going for french food. To me service is everything, first they made us wait "outside" in the cold to be seated, and then they rushed us to order, the crepe was ok nothing that u can't make urself, it doesn't taste THAT great as some ppl commented on yelp, the portion was small, so if u r looking to go on a diet I would definitely recommend this place.  The orange juice u ordered wasn't even a full cup, I guess it's because the oranges are expensive? As soon as everyone finished their crepe, they immediately placed the check for us to pay. The overall experience is just BAD.  We were there for 45 min and was rushed to leave while no one was waiting to be seated!
