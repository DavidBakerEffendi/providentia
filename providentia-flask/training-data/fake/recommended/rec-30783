My boyfriend and I came here for a small wedding reception and can't wait to come back for dinner and drinks! The decor is modern (I'm more of a traditional gal) but I loved it! The bar area is a little narrow but there is a decent room in the back. Before I continue with my review I highly recommend just going for their bathroom. It's like walking into the future. As you walk in the lights turn on and the toilet seat lifts up. There is also full lengths mirror on every wall so it's a little uncomfortable staring at yourself while using the restroom. Enough about the bathroom - the food was a bunch of appetizers. A delicious cheese plate with a variety of cheese - Gouda, Brie, blue, Parmesan etc served with toasted baguette. Chicken kebabs grilled to perfection. Brussels sprouts in a maple glaze - even if you hate Brussels sprouts you must try for the glaze. Flat bread with kale, balsamic vinegarette - it was sweet and savory and my favorite of the night. We also had polenta cakes, shrimp with gazpacho. The cake was made from a pastry chef - I'm not sure if she was part of the restaurant - not two sweet yellow cake with blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries in a not so sweet cream. The service was great! Very attentive - clearing out plates, refilling drinks, very friendly. I will be back and maybe host a party here in the future!
