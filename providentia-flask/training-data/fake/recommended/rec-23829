The Cantina is my favorite restaurant in the city.  You can't beat the blood orange margaritas, chicken tacos and grilled corn that is usually on special. Yes there is usually a wait to be seated, but that's because it's so yummy.  The service can be a little bit slow, but that's usually because the restaurant is busy. Ambiance indoors and out is always lively and fun. I love this place!
