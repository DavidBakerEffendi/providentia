Darn tasty, and a great neighborhood feel atmosphere! Probably the best foie gras that I've had in years. It was a lovely spring evening in Manhattan - temps in the 60s with little to no humidity... the great weather outside lent iteself to the need to enjoy a fantastic bottle of Etude Pino Gris (Blue Ribbon has an awesome wine list - coming from Northern California, I was very impressed with some of the limited release CA wineries that they featured). All of the members of my party enjoyed a fantastic dinner including some specialties of the house - steamed mussles with white wine and challots, grilled duck breast with candied apples and cauliflower mash, and my favorite entree of the evening -- grilled sea scallops. mmm mmm. Matching with the beatiful evening, the great wine, and the wonderful seafood, I enjoyed some lemon and mango sorbet for dessert. Delicious!
