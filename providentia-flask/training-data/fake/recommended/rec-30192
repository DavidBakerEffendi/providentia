The food may be delicious....however, when a busy restaurant let's there guests stay an hour after paying while there are people waiting outside for over an hour and a half, then there is a problem.  Being accosted by the manager because we spoke to the people being seated speaks I'll of the restaurant and the managerial staff.  A restaurant should have no problem letting a table know that there are other guests waiting. Especially an incredibly busy one in this city on a star day night. Maybe we are HANGRY at this point, but the snarky server isn't doing it for us either.
