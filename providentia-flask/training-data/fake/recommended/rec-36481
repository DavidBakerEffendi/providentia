While in NY for an awards presentation (my Diamond Golden B - Best of the Best 2010!!) my GM said let's go to the SoHo store since you mentioned wanting to see it & then to Balthazar for lunch.  She quickly got on the phone to make a reservation for 2:30 ( this was a Mon. btw).  So after being taken on a tour of the SoHo Bloomies we grabbed a cab over to Spring St.  We were seated in a few minutes & the place was already packed but we had nice table, albeit close to others it was not intrusive by any means.  Everyone's plates around us looked scrumptious so it was a bit difficult to order - however we ended up completely satisfied!  I decided we should all try the Nettle ravioli as a starter and it was just perfect, homemade with just enough sauce and not overwhelming.  My two companions ordered the balthazar steak with pomme frites - I had a taste of both steak & frites and they were divine! I ordered the roasted beet salad - out of this world good with Maytag Blue cheese and a vinagrette dressing that let the beets really shine, I scraped my plate clean!   If I get back to NY (hopefully soon) I will make a beeline to Balthazar!!
