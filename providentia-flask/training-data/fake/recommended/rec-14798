Great ambiance and the menu selection is very good for a range of tastes!  The waiter suggested a martini made with local gin that was a bit pricey - but the drinks aren't what we came for so it wasn't anything we found ourselves to be dismayed by. Had the cheese steak egg rolls which were yummy but a bit on the heavy side but to be expected! The salads were very good!  Very good service and a great place to eat with reasonable prices as well!
