This is hands down the best restaurant and bar in the greater Philadelphia area.  WE stumbled into this place on accident looking for a quick bite to eat and a drink.  They service, quality, and room blew us away!  We enjoyed it so much we went back on our last night there.  It had quickly become one of my top 5 favorite places to eat and drink in the country! Definitely a MUST!
