Will start by saying the atmosphere in this place is awesome, nice bar, nice upstairs dinning area. The food was awesome and drinks were on point. The reason behind giving only two stars is the service and miscommunication between management and service was horrible. Half way through our dinner(7pm reservation) we were told that we had to leave by 8:15 with no reason. Immediately after finishing our main course we were rushed into dessert selection and handed the check before even receiving our desert. We approached the manager asking why we need to leave by 8pm if there is Â a set time allowed to din and they needed to make room for other reservations, he did not know what we were talking about but did not offer to stay longer or ask who told us this information. Immediately after paying for our check we leaved, and the manger rushed after us, apologizing for any misunderstanding and wanted to offer us one free drink. One free drink after a $200+ dinner? I would come back to this place on a regular basis because the food was awesome, but sorry Tolache you wont be seeing my business again for a while, being rushed into leaving with no reason?
