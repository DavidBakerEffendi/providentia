Plane lands at about 1am.  We get to the hotel and check in sometime around 2am.  Hunger sets in.  We ask the check-in lady if anything is open nearby, and she points us in the direction of some unnamed deli.  Bullshit.  Get out the Yelp iphone application and we're instantly informed about the Halal cart a block away.  Cool beans. For $6 bucks I had a huge heaping pile of pretty good chicken over pretty good rice with some pretty good white and red sauces on top.  I'm not sure I appreciate everyone else's enthusiasm here, but I certainly get the appeal of late night street food.
