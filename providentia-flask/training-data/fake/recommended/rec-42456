Their chicken mozzarella calzone is both massive and delicious. Everything else I've tried here is good, but pretty much what you would expect out of typical diner food. I will say, however, that their decadent brownie cheesecake is the best cheesecake I have EVER had! Not too sweet but definitely rich and creamy and the brownie layer makes for the perfect bite. Yummmmm.
