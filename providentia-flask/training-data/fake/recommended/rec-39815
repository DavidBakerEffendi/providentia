I wanted to see what the big deal was with this place.  It's always mobbed outside, and the decor made the menu look swanky.   So I took my girlfriend here for dinner after a long day at work.  We were both starving and the 30 minute wait didn't make things better.  After being seated we quickly ordered the Fried Tofu which was served quickly and inhaled ever quicker.  Tasty - ok, now where's our veggie Pad Thai? Twenty minutes later it's served and I take the first big bite - right into a piece of chicken.   Thank you Joya for breaking my ten year vegetarian streak.
