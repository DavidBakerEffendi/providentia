Sorry to add to the gloom but I found the food to be just fair with a pricey menu and very small portions. They even charge $1 Â EXTRA for sauces which are not more than a tablespoon. Cocktail sauce that can only coat two shrimps for a buck? Seriously? It should be included ! Ladies room with broken locks for a new place? I get the rustic look but stairs that are steep and already splitting lends itself to danger. Good bar and I guess if you drink enough you can overlook all the downs.
