Very disappointing.  The food was OK but the service was poor.  I downloaded their app to get a $5 discount but it took them 15 minutes to decide that they couldn't do it.  THey shouldn't have an app which they encourage if they don't know how to use it and then make phone calls to the owner who still doesn't know how to use it.  They should have offered to take off the $5 or not charge for the coffee which they forgot to add on until we asked for the discount.
