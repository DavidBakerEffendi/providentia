Before I came here, I thought I loved sushi. But now I realize that I just love soy sauce and ginger. I usually smother my sushi rolls in both. The rolls themselves are usually bland. At Beyond Sushi, however, I barely touched the ginger and soy sauce. The rolls I ordered -- Crunch n' Munch and Sweet Tree -- were so inventive and flavorful that they didn't need extra condiments. Cucumber Mint Lemonade was also delicious and refreshing. I've found a new favorite restaurant.
