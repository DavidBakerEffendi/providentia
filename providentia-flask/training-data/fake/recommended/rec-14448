Went to Bijan's last week with my girlfriend. She was busy so it was up to me to decide on a place we had not been to for drinks and food. Found this place and the reviews got me excited. Our experience was great. This little but cozy (and nicely decorated) place provided some great service, very creative drinks and some really good food. The place was pretty empty when we got there but was packed when it became time to leave. The ambiance is nice, bar looks very organized and has a good warm character. The combination of small and long wood tables provided a good balance of comfort while maximizing space in a small venue. For drinks we had the: * Persian Kiss: very good but the pomegranate was a bit too overpowering. * Pump up the jam: great drink. The cayenne has a kick that hit you after a few seconds. * A gin, cucumber and lime drink that I cant remember the name, but will crave it for the hot summer days. So refreshing and light but with that subtle gin taste. You can also order it with Vodka. Food was the highlight of the evening. We had the Pistachio Crusted Salmon and the Hanger Steak Frites. Both where fresh, perfectly cooked and tasty as hell. The salmon felt fesh and soft. The truffle mash and vegetables where appropriate and tender. The steak and frites where incredible. As an avid addict of pommel frites, I was amazed when my girlfriend said those where "the best fries, I've ever had." I still think Pomme Frites on St. Marks are still king, but the herb fries from Bijan's are well seasoned, perfectly crispy and lots of them! The steak itself was cooked to a perfect medium term and the meat was tender and seasoned lightly. I could taste the quality of the meat instead of an excess of saltiness. We will come again. This place has the charm and friendly staff that we like. There are still many menu items we wanted to try, so Bijan's will surely get a second visit from us.
