As they say, you have to eat NY style pizza. My friends kept telling me how great this coal oven pizza place was.. I think I had high expectations for Lombardi's, because I was slightly disappointed. I came here on a rainy weeknight and we ordered the caesar salad and a large pepperoni, sausage, garlic spinach, pizza for 3 people. Lombardi's still had enough customers, considering that it was pouring rain.The pizza took a while to come out, and I'm not sure if I would've waited any longer. Props for having a crispy thin crust and coal oven taste, but other than that I was not impressed. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff was accommodating, a great place for a group. Pictures of celebrities who have visited this historic pizzeria, newspaper articles, and awards serve as the wall decor around the restaurant. Something fun to look at while you're waiting for your pizza. At least I can say I've been to the first pizzeria in the U.S!
