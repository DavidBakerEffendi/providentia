Why am I finding this just around the corner and I check out of my hotel tomorrow? It gets PACKED and thank god Im brown cause its filled with them as far as the eye can see (which is ALWAYS a good sign of yummy approved food).  You quite don't know where the line starts since everyone seems as they are hanging out. But I notice  that everyone along the wall has receipts in hand and quickly make my way up front. I get: Unda Aloo - quite popular and REALLY filling. I guess its all that spicy potato. Like they say, it has a kick, nothing I couldn't handle but if you are sensitive to spice, head warning. I could've been done with that but I can't ever just order one thing off the menu.  :) Shrimp Masala - By far my fave. It was MUCH skinner than the Unda but really packed the flavor and the shrimp was cooked really well. Something you don't expect from a "fast food joint*". I would get two of these and call it a day. Again, I can't order just one... *not so fast as fast food but I would rather wait an extra 5-10 minutes here than get something out of your typical McBox, BurgerBell spot anyday!!! I eat VERY well living in Oakland/SF area, but I after all the flavorful food I've had out here, I am feeling a bit jealous....
