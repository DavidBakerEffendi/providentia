Let me start by saying the lobster and shrimp pyramid pasta is the best dish I have had in recent memory. Seriously outstanding. If you go, be prepared to wait. Reservations are only accepted before 6:30. They'll take your cell phone and call you when your table is ready, so plan on a pre-dinner drink at Valanni across the street, or Tria down the block. Also, parties of more than four are kind of obnoxious because the place is so small. BYO and cash-only. Service was cordial but not overly friendly. The tasting menu ($45 for four courses), which I've had before and comes with almost too much food, is only available to you if the whole table is also ordering it. We shared the antipasti app, which was big and full of portobello mushrooms, roasted peppers, marinated mozzarella balls, salami, olives and roasted tomatoes. For my entree, I had the arctic char special, served with parmesan new potatoes, grilled asparagus, and a micro greens salad with lump crab meat. It was excellent, though the fish could have been cooked a tad longer. I tried all the other dishes too, and everything was great, with portions that were much bigger than expected. The four of us shared the tiramisu, which was moist, flavorful and gone in 60 seconds. Â  I'm pretty close to claiming Mercato as my favorite restaurant in Philly, but there are still a few more to try.
