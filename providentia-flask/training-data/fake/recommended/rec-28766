Came here because I saw it was good in yelp. I ordered the house special noodle soup as it seemed like it was a safe bet. The noodle had decently good meatballs in it. Even though the soup was a bit bland to me, I really enjoyed the taste and texture of the noodles. I can't wait to come here one day again to try out the other noodles and food on the menu. Definitely will revisit!
