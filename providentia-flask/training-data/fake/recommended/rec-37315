3 of us went in for lunch. The staff as very polite and welcoming. I was extremely impressed with their service. We ordered one soup to share, and the staff split the soup for us. We ordered a crepe at the end to share, and the server once again split that for us. She came out with 3 plates. All of us enjoyed our experience there.
