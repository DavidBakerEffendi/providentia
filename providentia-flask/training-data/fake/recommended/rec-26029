If you read my reviews regularly--and of course you do, why wouldn't you--then you know that I love two things: em-dashes, and restaurants very close to my apartment. So you should be SHOCKED and INTRIGUED that I love Barboncino so much that I'm a legit regular here and it's in an entirely different neighborhood from where I live. The pizza is just so god damn delicious... and the bartenders make a mean Manhattan. What more could you want? A suggestion? Here it is: one of each. Two of the arugula.
