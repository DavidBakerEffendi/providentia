I have eaten sushi lunch here twice now and both times I have been impressed. The sushi was excellent. Everyone who has visited with me agrees the the sushi is very good. I have since ordered take out twice also for dinner to share. I would recommend trying this place out. It is very nice inside. Everything is new and very clean. Enjoy.
