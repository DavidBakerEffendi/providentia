Love, love, love this hole in the wall. I usually order a regular and share with a friend because the portions are pretty big. You can try different sauces before settling, but I highly recommend the pomegranate terriyaki mayo. That being said, the place is pretty small so it's not good for large parties looking to sit down and eat.
