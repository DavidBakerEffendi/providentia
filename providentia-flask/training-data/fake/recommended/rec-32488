Updating my review...I went to Monte Alban again for lunch this weekend. Will you find better Mexican food in California? Of course. So reviewers comparing it to places known for great Mexican food are a little unfair as New England and the northeast in general has long been neglected by great Mexican places. But for Hartford, and possibly all of southern New England, this is as good as it gets. I highly recommend the mole sauce. Favorites are the al pastor burrito and enchilada oaxaquenas. They have some super cheap lunch deals Monday through Friday that cost less than $8. The weekday lunch specials are limited to mostly burritos and an enchilada combo but well worth the trip. Also, parking here SUCKS. Look for street parking. The side lot is dominated by parking for Tisane and you'll get towed.
