This place is an f-ing joke!  The food tastes good but the small portions are ridiculous.  You could spend $100 per person just to feel like you ate an entire meal.  I like tapas and I like the idea of tasting plates, but this restaurant needs to rethink itself.  It's in East Falls not Rittenhouse square and the ambiance is not good enough to justify the the prices.  Its a great restaurant if you want to waste your money and feel like a chump.
