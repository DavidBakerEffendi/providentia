Sketch Burgers definitely lives up to the hype. My journey began with me narrowly missing the location, but finding a primo parking spot right down the block. The building/eatery is unassuming and was faintly hidden behind some trees, adding to the mystery as we walked in. The decor was cool and simple, foreshadowing the feel you get from their amazing food. My gf and I both ordered the vegan bean burger, asked for it to be well done, and added our own spin with additional toppings. Also got the Belgian fries and the brownie w ice cream, and they too were phenomenal. The burger patty tasted fresh with that made from scratch texture to it. The green goddess sauce added a perfect spice to it, and I will def be choosing that sauce again when I return. Overall, this place made it to my top 2 list for burgers. Its only competition lies with the veggie boom burger from UBurger in Boston.... But it's an epic tie. Can't wait to come here again!
