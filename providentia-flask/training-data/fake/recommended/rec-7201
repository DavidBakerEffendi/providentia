I am such a fan of Penelope. It is so good. I've been here twice with my cousin. The food is excellent, atmosphere is awesome (lots of hip first-dates, think girls with cat eye make up and slinky black TopShop shirts) The prices are nothing to call home about- But I am willing to spend a pretty pennyon good food. We love love love the chicken meatballs. She always gets the arugula chicken meatball salad and I've had that plus the chicken meatball sub w/ pesto, fontina, tomato... it's fantastic. Finger-suckin' good. And we always start off with the spinach artichoke dip just because spinach artichoke dip. Their peanut butter blondie is pretty good. For my second adventure at Penelope, I had my eye on a slice of their red velvet cake but couldn't get myself to spend $5.50 on it for it, plus it was post- Hurricane Sandy when all we'd been eating all week was goldfish and halloween candy stuck inside our cold and dark apartments. Maybe next time when I resume my normal yoga and green regime. Love you Penelope.
