Aside from a disinterested waiter and the journey through the hood to get here, this place is rock solid. Good quality seafood with reasonable prices. Had shrimp with Garlic Sauce and Broiled Octopus as apps., and split a fried white fish for dinner. Best shrimp and garlic I have ever had. Leftover sauce was so good I saved it for bread dunking and dumped it over my rice. I will definitely try the takeout from this place in the future.
