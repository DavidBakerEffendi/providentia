Passed Dalessandro's on the way into the city. Checked online to be sure it was the place I thought, then stopped on the way home. THE best cheesesteak you'll ever eat.  Perfectly seasoned steak on a crusty Amoroso roll. Fried onions a must ! Provolone, of course... Counter seating inside (cramped) a few tables outside.  Order and wait til they call your name. Cash only. Good beer and drink choices.  A great experience ! Go a little out of the way for the best cheesesteak EVER
