"Hot sauce? Psssh, people think Tobasco sauce is hot, so this must be about the same." This was the thought process that went through my head when my friends warned me about the hot sauce. Any pride I felt in being able to handle extremely spicy foods due to my Indian upbringing went out as quickly as the 3rd or 4th bite into my food. And never have I been so glad to look like an idiot, because the food was so amazing that I didn't care. I mean eventually, my body stopped sweating, and I felt like I could breathe again, and then I was thinking "wow, this is great!" My first experience with Chicken/Lamb and Rice was at some food carts in Philly, and I thoroughly enjoyed them, but since having the full blown awesomeness of the NYC Halal Cart, I feel sad every time I am craving lamb and rice, and I have only the Philly version available. $6.00 for meat loaded goodness with rice, bread, and salad (although a lot of people opt out on the salad; I personally think it works well with everything else in there). Word of warning: load up on the mysterious white sauce, add just a few squirts of the hot sauce. Unless you can't handle spicy food at all, then don't add any hot sauce or you will probably be living in the bathroom the next day. My cousins and I drove into the city just for this, and I am so glad we did. Now I keep trying to find excuses to go back for this amongst other things. The line wasn't as long as I thought it would be either, which was great.
