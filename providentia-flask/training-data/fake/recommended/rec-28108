Great food. Brunch Irish Breakfast roll is amazing. Â Very nice service staff and when things slow down a bit due to immense volume they handle it with have and charm. Well definitely be back. Update: new Chef has gotten rid of the amazing Irish Breakfast. So disappointing. The rest of the Food has been great, but I craved this dish and miss it. Hope they reconsider. Maybe a weekend special? Please?
