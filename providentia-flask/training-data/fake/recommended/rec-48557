Amazing food, great service, awesome atmosphere.  I loved the veggie chubbsteak so much I creamed my butt.  Seriously the bathroom is also pretty cool looking mad stickers n whatnot.  You gotta try this place if you're into good ass vegan/veggie/even meat product food.  Couldn't be more pleased on the real tho.
