At here last night.  It was certianly pleasant enough.  The decor is dark wood and inviting.  The place is crowded and a bit loud, but you make due, right? I had a one of the cocktails from the list (a Corragio).  It was sweet like a Manhattan, not sweet like a mojito.  I liked it, a lot. For appetizers we had Sweet Corn Crostini (really good and earthy), Steak Tartare (too much truffle oil, but it happens), and Burrata (the star). Entrees were the Veal Agnolotti (really good pasta, sauce tasted like bacon) and the Duck (super tender, I asked for more towards rare and they accomodated). Not enough room for dessert!   Definitely go, and go back.
