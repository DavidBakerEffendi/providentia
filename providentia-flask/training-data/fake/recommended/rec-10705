Buvette was a charming spot to have brunch this weekend.  We didn't feel like waiting for a table in the backyard but I think we may have been a little remiss with that decision.  In any case, we settled in at the bar and had some croissants, the waffle and coffee.  The portions were extremely tiny--think mini croissants and one instant-size (although definitely homemade) waffle.  But I don't think the prices were that unreasonable for the West Village and as I was actually still kind of full from a big dinner the night before, I appreciated the portion control.  Still, something to keep in mind if you are actually hungry; order a few things.  I will definitely be back for dinner to see how that compares!
