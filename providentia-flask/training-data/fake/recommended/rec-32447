This place has been about a couple months now and I was here on the second day they opened a several times since. Go on Tuesday if you want your loyalty card punched twice as its Double Punch Tuesday. Overall its pretty good. They have suggested panini sandwiches but you can really pick from whatever meat you want and a variety of generally fresh ingredients. For reasons that no one can understand it seems that virtually all their suggestions include salami. Even the employees said that salami was the item most people wanted removed. I have been going with the buffalo chicken. But avoid the lettuce because when they heat the panini the lettuce gets all wilty. Really the lettuce should go on AFTER the panini goes though the heat. Anyway its pretty decent. Interestingly they also have coffee and breakfast items. I have not tried any of them but the muffins looked pretty good. Its kind of expensive. A medium panini and a drink will cost you more than $10 and you might still be hungry, as I was today. It can be kind of slow. Partly it just seems to take time to put the paninis together and then its got to go on the panini thingie to heat it up. All this takes time even if its not crowded. Also its worth noting that the ownership is very religious and therefore the place is not open on Sundays. Doesn't bother me since I normally go for lunch from work but it could be irksome if you were expecting it to be open. Overall my coworkers and I generally like the place. It feels more upscale than your average sandwich place and the ingredients are definitely fresher than Subway. That comes at a price but I keep coming back so I guess I'm saying its worth it.
