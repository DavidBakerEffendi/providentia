I was in the area for a week and ate here twice. Good diverse menu, obviously an emphasis on steak. Food came out cooked to temp and hot. They use food runners so when the food is ready it comes out immediately, doesn't wait for your waitress to have time. Their salad bar is a nice bonus that comes with the entrees. Service was on point. Can't wait to go back when I'm in the area again.
