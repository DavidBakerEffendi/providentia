I really enjoyed dinner at this place. Went with a group of 6 people and shared a bunch of pastas and pizzas. The pastas di mare, ragu napoltano are not to be missed. And the pizzas - we got veggie and diavola and they were both delish. the artichoke appetizer was simple but super refreshing with the lemon flavor. This place is great for groups... a great find!
