I LOVE THEIR CHICKEN!!! Their hot chicken is honestly some of the best I had. I had the regular because I do not eat spicy food, however the spicy is definitely hot if you like. My friend and I came here and we were shocked to see how small this place was. It was pretty "intimate" with its seating and I could hear the weird conversation next to me. That was not too great. The service is extremely welcoming in this restaurant which I really enjoyed. Their drinks were not too bad, a little too sweet for my liking. I ordered the Sister Rosetta which is their most popular drink and it was not my favorite. It tastes like a sex on the beach which many people happen to like. Their macaroni and cheese had a powdery taste to it, so it took away from the down south home made taste I was expecting so I did not finish it. Their vegetables and their french fries [sweet potato fries as well] are amazing! I had been waiting to try this place for quite some time so I was happy to finally get here. I don't know if I would return, it is a little pricey but not too bad. Reasonable.
