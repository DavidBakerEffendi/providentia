This place is pricier than the restaurants I regularly go to, but worth it for a treat.  Everything you will consume, from cocktails to their bread and (ridiculously delicious hommade) butter is fresh and made with care.  The flavors are subtle and portions on the smaller side (bearing in mind that most restaurant portions are ginormous these days), but overall the food is tasty and well-prepared and service is impeccable.  I have had wonderful dining experiences there and plan on going back.  I also love that they have cloth towels in the rest rooms instead of paper ones (it's the little things...).
