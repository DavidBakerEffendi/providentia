In a word, this place is AWESOME. Went here with my g/f a few weeks back but finally got on here to write this review. Very cute restaurant, lively crowd, young crowd, some may find it a little too loud but we were fine with it. Our waitress was cute as hell, even my g/f contemplated some scissor action. The service was great. The cavatelli in a pesto sauce was phenomenal.
