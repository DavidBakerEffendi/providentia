We came here during restaurant week. We had a large group. We had reservations so we were seated fairly quickly. It is a beautiful restaurant. We walked by the very big salad bar. They were really crowded and that was expected. I thought the meats were really dry and flavorless. I don't know if its because it was restaurant week and they had to cook in a rush or what. It was my first   time and most likely my last time. I just don't see the hype and I would definitely not pay full price for it. The sides were good and the  dessert saved it somewhat. I'm a sucker for sweets.
