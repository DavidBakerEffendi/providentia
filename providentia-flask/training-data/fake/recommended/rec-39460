Cool place, with a huge beer list.  If you are not a beer lover, stay away!  I felt like we were going to get kicked out if we asked for any other drink.  We had some questions about the beer list, and our server was nice enough in answering them (but kind of made us feel dumb at the same time).  Food was your typical bar menu.  I had the California wrap, which was pretty good.  We ordered guacamole as an appetizer, which was really good considering we were ordering it at a bar. I feel like if we had a little bit more direction from the server concerning the beer selection, we would have enjoyed this place a lot more.  If you're a beer fan, this is definitely the place to go.
