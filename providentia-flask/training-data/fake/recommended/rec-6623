There would have been a time in my life when a towering burger with lots of stuff, primarily bacon, oozing out of the sides, would have impressed me. Since I do care about my choloesterol these days, I have bumped Corner Bistro from it's original number one spot down a couple. The burger is juicy. The thickness is perfect, but you have to go simple: Burger, cheddar, maybe a couple onions. That's it. Also re: the wait - I find that going at 6 or 6:30 on a weeknight and sitting at the bar does the job.
