This is amazing Italian Taverna with a very cool and cozy ambiance.  Bar looks awesome with all the woodwork and liquor bottles so does the coffee bar.  Restaurant has a very pleasant and comforting feeling and upon entering you know they will treat you with great good, and no disappointment it is.  Came here for brunch and what a delicious meal we had.   I had the steak tartar for app, wow!   followed with the zucchini frittata with roasted tomato, goat cheese and basil which was excellent.  my wife had the Uovo modenese with cotechino sausage, poached eggs w tomato hollandaise which she loved and couldn't put down. The specialty drinks and juices are amazing and delicious original creations.   This is the place where you want to come back the following week and try all other menu items.   Definitely coming back...
