I love the daily specials at the noodle bar. It's the one place to get some authentic tasting Korean food in grab-it-to-go style. The Korean style beef sushi rolls are awesome as well as their other salad bar items. You can't beat $5.99/lb.     Everything is neat and for a place that serves so many it is well-maintained.
