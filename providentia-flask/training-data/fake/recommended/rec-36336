An unfortunate evening made right by management ... Came with a  friend, a former New Yorker who has lived in Texas for the past 16 years.. appetizers ordered were not served until requested....2 times...a fish for 2 was presented, taken away to be fileted, and served 5 minutes later but well in advance of other diners...a burger ordered with sauteed onions was served sans onions (but charged $2 as open food) and when all was said and done- the overpriced (but you knew that going in)  bill was presented with a 20% tip for a party of 6... and no choice but to pay it.... the food was absolutely tasty, the crowd way hip and the experience that evening very unfortunate as we left feeling mistreated and ripped-off SO.. I cam home and wrote this review which i have now edited because the next morning my wife called the restaurant, spoke to a very lovely young lady who said she'd have a manager return the call later and lo and behold- a manager did call just a couple of hours later and apologized AND removed the ENTIRE tip from our credit card AND reminded us of their excellent wine cellar with an offer to share some wine on the house when next we visit. And we will visit again- KUDOS to the management for making things righ...
