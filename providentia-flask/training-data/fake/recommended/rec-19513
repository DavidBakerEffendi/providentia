One of the best breakfasts I've had in the city.  I ordered the millet pancakes that had an almost overly moist texture however the taste was incredible.  Perhaps the best pancakes I have ever had.  I also tried the Eggs Benedict which were perfectly made.  The service was very prompt and friendly.  One drawback is that it's crowded and you may need to wait a while to get a table.  That's not the restaurant's fault though.
