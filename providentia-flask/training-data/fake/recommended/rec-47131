Sabrina's is an all-time favorite. A few years ago (when my pockets were a little fuller), I was eating at Sabrina's every weekend. Sometimes, for a change of pace, I would go twice in one weekend. In over one-hundred visits, I've ordered the same thing almost every time: The barking chihuahua. The chihuahua is a breakfast burrito containing eggs, black beans, red pepper, and jack cheese. It's served with salsa and sour cream on top, with some excellent home fries on the side. One time when I went to Sabrina's with my sister, she ordered the blueberry granola pancakes special, and those were the best pancakes I ever tasted. The vibe is hip and the decor is retro. The coffee is La Colombe. The menu is extensive and the specials are always interesting. The line is usually long on the weekend, but if you call ahead and give them your name, you can save yourself some serious waiting time. Though best known for its brunch, Sabrina's is also open for lunch and dinner. But don't worry if you're craving omelets and it's dinnertime; the brunch menu is available all day.
