People shouldn't go to Kumo expecting outstanding Japanese food; rather, they should go expecting to enjoy the show put on by Kumo's talented and engaging hibachi chef. He has all the tricks up his sleeves - onion volcano, bouncing egg, spinning knives - and sure knows how to excite his guests by delivering sake from a squirt bottle to their mouths. The food itself was passable, but nothing to rave about. Go with a group of friends to celebrate a special occasion!
