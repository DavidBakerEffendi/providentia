So we have been travelling around the USA Â we came over from England for five weeks and we have had some amazing meals in our travels, but this old style diner took me right back in time the 1930s ford parked next door did help but more so the old fashioned taste to the fries really took me back and the huge portions were to big for me these days but took me back to when I was a kid and could eat till my stomach hurt.
