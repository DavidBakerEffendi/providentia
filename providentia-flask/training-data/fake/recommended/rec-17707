The location of this café may seem random, but the place really makes up for it.  Café Hanamizuki has cute decals which includes wall art, and chalkboard art. The coffee was great but the snacks were amazing. I wanted to try the Hawaiian rice ball, but that was sold out (which is understandable since I went there at 6pm). My next option was the suki-yaki rice ball, and it was surprisingly good. I had no idea what half the ingredients were, but it was really tasty! Excellent place to study, chat with a friend or have lunch--the café was very spacious.
