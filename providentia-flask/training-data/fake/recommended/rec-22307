The food is horrible. I swear it tastes like what I would imagine very bad Mexican TV dinners, made by Italians, heated up and transferred to a plate would taste like -- although, no where near as atrocious as Su Casa. I give it two stars because the margaritas are strong (makes the food taste better) and the employees are friendly.
