Cheap beers, great burgers, and a dive bar atmosphere?  That's right my alley. With this place, you pretty much know what you're getting when you walk through the door.  There's no hand out menus, the draft list isn't updated, and who knows who's going to end up sitting next to you at the bar.  It's a no frills kind of a place.  And I like that. The burger is very good, not spectacular.  It's a big patty, with not a lot of seasoning.  It's a more straight up "burger" taste than some of the other fancy burgers out there.   Overall, it's a good place to sit at the bar and have some good food and a good time.
