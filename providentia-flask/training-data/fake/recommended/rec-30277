I just had brunch at Miriam and it was awesome. Husband had the chicken shwarma and the plate was huge. I had the Bureka--I debated over a lot of things, and was really happy with my choice, though I would have like a pita to go with it since there are so many things to scoop up on the plate. My only complaint was that our server wasn't very attentive. She never checked in on us even once. It wasn't so busy that she couldn't have come by. We had to keep flagging her down.
