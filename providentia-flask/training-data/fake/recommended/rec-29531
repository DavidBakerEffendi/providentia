Me and my room mates just ordered a calzone and fried dough balls and we couldn't have been more disappointed! The calzone was burnt and had little to no cheese in it. Not worth the price we paid. The fried dough was soggy cold and unbearable to even finish. Along with all of that the people who work there are so incredibly rude!
