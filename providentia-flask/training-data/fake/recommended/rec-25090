The food was okay but the prices were high. Zero atmosphere, kind of a noisy cafeteria style. The 12-inch gluten-free pizza was very good, but again--$18? Really? Every topping except cheese adds $1.50 and meat toppings add $2.50. Two adults and two kids, no booze, a couple of appetizers and everyone got a dessert. The bill came to $130 including tip.
