I was visiting Philadelphia for the food last weekend and I went to countless restaurants that were all amazing but Parc will be a spot I talk about for years to come because I have never had a breakfast that amazing. The food and ambiance of Parc is of such high quality it feels like you are sitting in a cafe in France. I had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict, shared the pastry basket, and topped it off with a Bellini! I wish I remembered our waitress's name, she was adorable and really added to the experience. I will be going back to Parc next time I'm in Philly for sure!
