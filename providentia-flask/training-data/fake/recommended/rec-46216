Amazing Indian take-away for cheap! When you see that an Indian restaurant is next door to a really good Indian grocery/market with lots of fresh produce you know that you're likely to have a great meal. Hot Peppers is really very, very good, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. I ate in, and had Aloo Tikki (other reviews are right-- don't miss these if you go), palak paneer (which was top-notch), and garlic naan (a solid B, but not quite as good as the other dishes). Interestingly, it didn't come with rice, and I didn't see rice on the menu, either. Maybe I missed it? Or most customers have rice going at home all the time anyway? Definitely don't miss this one; I drove from Princeton to go and it was completely worth the trip.
