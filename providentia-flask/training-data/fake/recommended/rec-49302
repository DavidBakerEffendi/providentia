Well I usually love this place but unfortunately my last experience was exceptionally bad. I was there around 6 on Sunday and the cashier was amazingly rude. just absolutely atrocious. While waiting for my food I over heard more gossip about her co-workers than a high school gym room. I love the food here but seriously, I don't need to be part of whatever the restaurant has going on behind closed doors. I had a couple questions about my sandwich and was met with a combination of general uncaring and felt like I was being almost yelled at. Ill be sure to avoid her from now on. Wish there were two different rating scales on here, one for food and one for service.
