I don't understand why more restaurants specialize like this.  Just pick on thing and do it well, really well. The Meatball Shop is THE best place for a good and cheap dinner.  Yes, you can have both in NYC. The menu is a fun game using dry erase markers to order what you want - from the main dish to drink to desert.  And make sure you leave room for desert.  Ice cream cookie sandwich that dreams are made of. For two people, dinner/drinks and desert - under $30.  Can't beat that.
