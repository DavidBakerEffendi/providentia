I considered coming back to this place to try out their brunch or dinner options but now that I've given it more thought, nah. Service was subpar. It wasn't busy at all on a random Tuesday for breakfast/lunch so why did it take forever to get the check? Or anything for that matter...Also thanks for letting us know that the lunch menu was gonna be available in like 10 minutes. Sarcasm. Got the omelette which tasted like an omelette you get on the plane. Bacon and chicken sausage sides were basic.
