I had the vegetarian ramen. I've had the vegetarian Ramen at Totto, Jin and many other places in NY, SF and Asia. Chuko is the best, narrowly edging out Totto in my book. The broth is complex and adding the chili garlic sauce in adds depth. I love the use of market vegetables. It makes me want to come try it again when the selection is different. If you are on the fence, then do yourself a favor. Come to Chuko. You won't be disappointed. My friends tried the other non-vegetarian varieties and they felt the same. As to things other than the food. We arrived around 7:00 on a Saturday and only had to wait around 30 minutes. This is considerably better than most of the other small ramen places. The wait staff were very friendly and tried to make us feel at home. The service is very fast. The ambiance and overall atmosphere is good. The furniture and decor are minimal, but you won't notice since the food is so good.
