A moment of silence for the pizza.  Ahhhh.  The crust is crispy, but not burnt.  It folds properly.  The local ingredients are lovely and fresh, but in no way do they scream "healthy".  (If you're looking for healthy pizza, try California.)   As for the location, and the pain-in-the-ass factor...cute street, lovely rustic interior.  The low counters enable you to watch the whole beautiful pizza-process happen before your eyes.  Don't even think about trying to get a table past 8:30 on a weekend evening.  Once the ingredients run low, no more seatings.  It took us a few tries to figure this out.  Come on a weekday night (early-ish) or on a weekend (very early).  On the up side...though you'll have to wait (and wait, and wait?) for a table, you can BYOB and they'll provide you with glasses so you can drink on the benches outside.  The BYO-factor makes this place more than affordable.   And now back to the pizza...
