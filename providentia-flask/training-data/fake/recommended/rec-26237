This is a very popular street cart in Midtown Manhattan on Park Ave. during lunch hours it is hard to miss this food truck as there is a big line to get food from uncle gussy's. Ordered the combo platter (chicken + lamb) with rice, tzatziki sauce, grilled onions and hot sauce. The lamb is alright but the grilled chicken had a ton of flavor. Price : $6.00 Will definitely return to try other things from Uncle Gussy's
