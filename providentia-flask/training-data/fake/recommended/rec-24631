Went to Salinas 3 times in the past 3 weeks for 3 totally different occasions with different type of people each time and everyone without exception loved it. How can you not love it? Place is cozy and gorgeous. Not only decor is beautiful but its one of those spots that makes you feel like you are celebrating something not just another restaurant with bunch of boring faces. Staff is polite and friendly. Food is beyond anything i can describe. all i can say is that you will find things on the menu that you most likely are not going to get in too many restaurants in NY to say the least. i hear only few places in NYC have similar menus to Salinas. Drinks are amazing. Overall if any restaurant deserves all 5 Stars it has to be Salinas.
