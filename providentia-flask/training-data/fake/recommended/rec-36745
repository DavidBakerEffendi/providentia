Yum! So glad, we came right when they opened up because the line was crazy when we left. There were 3 of us and a large pizza was the perfect size. My sister is vegetarian so I loved that we could get half the pizza to accommodate her. Pizza does take a while to cook but the wait is worth it. I love that the crust is thin and you can tell they use quality ingredients. Glad we came here for our NY Pizza experience FYI-THEY DO NOT HAVE ALCOHOL
