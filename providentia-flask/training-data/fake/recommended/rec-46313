My review is for dinner. It was a double date...and the four of us are all 24-25 and trying to save a few bucks. That is primarily why this place deserves 5 stars - Wow you get a lot for your money here! Make sure you go at an off-hour if you have 2-4 people because they don't take reservations for small parties. The food and wine were great (for the price). Yes I've had better and more fancy Italian, but if you adjust for the price you really can't beat it. Excellent pasta and buratta. We ate and drank our fill and I was shocked at how low the bill was. We sat outside during the summer..they keep their windows open so the whole thing is open-air which is cute and nice. Very good service. Cash only.
