So... I find myself downtown for St. Baldrick's Day (annual event to raise money to fight childhood cancers), and the bar where its located is too packed to grab a meal.  So the missus and I take a quick stroll north and find Max Brenner's.  A chocolatier who also serves food?  Let's give it a try... The interior design can only be described as a cross between Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and the Milk Bar from "A Clockwork Orange".  Very, very odd, but kinda cool in a quirky way.  The aroma of chocolate was heavy in the air;  Not super-sweet, more of the "in processing" cocoa aroma, which is fine. The food was very, very good.  As it was Friday during Lent, I had the Sandwich of the Seas, a salmon burger that was extremely well cooked and very tasty.  My wife had a mozzarella, basil, and tomato panini that was also very good.  The waffle fries that come with them, lightly dusted in cocoa powder no less, were extremely good. The only downside was, oddly enough, at the end of the night.  While our server was pretty good overall, he gave my wife some bad advice on the Mexican Spiced Hot Cocoa... He said it was relatively mild and more of a sweet spice.  However, given I switched with her, I can say it definitely had more of a kick than that;  I enjoyed it, but I'm a chili head. It was definitely worth the visit, if only for the quirky vibe.  The fact that the food at a chocolatier was as good as it was just made the visit even better.
