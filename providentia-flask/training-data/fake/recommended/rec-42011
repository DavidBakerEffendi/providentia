Finally had the chance to try out Paesano's the other day and like, Modo Mio, they do not disappoint :D Great prices ($6-7 including a drink) for some delicious hearty sandwiches...tried the roast pork with peppers and the beef with cabbage.  Terrific combination of flavors...with a bit of a kick.  Will be back.
