I have been here several times and mostly enjoy sitting outside when the weather is nice. I have been here for lunch, dinner, and late night bites. More recently, I have enjoyed the bucket of pumpkin beers for $16. Food-wise, I have had their mussels, truffle fries, tuna melt, ceviche (not a favorite), kale salad with fried egg (not a favorite) and fried calamari. They have a happy hour but you must sit in the bar. I seriously hate when restaurants do that. I found out recently, they deliver too, which is a pretty cool service.
