Tia pol is awesome. There are a number of dishes that I always get and that always end up being delicious. The patatas bravas, lamb skewers, and croquettes are my favorites. The last time I was there I had the asparagus (one of the specials that night) with crumbly cheese and lemon, fantastic! For dessert, always the leche frita, yum yum. There's usually a wait to be seated, but the line usually moves fast. I'm giving four out of five stars because they continue to list cider on their drink menu, when it actually isn't sold there any longer. For months they were telling me "We ran out already!" Â Try Tia Pol, it will rock your world.
