Great lunch special - although wish they had something other than super sugary/HFCS drinks to go with.  Either way, the fries were good - thicker, not like thin frites.  Still great, though, some soft, some crisp.  Veggie wrap was very tasty, which can usually be a drag at restaurant places that only have one token non-meat option.  If I go again, it would probably be for frites only, but overall a nice lunch stop.
