I had been wanting to try Chickie's but they're always closed at convenient times.  Like when we need a big Italian hoagie after work prior to the Phillies game.  I ordered the Italian Caprese.  Extremely, extremely tasty sandwich.  Fresh prosciutto and mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil.  Friendly service.  Nice local feel.  Only problem was they were out of their specialty "seeded bread."  I have little "REAL" Italian hoagie experience to compare but I think this sandwich was 5 stars!
