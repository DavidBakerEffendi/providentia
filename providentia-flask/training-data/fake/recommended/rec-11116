Great Brunch! All other reviews were pretty on the ball, my only note is that this place is cash only, and being one that never carries any cash I was surprised to see that. They do have an ATM in the restaurant, thank goodness. I had the special, eggs bene Florentine, totally delicious! My friend had the Challah fresh toast, it was like eating a cinnamon roll. I will definitely come back here again when I visit Philly.
