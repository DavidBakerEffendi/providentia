Only stopped in for a drink since we couldn't get a table for over an hour and fourty-five minutes. Had a margarita on the rocks and wow-wee was it a drink! The ambiance was great and a smart stop for happy hour. Â I wish we were able to have dinner but I guess next time we will go prepared to wait.
