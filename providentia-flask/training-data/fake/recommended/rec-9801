The food is really great and the location is good. You can take a walk after dinner to the water to digest the heavy pasta sauces :) My cheese ravioli with pink sauce was excellent. The sauce was creamy and tangy. My friend's seafood ravioli was not as good, but still quite good. Finally, the steak is humungous! Literally a wood plank with greens, cheese flakes, and tons of steak. Recommended maybe for two people. But the service left something to be desired. We were there on a Sunday night around 7pm. The restaurant was at least 50% empty but still the hostess kept us waiting for 10-20 minutes outside. When we asked a few times when we could be seated, she didn't offer any explanation. Others were waiting too. Why -- to make the place look busy with ppl standing outside?? When we were finally seated, it was a tiny table for the 3 of us, when there were plenty of free tables around. We could barely put the bread on the table. Even when we finished eating, the restaurant was not completely full, so it's not like they had a ton of reservations or anything.
