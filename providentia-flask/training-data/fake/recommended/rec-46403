Terrible service!! Made reservation on Sunday at 2pm. The whole place was empty inside. We wanted to sit outside, and there were two empty tables. The hostess would not let us and said they were reserved for 4 people just in case. People sitting outside started to leave anyways, what's the big deal?! Then 3 people walked in and they seated them there right away even though they didn't request for it. The hostess must be on some kind of power trip. We walked out and went to Tribece Grill, where they seated us outside right away. The service was night and day!
