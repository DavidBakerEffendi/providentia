Came to Landmarc for brunch with a few friends.  I had the Eggs Norwegian and a Bellini.  The food was excellent, very fresh and well-prepared.  The Bellini was strong-which is just what I needed!  The waitress was excellent, very attentive and honest.  The only issue for me are the seats...they are in dire need of a change!  The leather booths were ripped - unsightly and uncomfortable.  Otherwise the ambiance (besides the ripped seats), food and service is excellent.
