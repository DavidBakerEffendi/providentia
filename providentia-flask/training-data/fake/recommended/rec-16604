i love this place.  i go to bed dreaming about it and hating the fact that i don't live in nyc anymore.  why can't sf have any amazing halal carts?!?!?  when i lived in nyc, my friends and i would walk 50+ blocks from downtown just to eat this or cab all the way up to 53rd street at 4am just to stand in a long line around the corner.  worth all the effort and wait!
