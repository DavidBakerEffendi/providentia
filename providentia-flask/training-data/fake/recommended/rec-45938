I always ordered from this place and never had an issue until today. I called for delivery and the lady on the phone was completely rushing taking the order. They delivered the wrong dish and when I called back she simply said "you need to speak clearer next time". Really? She followed on by telling me to throw the dish away and to remind her to credit me for the dish next time I called. Next time? How about bring me the dish that I just paid and ordered now (plus, the dish has meat and I am vegan). One thing I will not tolerate is crappy costumer service especially from a place that received a lot of business from me. I Â do not recommend this place.
