This might be my favorite place in NYC.  I try to come here at least once a month.  I have never had anything bad on the menu and have tried most of the staples as well as many of the specials. I typically dont order chicken when I go out to eat but have ordered here on several occasions  its that good.  Food is always fresh and they are great with helping pair wine wth your meal.  One thing I get every single time are the meatball sliders because they are simply amazing.  Love the place, love the service, love the neighbhorhood, love the food.
