Was great back on the days, seems like the changed something in the pizza. Don't get me wrong , the squares are one of the best, but somedays better then others. The food in the dining room is still great! Lenny is a great chef. Ice cream is alway great if they don't run out. Summertime always expect a crowd. Â If it wasn't for the inconsistant pizza I would of gave five stars.
