Food here is always amazing. It makes up for the long wait. A group of 7 of us went last night (Thursday) for a birthday and had an awesome time. Had handsome Greg as our server. He is da best. The only reason I took a star off was because the shorter host with a ponytail. She was not so friendly and made my friend feel some type of way for asking how long the wait would be. A smile wouldn't hurt girl. Still we love cuban petes and we'll be back!
