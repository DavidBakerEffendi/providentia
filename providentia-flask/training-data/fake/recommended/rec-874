We only stopped in for drinks after mid morning tours around the historic sites. We wanted some cold beer on a hot july day. They had some interesting local choices that we couldn't get in Florida and the bartender was nice about letting us sample. We enjoyed our cold beers and even went to feed the meter. The food looked good but we had a later breakfast and was planning on putting our two sense on the pat's/geno's battle later that afternoon. We received great service. They seemed to have a good lunch crowd and I can see how tables on the second floor have lovely views. We didn't want to take up a table for only drinking. I checked the tab on the way out and it said our server was Pete. I don't know if that was his name or not, usually I inquire so I can talk to a bartender by name but he was so attentive that we never needed to use it. He was working on July 7th from noon to three approximately. Their borough no. 6 is a delicious take on a Manhattan and we wished we hadn't ordered the large format porter in lieu of each having our own instead of splitting. We are really into ryes and was pleased to see a very decent selection. We had a nice little afternoon day drinking a few beers and splitting a yummy cocktail. Everyone was friendly. I would recommend this little spot to anyone touring the area who wants a cold beer.
