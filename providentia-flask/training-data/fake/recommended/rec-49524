Very expensive ( don't expect to leave without spending at least $20) Right off the PATH (Get off on 23rd)  it's about two blocks down on the street opposite of the PATH exit. Atmosphere (4/5) - Basically if a restaraunt, farmers market and williams sonoma had a baby, this would be their love child.  So THIS is where all the cool trendy moms go!  I felt like this is where I'd like to be on a Thursday night when I am a fabulous young mother living in Greenwich Village with a fancy 2 bedroom apartment with a Butler named Geoffrey. Food (2/5) - TOO salty.  YUCKY.  I am not a vegetarian fan and unfortunately this reminded me why.   I ordered the risotto which tasted like grounded up hemlock that was basted in salt.  However underneath all of the salt was some yummy food, I think...  I am still coming out of my salt induced coma. Will I come back?  YES!  Looks very neat.
