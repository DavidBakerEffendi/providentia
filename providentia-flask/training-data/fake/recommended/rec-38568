I recently moved to the Passyunk area and have taken forever to find the ideal spot for frittering away a late Saturday morning. My problems were solved today when I finally girded my loins and entered B2 after passing it every day for the last few weeks. Although the bar-style ordering might seem intimidating, I found that the line moved very quickly. The staff was immensely friendly and timely with my order -- the barista even helped me find a seat, since the place was relatively crowded. What nice service! The bagel sandwich I had was amazing -- generous amounts of goat cheese, thick slices of cucumber, and fresh basil leaves on a delightful toasted wheat bagel. All of this for 5.50, and I am still full from it! The coffee was satisfactory, and I got a complimentary refill with the mug-sized serving. The rest of the menu looked just as appetizing, with a ton of vegetarian and vegan-friendly options to boot! I can't wait to come back again and try something else. I'm not 100% sure why people complain about "the hipster crowd" here -- Â it feels pretty petty and detracts from what is a cozy, reasonably priced cafe with friendly service and yummy food. My only (very, very minor nitpicky) complaints are that the place is cash only and the table I sat at was perilously wobbly. Definitely recommended!
