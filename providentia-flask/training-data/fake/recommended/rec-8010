The food and service at Amada are outstanding. Both times I came here, I made the reservation for 5pm, which is when they open. I arrived early and they politely requested that I wait at the bar. The bartender was fun to watch and he made really good drinks. When someone came to walk my wife and I to our table, she carried my wife's drink for her which I thought was a nice touch. I really felt pampered the entire time I was there - constant changing of our silverware and refilling our wine glasses with no delay. The food portions were small, but everything looked and tasted delicious. Overall, Amada is my favorite upscale restaurant in Philly.
