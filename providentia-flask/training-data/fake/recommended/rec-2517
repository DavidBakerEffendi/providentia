Cosmi's has the *BEST* cheese-steak in Philadelphia.  The bread is great, the meat is high quality, and it is put together with care.  Also, Cosmi's has a fresher, non greasy taste. I went on a Cheese-Steak crawl with my classmates.  We tried Jim's, Pat's, Geno's, John's Roast Pork, and Cosmi's.  Cosmi comes out on top!
