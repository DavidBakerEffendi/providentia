Small place with a hellishly long line, especially in the winter - but oh so worth it.   The half dozen times I've been here, I've never been disappointed by the soup.  From the creamy mushroom soup to the lobster bisque, even the cold carrot ginger soup in the leaden heat of a summer heat wave, everything was delicious and satisfying. There's a varied selection and a large soup with a piece of bread and fruit with drink extra, won't break the bank at under $8.
