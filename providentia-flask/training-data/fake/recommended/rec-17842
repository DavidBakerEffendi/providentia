I usually eat at Fornos. I wanted to try something new I read so many good reviews about Fernandez so I wanted to give it a try. For starters I ordered calamari as an appetizer that wasn't good it was very rubbery, and for my meal I ordered the tile ribeye and shrimp that was delicious. I have mixed review on this restaurant. If your looking for good steaks this is the place for you. The rodizio is ok the meats are little salty. Service was just ok could have been a lot better for the 500.00 bucks we spent on our meal. For me Fornos is a lot classier has better service and you get a lot more food portions for your money and their garlic shrimp and rice is to die for. So if your looking for an elegant restaurant this is not the place for you. But if your looking for steaks this is the place. So with that being said will go again only for the tile steak.
