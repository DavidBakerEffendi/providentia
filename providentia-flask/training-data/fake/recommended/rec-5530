Okay - I don't know how I had not heard of this place before.  This is a great Italian, little white table cloth BYOB type of spot.  I'm all about the ambiance, which was great here.  The food was brought out promptly and the service was excellent.  We started with the mussels, which were amazing in a white wine garlic and tomato sauce.  They serve a great bread as well good for dipping.  I had the rissoto with portini and goat cheese, which was brought out in a perfect portion size.  This is a classic Italian spot with tables close together, fairly noisy but still great for a date or small to larger parties.
