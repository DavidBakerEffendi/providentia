I had high expectations for this place.  I love noodle soups but I don't think I even finished half of mine.  I got their signature ramen that everyone gets, but I guess my tastebuds aren't catered to this type of soup.  The broth is definitely flavorful but was a little too fatty and greasy for me.  I like mine more clear and I just felt really heavy after several sips.  The noodles were too thin and could have been cooked a little longer.  They didn't taste homemade to me.  For the price, I would have wanted a bigger bowl, filled with more meat and vegetables.   A noodle soup should leave you feeling pleasantly full without the guilt you get after a big meal.  I felt like I got the nutritional value of a fatty steak without the filling substance and satisfaction.  SIGH.
