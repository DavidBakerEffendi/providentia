Busy Saturday, waitress is either new or in the wrong field. Dear manager, yes that was grapefruit juice in my margarita I sent back, and no I don't want another... You were Doing great until you dropped ' well I offered' . Yeah that's on the list of things not to say to a customer. Next time maybe the manager can help set the tables on a busy Saturday... Three tables including ours asked for silverware... One got up and got their own. When your staff is in the weeds, give them a hand before the order comes out Luke warm or before the customer has to ask for silverware. Â I guess that's enough for now.
