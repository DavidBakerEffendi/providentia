wow.. where have the times gone! i've been to this place 3x the past year and i live in MD! haha and yet i still haven't written a review! where have my manners gone... must be all the pork buns that i've been eating making me completely forget to yelp! *wipe hands* ok, now where to start... 1st time I came here, I was like why on earth do I need to go to a place for ramen noodles when I can simply make the packaged ones right in my pantry? right? haha.. oh silly me.. turns out that the ones in the package are bad processed food but ones in the restaurant are made fresh and oh so different.. well not sure if they make it right then and there but it definitely doesn't taste like your cup of noodles - that's for sure =D from the encouragement of my friends, we each got an order of pork buns.. O. M. GEEEEE - wow that stuff is sooo good! i mean better than duck buns.. the pork just literally melts in your mouth!  funny, my mouth always water whenever i think back on food when yelping - haha.. anywho, it's good, it's very good.   now onto the ramen noodles, i've tried the spicy ramen, miso ramen and the ramen won ton noodles - all good - VERY good.. my gawd, i want to go back again and that'll be in two weeks! haha.. i'm a bit obsessed now, can't you tell. if you haven't been, you should go but then again, don't let me hype it too much otherwise ur expectations would be too high.. so umm, yeah this place sux! don't go! but yeah go still =P If you don't go for the food, at least go for the enthusiastic greeting each time they take you to your seat.. they really love the ramen =D last two times I went were early mornings like around 11am and there wouldn't be much of a line.  Any later, you could be waiting for a good hr or so.  i'd wait of course but that's just me. I want my pork buns! =P
