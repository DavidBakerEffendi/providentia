I am bitter I can't afford to eat here. I am also fully in agreement with those reviewers who wanted to give a low review so the place won't get overcrowded - but I want them to succeed, so I will be honest. Jacques is my hero.  In fact, I want him to marry someone I know so I can eat his food for free. The tasting menu is amazing - I have tricked my father into paying for it on several occasions - and the wine pairings are fairly interesting, although if I am honest I will admit I know less than nothing about wine.  My father claims too, though, and he was impressed, especially by the chocolate-y dessert wine. And now what you're really waiting for -- the food porn. 1) a scallop ceviche with loads of cilantro - served daintily on a scallop shell, if you care about that sort of thing. 2) a tiny sliver of trout, grilled to perfection, on top of a salad of pickled onions and purple potatoes. 3) foie gras on brioche toast, served with a sweet, tangy pineapple sauce. 4) lamb tongue tacos, with perfect guacamole and crisp, lemony radishes lamb tacos. 5) a skewer of spicy lamb heart, liver, and kidneys served in a creamy white sauce. 6) more lamb: a lamb chop, rare but with perfectly crisp fat, served with a sort of mint pesto.  buttery braised lamb that felt apart on my fork.  greens with an olive-lemony dressing.  root vegetable puree - rutabaga and pumpkin, I think he said? 7) a salad course: fennel and endives with blood oranges and tiny slivers of lemon 8-9) dessert: a lard (yes, lard) cookie with homemade vanilla ice cream for me, and a pumpkin pie with homemade pumpkin icecream and pumpkin-seed brittle for my father.
