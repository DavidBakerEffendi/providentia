All too often I walk out of places thinking "that meal was okay, but definitely not worth the price." On some occasions I say "that was pretty good, I didn't mind paying that." Very very rarely can one say that the quality of a meal far exceeds the price you pay for it. This was my experience at go go curry. Some friends and I were looking for a quick meal by my job before a movie. From the moment I walked in until the last lick of curry on my plate everything was absolutely perfect. My friend and I were feeling ambitious and decided to share the grand slam. Every morsel of and every grain of rice was so delicious and we feasted for the low price of about 6.75 each including tax. Walking out of the restaurant I was in some kind of daze, and when the little automated speaker over the door yelled out "konnichiwa!" as we stepped out, I was in absolute euphoria. I'll definitely be visiting again.
