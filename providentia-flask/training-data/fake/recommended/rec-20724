2.5 would be the right rating - somewhere between "meh" and "A-OK". The service was great all through the evening, and appetizers and dessert were good, so well 3 seems OK. Basically, things go downhill after the first bite of their excellent cheese bread. The problem is really in the quality of the entrees and the price you pay for them. The norm seems to be enormous quantities, and very rich food - the pastas and risotto will fill you up after a few spoonfuls. Even 2 moderately hungry people may just about be able to put away the heaping plate of risotto. And you will eat risotto for lunch next day, and try to feed it to your dog the day after. Rack of lamb is a better choice, 3 chops, nicely done & served with asparagus spears. For dessert, try the pistachio gelato, (you have to plan for this by not clearing your entree plate, which if you do, will surely render you disabled in the dessert department) it is just wonderful, smooth creamy with small chunks of pistachio in it. The most entertaining sight of the evening - the decor is fake mediteranean outdoor patio - was a gaggle of 6 year olds standing on chairs by the pizza oven and getting their custom pies made.
