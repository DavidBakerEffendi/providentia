My first time back after many years and was quite pleased. At first I feared being rushed through dinner by the break-neck speed after checking in our reservation. We were seated, served water, and and informed of a lengthy list of specials in two minutes or less. I checked the dining room and it was about 3/5 crowded at 7:30 on a Saturday. No need to rush tables. I politely told our server our preference and service was perfectly timed for the rest of the night. I appreciate when Â a professional server 'gets' the mood of the table and can accommodate. My Dad and I were there to sort out some family matters and wanted time. I had the 35oz prime rib which was cooked to order and was very tender. It comes with wasabi mashed but I wished I asked for a baked potato. My Dad had the 24oz Porterhouse which was cooked perfectly Wines by the glass ranged from $8-13 but were good pours. Somewhat cheaper than Ruth Chris at Forrestal the atmosphere and is less stuffy. Sometimes I love the classic steakhouse service but sometimes dinner is better when the breadcrumbs aren't immediately wiped from the linen tablecloth.
