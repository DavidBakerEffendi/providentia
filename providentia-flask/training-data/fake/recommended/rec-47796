*Note* Review is for the Bar only Kelly's is an interesting place for sure. Much like "The Cave Of Wonders" in Aladdin, it seems like only diamonds in the rough enter the place. This is not say that you won't have a great time when you go. I've been there on several occasions, and the bartenders that stand out to me are Gary, Ryan, Katie, and Mike. Gary is hilarious, Ryan actually listens to me when I ramble about random nothingness, and Mike brings the off-the-boat Irish humor. Katie is just a joy to be around and lights up the room. I go to bars solely for the staff, and this bar is star-studded for sure! With regards to pricing, it's typical of a downtown New Haven Bar location. I've never tried the food. But I enjoy giving my hard earned money to people that deserve it, and the hardworking, Â "Fantastic Four" at Kelly's certainly deserve every tip they receive.
