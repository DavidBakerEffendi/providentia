I came to Russet for dinner with a few friends.  The ambience of the restaurant is very cozy with dim lighting and cute decorations.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the food.  I ordered the duck as it was highly recommended by the waiter.  The duck was incredibly salty and I needed to drink a couple of glasses of water to offset the saltiness.  The dishes at Russet are quite expensive - you can get better food for the price at other restaurants.
