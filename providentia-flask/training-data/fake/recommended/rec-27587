I took my father here, who is highly suspicious of new Japanese restaurants. His face lit up when finding out that they make their noodles on site. He found the eggplants to be delicious, and the gyoza to be crispy Â and interesting (comes out looking like a UFO) . I really like this place. I love their udon, and their pork is amazing. I definitely go there too often.
