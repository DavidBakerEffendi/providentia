WHAT THE ...? The fresh roll with the big chunks of crabmeat, braised tofu and sausage in a tamarind sauce ... the mango over sticky rice in coconut milk with salted basil seeds (BASIL SEEDS?!?!) ACTUAL Thai-hot seasoning, as promised? (FYI, whenever my friends who love spicy food/have been to Thailand ask for "Thai Hot," they're often disappointed. We weren't disappointed here) The Wok Basil Chicken is the Milder of the Thai hot dishes. I initially didn't want rice and politely let the server know. She looked at me with concern and asked if I was sure. I paused and said I would let her know. Five bites into the dish, I asked for the rice. There's no pride in real Thai hot food. Which is what this is. And the rice makes the dish better (doesn't rice always?), letting you taste the layer after layer of spices in the wok dish (according to my friends, who were sweating as much as I was, the wok calamari dish is also glorious). HOWEVER. Do avail yourself of the section labeled Pure Thai Noodles. There, you will find the Nakorn-Patom Duck Noodle soup with the thin rice noodles. The broth is just perfect, and the duck is perfectly cooked (in my humble opinion, if one cannot cook a duck just so, one does not have a Thai restaurant. It's my litmus test for an acceptable Thai restaurant. If you don't eat duck, any other of their noodle dishes under that category is a fun way to see how good they are with noodles. The noodle to other-stuff-in-the-soup ratio is always even, and the broth is so yummy, I have a difficult time not picking up the bowl and drinking it)
