I ate here recently for a friend's birthday. The location and the decor did nothing to add any sense of authenticity to the restaurant. Although the natural light was pleasant and bringing the kitchen out of the back room and into the main dining area made for a more relaxed environment, there was still a sense of unnecessary pretentiousness. Everything from the walls to the floors to the furniture reminded me of an upscale but bland Italian restaurant in the middle of suburbia where authenticity and creativity are outlawed. The wine list was very extensive but I can't remember seeing any bottles for less than $45-$50 and the prices increased very quickly once past the entry level choices. The service however, was excellent. For better or worse (I maintain better) my wine glass never got anywhere close to empty! I wasn't extremely hungry and so split an appetizer (goat cheese gnocchi) and had the lamb. Although both were excellent (as were the octopus and pork that I tried) they lacked that "wow" factor that I would expect for a restaurant of this level. I guess you could say they do basic dishes extraordinarily well but I've would like them to take a few more risks in their use of ingredients and presentation.
