Ambiance: 4. Nice place for a weekend dinner, not too cramped.  Open kitchen and low-rise bar both were positives also. Cost: 3. A few things on menu ridiculous overpriced but all in all most of main dishes were not highway robbery.  Standard alcohol prices for this kind of a place. Food Quality: 4. Best steamed pork buns I can recall having.  Main dishes are hit or miss, highlights include duck special and the catfish.  Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes moderately overrated.  Rotisserie duck ssam is undoubtedly where it's at, from the grunts of pleasure at the table next to ours. Service: 4. Great service since it seemed like they worked in teams.  Never waiting long for anything. When to return: Date spot.  Trendy dinner with friends.  Special occasion for the Rotisserie Duck Ssam family style meal.
