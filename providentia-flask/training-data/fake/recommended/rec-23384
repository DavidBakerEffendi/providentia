I say neither, but given the choice, Pat beats Geno's everyday. there are a number of reasons. 1. Pats has the dope fiends i watched a woman nod out, each time so close to a sip of soda, only to have her head snap back, and nod out again, for my entire visit 2. ?uestlove i was at Pat's and thought "that looks like the guy from the roots" only to realize, "that IS the guy from the roots" 3. Booooo Geno's neon lights? this isn't Reno. angry Italians? no thanks. you came over on a boat too. lose the attitude 4. My middle name is Pat and I don't know any Geno's
