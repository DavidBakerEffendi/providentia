Okay I never write reviews but this starts the new year with a huge exception!!! We are huge foodies and if it is new and different we are there. From Upland to White street etc. Have been to Little Owl quite a few times. The food is fabulous and consistent. Now comes the real reason for the review. I was thinking about the meal and entire experience last night. 02/02/2015. Light bulb went off approx. 75 watt and no not  one of those ugly squiggly energy savers. I realized from last nights meal that there are so many great places to have a great meal in the city. So after you dine and leave you remember a few things about the meal. Apps ? desert? service ? long wait perhaps? or maybe the horrible table next to you that killed the whole vibe. But you are still wondering what is this guy trying to say about Little Owl? Okay here it is. The total experience here is incredible!!! The staff mesh with each other like similar to the finest quartet at The Bushwick Starr. So well orchestrated that you become engrossed by the movement of food coming and going though the ultra small kitchen into the uber small restaurant.. There is a uncanny sense of caring about your meal and satisfaction with your overall experience as a short term guest in there establishment. I realized last night that it is so true size really doesn't matter if the execution is strong and memorable! The food is thoughtful and well presented. Light and flavorful but memorable The vibe is positive and pleasant but not overly west village granola . The service is pleasant and positive but not rushed or artificial. Sincere being the operative thought! So to sum it up there are many choices and lifetime of experiences some memorable to our palate's some to our hearts some to the left side of our brain and some to the right side . This place hit a trifecta  for me. Worth the wait if there is one and well worth the drive if you don't live in the city,
