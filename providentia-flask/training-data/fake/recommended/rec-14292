Oh Mario, how I love all your restaurants! We came here for lunch recently and had a wonderful experience. At first I had my reservations of what would an Italian chef know about Spanish cuisine but boy did they prove me wrong and I'm so excited! Amongst the 3 of us, we polished off 9 dishes. We were pretty full after our meal but so happy!!!! The top highlights were the razor clams a la plancha which had a garlic sauce that we soaked up with bread cause it was SO GOOD and also the pulpo with fennel and grapefruit, the octopus was so tender, smokey, and so yummy! We had the jamon iberico which was just like I remembered it in Spain. They gave you a hefty portion but for $25, they better! :) We also had the cod cheeks, mackerel, skirt steak, and croquetas. If I had to pick one, my least favorite as the patatas bravas. They just seemed very wet in the sauce and not too much flavor coming out of it. Tasted like there was curry in it perhaps. The space is pretty small. I like how the tables have a shelf underneath so when our small table started filling up fast with food, I was able to put my water glass in that shelf to make space for more food to come. :) I want to go to more of your restaurants now!
