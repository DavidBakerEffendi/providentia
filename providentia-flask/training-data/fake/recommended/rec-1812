this place is alright. came here on a wednesday night with some friends from college. the location may not seem like much from outside, but once you get downstairs you'll be pleasantly suprised. there was a bit of a wait before getting a table. i liked how the person working at the front was stringing us along. "oh yeah, there are only 2 people ahead of you", we waited for 20min before we asked again, and he pulls the same $hit again. after a while, i caught onto his trickery. putting that aside, this place is pretty straight. the food is good, the drinks are good, and the atmosphere is pretty nice. that's all i really ask for. fyi the fried pizza sounds better than it really is, but i was happy with everything else i ordered. there are some tv's on the walls to watch some sports games that might be playing.
