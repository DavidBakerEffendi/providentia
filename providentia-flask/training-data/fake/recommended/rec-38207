One of my favs! Bartenders are attentive and friendly even during busy times. Andrea is awesome - very positive and personal with everyone at the bar. She made excellent recommendations for both food and drink. The lobster guac is outstanding and I wouldn't miss the mahi tacos if I were you! Wash it down with a cucumber strawberry margarita. BOOM.
