Mixed menu of Asian and New American, I had the chicken satay with peanut sauce that qualifies but it's a little small. Other dishes a little more generous. Big regrets I didn't order the Rad Na Thai Chicken (see someone else's Yelp picture). I think the place is trying to be a throwback to the early 1960's Martini lounges, but with a polished contemporary treatment. Some review said it was dingy. Not so. However, my overall enthusiasm is still muted. We went for lunch, so perhaps dinner with livelier patronage, brings out the best in this place. The background music certainly brings good vibes. #life-as-I-know-it
