family owned, very cute place. The calamari balsamico was fantastic, as was the eggplant rolletini. The pork chop was also great. They don't rush you through your courses, which I was very pleased with, since we hadn't seen our friends we were dining with in a while, so it was nice. They also include salad with the entrees, I always think that's a nice touch.
