starts: exc salad, olives, bread, oil, garlic bread, then they bring the menu: i had seafood paella , other person had sausage dish and shrimp in garlic sauce; too much for two people; but had desert anyway, perfect flan got 4 star instead of 5 because i am used to free refills in south, and other person had colas 4 x = $13 ( 3,25 for each small refill - sorry that is unnecessary when they are so generous with portions and lead-ins
