Bottom line? The food was pretty good. Not much in the decor or ambience department. It has a kInd of confusing layout-- there was a medium sized crowd of take-out customers (some phoned in and some didn't) gathered around the sales counter with no discernable strategy of who gets waited on first. Traffic flowed both ways along the "line". I ordered a medium curry shrimp, a meat pattie and a chicken pattie. I didn't think the curry was too spicy- but it's kind of sneaky, it takes a long time to tickle your throat and lips. Great portion of shrimp in a thickish sauce, with some carrots and potatoes tossed in. The rice and peas were very good, as was the cabbage salad. Neighborhood was definitely sketchy, but thanks to Yelp, I now venture into places I didn't normally patronize. One last thing, some of the previous reviews described rude, shabby, or indifferent customer service here. I saw none of that. The sales people I interacted with were all smiley and sweet as can be.
