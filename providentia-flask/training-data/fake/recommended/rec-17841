very affordable lunch 7 dollars, you get rice , salad and a bowl of soup.. the soup comes first and its a big bowl... the lunch special seems to be chicken mostly , but its reasonable . the ceviche is delicious oh man ..i had the ceviche mixto which has fish, shrimp, calamari and shell fish...really delicious... I think the prices for NON-lunch are a bit on the high side....\I have been here 3 time have not regret it
