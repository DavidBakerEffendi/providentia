I had a mini high school reunion dinner at Ofrenda. We loved the ambiance - the interior was cute, we sat right by the open window and it was a lovely day to be dining semi-outdoor. We arrived there early enough to enjoy the Happy Hour - the cucumber margarita was excellent, and every dish we ordered was tasty. It would have made a perfect night if the server didn't drop a plateful of guacamole in and outside my gym bag while we were waiting for our table at the bar. The Maitre d' wasn't very attentive to what happened, she kept saying "that's okay" until I pointed out my smeared bag, at which point she realized there was some damage. She reluctantly got some paper napkins for me to wipe it off, and never apologized or mentioned it after. For that poor service, I'm subtracting one star.
