First of all this neighborhood is fabulous in an earthy sort of way. The restaurant has a beautiful decor that is welcoming and casual. Our server was way nice and cute in a Michael Cera kinda way. Not as punctual on my second drink as I'd liked but nice. And speaking of drinks, I gave up drinking cosmos a long time ago but on this occasion I decided to reminisce the old days and try one of there fun specialty cocktails, the Fork Cosmopolitan. It wasn't too sweet and it went down smoothly and quickly....maybe I shouldn't have been to impatient with my second drink? I had the burrito, it was yummy and plentiful. After satisfying our bellies we were ready to get out of there only because we sat next to chatty Cathy who did not let her lunch buddy peep a word the entire hour we were there. Great place to brunch!
