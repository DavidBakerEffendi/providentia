While I might go to its edgier & more "nightlife"-like sister restaurant Qi with my friends, I would take my parents here to wow them with the classic, elegant decor and delicious food. Their lunch specials are a STEAL for $6.90 entree + appetizer, and I highly recommend the thai iced tea ice cream and green tea ice cream. I thought it was odd at first that they served it with gingerbread, but everything meshed surprisingly well. Delicious, decently priced food, great service, and lovely ambiance! I'll be back!
