I am writing to report that this restaurant refused to allow my frail friend, who walks with a cane, to sit at a table while she waited for her friends to arrive. We were 25 minutes late, and found our friend on the sidewalk, furious that she had Â been forced to stand, even when there were plenty of empty tables. She had given this restaurant alot of business in the past, but will never return. That is no way to treat people clearly in shaky health who arrive ahead of the rest of their party. Outrageous.
