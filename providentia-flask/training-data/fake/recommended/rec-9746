I haven't been to many good Thai places around the city, so this was a welcome sight when a friend suggested we eat here for dinner. The place is dimly lit, providing a more intimate setting for those seated across from the bar, and a lounge setting for those seated beyond it. When we stopped by (early Saturday evening), our party of three was seated in fifteen minutes in a booth. Unfortunately I wasn't too hungry (had sushi buffet earlier in the afternoon) so I only ordered their Curry Puffs. My other friends ended up ordering entrees (Pad Thai and Thai Fried Rice). Our food was served literally within five minutes. Probably the fastest time that I've been served food, although admittedly, those items are probably good to serve anytime during the dinner rush time frame. Food was good, and they weren't over-seasoned or overly sweet (which is a very disturbing trend I've had with most Thai places). Also reasonable prices for food in Hell's Kitchen. I was a fan of the atmosphere and definitely wouldn't mind stopping by again if I was in the area and had a craving for Thai food.
