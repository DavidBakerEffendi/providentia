We went here because we read they had great nachos, but we didn't end up ordering them. They were out of Chile Rellenos, but the pollo flautas were a very acceptable substitute. I loved that it came with a salad and not the standard rice and beans. The servings were quite large and the value for the price was excellent. The tortillas and chips were obviously homemade and terrific. We will definitely return.
