The wait in the musty lobby downgraded the rating from five to four stars. We waited an hour an a half for a group of six even after asking halfway for separate seating. Granted it was a weekend and the place was crowded, still had to make a couple trips to the nearby bubble tea caf√© to stay away from the stench and heat right in front of the restaurant's entrance. They give you a number for your name on the waiting list and call it; if you're not there with your party they move on to the next number. Service was much more efficient once seated, with waiters promptly bringing us waters/menus. The Pork Soup Dumplings were cheap and delicious, and the Shanghai Flat Noodles were kind of greasy but nevertheless good. Always crowded inside, but good if you're looking for a reasonably priced place that'll fill you up--also good for family style dishes, aka sharing the dumplings/other dishes served with the rest of the table!
