Nothing special to see here, just another over priced Brooklyn place trying too hard to be like one of its Manhattan counterparts. The appetizers were all good but the entrees really left something to be desired. I ordered a $23 chicken dish, that was described as coming with "mashed potatoes" and "mushrooms". My plate had one mushroom on it, and a thin layer of what can only be described as liquid potato. The chicken was cooked well (juicy) BUT the flavor wasn't anything special. (I've made better myself).
