Great people and delicious food.  My friends and I were waiting for another friend to get out of work Friday and decided to grab a bite to eat.   We sat down, ordered and received our food almost immediately.  The waitress was super friendly and attentive to our needs.  We will be sure to return whenever we are in the area! Keep serving great food, and service. :D
