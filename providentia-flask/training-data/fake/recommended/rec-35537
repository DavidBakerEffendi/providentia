Very cool, social place.  Bier gardens are getting big in Philly because of this place.  Food is great.  Outdoor seating and picnic benches make it really easy to talk with people...especially when there are games out there like jenga and stuff like that.  They even have a ping pong table.  Although it can be distracting and I'd imagine difficult to play surrounded by people not watching, it's different.  Great beer selection.  The place has gotten more and more popular and it makes it harder to get in.  When you're in it's so packed it takes away some of the fun compared to when it first opened, but it's still a great place.  Many tables for sitting in groups inside too.
