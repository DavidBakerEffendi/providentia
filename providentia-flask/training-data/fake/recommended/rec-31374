Sooooo good. Lines at the door so plan to wait at least 30 mins. Write your name on the list when you arrive and DO NOT LEAVE. If you leave and they call your name when you are not present you will o back to the bottom of the list. The restaurant is very small and be prepared to share a table with strangers. The bathroom is the smallest bathroom I've ever stepped foot in. The sink looks like a child's toy. Now onto the food cause none of the stuff I just said matters because this is the best ramen ever. Really complex flavors - especially when you design your own by adding toppings. I had spicy ramen with chicken. I added char Sui and mushrooms. It Â was so great that I was mad when I was full. I also tried the char Sui bun appetizer. It was perfectly cooked. I can't wait to go back.
