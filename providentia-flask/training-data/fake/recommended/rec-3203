Build it and they will come. It just takes a handful of people to tag a place as "the best place for _____________" and a cult following grows. Don't get me wrong, I eat here, and enjoy it. This place is alright, its good, but loses half a point for hype. I've known about this place for about 5 years. The perks, they are open almost ALWAYS, at almost ALL HOURS. The long lines keeps the food fresh. Fantastic location. Convenient. The downside, the long lines. The conveyor belt like service - I mean I don't want Henry Ford serving my food. The food is good. Not amazing. Better halal is available at a few locations, with the 'King of Falafel and Shawarma' in Astoria being among them. Also the hot sauce is dangerous. I usually ask places to make my food extra spicy. But the sauce they have makes taste buds quiver. And in a strange way, sick, depraved, and masochistic way - I ENJOY IT. Good food. Â Just not AMAZING.
