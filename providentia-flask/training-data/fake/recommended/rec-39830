I have to start off by saying that these were some of the best empanadas I've had in a while......from the reggaeton to the belgian chocolate ones they were alllllll amazing! I do admit that its a pretty small place and it gets extremely crowded which subsequently affects service but in my opinion its well worth the wait, in addition to the empanadas, the guacamole with the plantain chips was scrumptious and the sangria was perfect...the last time we were there we ordered like 6 empanadas, the guacamole and a few beers for just under $30, doesn't get much better than that!
