I had my birthday dinner here, a group of 8 of us. The restaurant was accommodating even though they had a packed house of reservations full of large parties that evening. I have a tomato allergy, so it's incredibly difficult for me to enjoy an Italian restaurant, as I want everything on the menu, but there are only about 5 things on a normal menu I can now eat. I was able to get a full three course meal without even a thought of having to worry about my allergy. I got the Insalata Melograno, and of course just asked them to hold the tomatoes, followed that up with my entree which was the Filetto al Pepe Verde, and something chocolate for dessert. I was so impressed with my meal, the service, the accommodations, everything. My favorite part though, BYOB. Who doesn't love an incredible meal with your own alcohol?
