Maybe it's just me, but I keep expecting Patrick Swayze to kick me in the face whenever I'm at Franny O's... And I mean that in the most positive way. This is a road-house dive of a joint and I love coming here. Just grab a beer and watch the show. The crowd on weekends is friendly and likes to dance (stumbling around the dance floor still counts as dancing, right?). Mixed ages - 20s and up. Hard to tell the top end of the age range, 'cause it's so dark in this place. Beers weren't too pricey and the bartenders are very friendly and really fast. Ample parking too.
