Porcini is an intimate, European style Italian BYO located on a quaint block of Sansom Street conveniently in the heart of Center City, and even more convenient, less than a block from the Roxy Theater.  Aside from it's convenience, the cozy dining room, authentic meals, and warm wait staff made my night a true dining experience one that I would like to repeat many times. All natural, home grown, delicious.  Everything.  From staple ingredients such as basil and oregano, to the fresh made pasta, Porcini is not your typical BYO.  In addition to their menu, Steven and David Sansone, brothers and owners of this not-so hidden gem offer nightly specials that seem to blend perfectly with the rest of the meals.   I would highly recommend sharing because there are too many delicious appetizers and entrees to choose from.  The variety of sauces in each entree really wooed me.  Where as with many other 'Italian restaurants', everything is doused in marinara, at Porcini, each sauce is carefully tailored to fit the dish it was made for.  The calamari appetizer, sauteed in a zesty caper sauce, was one of my personal favorites, along with the Cannelloni with ricotta and spinach in a rose sauce.   The quality of food and atmosphere is just unbeatable for an intimate evening with close friends or loved ones! + BYOB + Accepts Credit Cards - Trying to make a reservation
