Hole in the wall. Yes, don't expect fancy table mats, silverware, nice furniture. Today, I finally decided to visit Tasty. I was warned to not have such high expectations on its ambience and service because apparently there were none. When I arrived, my suspicion was confirmed as this restaurant was kinda hole-in-the-wall. Nevertheless I ordered the beef noodles as my friend strongly recommended this dish. The noodles had a really nice texture to it, because it's handpulled and not machine made I guess. The sup broth had me wishing for more considering the amount of beef and cow parts they put in the bowl. It was good enough, just not great. The portion of this bowl of noodles is pretty sizeable, even for a hungry, energetic young male adult like myself. Well, I couldnt finish the bowl of noodles because I also ordered 5 pieces of dumplings. I actually really like the fried dumplings because the texture of the skin was a little crispy and the inside was juicy and flavorful. Dip it in the special soy sauce and you would be surprised how an unassumingly presented plate of dumplings can taste so damn good. And yes, for all I had, I only paid $10 , including tips. Damn!
