I did the pre fix wine pairing lunch. First the service and decor and ambiance is terrific.The food was overrated and was expensive to say the least. The chef still uses a lot of foam in their presentations which I was never a fan of. If I go back again I will order off the menu as opposed to the tasting menu . I just spent a weekend at the Inn In Little Washington and the food was spectacular and dwarfed my experience at Bouley.
