Slate is not a restaurant.  It is an experience; an experience rich with bumping Timberlake songs, sophisticated paintings, and truly excellent European fare. The owner, Lorenzio, is an immigrant from Romania.  The food carries with it the taste of something exotic.  Not everything is great, but the best dish on the menu is by far, the game hen. This place is madly underrated.  Rouge will be packed and this place, a mere three blocks away will be empty.  Take your lover here for a memorable night in a quiet, and welcoming atmosphere.
