Doma is a great place to eat a very good Japanese/Korean meal.  I would give the food 4.5 stars because the sushi was perfect and the kalbi was yummy too.  I'm subtracting half a star for food because I felt that their prices were a bit high, but I guess that's Philly Japanese food.. it's expensive! As for the service.. 5 stars!  The host was laid back and sat us at a table really quickly.  Our server was helpful and friendly and he kept our table really clean (the BFF was a bit messy.. hahaha). So.. the only real reason I'm giving Doma 4 stars (instead of 5) is.. the seating.  I know this sounds weird, but I'm not a fan of high stools.  I know it gives the restaurant a chic vibe, but (1) it was uncomfortable and (2) I was constantly worried about my back(fat) showing.  They did have some regular seating, but it was taken when we walked in.   If you're from the west coast and desperately missing good sushi and Japanese food go to Doma!
