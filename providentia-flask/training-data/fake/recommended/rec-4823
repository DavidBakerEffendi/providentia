It's might be a bit unfair to write a review of a bar I only visited for less than two hours. But I'm pretty sure that I already understand the Frankford Hall experience. And it was awesome! I'm crushing hard on this place already, after one time. We came on a busy and warm late spring afternoon, which is the perfect time to go. Lots of other people thought so too, as the place was pretty packed.. Lots of picnic bench tables, a few smaller tables, and even a ping pong table. In case you haven't gotten it by now, Frankford is really just a fun place to drink with friends, have an awesome outdoor summer time (since 95% of the place is outside). It's a perfect spot for a group of friends, not so much for a dinner date. And definitely not for kids, but for some reason there were lots of them around our table? Please don't bring your kids, I hate having to step on them on the way to get my liter of beer. I can't remember how long the beer list is, but there was plenty there for me to choose from. If you don't know me, then you should know that I mostly drink Bud Light. For the flavor. The prices were pretty reasonable as well, but the more buzzed I got, the more annoyed I was that our beers were never poured to the top. Why is that? Frankford also has a cool sounding German bar food menu, and the food that people ordered around us smelled fantastic. I really hope to go back soon and try some food and have some more great memories!
