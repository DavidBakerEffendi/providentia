Went here on a business lunch.   It is in a strip mall with other options for food.   Service was fast and prices reasonable.  I ordered a salmon sushi and roll dish, my other co-worker ordered a vegetarian dish and our guest ordered sweet and sour chicken.    The sushi was ok, the vegetarian dish was ok and the sweet and sour chicken looked really good.   I would come here again and probably focus on the Chinese good on the menu.
