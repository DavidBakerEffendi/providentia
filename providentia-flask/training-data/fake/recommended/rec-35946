I'm a fan after my first lunch special, Sunmizen. Everything is good! Â Lucky enough we didn't wait to long. This little gem is a must go for a lunch break after you have your shopping in Bloomingdale's. Beware of their hours though. They close in between lunch and dinner hour. To convince you more, I've been to Japan and their food is very authentic!
