We found Miriam when searching for Happy Hours in Brooklyn. This was a top rated spot that includes food in their Happy Hour. First off, Happy Hour is only at the bar, so try to get there early because it's a small bar that seats about 10-12. 2 for 1 wine and beer. I had the Tempranillo, nice selection. Best part are the 2 for 1 mezzes. At $4 each, this brings the price down to $2 per selection. Mezzes are basically Middle Eastern tapas. So we had 8 different plates. The meatballs in pomegranate sauce were our favorite. Falafel was also very good, labaneh and merguez were also good. I ordered the calamari with tomatoes and chickpeas, ended up sending it back for something else. Not much flavor, and the bartender was very understanding. Great deal, friendly bartenders, nice atmosphere.
