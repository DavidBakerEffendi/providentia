Service was a bit dull... and i was pissed that my table had a wobbly leg. Dumplings needed to be placed on a paper towel to remove excess oil, from the frying process. A slight sprinkle of salt would have also helped... I totally forgot what was my entree (and that's not a good thing). I should have just grabbed a hoagie from wawa, and saved a couple of dollars.
