Came here for brunch with my cousins visiting from SF. The place wasn't very busy for a Sunday morning (Mother's Day nontheless) but I loved the homey feel in the downstairs area. Service was prompt and efficient, and very friendly as well. I ordered the greek eggs benedict, which sounded pretty interesting. The eggs were cooked very well--runny and not overcooked yolk. They serve it in an interesting way with the eggs sitting on top of a bed of spinach that had been baked with cheese and some cream--very tasty--and then instead of an english muffin, they have a couple points of pita chips sitting around the dish. The eggs and spinach were great, but the pita points were very oily and greasy and dark, as if they had been using old oil. The greek home fries were also pretty oily and salty with a nice herby flavor that helped to balance out the greasiness. My cousin seemed to enjoy his fried vegetable omelette. From what I could see it was pretty densely packed with veggies and more green than yellow. It was nice to see that they didn't skimp on veggies! I'd definitely come back, but would also probably prefer to eat here for lunch or dinner. Brunch wasn't super exciting. Pricing was reasonable, all the brunch entrees were around $10 which is getting harder and harder to find in the city!
