I gave it a second shot yesterday and hated it.  The broccoli in my soup tasted like it had been dehydrated then brought back to life.  The shrimp in my dumpling was fishy. The broth had a great color but had a weird oniony-gingery-sweet flavor.  This dim sum is definitely frozen. The filling of my shrimp shumai was SPONGEY and bland. The bubble tea is great. I'll go back for that only.  The place is clean and the staff is as friendly as the language barrier will permit.   This review is coming from my high standard in noodle soups. Perhaps if I hadn't had great ramen/curries/noodle soups in the past, I'd like it better.
