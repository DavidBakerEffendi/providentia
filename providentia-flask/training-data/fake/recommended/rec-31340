Why why why did Ember Room have to close??? Regardless of what they told me about Obao being under the same ownership, the quality of the food just wasn't there. There was nothing exciting on the menu. All my old favorites were replaced by dishes that were nowhere near what I used to eat at Ember Room. The waitstaff was nice and all, but the place lost its "cool." There wasn't even any music on and it seemed so sad.  There was also a very strange odor on the first floor of what seemed to be bleach and a dirty mop. In addition,  it doesn't make sense to me why open another Thai restaurant on a block that is already full of Thai places.
