Great atmosphere and authentic Cuban food. The tapas are affordable and can be made into a meal. Seating can be a little tight when its busy. But no wait on the food! Byob, if you bring your own wine you can mix it into your sangria. Staff is extremely attentive and the owner wanders around. Love the energy and the vibe.
