DATE NIGHT. DATE NIGHT. DATE NIGHT. Should I say it again? This is a very cute, cozy, romantic dinner spot. Nice wine selection. The food was amazing (the meatball sliders really are to die for). The pork chop lived up to the hype. The summer corn soup was the best I've ever had. Everything about this place is so unique. It's definitely as far as you can get from corporate, chain, or cookie cutter. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG BY DINING HERE! I highly recommend this place for a romantic, intimate, and amazing dining experience. The staff were wonderful too.
