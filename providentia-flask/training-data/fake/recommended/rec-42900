The brunch here was amazing. The eggs benedict were some of the best I've had in the city, and the grapefruit brulee was delicious. The ambiance is cozy and eclectic, the wait staff was friendly and the wait for a Sunday afternoon was not very long (about 30 minutes). Great coffee as well and the price was not that bad. I'll definitely be returning.
