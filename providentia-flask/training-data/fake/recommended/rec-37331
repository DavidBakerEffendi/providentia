First time here, and the staff was very friendly and quite helpful. We chose two panini; #20 - chicken, fresh mozz, arugula, peppers, and #27 - porchetta and broccoli rabe, which was our fave.  Shame we don't live in the neighborhood, the sandwiches were delicious!  If we find ourselves nearby again, it's a stop I would make in a heartbeat.
