I've been to Soba-ya twice and loved it both times.  Of course, both times I got the salmon and salmon roe over rice with soba noodles, which is delicious!  The first time I got cold soba, and the second time it was hot soba.  I liked the cold soba better, personally, but both were yummy.  I've only been during lunch, when the prices are a little more reasonable for a college student.  I also tried the ice cream once.  My favorite was the yuza flavor. The black sesame was good, too, but I wasn't a huge fan of the honey wasabi.  It was an interesting flavor, but very strong, so I could only manage a few small bites.
