Surprisingly nice evening... Â Started with some cool grooves from the DJ and then some live original music that was actually pretty good. Little too loud at times to socialize but with great drink prices and an attentive, albeit forgetful, staff the place was a great find in Trenton. Crowd was mixed but mostly younger although nothing that made you feel out of place.
