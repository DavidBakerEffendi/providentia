Good food, good service, good prices.  Not too much space (dining for ~20) and no sign outside.  Greens are incredible (collard and fried green tomatoes), the ribs are good, the chicken is better.  The blackened fish was passable.  The mac-n-cheese is worth getting shot for.  They have a bartender that is worth the visit.  You will know if you have her when you hear the laugh, you will not miss it unless you are deaf.  I loved this place.
