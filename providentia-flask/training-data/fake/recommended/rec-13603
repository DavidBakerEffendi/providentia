Pizza was pretty damn good but the service, restaurant and pretty much anything else you expect when paying for food was worse than lousy. The man who took orders gave the impression he barely spoke English except when it came to giving you the exact amount you owed and giving you some change pretty swiftly. Smiling apparently isn't a requisite of customer service anymore, and the entire restaurant just gives the ambiance of grease. Sure, it's a pizza joint but does EVERYTHING need to be covered with an oily film that makes you feel like you need to douse yourself in disinfectant upon leaving - and this is on a sunny day! That said, the pizza is very very good. The crust was perfectly cooked, the ingredients were delectable and the cheese they use as a base has a special twist and kick to it. All I'm saying is that if I'm going to pay for your pizza AND you're Â to ask a five-star rating, SOME level of service (even a smile) would be appreciated.
