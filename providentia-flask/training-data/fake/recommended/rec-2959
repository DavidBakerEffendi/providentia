Our plans fell through a few Saturdays ago, so I suggested this new place to my husband to try out.  We called and luckily they had a cancellation that night and we were able to get in.  Great food & great service. Small place but nice cozy atmosphere. Have friends visiting in two weeks from out of state and we ve already put in our reservations.  Great to BYOB!
