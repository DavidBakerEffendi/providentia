I guess I forgot to write a review. I was here about six months ago with Rotardted Ro Ro. The food is very good. That is to say that the raw meat that they give you to boil is good quality. When I go to a restaurant and spend a fair amount of Â money, I don't really want to boil it up myself. Should I help wash the dishes too? Cook my meat for me bitch! _____
