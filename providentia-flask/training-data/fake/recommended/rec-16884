This is a horrible representation of what Puerto Rican cuisine should be.  The black beans tasted like they came out of a can and were boiled with just a little bit of salt!  The breaded steak was soggy and not at all tasty. Guess they forgot the adobo!  The seem to be catering to the non Hispanic that now have taken over the neighborhood.  They do not know the difference between authentic Puerto Rican food and what they are being served. Never coming back!
