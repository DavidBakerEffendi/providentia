2nd time they mess up my order! I ordered a rice cup w/salmon, I got my cup of rice w/TWO, literally 2 small pieces of salmon!! Who orders that!?!? seriously!? & is that even in your menu!?!? You'd think that if there's a misunderstanding during the order process they'd ask for clarification, but no! Â My 2 pieces of salmon were delicious! Thanks for an awesome dinner Silver Rice!
