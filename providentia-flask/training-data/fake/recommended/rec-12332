I was told that if I'm visiting NY, I HAVE to try the Halal Guys.   I was glad I heeded the advice. I was also told that the thing to get is their chicken and rice... ...but how can you pass up good gyro??? So I got the mixed chicken and gyro over rice.   So yummy...   The rice is just chewy enough and flavorful.  The meat (both the chicken and the gyro) were moist, flavorful, and delicious. I can see why people swear by it.  So good~
