No frills soup place.  Most of it has been good. There are seats so it is a pick up only place.  Lunch will cost you between $4.50 - $10 with an average of $6 for me.  Sometimes I add the half sandwich, sometimes I don't.  I don't have a go-to soup, I just try whatever they have because their menu is pretty seasonal. Definitely stop by if you're in a soupy mood and in midtown. Not worth going out of your way. I don't think they're open after 5....
