What Happened??? We used to be huge, and I mean huge, fan of this place. This was our first visit since the expansion. Each and every dish was bland, to the point of being inedible. I ordered a vegetable curry (the peanut sauce-based one), I was asked if I wanted tofu with it, I said "a little". What I was served was a dish of tofu in sauce with what appeared to be boiled carrot and zucchini slices on the side. Abysmal.The Naam Salad had no flavor at all, could not taste lime nor peanut, which are supposed to be the defining flavors. Basil Fried Rice was tasteless, with overcooked vegetable. The tiny $4.95 bowl of Miso was 1/2 full of seaweed, with a tiny dollop of broth. We were clearly disappointed with one of the apps, the server asked if it was ok, we said not really (and had barely touched it). He took it away, but no further mention was made of it, we were charged for it. The servers were all very young males, there was no management presence in evidence. I really can't understand what has happened. This restaurant used to have people waiting outside to get a table. Tonight, on the weekend, at 7:00 pm there were only 4-5 tables. So disappointing!!
