The food here is really good, but the service can be sooooo slow (hence the 3 star review). It even took them forever to bring out two extra coffees. But the food makes up for the sub par service. The feta cheese and spinach omelet was delicious (I had only egg whites and held the olives), and the potatoes that came with the dish were absolutely amazing.
