I won't be going back. I visited on Labor Day. It was hot. Most restaurants bring you water but I had to ask three different people before I got a glass. No one came by to refill it until I was done. It seems like the staff decided to stay inside where it was cool rather than attend to their customers. My burger was ordered medium-rare and was served gray-brown throughout. It is certainly not worth the money.
