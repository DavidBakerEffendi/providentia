I was first introduced to Yasuda in 2008 and I try to go back to it as often as I can. I have also told many out of town friends visiting NYC to go to Yasuda. I think the fish quality is top notch and I like the quiet, subdued ambience. In my most recent trip (about 4 months ago), I made a reservation for 2 - a good quiet place to catch up with a friend. I was told I must finish my meal by 8 PM (giving us about 90 minutes). I find that a bit snobby but ok, I get it, you have lots of customers and you need to turn the table quickly. As usual, I have found the fish quite good but I found the service absolutely atrocious. They appeared to be rushing us throughout dinner even to the point of being unhappy when we ordered additional fish. At 7:30 (with 30 minutes left to our reservation)when we asked about dessert, they basically snipped that this is the last order they could take from us. I felt disrespected and unappreciated as a customer. It's not clear to me why we got this kind of treatment. We were not drunk. We were polite and said our "please" and "thank you"'s and didn't fuss about anything. I have never felt less welcomed at a restaurant. This is New York. Good food is plenty and with that kind of attitude, I don't find a reason to go back.
