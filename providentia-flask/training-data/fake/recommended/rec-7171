Came here with my parents (big mistake).  I would definitely recommend this place but the "hipster vibe" seemed like a little too much for mom and pops.  Food was great, got the Khao Sao, Sig Sig, and Pork Jowl.  I loved the Khao Sao and Sig Sig but was not a huge fan of the Pork Jowl.  Service was kind of slow but I wouldn't take away a star for it.   I would definitely come back but with friends, not family.
