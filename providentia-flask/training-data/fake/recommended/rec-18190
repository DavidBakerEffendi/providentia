I live three blocks away, and finally ventured in with a friend a few weeks ago because I'd heard great things about the place. So, since then, I've been back a few times. I was incredibly impressed with the beer selection. Others have complained about the service, but I've always received good service. The food is very good, and the prices are reasonable. I love the mini corn dogs, pork tacos, and the summer picnic meal with the chicken strips, mac'n cheese, and greens. I have yet to try a burger. The only complaint that I have about Local 44 is the noise. I constantly have to lean over to hear what someone is saying or shout to be heard.
