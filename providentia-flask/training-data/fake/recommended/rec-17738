"Hi Jerry, we're very sorry that your experience wasn't up to either of our expectations." SERIOUSLY ???? Not up to EITHER of our expectations ??? The last time I looked, you got paid, IN FULL, and I got CRAP for lunch. I'd say that for your statement to be true, you would've received the same thing I got. pennies on the dollar. I was out $24, and we left your food in your trash bin. EVEN ? I Think Not. Â YOU would've been run OUT of Chicago.
