LOVE the food.  The prices have recently gone up, which is a bummer.  But I can't blame them for trying to stay afloat in this economy.  Can't buy individual tacos for $2.00 anymore, now it is 4 (I think) for $10.00 The chicken enchilada mole is a fabulous dish.  We usually add a side of beans which I find myself craving now & then as they are just that good.  The tacos are the BEST around & the 3 sauces are some of the best I've ever had.  There is a mild Avocado sauce, a Medium Tomatillo, & a fiery Red sauce that comes with the tacos as well as radishes, lime wedges & grilled green onions. We like the Ceviche In the summer. The sliced yams & toasted seeds (?) are an interesting addition. Plenty to share. Well worth every dime for delicious & affordable Peru-Mex food.
