Eh. The atmosphere is amazing. The food is alright. Waiter upselling us on quail but wasn't even good. Shishito peppers were good. The highlight was the drinks not the Romero. Mind you they charge $14 for cocktails and I found out they use well gin to make it? Not cool Salinas. You charge $14 a cocktail, use good gin. I won't be back strictly for this sneaky reason.
