Riverpark is so elegant and modern! I can not comment on the food because I attended a social event here that was catered but I was in a wine mood so that cocktails were on point! Â I will definitely be returning for a refined dinner, business meeting or even a reception. I can not wait for the summer so I can frequent this place, because the outdoor seating and location on the East River would be excellent to enjoy time and time again!
