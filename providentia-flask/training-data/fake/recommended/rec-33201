I've made it a personal goal to check out more new-to-me places near my apartment and when Malagueta came up, I was pleasantly surprised. Although the service was rather slow (not the place to go if you're in a rush) -- the waitress was quite nice and the food was fantastic. I don't have much experience with proper Brazilian cuisine, but it seemed authentic.
