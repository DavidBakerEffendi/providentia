I came here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. We were craving crepes and found this gem on Yelp. Bonjour Montclair is a small establishment with limited seating. We got lucky and got seated right away, however, it seemed like the wait wasn't too long for those waiting. The food was really good and the service was just as good. I ordered the 'smoked salmon, goat cheese, tomato, onion, and pesto' crepe. It was delicious. I'm a sucker for goat cheese so as soon as I saw those two magical words, I knew I had to get it. I love the fact that all ingredients were correctly proportioned. They didn't skimp on any one ingredient. In addition, I ordered a fresh lemonade, which in fact, was very fresh. My friend went with a sweet crepe. She ordered the 'fresh strawberry nutella' crepe. I can definitely vouch for the freshness of the strawberries, and of course, nutella is delicious with anything. The proportions are HUGE. Both my friend and I could barely finish a whole crepe...but we did because it was too good and we couldn't resist. I will definitely be returning to try some of their other crepes. I can imagine how nice outdoor seating will be in the spring/summertime. Don't forget, cash only!
