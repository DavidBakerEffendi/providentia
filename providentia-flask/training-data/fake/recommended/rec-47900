The staff here is very nice.  Their tacos on the other hand are just ok.  I had the chicken, carnitas (pork) and the asada (steak) tacos.  The meat on all 3 was super dry, even tho the carnitas was very greasy.  The taste was nothing to write home about.  That bing said, this is the best Mexican in the area.  Sad.
