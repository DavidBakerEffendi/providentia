Wow!  First, THANK YOU to all the yelpers that caused me to come here in the first place. All the food was great all on its own. But when you consider the coat of the meal it becomes unreal!!  Very big portions, huge drinks - great prices. I totally plan on making this place a hangout. Solidly 4-1/2 stars!
