This place is worth the hype! I love marking my order on a laminated menu and sitting at the bar. I had a buffalo chicken ball that was a special today and it was great. Ironically, my favorite ball was the veggie one! It had crunchy lentils that gave it a wonderful texture. Try it with the pesto sauce and you won't be sorry! The spicy pork ball with the spicy meat sauce could've beet spicier, but I tend to like things really hot. Service was quick and friendly and that makes this a really delightful lunch spot!
