Finally tried the Meatball shop. I liked how you can order individual sliders so you can try each of the meatball favors. You can also order sauce for each one. I tried beef (tomato sauce), pork (spicy tomato sauce) and chicken (pesto) sliders. the pest was my favorite but the tomato was simple tasting. I also noticed that there was very little sauce on each slider except the pesto. We ordered a side of sauce and it helped. Service was very good and attentive. I think the hype was a bit bigger than the delivery.
