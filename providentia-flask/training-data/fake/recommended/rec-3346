Late, late night snack. Stopped at this place around 4am and there was a long wait. About 15 minutes in, they let us know that they were on their last batch of fries and therefore might not get a chance to taste these yummy fries and amazing sauces. Luckily, the friendly people in front of us cut down on their order. Ended up choosing just two sauces, the mango mayo and parmesan peppercorn mayo though I wanted to try just about everything else on their menu. Both were very unique and great tasting. The mango wasn't too sweet and the parmesan wasn't too cheesy tasting. Again, a perfect mixture of salt, sweet and everything else in between. Many people stopped by inquiring about the long wait for "just fries." I've got to say these are not just any fries. These were hot, thick and not too oily. It had a great texture, a tad crunchy on the outside and soft but not overcooked in the inside. I hope to be around this part of Manhattan soon so that I may try their many other different sauces!
