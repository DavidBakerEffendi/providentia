Hi, my name is Gene.  I am a L&B addict and I'm here to tell you the facts. This 5 star rating is not because of my Brooklyn-biased preference.  It is due to their most incredible square pizza that is highly addicting.  It beats heroine addiction, porn addiction, gambling addiction combined by a mile! Whenever I visit my parents, I always make a point of stopping over here for their squares.  If I had extra cash, I'll order a few whole pies and freeze them.  Does that sound like an addiction?!?!?
