Fun place to go with friends while drinking if it's a bit late and people still need to eat.  The menu isn't very inspiring... bog standard Mexican food. Portion size isn't anything special either.  Pitchers of margaritas are pretty reasonably priced though, and after a few of them, you'll appreciate that this is the kind of place where no one even notices if you get loud and a bit unruly.  Lots of dark corners too that it easy to forget about the world outside.  I wouldn't bother going here before 10 PM or so though.
