For a vegetarian restaurant this place ifs great. Everything had flavor and was absolutely delicious. You won't even realize that meat is missing. Although it was a little cold in there and I do think they could fix the atmosphere a little. It isn't a attention grabber in going in to eat just maybe picking up and going home.
