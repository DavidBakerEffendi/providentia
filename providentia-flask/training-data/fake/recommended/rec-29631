I've been there twice in the last couple weeks and I'll go again. The service has sold me, but the food will sell everybody else. They are generous with the bacon popcorn. The first bag is like the greatest thing ever. The second bag, you think you are in heaven. But the third bag was too much. Yes, I'm a glutton. She let me take my bag home, and it was great for breakfast. The food. I have tried most of the dishes mentioned on previous reviews. Nothing disappointed. They have small plates and larger plates. The larger plates have a lot of food. They are creative and flawless with their desserts. Great creativity and use of pork. I'm hungry again writing about this.
