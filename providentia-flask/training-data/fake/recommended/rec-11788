I agree with some of the negative reviews. Bouley has a stellar reputation. Many of the best chefs in NYC came through this ktichen. But I fear that those glory days are long gone. The food here was disappointingly average and unoriginal for this class of dining. I sampled the tasting menu for free with a pharm rep.  I would have been really pissed to pay for the meal otherwise, it was incredibly expensive for what you got. The "sashima quality tuna" appetizer started the meal on a mediocre foot. I've eaten alot of good maguro. I could instantly recognize that this tuna was of average quality, it had the bland, freezer burn taste that you would get at Go Sushi. . The main entre was beef utilizing a marbled cut of beef from italy, intended to be Kobe-like.  However it was far from it. The dessert and bread however were excellent. I guess I would come back to the bakery. So all in all, disappointing given this restaurant 's reputation and history. Would not come back if I had to pay for it.
