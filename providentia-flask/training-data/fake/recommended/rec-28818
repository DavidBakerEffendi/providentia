I can't say anything but good things about this place. I went here for a big hat breakfast with my meetup group. The food was simply delicious. It was warm and prepared just right. The atmosphere is nice also they were able to accommodate our large group of 20 in the upstairs in our own private room. I definitely plan to go back again.
