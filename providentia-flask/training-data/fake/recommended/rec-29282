wtf..  I read all these great reviews about this place and no one warns you that the food here makes you insane.   Proof is my wife who hates pork. I usually try to order things we would both eat so I get veggie, shrimp and hesitantly order the pork dumplings. She pleads with me to order more pork dumplings. Too bad I'm only visiting because the food here is going to haunt me. The best dumplings I've ever had. Period!
