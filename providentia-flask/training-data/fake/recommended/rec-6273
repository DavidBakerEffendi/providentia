I thoroughly enjoyed my time at La Sirene.  I think the tininess only adds character and builds an intimate, homey space.  Love this place, love the french food, I would recommend this place to all of my friends. For a group of 3 we brought a couple of bottles of white wine and started with the mussels.  I'm starting to crave them as I write this... There might be crack in the broth, its rather addicting.  The service was also great.  I guess its hard to go unattended when everything's a foot away but she was always there to refill our wine glasses.  The only con I have about this place are the entrees - the meat options are pretty much just plates of sliced meat.  My lamb was slightly overdone for medium and bland.  I liked my friend's duck.  The dessert was awesome - profiteroles, very good to share. Can't wait to go back!
