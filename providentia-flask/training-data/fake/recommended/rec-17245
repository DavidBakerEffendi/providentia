The food was good, but a bit too pricey. We came here a few times for dinner and the wait was too long so we left. Â We tried again during lunch time and were lucky to get a table. We ordered 3 ramens, 2 appetizers, and 3 sodas, which came to about $100. It was def. pricey for what we ordered. I don't think we will go back. There are other ramen places just as good with shorter lines and appropriate prices. 4 stars for the food and -1 star for the price.
