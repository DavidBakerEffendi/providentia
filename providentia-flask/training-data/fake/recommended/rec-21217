We had a dinner party at Palma's carriage house last night and everything was absolute perfection.  The space is by far the prettiest private room I have seen in a NYC restaurant. Everything from the pictures hanging on the wall, the books, the beautiful fresh flowers and candles all give it a very personal and rustic feel. It's quite special and we could have easily felt like we were in the Italian countryside...all the better that we were tucked away on a beautiful little street in the West Village. The food is excellent from start to finish - hors d'oeuvres included bruschetta, green olives marinated in olive oil and rosemary, mixed meat plates with prosciutto/mortadella/etc.  They were all perfectly laid out on the table before we arrived. For the appetizers, we picked the crispy risotto bites filled with italian cheese (a MUST!), the burrata (which was served over fresh peas), and the fried baby artichoke hearts.  For the primi, we picked the Ravioli filled with spinach and ricotta served in a tomato sauce and the pappardelle with slow roasted lamb. Both pastas were absolutely delicious and we were almost fighting over the parppardelle.  For the main, we had the branzino and the tagliata di manzo.  Again, both delicious and perfectly balanced.  We topped it all off with a homemade chocolate cake that was simple, yet delightful. Service was seamless. Our personal waiter named Joery was attentive with a warm and gentle personality.  He was always present while never at all being intrusive. Jessica Capone - the special event coordinator - was also very helpful in helping us plan the evening. ahead of time.  She was always available and knowledgeable. All in all, everyone left feeling utterly enchanted by the ambiance, the service, and of course the food. We will soon be back for certain.
