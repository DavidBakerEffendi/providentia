this place has great food. it's really small though so the wait is not always the best. the tables are small but that's ok. patatas bravas- awesome gambos al ajillo- also awesome, perfectly garlicky and the sauce is perfect for dipping croquetas- who knew the croqueta del dia this day- swiss chard- could taste so amazing. love this place- but again, very small, better for off hours. the wait is usually an hour plus.
