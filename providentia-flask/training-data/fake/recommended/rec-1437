You know what's real American? Capitalism. Freedom to decide what business I give a dollar to. Geno's is gung-ho about "freedom fries", making sure I'm aware that white people originated in the America's, and that I should glorify a police officer who was slain in 1981 when there is MUCH more to that story. I'm spending more time discussing the politics and marketing of Genos over their cheesesteaks because their cheesesteaks are not worth talking about. Maybe at one time 30 or 40 years ago they might have had more flavor, used higher grade cheese, and the "cute" rivalry with Pat's across the street for who's best was relevant. Times have changed and the area is more diverse now. The blend of cultures is apparent Â and in 2013, with ways to learn of a business through social media, its not all about you (the company) anymore. I shall take my American dollar and mouth elsewhere. Oh, and I'll put my American middle finger in the air facing Geno's while I'm at it.
