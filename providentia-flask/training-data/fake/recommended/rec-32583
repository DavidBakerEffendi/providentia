This place has been one of my favorites for many years for a number of reasons.The food is amazing. I don't think I have ever had anything that I didn't like in this place. The pasta menu is two pages long. There's something for every one. I personally like Pescatore, pasta with tons of seafood, you'll forget you're in soho. Why? Because it's so inexpensive. Pizzas are great too. All of them. The place is not fancy, like some other yelper said, it looks like you are in someone else's house. A house with a lot of people. This place is always packed. So because of the reasonable prices you have to understand that they need to sit a lot of people during the night, so don't expect to just hang out there all night. Perfect menu: Bocconcini salad, Fettucini Pescatore (or if you're vegetarian, try the ravioli with mushroom, cream and walnuts)...then a tartufo or a tiramisu.Order some house wine and you'll be set and happy. Staff is very friendly.
