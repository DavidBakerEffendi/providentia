Came here the other day while on a weekend trip to visit my brother in collge. I have had other cheesesteaks during previous trips to Philly, but I don't recall them too much, because I was very young at the time. After being referred to about a dozen places by co-workers and friends, I decided to go with Geno's, since it's one of the two staples in the city besides Pat's. Overall, I was very pleased with my cheesesteak! I ordered a "mushroom wiz, wid out". The meat came in whole, thin slices that was in even proportion to the bread. There were plenty of mushrooms on top, which I love! To me, having the Whiz on the sandwich made it all complete. About the decor, the place screams "tourist destination" with it's bright lighting and many pictures of famous people. Also of note, the badges of many municipalities across the United States are posted on the walls as well. I was delighted to see a badge for Ossining Police. Next time I'm in Philly (which I'm sure will be sooner than later), I will make sure I go to AT LEAST two other eateries, including Geno's rival, Pat's.
