Where I come from, we have many fancy and non-fancy Mexican restaurants, most of which are very, very good.  I'm Mexican-spoiled.  My friends took me to El Vez for a little dinner the other night, and the food was okay, but nothing spectacular.  The blood orange frozen margaritas were probably my favorite thing, save for the experience of sitting in a very regal, velvety booth with my amigas.
