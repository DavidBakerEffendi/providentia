This is one of my favorite "late late night" restaurants.  It's where you can go at 2AM and get grilled lamb shank, roasted oxtail, or fried chicken with mash potatoes.  All very reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, I'm not down in SOHO enough to take advantage of it more often.  I did hear they had an issue with the Health Dept though ... haven't been there since someone told me that.
