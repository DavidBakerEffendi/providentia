I will NEVER go here again! The server was strange & made us feel uncomfortable. She tried to be funny but just gave us a bad vibe instead of making us laugh. The air must be broken because we sat there sweating (literally) over our food. It was terrible. The food was not very good either & the waitress messed up our order. The place is dirty & in need of a facelift. I don't recommend going here at all!
