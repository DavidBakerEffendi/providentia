Very cute but hidden Japanese restaurant, we missed it first time when we were trying to find it. It can only host about twenty people at one time. There are plenty of plants inside House of Small Wonder. It's Â like sitting in a lovely garden while having meals. But one thing really bothers me was files and other small bugs. We had Croissant French Toast and Steak w/ rice. The taste of them were above average but not very outstanding. We kinda miss traditional American brunch.
