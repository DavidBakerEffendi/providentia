Fresh bread, warm turkey, apples and guyere cheeses, delicious Honey Oat Bread and crisp bacon ---The Red Onion Special! My boyfriend and I were on a New England Road Trip and we hit up the red onion on a recommedation from his cousin who used to live in Burlington. What a fantastic recommendation indeed. I don't know if this place would be awesome for dinner but word of the wise to the lunch crowd--eat at the Red Onion. I also tried one of their peanut butter bars--freaking fantastic and you can't beat it's location on Church Street either. If it's nice out be sure to sit outside, the interior was a bit warm and small and there tends to be cluster of people at waiting in line, right before the door when it's busy. Huge sandwich! Wish it was in Boston!
