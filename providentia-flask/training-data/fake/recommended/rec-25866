This place was recommended to us by a local. Definitely a great restaurant with amazing food. This was the first spot we hit when we arrived to NY and we're glad we did. I recommend the baby greens salad (which is big enough to split). You can't really go wrong with anything else you order as we were very pleased with our main courses!
