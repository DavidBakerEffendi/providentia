I started eating at Orlin when I first moved to the city. I used to live on st. marks and then on 4the street, so it was always a staple. We went for the brunches on Saturday and Sunday, we usually had to run to make it to brunch before it switched over to the dinner menu at 4pm. Yes, that's right, it was rare for me to get out of bed before 4pm on the week-end. Ahhh the hangovers. Anyway, despite my lateness, they have a tasty brunch with awesome blueberry pancakes. These pancakes are of normal size, not the skillet size ones you get at some restaurants. Have you ever tried making huge pancakes at home? Why doesn't it work? Oh I think it's because pancakes aren't supposed to the size of a manhole cover. However, my absolute favorite at this place is their veggie burger. IT. IS. SO. GOOD. I don't know what's in it, but that veggie burger kicks ass. It comes with salad and fries (though sometimes I sub mashed potatoes for the fries, because, hey. mix it up) and it's sort of like heaven. I don't love the inside too much, makes me feel a little trapped, but it's worth it. I'd follow that veggie burger almost anywhere. ME + VB =4 EVA.
