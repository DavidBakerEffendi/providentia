We tried Divina  and  were satisfied with the food and service. Each of us had a different entrée and were quite pleased. Although good, portions were kind of skimpy for my liking anyway, and pricy for what you were getting.( Pork chop special (2) for $27.95,  appetizer of fried calamari $13.00). Atmosphere is nice and waiter was accommodating, but said to us before taking our order, "food here is good, service not so good....maybe he was joking around, not sure, but we found the service good. Overall, food is good but not likely to go back. They should charge less on certain dishes, or be more generous if keeping prices as they are.
