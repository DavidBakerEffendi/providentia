Pretty good definitely has the go for drinks after work feel to it so noise isn't quiet at the moment The appetizer I got was a filet + potatoes which was really good only wish there were more pieces you get about 6 but I could eat 12 The burger was pretty good only problem was the bun but cheese on it helped overall very nice...now for desert What basically amounted to a chocolate shake didn't blow me away, kinda thin and for a place like this I guess I expected better :\
