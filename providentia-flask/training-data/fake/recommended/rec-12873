I think this place is definitely worth the trip. I know some are commenting about the wait times but when we went it was about a 15 min wait in the morning during the week.It is kinda of small but that's no real issue. The pancakes were the best I've ever had, and I don't even really like pancakes all that much. If you're in the area definitely check it out. I will be back!
