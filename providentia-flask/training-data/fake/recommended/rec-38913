We almost missed the bucket of spuds when ordering.  That would have been a real shame.  Adding two fried eggs on top of the home fries with delicious cheese and salsa made this a meal in and of itself.  The sourdough french toast and the gingerbread pancakes had us all leaving stuffed. Is it expensive...yes Is it worth it...no doubt Can't wait to come back!
