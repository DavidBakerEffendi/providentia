oh my god. NY food did it again, this time with an amazing bartender! We arrived, sat at the bar, and immediately ordered one of the specialty drinks. The first one I got was made with rum, although now I can't remember anything else about it. For appetizers, my friend and I ordered the pickled veggies. There was pickled dill, jicama, green bean, radish, etc. We split 2 different entrees: one duck pomegranate salad (AMAZING, best salad and duck I've ever had), and the ribs. Everything was just incredible. For my next drink I had this amazing pumpkin creamy concoction which i LOVED. The bartender, who was also our server, was spectacular and entertaining. I highly recommend this place! The prices for food is extremely reasonable, the drinks were a little pricey (to be expected). The ambiance is quaint, cozy, and a nice escape from the hustle bustle life right outside. I really, honestly could not have been happier, and owe it all to my friend for showing me this gem.
