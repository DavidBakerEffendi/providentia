9th avenue is definitely filled with one of the yummiest Thai restaurants in the city! I love thai food, and have to agree that this place truly deserves 5 starts! Food: Exactly how we asked for. We had Spicy Thai Fried Rice and the Spicy Thai Basil w/ imitation duck (SOO TASTY! - - perfect for a vegetarian). My cousin was visiting the city and had never had vegetarian duck. She was in love with the dish! Service: This place gets pretty crowded during dinner time so definitely make reservations if possible. Our wait staff was very attentive and made sure that we knew exactly what we were ordering :) Ambiance : Beautiful and elegant. I loved the chandelier drops. Bathroom was a little darker, you can barely see your face in the mirror. However the place can be great for both date night and bday dinners
