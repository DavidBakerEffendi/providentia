i wish our server had mentioned the catfish and grits special. by the time i saw the little chalkboard sign, it was too late. no matter, i plan to return soon! my sunday brunch at rose petals was great. they are very generous with the la colombe coffee pour in oversize animal-printed mugs. our server was friendly, attentive, patient and happy to help people in my party with waffle choices. i had a fajita omelette with grits, and the thick, creamy grits. both were delicious. the omelets are generous three-egg size and the fajita was served with sour cream on the side as well. everyone else in my party had waffles, including the berry, peanut butter, and chicken and waffles. the boneless chicken and waffles came with crispy skin on the side so you can add as much or as little as you like. for the first few minutes of our brunch the conversation consisted of: "oh, this is so good! this is so good. this is delicious. can you pass the syrup? mmmm, this is so good." the decor is warm and cozy. they have a little seating area with an armchair, couch, and even a lumbar/neck support roll pillow. there's also a kids playroom with a big window in the back with toys, books, and a chalkboard. one thing to note is that they don't seem to serve pork. they have beef bacon, turkey bacon, and a variety of chicken and turkey sausages with herbs. if you're a septa-rider, they're right across the street from chelten ave. regional rail station on the chestnut hill west line. the 26 and J buses runs right out front. the 23 is about 4 blocks away on germantown ave, too.
