Quaint French restaurant of which everything breathes French except that it was built not that long ago. Even the stairs going down to the restroom was 'typical'. The oysters were excellent and the mould frites too. The crenelated brûlée was ok, too sweet for my taste and too custardie. The place was hopping that was for sure
