After our horrible lunch at monkey bar we wanted some good food and we found it at Zio...the pizza was great and so was the cheese steak... the restaurant was warm and inviting with all the exposed brick. The service was great.... I can't finish with saying the CANOLIS were amazing..thanks guys for a great meal.
