I don't normally come to Brooklyn for hotpot, but this place is an exception. This place is small, so you should make reservations before you go. You should get the CREAMY PORK BONE SOUP in regular AND spicy. The food is fresh and they make sure they clean their seafood well. They also offer higher quality of beef. From fatty beef, to wagyu beef, they got it all! I'm a fan of Mister Hotpot, but I feel their prices are a bit expensive compared to the other places that I go to though. I felt like I overpaid ($58) for the lobster I got. The staff can be a little slow and forgetful at times when it's busy, but some of them can be a bit rude as well. Maybe they had a bad day, but don't take it out on your customers!
