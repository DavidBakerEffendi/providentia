Not bad. Not bad. I was soooooo traumatized from Donburiya (in Midtown East--food was disgusting)...and I wasn't sure if I wanted to trust Yelp again to help me decide on 2 star Japanese, but I took a chance. I had the curry udon with beef. It wasn't bad...it wasn't the greatest...but I'd have it again. Service is not the greatest. They forgot our appetizer and brought it out when we were nearly done w/ our meal. but we still took it. They were also a bit rude when we were ordering...but hey. I've learned I can't be that picky in this city about service....because there is no such thing!
