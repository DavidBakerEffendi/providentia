I'll preface this review by saying we just ate in the cafe on the ground floor. I ordered the Big Deal which was okay. The cheese was good, but overall the sandwich was forgettable, small, and kind of overpriced. I wasn't expecting a deli sandwich packed with meat, but for ten bucks I expected a little more. I'd come back to pick up some cheese from the deli, and perhaps try out their cellar, but if you're looking for a quick bite from the cafe, I'd pass.
