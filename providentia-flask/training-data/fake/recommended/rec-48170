We loved it.  A great neighborhood place.  Yes, the app list is a little all over the place, but that means there's something to certainly fit your mood.  I can back the ciao bella, and saltimbocca (a special at the time) pizzas.  Both were baked perfectly and loaded with toppings.  The italian burger and chicken parm sandwich were also delicious, served on fresh-baked buns.  Service was friendly.  The kids noodles w/ cheese were incredible - consider adding a variation to the main menu.
