I've gotta say that the hype might have killed this place for me. I had their Greenpointer tonight and it was GOOD. But it was not out of this world amazing. I honestly had a difficult time tasting the cheese on my pizza. It had both mozzarella and pecorino, which is usually a pretty pungent cheese. I am not sure if it is a quality of ingredients or the quantity that was on the pizza but I could barely taste the cheese and ended up tasting mostly the dough. Don't get me wrong, this is pretty good pizza, and I would probably try it again. But I've had better.
