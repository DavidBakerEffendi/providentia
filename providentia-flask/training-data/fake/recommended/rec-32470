Awesome Pho.  There isn't much else to say - sometimes they have some sesame donut confection available, and on weekdays they have fresh spring rolls, but other than that it's just Pho - and great pho at that.  The shrimp and beef are very high quality and the broth is the best I've had.  I've never paid more than $7 so I would say it's also a great deal. Not a fancy place but there's a reason the local lunch crowd is lining up out the door most weekdays.
