The location is good and they participate in restaurant.com.  This is why my friend and I tried here last night.  The bar area was packed, as was the parking lot- they definitely do not have enough parking.  The restaurant is a little loud since the bar is so close, and the service is pretty lacking.  We didn't have too much of an issue, but the tables around us were flagging her down all night asking for silverware and new drinks, stuff that was missing from their order, etc. The food was not spectacular, but based on the other reviews, I'm pretty sure it's because of what we ordered.  We both went with large salads.  I got the "that salad" without chicken (since I'm vegetarian, and there weren't that many options!) and everything was from a can.  So pretty disappointing for a salad as your meal. We did order an appetizer though, the spinach dip, and it was fabulous.  Should have come with more to dip in it though.  It arrived in a bread bowl, with only 4 small chunks of bread and the lid, so we got a little messy taking the thing apart and then quickly ran out of bread all together. Overall, the experience was just OK.  But not really OK enough to try again.
