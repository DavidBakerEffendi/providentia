We have been here several times over the course of our time in central Jersey. It is a convenient meeting place for the SO's team of coworkers to get together since they are located all over NJ. We've done appetizers, crab pots and just drinks and for the most part, Joe's fit the bill. Casual enough for drinks, decent food for the hungry.
