The ambience is nice and the food is ok, but what really bugged me was the overall lack of Kimchi, Â which is the most basic of Korean foods! I'm sorry, but if I am ordering a sit-down meal with three people, and I ask for some extra Kimchi, give me some extra Kimchi! It's not a big deal, and in every Korean restaurant you'll ever go to, Kimchi comes free and it comes plentifully. Not here. When I asked the waitress for some extra kimchi to go with my bi bim bap, she looked at me like I had asked her for a pepperoni pizza or something equally unexpected. After some awkward discussion, she ended up giving me a tiny plastic to-go cup of Kimchi and proceeded to charge me an extra dollar for it! Bad form, very un-Korean, and left a bad taste in my mouth that will keep me from coming back for a long time.
