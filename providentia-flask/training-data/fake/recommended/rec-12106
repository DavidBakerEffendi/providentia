Very warm interiors and great service are the main appeal of this small place. My review is based on two dishes only. They shared the same flaw: the subtle flavors of the main ingredient were virtually obliterated by the other things on the plate. The "burrata" appetizer came with dill spice, served on a slice of toast in a potato-leek broth. The broth was wonderful, but the burrata couldn't be tasted as a result of the other strong flavors.  It could have been served as soup and I wouldn't have missed the cheese, which itself was too firm and had a chewy texture. Similarly the skate, served with spicy broccolini, was over-shadowed by the spice. Skate is beloved for its delicate taste. Why it was accompanied by a palate killer is a mystery.  Again, I don't know if these two dishes are representative of a theme of too much "creativity" or I just had bad luck.
