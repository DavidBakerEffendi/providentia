Earlier this week, my supervisor flew in from Boston and wanted to go out for lunch with the rest of my crew but it was seriously freezing outside. Tito's to the rescue!!! I placed an order at their Tuesday opening time of 11am and the order arrived with real door-to-11th-floor-hospital-office-door delivery service in time for lunch. I received a call before the delivery person left the restaurant then again, when they arrived at my workplace. Who does all that? For lunch that day, I had super-cute Mini Shape Quesadillas with ground beef, a dependable, marinated Steak Taco (see my previous review), some of my work wife's fries with a tangy chipotle dipping sauce, and a cold Jarritos Mandarin soda. Deliciously satisfying! Our group order for 6 folks came with a giant bag of homemade fried tortillas which remain crisp a few days later. Gnosh gnosh gnosh! Over the past month, I've been really into their wings, particularly their Gnarly Wings which are a little tart and spicy (the orange-colored kind) and Â their Hot Sticky Sweet Wings that are indeed sticky and sweet with a honey glaze and a hint of habanero. While I'm a big fan of these wings, their sweet, tasty Aloha Wings remain my favorite. I've had a really hard time finding a fish taco around New Jersey and Tito's does it really well. Their Fish Taco has lightly battered/fried tilapia with shredded cabbage, limey cilantro sauce, and salsa in a double crispy/soft shell. Really well-balanced and fresh! Tito's never disappoints, especially on a cold-ass winter day!!!
