Loved it Loved it! It was hard to find, it was small, it was cramped and most of all it was cheap. Shhhh... the amount we spend for constant drinks and food was unbelievable, but when you factor in location, its beyond words. If I lved in NYC, this would be one of my go to spots. Unfortunately, If you plan on going here with a large group, we had 7, be prepared to wait for a long time. On the plus side, you can put your name on a list and they will call you as soon as a table opens up. We put our names on the list with an expected time to seating about an hour. Well after an hour and a half we got a call telling us our table was ready. We left Tropical something bar next door (didnt care to remember the name of this *&^^in place) and got seated at Hagi. How can you go wrong with cheap, yet great, Saki, beer and izakaya lifestyle. I like the potato crocket, sweet potato tempura, squid (very fresh and charcoly) and may more, but.... the Yakitori, one of the Udon dishes (not the curry one) was extremely disappointing. What ever the case, the crowd was fun, the waiters could be a bit more attentive, but the quality and price of most of the dishes and the alcohol will make me want to come here every time i am in NYC. Japanese sports bar the way it should be.
