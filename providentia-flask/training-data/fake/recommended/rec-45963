Second time I've ordered from them and it's taken over 50 minutes to get food delivered. Times before that were much faster- I live about a mile from the place. By the time it comes it's tepid and un appetizing. I will stop getting food there. I miss New England Wings. They were fast and had better wings to boot. I suggest you pass on this place.
