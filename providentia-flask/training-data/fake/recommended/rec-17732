The food here is just absolutely off the charts. I would never have even known this place was here without yelp because it's so small, but I'm glad I had yelp to find it. Easily my favorite food place in Ewing/Trenton. The food is completely authentic at a very good price. Your first time in you may be conservative and order something that any Mexican place can do well like a quesadilla or something, but I encourage you to try everything and the mariachi plate would definitely be the best way to do that. They make every dish so well and I promise you won't be disappointed. Plus free chips and salsa when you order. Can't beat it
