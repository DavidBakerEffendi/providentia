HOLY FRIES!!!!!  This place is a tiny hole in the wall and at any given time, there is a line, YES, a LINE that extends onto the street of people waiting patiently to get their mouth on these fries covered with sauce covered with yummy goodness that only Belgians have created.  OMG....my mouth is watering. I don't even know what else they have there, I think only beverages, but it doesn't matter.  It's all about these delicious cut potatoes.  GO...NOW!
