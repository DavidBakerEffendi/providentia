I was finally able to check out ASB after hearing so many things about it before it opened (this review is being written a little belatedly!).  I was expecting great things because of how much I love South Philly Tap Room, and wasn't disappointed.   Unfortunately I wasn't able to partake in the alcohol at this brunch, so I had to settle for trying sips of what my fiance was drinking.  They have an excellent selection of seasonal beers on tap.  The Bloody Mary was neither excellent nor horrible- nothing unique about it really, but still good. Food was delish, especially the big white bowl of salty/peppery fries with what I believe was accompanied by some sort of tartar sauce dip.  I had the falafel sandwich which was great, but could easily feed a den of bears.  The Krab Cake sandwich (made with fake crab) was great!!  I would go back just to have that as my own order. The area is a little sketchy, especially at night, so I don't think we'll be going there for late-night drinks...but who knows, stranger things have happened.  Definitely an awesome new brunch/lunch spot.
