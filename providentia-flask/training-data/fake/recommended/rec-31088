This new little cafe is what south street has been waiting for. After a quick stint at the gym I looked for something quick and healthy. The new cafe on the corner caught my eye and walking in felt like a nice urge of welcomeness. I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap and split pea soup. Victoria, the owner, was behind the counter and greeted me like we've known each other for years. The food was made from scratch and was absolutely amazing. The decor is newer and welcomed with new tiles, tvs, and a feeling of home. Try and you won't be disappointed. Price is a little high but its definitely worth it.
