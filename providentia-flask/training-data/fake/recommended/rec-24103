I love some of the food at green eggs, I used to go there often to eat in and take out, and I've had good service in the past. But recently I've experienced such appalling service that I won't going back. The straw that broke the camels back was when they hung up on me multiple times yesterday as I was trying to place my breakfast order. Didn't even remotely attempt to apologize. Managment is more concerned about hiring attractive waitresses than getting decent service.
