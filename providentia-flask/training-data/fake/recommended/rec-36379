Went to celebrate my birthday with my husband at Balthazar recently. I ate there frequently when I was single, but this is the first time back after I married six years ago. I guess I forgot about the place. When we were looking for a place to eat for my birthday, it popped in my head after we couldn't get a reservation at ABC Kitchen. The experience was as I remembered. The staff is friendly but professional. Though my husband was late for our reservation, they sat me. A nice touch since so many good restaurants want everyone present to be seated. I ordered the lobster risotto to start and Dan ordered the Balthazar salad. Though both were very good, he complained that the portions were small for the price. The risotto was very tasty and I thought worth the $18 price tag. I have to agree that the salad -- certainly good -- was just a salad and a bit steep at $16. The entrees were excellent. I had the cod and Dan had the skate. He said he wouldn't come back after the appetizers but changed his mind after the entrees. We finished every bite. Dessert was really just OK. I ordered pavlova and he had a fig cake. Both were a bit too sweet. I would have preferred to taste the natural sweetness of the berries instead of the sugar syrup and the very, very sweet meringue. The cappucino, in contrast, was a little bitter. Still a very good restaurant, and worth more than one visit in six years.
