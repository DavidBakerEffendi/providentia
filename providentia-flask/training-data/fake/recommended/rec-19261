Not impressed.   After reading reviews and online about how great Osteria is, we were excited to say the least.  We did the sampler course which was a little bit of everything from each course.  The thing that sticks out mostly is the lasagna was extremely small, flat and burnt.  Granted I'm not on the up and up on traditional italian lasagna but this was almost insulting.  At most it was 1/2" thick.  The server just rattled off the menu when asked for suggestions or most popular items.  Perhaps we should have tried a specific item on the menu...in any case, this was not up to snuff, especially for the price paid.  We will not be back.
