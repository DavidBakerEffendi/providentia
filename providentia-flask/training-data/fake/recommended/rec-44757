I think the menu reads better than the food actually tasted. I've heard that they're usually nice, but they were a bit crabby (maybe because of the brunch craziness?). They gave us our check and, within 2 minutes of us paying (not even an exaggeration), they came by and said that they needed the table. I understand they're a small restaurant and they had a line, but honestly? Bad hospitality.
