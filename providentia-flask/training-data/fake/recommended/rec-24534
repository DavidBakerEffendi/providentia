We sat at the bar and enjoyed the food immensely. This is what we got: steamed buns- must have benton's smoky mountain ham- tasty but probably our least favorite of what we got honeycrisp apple kimchi- surprising and delicious smoked liver mousse- we tried something different and were happy with it spicy pork sausage & rice cakes- we loved this one Next time in NYC, we're going to explore the rest of the menu.
