I've been here a few times and have always left happy.  It's unusual to find a restaurant of this caliber right upstairs from a grocery store.  The food really is quite good - I've sampled many of the appetizers - the ones that stand out in my mind are the olive bread pudding and sausage sampler.  For dinner, I have always ordered the hamburger (boring, I know) . I have them add blue cheese and bacon and it's great - served on a unique garlic pretzel roll that's really quite tasty.  Other people in my family have been more adventurous and are always very pleased with what they order (some even rave).  I've also been for Sunday brunch and enjoyed that they take reservations and that it makes for a relaxed meal.  I can't really comment too much on the brunch food, as I had a bagel with lox (note - they butter and toast the bagel unless you ask otherwise).  However, my friend had the french toast and it was delicious.  The only issue this place seems to have is the service - we started going when the restaurant had just opened and I expected the initial growing pains to subside with time - they haven't.  Even servers who I recognize since the place opened still seem to lack confidence/familiarity with the menu.  The service isn't horrible or anything, just needs some fine tuning -  it wouldn't stop me from coming back.  Definitely a great addition to the area - a something for everyone kind of menu.
