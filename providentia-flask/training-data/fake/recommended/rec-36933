I have the pleasure of working in NYC and this is my most favorite restaurant in all of Manhattan and favorite tapas place ever! Â The decor is super cute and can be pretty romantic if you're sitting downstairs at one of the more intimate tables. I have had almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. You MUST try the brussel sprouts. Even friends of mine who despise brussel sprouts loved them at Alta, yes LOVED! I have never found brussel sprouts this good anywhere. The goat cheese with honey and lavender is another favorite of mine. All of the bacon stuff I'm told is fabulous too. The Spanish wine selection is really great and the servers are always helpful selecting a good one. There are so many restaurants to try in NYC that I rarely visit any more than once...but for Alta I always make an exception.
