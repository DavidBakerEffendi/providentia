Came here based on Yelp reviews, rated #1. Warm and inviting dinner dining experience. Hot tea was served with meal. Real authentic Chinese cuisine that focuses on spice. If you are not into spicy foods, the owner will make suggestions. I tried the traditional American pepper steak dish which was very tasty and tender. I also tried the fish fillet and tofu chef specialty dish. Did not like so much for consistency was too mushy for my taste and no spice (which I was happy about, but spice could have helped improve the dish). The owner graciously suggested another dish, the sauteed pork and tofu, which was a happy medium, not spicy but it was flavorful. Meal ended with orange slices to clean the palette. There were many other exotic looking dishes other patrons were enjoying as well. Overall great experience, huge portions for a very reasonable price in Chinatown. If in the area again, will definately stop by again.
