I've had a lot of things from Il Bambino and nothing has ever disappointed. Great ingredients on great bread, made right every time. My favorite thing is the Smoked Tomato Bisque, which they don't have all the time. It's AMAZING! It comes with a pesto covered toasted bread that is garlic-y and good. You can eat it on the side or, like me, dip it in the soup between spoonfuls of the velvety goodness. I've also had the Mozzarella, basil pesto, chili oil Crostini, which has their own chili oil on it. FYI, they sell that at the counter. It's not really spicy, but gives the thickly cut fresh mozzarella more flavor than just the pesto. The Artichoke Panini, with goat cheese, sweet onion and rosemary oil is also divine. Everything they have is the perfect combination of flavors and nothing ever over powers another. BRUNCH: One of the BEST BRUNCHES IN ASTORIA! Which is also served on Fridays! Woohoo! My favorite was the Filthy Sombrero Panini with Dulce de Leche, granny smith apples, goat cheese, and rosemary aioli. It was sweet, yet fresh with the crunch and tartness of the apple slices. I also tried the Notorious P.I.G. Panini with Smoked bacon, scrambled eggs, artisan cheddar, and truffle spread. It too was the perfect combination of ingredients on the perfectly grilled bread.
