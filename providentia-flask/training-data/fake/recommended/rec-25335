This jawn is tight. Literally, and figuratively. Loco Pez is a welcome addition to a line-up of solid bars in Fishtown. Living less than a block away, I find that I can more often than not find myself here unintentionally. There's so much drawing me in: $3 drafts during happy hour (5-7 daily). $1 taco days (follow them on FB). 3-dimensional Jesus photos. Vegan or not, make sure you try the Mushroom, Seitan & Spinich, and Soy Chorizo tacos. They are all equally amazing. Well, the soy chorizo might take the cake; that spice is epic. And their guacamole is pretty damn good too. As for drinks, you can't go wrong. They've always got a nice selection of local beers (PBC!) and their magaritas are all legit. I'd recommend the Monte Carlo -- it's got chipotle-infused taquila. Yea. Make sure to get there early, this place can get packed! And don't forget, it's "cash only, bitches."
