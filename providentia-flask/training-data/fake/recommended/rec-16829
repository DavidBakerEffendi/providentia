Friendly little place off Broad and Spring Garden.  Friendly staff delivers reasonably priced pizza/diner fare.  They claim this is "The Place Where Good Friends Meet!".  I imagine if I lived nearby I would frequent John's Place.  The name itself invites imagines of a local establishment.  You can hardly tell what they serve at "John's Place" unless you happen to be in the know. The pizza slice was well portioned and the staff was more than happy to welcome a new face.  Would suggest to anyone in the area.
