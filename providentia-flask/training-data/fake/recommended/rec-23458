The food is good. Not really worth the long wait you have to endure on weekends, but they serve thoughtfully prepared and seasoned food. It is definitely over-hyped (definitely not a 5 star Yelp place like the reviews suggest), and the ambiance is really lacking, but you can get a solid brunch here.
