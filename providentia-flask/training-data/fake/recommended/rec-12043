At first me and my buddy were wary of heading here midweek, but we were so happy that we did. The staff is phenomenal. I felt like I was a member of the family. Pete the bartender was awesome, and Alina, the manager, makes the best salad dressing on earth. Go here. We came on a Wednesday, not too many people here, but that could change if you go. So go! Right now, go!
