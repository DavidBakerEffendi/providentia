I can't believe there are so many reviews for this little tiny place right down the street from my house. When they first opened, i thought it was just another latin place, which there are tons of in this neighborhood, but this place is really good and actually slightly classy. contrary to others, i like BYOB, and my local bar is two doors down, the letruim, but we will always call it the emerald, come have a drink and don't be scared just cause you are in queens. GOODSIDE!!
