So I think I would give El Camino 2 or 3 stars for the food but 4 or 5 for the service/atmosphere.  I"ve been twice, and both times the food was just fine.  The first time I ordered from the "Tex" side of the menu and got a seitan bbq sandwich, which just tasted kinda charred (in a bad way) and the bread was just white bread with lots of grease on it.  I actually didn't even finish it, and it's pretty rare for me to leave behind food I've spent my hard-earned money on.  This latest time I ordered from the "Mex" side, enticed by the cactus and sweet potato burritos.  They were fine, but the tortilla was like the kind you would get at taco bell.  And they weren't stuffed very full.  My husband's two entrees there were similarly a let down.  Although he did love the fried pickle chips. However when we went last weekend we had amazing service.  I ordered the burrito without the cream sauce, and when they delivered the food, I hadn't even taken a bite yet before they came and snatched it away, apologizing profusely that they put the cream in.  Throughout the next few minutes it took to make a new one, several people apologized to me, and the server even took the blame (classic server move is ALWAYS blame the kitchen!) and took the burrito and one of our apps off the check!  All this and I never even had to take a bite of it and then wait to bring it to the server's attention, which is the usual route a dairy-less eater has to take, all the time. I also just can't get over how much I love the natural-cut wood tables and bar.  Both times we had to wait, but not long.  My husband is eyeing up the veggie wings and is dying to go back soon for just drinks and apps.
