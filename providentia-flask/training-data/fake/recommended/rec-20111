Never in my life have I experienced such treatment from a restaurant employee.  Disgusting!  Here is my story... Me, my husband and my daughter came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  We placed our orders and the waitress (who did confess that she typically does the dinner shift) entered my order incorrectly.  She was really sweet and apologetic and left the incorrect dish on the table and said, "you can pick at that in the meantime while I place the correct order."  As I reached over to take a piece of vegetable from that plate, the bartender (who was across the room) yells and says, "Ma'm, excuse me, if you're going to eat that too, you will have to pay for that."  First off, the waitress just told me 5 seconds ago to eat it and second of all, who does that????  Let's say that it is their policy to take the food back and not have the customer eat it, shouldn't that be something that is quietly discussed with the waitress and not the customer? I was beyond furious at how obnoxious he was being to me and to make matters worse he then began to yell at the poor waitress, who just made an honest mistake.  I am not sure how this douche bag got a job in the service industry but he clearly has no idea how to talk to his customers or the staff.  When I confronted him he told me that he can do whatever he wants, which is funny since this isn't his restaurant.  I wonder how the owner would feel about that.  I guess I will have to email him and find out...
