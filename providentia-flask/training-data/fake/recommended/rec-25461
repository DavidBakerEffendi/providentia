I guess I should have known when we walked in at 7:00 on the rainy Saturday night of Memorial Day Weekend and immediately got seated that this is not the "go to destination" of Boonton.  This was our second time here since it became Sharky's and I was not impressed. Waitress didn't really know what she was doing, probably her first day?  We asked for the wine list, she gave us the beer list (and couldn't off the top of her head name the four house wines they have, really? four?).  I ordered a Yeungling but it tasted off, so I didn't finish it.  (And that's saying something, as it's one of my standards.) For a place called Wing and Raw Bar you'd think the wings would be at least good...not so.  The buffalo ones we got were WAY overcooked and likely not the "medium" we ordered.  The Honey Mustard ones were better, but honey mustard is a weird flavor for wings.  Our dinner (sandwiches and a burger) came out 45 minutes later (did I mention the place wasn't busy?).  Pulled pork sandwich was not great, although my husband enjoyed his Mahi Reuben and my step daughter her cheeseburger. Lots of TV's, I'm sure this is a great place to watch a game.  I'm glad we had the $10 for $20 Yelp Coupon, but I'm not likely go to back.
