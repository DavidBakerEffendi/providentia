Dined here for the first time last night with six people. The food was impeccable; it is obvious that the chef/owner is passionate about his food and a delightful gentleman! Several memorable items included skate, which is rare to find on most menus and included a generous serving with a delicious assortment of sautéed mushrooms; mussels in a flavorful broth with a touch of cream; tender grilled octopus in an amazing pool of a citrus and olive reduction.  A must for dessert is the almond creme brûlée. Service, although pleasant, could be amped up a notch...champagne corks and wires stayed on the end of the table throughout the entire meal. Bowl for mussel shells never appeared, and wine glasses took a while to get to the table. Decor is simple but chic. We will be back here again soon!
