After waiting almost forever, a buddy and I were seated shoulder to shoulder with some other poor schmucks that said they were coerced into trying it. While I will admit the burgers are good, they're nothing deserving of all the hype they get.  Add on top of that slow and inattentive service, and you have a recipe for disaster.  I just don't see what's keeping the hype machine running.
