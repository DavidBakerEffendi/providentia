To be honest, when HipCityVeg first opened, I thought I would never go there. As a meat-lover, I didn't think I would enjoy eating vegetarian food. And I especially thought that the idea of fake meat was strange. But I actually really like HipCityVeg. Generally, I go to HipCityVeg when I need a quick meal that won't put me in a food coma. The Udon Noodle Salad is my favorite menu item, though most of the food is pretty good. The desserts and drinks are also really good. The banana whip is delicious. And surprisingly, I found that I like the fake chicken here. The main problem I have with HipCityVeg is that it is pretty pricy. I can see how they get away with it because they serve a niche group of customers and make it seem like the ingredients are higher quality than at other places. But $9 for a tiny salad is a bit much.
