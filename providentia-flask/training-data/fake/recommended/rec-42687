Made an RSVP for 3 for a business dinner on a Wednesday night. We were seated early (!!) and promptly, and the waitress was really great with recommending drinks and food for us. Even the doorman and hostess were nothing but kind to us. None of the snootiness that I expected from such a famous place, to be honest. The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've been to quite a few gastropub inspired eateries, and this was really phenomenal, which I totally wasn't expecting. What I was expecting, was the care and attention to their cocktails. We all had a great time, and I was praised by my superiors for finding such a great place that was perfectly priced for the quality. Can't wait to come back when I'm back in NY sometime soon!
