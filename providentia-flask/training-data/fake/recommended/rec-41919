Red Owl Tavern is a great place to go for American comfort food.  The first time I went there I remember it was a cold and wet night.  I was greeted with a very good beer selection, and large juicy mussels in a delish warm garlic sauce.  I have gone here several times since and I highly recommend the chicken pot pie, as well as the hamburger and beef short-rib.  The food here doesn't push boundaries.  The short-rib is super tender, the hamburger is juicy with a nice bun, and the chicken pot pie has tender chicken and veggie pieces prepared in that warm-your-tummy sauce.  It is a little expensive but the food is very, very good.  Red Owl Tavern is all about excellent preparation of good, basic ingredients.
