Great homemade spaghetti and great lasagna! My stomach growls when I walk past this place. I never understand why people complain about the wait. I know everyone gets grumpy when we're hungry, but It's out of anybody's control. Do you want to be rushed or asked to leave because people are waiting to be seated? It's a bit lame being an eary-bird, but I get there early and never have trouble getting a table. Cash only doesn't bother me either.
