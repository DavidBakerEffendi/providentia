You're better off popping into Â a cheap chain restaurant. Very ordinary cuisine at extraordinary prices, slow service, a misleading menu and ridiculously poor value for money. If you're not overly particular, ihop could provide the same meal with more bang for your buck. If you'd like to get what you pay for, head over to Malcolm X Blvd and roll a dice. I promise, any place will be better. Extremely disappointed with my $23 brunch that added up to 3 regular pancakes, scrambled eggs, ONE sausage link and a flute of pastuerized orange juice (not the freshly squeezed OJ that they advertise).
