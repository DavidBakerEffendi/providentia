The food was excellent. The champagne avgolemena was 5 star soup. The sauteed haloumi cheese was the star. The eggplant and zucchini stack with tzatziki very good. Pear and arugula subtle but solid. Lamb chops good and meaty but needed more seasoning. Cozy and romantic ambiance. 2 bowls soup. 3 tizers. 1 entree. 2 soda. Tax. 86$
