Yes, yes yes! We return to Jim's every time we are down in Philly - and I agree with other Yelpers - I'm not a meat fan, but Jim's sandwiches are unbelievable! Make sure you get it with extra whiz, mayo and everything else - we bring plastic forks (I kid you not) to scoop up all the extras as we devour these sandwiches at the counter. Can't wait to return!
