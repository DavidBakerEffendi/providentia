Come for the atmosphere and the wine, not the food.  Jadis is a cute place, and it feels as though you're in someone's wine cellar that's been turned into a cozy living room.  I always enjoy food when I'm drinking, so I was hoping that this would be a good place for bites and great wine, but, only the latter proved to be true.  The charcuterie platter that I ordered was actually good, but then again, they don't make their sausages, so all they did was provide a good selection of meats.  My friend's risotto puffs and artichoke dip were atrocious, however.  The vegetables for the dip were soggy and wilting, and the dip itself was a mess of cream cheese, virtually no artichoke, and cold.  The risotto puffs had no discernible rice grains, appeared to have been made in a factory somewhere and had been microwaved.  The bread served to accompany my charcuterie platter was plain, old, dry, white bread.  Alas, I won't be returning.  There are many other places across town with excellent food that also serve alcoholic drinks in a great setting.
