Just gross. This review is probably harsh but I just felt disgusting after eating here. I can see the appeal for some but not for me! The food is really greasy and just gross. I got a curry soup that I thought was safe as a vegan but then I think I had a chicken bone in it so I stopped eating. Veggies beware!
