WOW!  Dalie's is, hands down, the best cheesesteak in Philly! When I first moved to Philadelphia, one of the first things I made sure to do was try Pat's and Geno's to figure out which camp I wanted to join.  My wife is from the area, and taught me the proper lingo for ordering to avoid ridicule.  I was rather underwhelmed--they were okay, but these were the originals!  They're legendary!  Obviously, I had built them up in my head WAY beyond reasonable expectations. Dalessandro's, on the other hand, is good, good food.  Not just cheesesteaks--although those are awesome.  No, you've got to sample the entire menu.  You cannot go wrong here.  The people who work here are some of the most pleasant people I've met.  So in summary: Food:  Great! Service: Awesome! So, if you're in the Roxborough/Manayunk area and you're in the mood for cheesesteaks, look so further.
