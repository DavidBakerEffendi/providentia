I have to agree with Andrew G,  the Glenwood diner is very consistent,  which is the hallmark of a solid diner. Breakfast is a sure fire bet,  I'm a fan of the 3x3, your choice of (3) pancakes or French Toast  served with 3 eggs served with American cheese, and a choice of sausage, bacon or Taylor Ham (a NJ staple). Because the hours here are in sync with the train, I've only been here for breakfast, if it were a 24hr diner, I would have been here many more times,  it's also my complaint about the train schedule or the bus schedule here in under-served Bloomfield... But I digress,  if you want to be OVER-served,  try an abundant breakfast and fantastic coffee served by the attentive lovely waitresses of the Glenwood diner.
