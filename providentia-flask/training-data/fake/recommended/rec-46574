Mama's is really the best around.  There is a line, but it moves quickly.  I got the Latke sandwich, spicy on a wheat pita.  Everything on it is very fresh and tasty. I'm not a vegetarian by any means and I like my bacon wrapped in bacon, but this is really good and filling.  For six bucks you can't beat the amount you receive and the quick, freindly service is a plus as well.  Everyone walking in the place has a pleasant demeanor because they know the food will satisfy their hunger pains.  Even with the lines there is usually a place to sit and eat or you could easily walk four blocks to the river.  Did I mention, it's six bucks!!  Awesome!!
