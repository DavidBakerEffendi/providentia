The rating is for lunch.  I was assigned to the school across the street for a week to grade state exams.  My coworkers and I went to Puerto Viejo every day!  The sandwiches are unbelievable.  Try the Completo and the Cubano.  Their Cuban sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.  The service is a little slow, but they make up for the slowness with the high quality of food and warm smiles from the staff.  The Cafe con Leche is wonderful.  You cannot beat the prices in New York.  Finally, I really like the ambiance: it's contemporary without kitsch; Latin without cliche. This place is so good that it makes the trek off the beaten path well worth it.   Make a point to go to Brooklyn and enjoy Puerto Viejo!
