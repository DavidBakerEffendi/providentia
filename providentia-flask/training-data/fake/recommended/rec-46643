Delicious, cheap, fast and [mostly] healthy. Best falafel I've had in Philly. They make it Â to order, so it's piping hot and delicious. $3.50 gets you a (huge) half falafel sandwich on whole-wheat pita. Yum yum. The thought of this place makes me miss Philly *sniff sniff*. Staff is so friendly, too.
