I've reviewed several ramen places - its my favorite dish for almost any occasion - and it shares a special place in my repertoire of dishes I'd go out of my way to try.  No two ramen are the same - and it shows dedication in preparation.   My date and I had tried to go here on a weekend - 2 hour wait as usual, so we had gone elsewhere.  So, we chose a weekday for this meal - we had a 40 minute wait, so we went to The Brew House across the street and had a pint.  Ippudo Westside has a busy atmosphere, the runway-style middle table bustling with servers and dishes - the turnover in this place is fast.  However, I didn't feel too overwhelmed - the place is kept small, but not claustrophobic.   We ordered some sake and some appetizers - the raw octopus and pork buns.  Both appetizers were delicious, though the raw octopus can be a bit overpowered by the wasabi.  Our ramen - as expected - was good.  The broth was light and refined - contextually complimentary and soothing.  The pork was thin, but dry - not characteristic - and not a good choice.  The noodles tasted fresh - wheat, without any stale taste or bad texture.   You're probably wondering why I give this place 3 stars.  At the end of the pleasant night, we had a tidy bill, but I kept wondering what made this place better than other ramen places?  Ramen, to me, needs to be unique - I want some rough edges - I want some experimentation.  I'm not looking for quirky or zany ramen - what is needed is the taste of realness in it.  What we had tasted was too refined - and safe.  I still recommend this place, but I'd go here once and then find cheaper ramen elsewhere - this place's menu is crafted around this experience, but it isn't a place I'd go for my fix of ramen.  Nothing surprised me here.
