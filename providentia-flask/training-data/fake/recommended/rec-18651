My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place because if it's good enough for Anthony Bourdain, then it's good enough for us! We got the wings first, which we thought were excellent. I've never tasted that combination of flavors, so there's nothing I can really compare it to. They were sweet, salty, bitter, and spicy all with one bite. Would highly recommend. I got the mussels dish with a broken crepe, eggs, and bean sprouts. The mussels tasted really fresh and there were a lot. My boyfriend ordered the spicy boar's collar, which he loved. It was pretty spicy though (I wouldn't have been able to eat the whole thing), so just a fair warning! We didn't get dessert because we were trying to catch a concert in Manhattan, but I did get the house-made pineapple shot as a meal-ender, and it was GREAT. Equal balance of boozy and fruity. Also, for people worried about the wait. We got there around 5 on a Friday. We were first in line (they don't open until 5:30), but the line started forming shortly after we got there. When we left around 6:30-7, I don't believe there was a wait yet for smaller parties. If going with a big group, your entire group must be there before you can be seated.
