Didn't know what to expect but the place exceeded expectations. 5 Reasons to go: 1. The trout is exceptional and the accompanying garnish and veggies are wonderful. 2. The meatloaf sandwich is an A++ 3. The jalapeno bacon cornbread is tasty as hell. This coming from someone who generally despises cornbread. 4. Excellent service plus fairly reasonable prices. 5. The orgasmic chocolate bread pudding. I've been trying to hit most of the top restaurants in Williamsburg and this place is one of the best. All five of us who came for dinner loved the food.
