This place is amazing. I read reviews so we decided to skip appettizers and order three pastas. They were SO delicious. Clearly freshly made pasta which fresh ingredients and good cream. The tagliatelle ragu is top notch, perhaps a bit salty but depends on what you like. So we were loving our three pastas when all of a sudden they bring out a fourth one and say 'we made a mistake and one of the pastas we brought you was not what you ordered so this is on the house' UH delicious mistake. But anyway this pasta was some sort of ball with truffled mushrooms inside. AMAZING. One very minor critique - not crazy about the wine list, which is mostly (is not all) Italian wines. I am a big lover of California wines so. The Pinot Nero was pretty good though. Service was great and the decor is beautiful and romantic but it does get loud in the pm so don't like, propose here. Definitely would come back.
