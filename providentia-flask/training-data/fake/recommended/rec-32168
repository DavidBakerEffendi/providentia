Two of us went here over the weekend, and man, what a waste.  We ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box and vegetarian bibimbap, hoping to get a sampling of both types of cuisines on offer.  The food was mediocre at best... the salmon was tasty, but my dining partner was sick with stomach issues the rest of the weekend, and the bibimbap was just a bunch of vegetables (well, lettuce and sprouts) and tofu thrown into a big plastic bowl.  No heated stone bowl, no crusty rice on the bottom (no rice at all, actually), no egg sitting on top getting cooked by the rest of the piping hot food... it was not bibimbap to me.  Save your money and eat elsewhere.
