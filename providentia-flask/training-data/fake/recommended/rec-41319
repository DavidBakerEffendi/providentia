Grilled veggies here were super tasty - clean flavors, small portions. My favorite dish was the salmon and salmon roe kamameshi (rice cooked to perfection in an earthenware pot, flavored with salty roe and salmon). And made a great Japanese beer find - Baird Rising Sun Pale Ale. I've been looking for it everywhere since!
