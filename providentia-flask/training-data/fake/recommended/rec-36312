My girlfriend and I spend a week in NYC to enjoy the downtown life.  For Easter we decided to try our luck at getting into the legendary Balthazar's in SoHo to enjoy Brunch.  Realizing it was a long shot from what I read online about the waiting list, we  ventured in with a hopeful outlook.  Of course, we were both very nice (as always) when we entered...and dressed very nice as well, since it was Easter.  The young lady at the door told me it would be about a 2 hour wait since we didn't have a reservation.  Immediately, the Maitre D (Will) looked at us both and asked us to please enjoy a quick drink at the bar or just wait a few and he would get us a table in 5 minutes.  My girlfriend and I looked at each other in amazement!  Will had just made a NYC dream come true for us.....Brunch at Balthazar's!!  We eagerly wait off to the side, and within 1 minute, Will escorts us my girlfriend and I to a wonderful table, and wishes us a "Very Happy Easter!".  Needless to say the food and drinks were every bit of legendary stature that we've all read about!  During the meal, Will walked around by our table and noticed us admiring the Easter Flowers that were planted in the restaurant, so he stopped and talked to us for a few minutes about the flowers and the professional florist that is used by the restaurant.  Simply amazing attention and service by Will!!  The food we always knew was legendary......now my girlfriend and I will always talk about how legendary the Maitre D ~ Will ~ is at Balthazar's!!  We both love NYC and will be visiting once or twice a year.....so we most certainly hope to see Will again, and enjoy that outstanding food and service!!!
