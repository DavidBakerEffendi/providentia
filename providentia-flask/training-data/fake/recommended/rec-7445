This restaurant is amazing.  Not only is the food delicious but the atmosphere and service is fantastic. I had the Roasted Mushrooms to start and even my friend who typically cannot stand mushrooms enjoyed it.  For my main course I had the Oriecchiette which is on some list as one of the pastas you must have in NYC.  It was good but too salty for my taste.  I also had a bite of my friend's Roasted Chicken which was very well prepared.  By far the best part of the meal was dessert, we shared the Hazelnut Chocolate Torta, which was basically a deconstructed Ferrero Rocher.  It was the perfect way to end the meal.
