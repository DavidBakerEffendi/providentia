Food selection is spot on and the coffee is decent. They have exactly what I'm craving on a Saturday/Sunday morning: bagels, sandwiches, smoothies and more. I had a bagel with chive cream cheese, which they give you on the side so you can spread the amount you please. It was really good! previously I have had the chicken salad sandwich which was also very good. You don't pay for your food until your about to leave which is a little awkward considering it is a coffee shop. A great place to do work except the internet is a little wonky. But the space is a nice light green and usually has artwork up from a previous art opening. The staff is generally friendly except for the male barista I had to deal with (major 'tud).
