My yelpers didn't do me wrong on this recommendation. Woohoo!  The cheeseburger was delicious!  Ginger martini was also a tasty treat.  Crowded when we got there but we got a nice little booth in the back that was great for people watching with a short wait thanks to an OpenTable reservation I booked about an hour ahead.  Handy no?  Ambience was nice.  Lots of good looking peeps with their extremely well dressed offspring having brunch here on a Sunday around 2 pm.  My kind of place.
