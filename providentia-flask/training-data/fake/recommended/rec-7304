I live a 10 minute walk away from Austin Street and the neighborhood has needed a place like this for a while. Great craft beer selection with what seems to be a focus on NY breweries, which I can appreciate. The menu is definitely unique, and nothing like anything else Austin St. Favorites so far are the Picked Pepper Wings and the Sweet Potato Fries that come with some kind of maple syrup dipping sauce. I also really enjoyed the fried pickle and brisket croquet. Service is super friendly, but would love a beer/liquor nerd to talk me through the choices. Great addition to the neighborhood.
