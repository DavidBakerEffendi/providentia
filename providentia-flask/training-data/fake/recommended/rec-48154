The best gyro in Morris County!!  I love this place, everything i have every tried is great. The gyro is filled with fresh cut meat.  There is more meat than lettuce unlike other places.  There kabobs, chicken wings and appetizers are great.  You can NOT beat the price either.  There is not a lot of tables, but you can usually sit down, since most people do take out.  Owners are great.  Butcher shop in the back, meat is cut to order.
