So worth the visit. I live right by it and only just tried the restaurant out. To be completely honest, I wasn't so sure at first. There is always a crowd so I knew there had to be something good about it. But the decor threw me off a bit. Way over the top. Not sure if they want to be Mediterranean, or artsy modern. And then Christmas decorations awkwardly arranged. But then the food happened. And I was sold. This is where the love and care goes, into the food, which really is as it should be. Wonderful kabab meat (great consistency and just a little crispy on the edges). Meze sampler plate was a hit. And to top it all off - the baklava was to die for. Absolutely smooth and the perfect blend of dough and pistachio and sugar. Paired with some strawberries and an espresso on the side... heaven.
