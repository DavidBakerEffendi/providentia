I am kicking myself...literally I am beating myself up! I think I have bruises.... Why? Because I work at 55th and 5th and yesterday was the first time I visted this mecca of street food. I did not know chicken and rice could be this good. My mouth is salivating just imagining the perfectly seasoned tender chunks of meat...the glorious white sauce...the oh' so hot "hot sauce". Not only is the food the best street food in town... but the guys running the cart are extremely nice, super fast and they charge next to nothing for a meal. Now that I know what I have been missing out on...expect to see me several times a week chowing down next to the cart. Anyone want to meet up for a little dinner date???
