Summary: standard Chinese style buffet. They have a wide variety to choose from, but the quality of the food is just ok... I'd rather go to Minado buffet - but then again that's Japanese style and a bit more pricey. You get what you pay for here. Food: typical Chinese food. I'd recommend the fried donut if you have a sweet tooth. Not much variety in the sushi department and not sure if it's necessarily fresh... I've never had food issues here though so it's fresh enough! Haha. Place is good for groups or just a couple of friends. I always see family's here as well. Not much more to say on this place, but let me know if you have any questions!
