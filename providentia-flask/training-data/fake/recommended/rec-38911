When asking a car rental employee what they would recommend to tourist types, they may offer up Al's French Frys (yes, with a Y). Don't be fooled by the name, they fry up burgers and such too. The table is even set with a bottle of white vinegar instead of ketchup, is it for dipping or cleaning? I observed the locals and only found salters. A mystery for the next time! Classic burger and fries joint, nothing palate shattering but solid comfort food.
