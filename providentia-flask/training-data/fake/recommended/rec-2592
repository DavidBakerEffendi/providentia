I must say, I was disappointed with my first ever cheesesteak! It was a coin flip between Geno's and Pat's, and the line at Geno's was longer (I know, sounds strange, but I figured if there are more people in line, it's better?). I've been told that it's standard cheesesteak protocol to be rushed through the line at lightning speed, but as a first-timer, I didn't know how to order and was yelled at! English-only sticker aside, I definitely don't speak Cheesesteak. I'm not sure what I was expecting exactly, but I figured that the poor customer service would be balanced out by a seriously phenomenal sandwich. It wasn't. Le sadness.
