I wanted to like Uva.  It was very attractive and packed with lots of diners screaming at each other over their meals because it is LOUD in there.  Okay, we thought, we'll sit in the back garden.  It looked beautiful and surely, quieter.  Nope.  We shouted our order to our server.  Our brushetta was excellent but things went downhill.  Our next course, carpaccio with pickled mushrooms, was just okay.  The mushrooms overpowered.  My companion had sole, which was overcooked, for his entree.  I had the special-meatball ravioli.  The meatball component of the dish was very flavorful but the pasta was unevenly cooked.  We didn't have dessert as we were eager to return to the relative quiet of 2nd Ave.  With the vast array of choices in NYC, next time we are in the mood for Italian, we'll try some place else.
