Beautiful room. Had an early brunch and the food came out very quickly. Server forgot our French toast bites and didn't really rectify properly, but we were full from having ordered the donuts to start as well...  Pumpkin donut was the highlight.  I had the poached eggs with avocado toast - just okay.  Would definitely try dinner there.
