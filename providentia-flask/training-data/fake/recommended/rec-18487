I loved this place. Was definitely skeptical when my friend suggested, mostly because of the name. Vegetarians don't be weary!! Delicious veggie meatballs available! I got the veggie meatballs with the pesto and the kitchen sink salad. Honestly one of the best salads I've ever had. So good, so many flavors. They also have really cheap Gansets which is always fantastic, but when I went I splurged on some sort of whiskey ginger beer with lime, and it was really good. The only reason I chose 4 instead of 5 stars was because the veggie meatballs were a little dry/ maybe overlooked. But overall delicious. Also the ambience is just so chill. Great playlist, cool community seating. Highly recommend.
