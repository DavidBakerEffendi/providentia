I view this on a spectrum as I've practically tried all the pinoy restaurants in NYC and the boroughs. On one hand you have your Cendrillon: tries to be fancy, nice interior, nice location (soho) - but in the process completely looses its authenticity - basically non-filipino dishes with filipino names. On the other, you have the likes of Ihawan way out in Queens, that dirty litty strip on Roosevelt ave - unappealing on the inside (or even outside for that matter) with its glaring flourescents and bare white walls Â --- but tastes pretty much like what you expect (and miss so much). Grill 21 is the middle of the two. The food is good, as "authentic" as you can hope a thousand miles away from home, and in a decent, almost cute little setting. I enjoyed in particular the bicol express (but that's just me - I like greasy stuff) but I haven't been disappointed with any of the selections. As people have said, it is a small place but that's forgivable. If I were to take someone unfamiliar with Pinoy food somewhere, Grill 21 would probably be my first choice before hauling them out to Queens where the real stuff is at. But overall, definitely a great place to get your fix for all the usual pinoy fare.
