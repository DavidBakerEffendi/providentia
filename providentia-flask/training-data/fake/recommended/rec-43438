what is all the hype about this place?!? there was a line a mile long at 3am. i saw 3 other halal carts before seeing this one... ALL EMPTY. next time... i'm going to give them a try because i don't know what the big deal about this particular one was. i know... people swear that this one is the best.... psshhhh. ok ok... it's not BAD... but seriously it's not Â THAT good. i'm mean... if you want some cheap eats in the middle of the night then yes... it's a good option (i'd take white castle anyday over this place). however... it didn't make me do cartwheels. the chicken is bland and dry. you can drench it with the special white and red sauce which made it better but i still wasn't impressed. btw... the red sauce if FREAKIN SPICY! they do give you a lot of food though... which is always a plus. but i'm still trying to figure out why people rave about this cart? i guess i didn't have enough drinks that night.
