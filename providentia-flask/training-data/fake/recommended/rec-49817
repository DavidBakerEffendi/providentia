If I drank wine, I'm sure this place could have easily been a five instead of a four. The waitress seemed to be quite knowledgeable about the wine selection, using buzzwords like "nutty" and "aromatic". Still, we came for the food. Risotto balls were quite nice, but I wish they came with more than half a dozen. We enjoyed some of their tapas, most of which were served on a tray that came with this delicious toasted cinnamon-raisin bread, crispy and fresh grapes, and a honeycomb, which complimented the bread incredibly well. We had the prosciutto di parmesan, which was tasty, but if you want prosciutto, order the prosciutto. We also tried the duck salami, which was also very good, but again, such a small portion (especially for two people sharing). The Vermont sharp cheddar cheese, however, was the saving grace of the dish. It had that distinct Vermont flavor and a solid-yet-creamy, melt-in-your-mouth texture that made me wish I had more! We also sampled the pork tacos (sans cabbage), which were pretty good, but the juice from the pickled carrots on the side seeped into the tortilla and made it a bit soggy. Nix those when you order; otherwise, very very good. Atmosphere was pleasant. We sat on the dining room side, which was fairly quiet. The bar side seemed trendy. Most important, however, were the enormity and cleanliness of the bathrooms. We got there around 630p on a Friday night (made reservations, you should, too) and it wasn't extremely crowded, but as it got closer to 8, the place got fairly packed. Not too loud, though, which was nice. Conducive to decent conversation. I'll definitely come back sometime.
