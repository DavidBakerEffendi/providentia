Outstanding in every way. Each dish was better than the last, from the thinly sliced & battered pan fried eggplant, to the grape leaves (piping hot) stuffed with spicy rice & ground sausage to the succulent rack of lamb. We asked our lovely & funny waiter to pick a nice bottle of white wine & he came back with a bottle from Santorini that was perfect & a great value too. The vibe is dreamy & the food doesn't disappoint. I live in the neighborhood & think this is one of the best restaurants in the East Village... No small feat!
