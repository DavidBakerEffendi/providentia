I just finished the leftovers from last nights meal. The shrimp étouffée is one of the best things I have eaten in some time. I don't say that lightly It was wonderfully spiced and full of flavor. I enjoyed the conch. The fried goat was good but not something I'd get again. Black rice was tasty, veggie app platter was fun and filling for two. My wife couldn't wait to eat the leftover Mac and cheese. She liked it very much. The soup and salad that came with the meal were both well done. Our servers were incredible. Luis, our waiter, gave us great descriptions and suggestions about the food. Another woman refilled our glasses with water or the classy six pack of hard cider brought in with us. Oh, how I love BYOB! The woman who greeted us at the door was friendly and lovely. Everyone who interacted with us was pleasant and I wish it were a dingy dump so I could afford to eat there all the time. I will have to get back there soon.
