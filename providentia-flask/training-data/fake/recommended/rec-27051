4 stars for keeping it real decade after decade. I been coming here for as long as I can remember. Actually I remember the greasy flimsy thin pies coming out the oven and the cans of root beer I would get as a toddler. 30 years later its still the same ole reservoir. A little change up on the ambience and maybe a few more entrees (or I didn't care about that when I was young) but I did have the Chicken Murphy and it was delicious. Many child hood family memories from here. I hope it remains as it's still a staple in South Â Orange, and their are still so many in the area that have no clue that it even exists.
