Jury duty in the cold NYC winter meant only one thing - I could finally grab a cheap weekday lunch in Chinatown! Entrees here sell for as cheap as $5 a bowl for the basic vegetable & egg noodle soup. I ordered the #1 House Special Noodle Soup, only $7.25 for a delicious bowl of knife cut noodles, ox tail, beef tendon, tripe, beef slices, and a fried egg. I wish the egg was more over-easy, but the tendon and beef slices were great. The noodles were also too soft for my liking, but I think that's a matter of preference. The older generation of Chinese people just really like their noodles soft, but I need that al dente texture. The noodle shop keeps a container of cilantro on every table, and I was not shy about shoveling spoonfuls and spoonfuls of the herb into my beef broth. The broth is on the lighter side and one of the better broths I've had in Chinatown. When you order, you have the option to get hand-pulled, knife cut, or rice noodles. Definitely try the knife cut noodles - I love the irregular length and texture of the noodles. If you sit near the kitchen you can see the chef slapping the dough against the table and pulling the dough into long noodle strands. What's the secret ingredient to making that springy, chewy Chinese noodles? "Jian shui" ("kan sui in Canto), aka lye water, is high in alkaline and gives the dough that yellow, chewy texture. It toughens up the dough and gives it that nice firmness. If you make noodles at home though and decide to add in lye water, be careful!! Lye, depending on the concentration, can cause severe burning or blindness. An easier alternative is to use dehydrated baking soda instead of lye. I had no idea they had seating downstairs until I saw a group of 10 magically disappear behind me. Next time I'm trying the pan fried noodles.
