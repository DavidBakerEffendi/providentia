Okay, so Here's the deal...This place is good for Margarita's (during Happy Hour 5-7, they are 415/pitcher) and nachos (we always do veggie)...if you are looking for anything else.Stop. turn around and leave...go elsewhere...but if what you want is a cheap pitcher of Margarita's and some nachos...then sit, stay awhile...heck...order a second pitcher and plate of nachos....but that's all folks...are you listening...nothing else...nothing! NACHOS and MARGARITAS...
