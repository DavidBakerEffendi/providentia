Great dinner tonight.  2nd time here and again was not disappointed.  My wife ordered the linguini with clams which although was not on the menu, was encouraged by waiter who said any favorite could be accommodated.  I had the linguini with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, arugata with a light tomato sauce.  The fried calamari was delicious especially with the spicy marinara sauce.  It's pricey and steered way from some of the other dishes that looked yummy but maybe next time.
