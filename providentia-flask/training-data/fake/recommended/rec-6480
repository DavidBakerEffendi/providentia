Many days over the past few years, I've walked by the large windows of Market Table, pearing inside and thinking, that place looks pretty great...Well, I finally went inside! The atmosphere was cozy and inviting.  We had a reservation for 2 but they were quick to accomodate a change to 3 people.  Unfortunately, we were seated to a large party, whose loud banter tended to overwhelm the intimate setting.   Vino was chosen based on a recommendation from our waitress after our choice was not available; it was below our price point and was a decent bottle but maybe not on par with what we were looking for. Now, let's focus on the food.  The menu was fantastic and picking out just a few dishes required some discussion.  We ended up sharing: Warm octopus salad: warm, flavorful and delicious with fresh-tasting, non-chewy octopus. Homemade cavatelli: the sauce was too creamy for my taste and the pasta wasn't up to the homemade level of places like Scarpetta, but the mushrooms were delish! Brussell sprouts: Yum.  Brussell sprouts and bacon are something that would be hard to screw up and fortunately, MT did not! Pork chop: nicely cooked, loved the slaw on top and was obsessed with the spaghetti squash (why does this not end up on more menus??) Short ribs: tasty but the meat seemed less flavorful than expected.  My dining companions polished this off happily! Pear and cranberry crumble: fantastic!  ice cream was creamy, delicious and perfect with the sweet fruit and crunchy crumble. Overall, a great meal in a really lovely atmosphere.  Service was on point.
