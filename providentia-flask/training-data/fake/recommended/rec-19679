Sorry, I have to be the downer here. I ordered Pad See Ew with chicken and the chicken and shrimp shumai from Seamless. As others have said, delivery was insanely fast, which was great. Unfortunately, I found that the Pad See Ew was relatively flavorless and the chicken was dry. Also, I had high hopes for the shumai but found part of a shrimp shell in one of them and some inedible pieces of chicken in another. Not great surprises. I will definitely order from them again as they clearly have potential and perhaps I just caught them on an "off" night. I am also looking forward to trying the lunch special. Glad to see some variety in the neighborhood!
