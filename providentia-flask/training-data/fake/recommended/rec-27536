yes. I love this place. I have been here multiple times and enjoyed the heck out of my experience each time. It hits all of my 5 star particulars. Incredible value for the price, excellent service, and wonderfully tasting food. This place rocks. My favorite is an iced coffee and a #8 roasted pork bahn mi.
