Great atmosphere and such an amazing variety of gourmet pizzas along with a few other interesting dishes. Staff is super knowledgable of what they are selling and very easy on the eyes. It adds a touch of class to your usual rustic pizzeria! Now for the food! The Bean Pur√©e Soup! Outstanding is the word that comes to mind. My Sausage and Fennel Pizza was spectacular in taste and had quite a nice kick. A wonderful place to dine!
