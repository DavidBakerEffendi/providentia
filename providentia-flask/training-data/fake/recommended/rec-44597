I'm always looking for great places to go before a Broadway matinee and this seemed to be the perfect spot for that AND celebrating my birthday. There are so many great things on the menu but since we were only two people, we ordered the Seafood Tower and figured that would be enough.  It sure was.  It's designed for 4, but two hungry people can get through it. It costs around $160 and what you get are oyster shooters, a whole lobster, 2 king crab legs, mixed ceviche, salmon brulee (raw salmon layered with sour cream scallops and brulleed brown sugar on top), scallop ceviche, shrimp cocktails, 3 kinds of oysters and clams on the half shell. Note it takes about 30 minutes to prepare so getting an appetizer or 2 is a good idea if you're in a part of 4 or more. The place has only been open a month so there's not even a sign out front but the address numbers are big and easy to find.
