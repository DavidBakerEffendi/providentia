Honestly, it is hard to rate this noodle house.  There are people out there that will rate this place based on quality but not factor in the cheap cost.  I will admit i have been here more than 5 times.  So what does that mean?  Good ? Bad? If you are looking for a cheap college meal then this is for you!   If you wouldnt mind spending an extra $2 and getting something that will make your pallet happy then venture somewhere else.   The ramen is lightly better than the kind your find at the asian markets.  The chicken is super dry so I would recommend beef / pork.   Open late so if you taste buds are a little tipsy or have a case of beer goggles then go ahead do it!
