So on my first night in phili, I came here with my friends after we had dinner in chinatown.  Not that this place was of the beaten path, but its kinda of tucked in a little corner off one of the smaller streets.  I thought this place was a great little find that my friends have been coming here for years.  We sat at the bar since we were here primarily for the drinks.  What I really like about the place was their variety of stouts and dark beers.  I tried the sweet sampler which came with a flight of three of the stouts.  I remember they had funny names, I think one was called a moo-hoo which was a chocolate stout, the second was an oatmeal stout, and the third was an expresso stout.  All three were very good but becuase all the beers were very full body in flavor, it was hard to distinguish the suttle flavor notes after awhile.  Another drink that one of my friends got was a beer milkshake.  Now usually im not a big dairy fan but the blend of the two flavors actually complimented each other.  It was a totally unique drink combination. Now i know this is a little stupid but i really liked the fact that they had coat hooks under the bar in front of each chair.  Since im from cali, you usually dont thnk of those kind of things.  I totally missed the point at first when I was trying to find a place to put my jacket, until I asked one of my friends what they did with theirs.
