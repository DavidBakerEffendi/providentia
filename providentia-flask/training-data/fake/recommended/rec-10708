My Husband & I took my Aunt & Uncle who came from Toronto here.  Based on reviews we thought we give it a try. The waiter talked us into the prefix menu.  The place was small and tight and felt as if you were on top of other tables, a bit uncomfortable!! The waiter has 5 other tables and it was ANNOYING that when we asked a question he would "brush" us off and go to the next table.  The pasta was o.k. and some of the appetizers were a bit overpriced for 1 piece of Mozzarella Carozza (My FAV) by the way!! Not impressed.
