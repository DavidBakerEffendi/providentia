I just hosted my fiancé's surprise birthday party at Jadis and we were beyond happy! Edit was so helpful with the arrangements months in advance and she and Maya took such good care of us and our 35 or so guests! The food was great, the ambience was perfect, music not to loud and service was great!  All of our guests were so impressed with everything! I would do all of my parties there!!!  Thank you Jadis, Edit and Maya for making our night just perfect!
