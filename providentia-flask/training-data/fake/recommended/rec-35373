Definitely great.  I had the berkshire tenderloin katsu and it was wonderfully soft.  They have what seems house made tonkatsu sauce and goma dressing that is a welcome improvement over the bottled stuff I usually use here in the states.  After living in japan, this place definitely made me feel like I was back in japan.  Great presentation and a wonderful lunch for me.  I don't usually give 5 stars but this place really hit the spot for lunch.  Pricey, but berkshire pork is expensive to begin with so thats fine.
