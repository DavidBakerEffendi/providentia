I was visiting Philadelphia over the Thanksgiving weekend, and went to Knock the evening of November 28th.  As soon as I entered, I knew I had found a great place.  I was greated warmly by the maitre d' and seated at banquette table with a great view of the whole restaurant.  The decor was a bit more formal than I was expecting, but that wasn't a bad thing-in fact, it gave the restaurant a lot of ambience, and while it was elegant, it was also very comfortable (and casual).  My waiter was friendly and competent, and the meal was very good.  Small detail but very impressive:  Usually bars and restaurants will service martinis in glasses that are on the thick side.  The pomegranite martini I ordered came in a very nice, thin-rimmed/lipped martini glass.  Very elegant. The maitre d' stopped by and chatted for a bit (very nice), and the owner, Woody, said hello and made sure that I was satisfied with everything.  After I was done with dinner and dessert, I wanted to go to the bar to have a drink.  The maitre d' had a seat ready for me, and had instructed the bartender to get me a drink.  That's service. I had a great time, and I would recommend Knock to anyone.
