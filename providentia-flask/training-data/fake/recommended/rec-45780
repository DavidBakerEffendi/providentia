Don't come here if u want PUBIC HAIR in your food! I will never come back to this pf changs again! Overly loud and crowded, waitress had an unruly and unkept appearance to be serving our food. I was seriously disgusted about my experience. Every other pf chang restaurant I've been to has never dissappointed me. But this place is definitely dirty!
