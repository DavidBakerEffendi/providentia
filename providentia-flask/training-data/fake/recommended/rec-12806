I have see so many reviews of people having to wait 2+ hours for a table and that was definitely not the case when I went- maybe I got lucky! We arrived for breakfast and waited no more than 15 mins for a table! :-) I was so excited to eat here and devour their famous pancakes! Didn't even have to look at the menu because I had already knew what I wanted! I ordered the Blueberry Pancakes with Maple Butter and my sister ordered their Chocolate chunk pancakes! PERFECTION, people, PER-FEC-TION! So thick and fluffy! And that warm maple butter pairs with the blueberry pancakes perfectly! My sister loved her pancakes as well, they were delicious! Definitely a breakfast spot you must try when in the city!!
