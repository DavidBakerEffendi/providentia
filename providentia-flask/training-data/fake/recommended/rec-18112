Just so you know, I now eat a chicken chaat from Mood Cafe at least once a week. They are so amazing and unlike anything I have ever experienced before. I would attempt to describe a chaat as "Indian Nachos". It is crispy chips, chick peas and potatoes topped with fruit, nuts, sauces, fresh herbs and chicken. The flavor is ADDICTING! :) The samosas and lassis are also fantastic. Thank you Mood Cafe for introducing me to my new favorite food!
