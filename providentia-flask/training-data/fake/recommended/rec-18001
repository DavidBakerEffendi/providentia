At $118 (including tax and tip) for a Saturday night pre-theatre dinner for two, this place really delivered.  We arrived ten minutes late to a 6:15pm reservation and the place was packed but the hostess got us seated in about 8 minutes. My first impression was this place is disorganized because of all the people waiting.  I was wrong.   We were seated upstairs and it is amazing how much space there was.  They could have easily crammed in more tables.  Decor is not elegant but it has a smart, almost steakhouse feel (lots of wood).  Service was outstanding; the employees really acted like they cared about the place. Water glasses were tended to.  Food came quick!! The food was pretty damn good for the prices they were charging.  A "hit-the-spot" kind of place.  The gnocchi (eggplant, tomato, mozzarella) was some of the best I've ever had.  The seafood risotto was delicious and not too salty like other places.  Free (warm) bread and olives for the table.  Caesar salad was crisp and flavourful.  Flan dessert was a steal at $8.  Beers and wine were reasonably priced.   In sum, the reviews are all warranted.  This is not a place for foodies or a "hidden gem" but it's honest Italian that you can truly look forward to before a show without breaking the bank.
