I am not local but I do come to Philly for biz trip almost 6 7 times a year and whenever I am staying over 2 nights I come here with my co workers to eat one. I have to say Geno's is not the best but its a fun experience for tourist. Locals can argue all you want on who has the best cheese steak but for out of towners like us we come to Geno's or Pats because they are the best known to us. Both Geno's and Pats are on the same level so no matter which one you try you will be back for more. I think one of the reason Geno is more famous is because of the order in english only thing and I think the bright orange outside. Anyway try it once and i f you don't like it just move on to others. As far as service you will have to just to deal with their mean attitude, don't let it ruined your experience. enjoy! For parking, I have been here during lunch time, dinner time, weekends, travel season....etc parking is not that hard to find just circle around you will find one.
