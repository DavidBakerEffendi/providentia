The first or second restaurant I come to when I visit New York. I've told all my friends about it, but none of them ever go. Losers! I don't mind sharing tables, or the wait. The dumplings are the reason to go (just say "one crab" or "one pork" when you sit down, and they'll know what you mean and bring you a steaming basket of soup dumpings). Sure, we usually end up eating several orders of them, but we pace ourselves since cold dumplings are no good. I also like their Shanghai style noodles and onion pancakes. Warning, the soup is hot and will burn you! You will need to be careful or you will lose your taste buds for the rest of the night. As I walk through Chinatown I like to tear my eyes from the bustling street scene and look up at the old New York architecture.
