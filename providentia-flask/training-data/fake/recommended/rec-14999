I went to Rex 1516 for the first time this past Sunday and can say the food and drinks were wonderful!  The place is small, yet larege enough that you aren't listening to everyone's conversation.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was amazing; she definately takes making drinks as a creative process and it shows.  Delicious mint juleps!! We enjoyed the shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy and the goat cheese cheesecake. The only compliant that I had was that my biscuits and gravy could of been a bit warmer when they arrived. Great lil spot worth checking out.  I will be back to try out the dinner menu.
