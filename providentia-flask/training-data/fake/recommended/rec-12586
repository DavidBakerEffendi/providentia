This place was amazing. You expect to wait at least an hour to be seated but when you do it is like winning a golden ticket. Three of us went on Thursday morning already with an idea in our head of what we were ordering. Between the three of us we ordered the blueberry pancakes, banana French toast, omelette, both bacons, onion rings, fried green tomatoes, grits, and rosemary sausage. Least enjoyed plate was the omelette, I hadn't had any but the person who did said it left a bit to the imagination. It was done French style with the egg cooked and stuffed like a crepe. The bananas in the bananas French toast could've been cooked a bit longer but over all well done. The pancakes were the sure fire winner. In fact we were upset we all didn't get one of each style. All the sides were amazing as well. I lived the onion rings, very flaky and light and not dripping with oil. I would highly suggest coming here. Now they don't accept reservations but you can drop in and put your name on the list and they will text you when the table is ready.
