French brasserie hedonists take note: It doesn't get any better than this. This is still one of my top three favorite restaurants in NYC. Everything here is premiere classe, from the friendly, knowledgeable service to the beautiful clientele to the oysters to the wine list to the steak au poivre (which is better than that at any steakhouse in town, by the way). And the warm chocolate cake dessert ought to be illegal. The irony is that Paris wishes it had a place like this.
