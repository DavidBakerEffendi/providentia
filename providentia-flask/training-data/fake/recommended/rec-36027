Solid, solid, solid Mediterranean food! Very interesting wine menu with some great lesser known varietals. Everything on the menu looked DELICIOUS. Dimly lit and cozy. Great for dates and dinners with small groups (4-5). From start to finish, just a great meal. Will be back! Tip: If you don't opt for one of their stellar entrees, 4 small plates are enough for 2 people. However, I'd count the delicious combination platter as 2 plates because of its size.The moussaka was amazing as well!
