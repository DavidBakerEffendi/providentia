Mamoun's makes a solid falafel, but I don't think it's the "best" in the city. Try a place like Taim, or even the original Moshe's falafel cart if you want a really great falafel in NYC. The main reason I go here (and everyone else I know) really has to do with the price. This place is CHEAP. Service is good. But to be completely honest I find their falafel pretty bland, and they are very limited in the toppings department. I'll have to try their shwarma, but as far as the falafel go, it's good for the price but certainly not my favorite. So basically, Â go here if you want a decent, cheap falafel, (and you're willing to wait on line for it) but if you're looking for the best, search elsewhere.
