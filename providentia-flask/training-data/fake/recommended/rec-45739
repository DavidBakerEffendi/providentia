Potatopia is not only fun to say but it's fun to eat at, too!  There are tons of potato options to choose from; mashed, smashed, backed, fried, curly.  Then you choose toppings like meat, vegetables, cheeses and sauces!  It seriously sounds too good to be true but I can assure you that it is.  It cane hard to find a good baked potato in the city outside of a high priced steakhouse.  But, Potatopia delivers a delicious one with the topics that you want.  Did I mention they have bacon?!!  The only downfall with this place is that after you eat your potato, you feel REALLY full.  I recommend eating here for dinner.  Oh, and there is very limited seating so don't plan to meet a big group of friends there and hope you can all sit together.  When the weather gets warmer, it would be nice to grab a potato, fill it with your topics and then walk to Washington Square Park and enjoy the yumminess outside near the fountain!  Can't wait!
