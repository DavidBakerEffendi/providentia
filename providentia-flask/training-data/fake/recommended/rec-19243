I've never had a falafel before so I can't compare taste to other places but, wow! The sauce was delicious and the falafel had great crunch and flavor. It created just the right amount of mess that every good meal should have. Enough to let any passerby know I was thoroughly enjoying it but not enough to deter me from ever ordering it again. Very reasonably priced and pleasant staff.
