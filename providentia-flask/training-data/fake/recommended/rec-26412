Not a bad Italian joint but for the city it just isn't anything special. Met there with a few buddies for a dinner. We had a margherita pizza pie which was very heavy on the sauce but nonexistent with the mozzarella and basil... weak. Service was kind of wimpy too as I had to repeatedly ask for more water. However, the chef redeems himself with some decent pasta.. although the sauce was a bit over creamy.
