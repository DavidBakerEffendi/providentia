Craving for Mexican can really, really, real. Was even willing to travel for some decent food. It was late afternoon and still packed with people and waited to be seated. We were sat in a communal table, but with barely room for space. The 2 parties adjacent to us were nice people but can imagine how close an annoying neighbor can be. Also slightly loud so don't expect a semi private audible conversation. Grapefruit Margarita: Was the special for the night and did not taste like grapefruit at all. Even the friends next to us agreed taste like pear. It had a tangy spicy salt rim but it was fun to lick. Chicken Quesadilla: It looked like a big empanada, quickly saddened expecting it to be bigger. We ordered a side of guac, the quesadilla was unmemorable but the guac added a nice tounge. Al Pastor Taco: Pretty good, better with the guac. Would recommend. Chicken Taco: Average, had way better. The bill came it didn't even feel semi worth it .... Moral of the story: Authentic Mexican is hard to come by and do not rely on the taste buds of hipsters. Sorry guys.
