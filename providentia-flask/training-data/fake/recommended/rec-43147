Popped in for happy hour before a concert, ended up staying for food as well.  Happy hour is well worth it up at the bar, definitely take advantage of it!  We were able to enjoy our wine and small plates at a leisurely pace which was great.  We ordered in stages to gauge our hunger. Their food can be a bit pricey.  The Duck Ham Panini was well worth the price and I highly recommend it but the Veal Meatballs were no where near worth their price (they were just okay). They have a great selection of wines and I look forward to returning for another visit.
