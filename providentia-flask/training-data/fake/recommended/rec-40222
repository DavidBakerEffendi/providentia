Visting from Florida with my husband.  Had dinner here with my brother and his family.  All I can say is YUMMY!  Our server Ashley was great and put up with our shenanigans without missing a beat. This is was my second time here and as with the first it did not disappoint.  We shared baby lobster tails , chickie's style hot shrimp, crab fries, and chickie's riverboat.  Everything was delicious but if I had to pick a favorite I'd say it was......who am I kidding I can't pick a favorite.   Definitely will be returning my next visit to Philly.
