So supposedly Lombardi's is the best pizza in NY, and the first pizza joint in the US? Anyway, I walked into this place not filled with hype, but still rather excited. The pizza was delicious (but then again I like just about all pizza, just some more than others). The pricing was fair, but I'll say a bit on the expensive side. The place is pretty large, with plenty of seating, but that didn't stop my wait for a table from being about an hour.   I do like how you're able to pick your own toppings, but then again you are ordering a whole pizza vs. a slice like your typical NY Pizza joint.   So why 3 stars...well it's not a terrible places, but on my next visit to NYC, I don't think I'm gonna make it a point to stop in unless I'm just around the area. The pizza is good, probably one of the best I've had in NY...and I ate at a LOT of pizzerias. However, given that most Pizza in NY is delicious, much faster to get, and cheaper...it's just really not worth making a special trip IMO. BTW skip their classic Margherita pizza, and just design your own.   ~G
