Don't understand what the fuss was about. My date and I ordered completely different meals and neither were good. This place seriously lacks salt. I have the 'legendary' blueberry pancakes, with a side of smoked bacon and the jalepeno corn bread. She had the fish tacos. We split the apple pie and each had a scoop of ice cream. The fish tacos fell apart at the first bite. They were goopy and lacked flavor. The blueberry pancakes were ok. The compote on top was good. But after a few bites of the overly-sweet pancakes were dying for some salt. I thought the bacon would provide that balance, but it's didn't. Even the apple pie lacked balance. All in all, really cute place, and they gave us scones on our way out, but I probably won't be back. BTW-The scones needed salt as well...
