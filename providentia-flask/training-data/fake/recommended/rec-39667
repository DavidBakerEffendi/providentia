I was pretty disappointed with this restaurant.  I had walked by it many times and finally decided to give it a try. The restaurant itself has a very elegant appearance and is very intimate which I liked. There is a hookah area in the back that looked pretty large and crowded.  The restaurant side of the restaurant had far less people.  While I enjoyed the ambiance, the food was a different story.  Between two of us, we tried the Mediterranean Platter appetizer and the lamb kebab and beef sabanghya. All of these dishes were mediocre.  The lamb was not cooked well which made it lose its flavor. The beef stew was somewhat bland.  I usually enjoy Mediterranean restaurants but felt this one in particular was overpriced and disappointing.  I had been looking forward to eating here for a while but now am not sure that I'll be going back. To end on a positive note, the service at the restaurant was great-our server was very friendly and attentive.
