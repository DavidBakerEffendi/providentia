omg!...can't stop thinking about this meal...my mouth is watering now! Just to add to the other gazillion reviews, this place is delicious! I had the grilled cheese sandwich that was "Heaven" I don't know how you can make a simple grilled cheese that yummy, but they did. It came with these two spreads, one was a flavorful grainy mustard and the other was a caramelized onion marmalade....amazing! ..The combo of the two that i spread on each bite was ..mmmmm..soooo...good. BF had the Cubano, and yes, equally delicious! We walked right in, no wait. It was 2p on a Tue, but when we left at 3 it was filling up with. It's such a cozy place, loved the old English pub feel. We had a beautifully sunny day, so really enjoyed the window seating.....am never disappointed by Mario Batali....love, love, love you!
