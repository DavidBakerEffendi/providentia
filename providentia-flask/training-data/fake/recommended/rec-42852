I love this place. It has become one of my East side staples. Service is always quick and efficient. The atmosphere is always warm and cozy. And the food is consistently delicious! I have been quite a few times and have tried a lot of their dishes. One thing that I always order though and has yet to disappoint is their meze platter. Yum. Great place for groups or for a date!
