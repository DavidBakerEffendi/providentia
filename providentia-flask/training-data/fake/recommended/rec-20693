The Mara Mara soba was delicious! The broth was very flavorful and fatty. I usually am a pansy when it comes to spicy but it was just the right amount of spice. The noodles themselves were delicious too! The croquettes were a little smaller than I expected but still really good and crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. The waiters were all really nice and would ask if we've been there before and give us tips on the best way to eat it. They have cute little instruction sheets too.
