It took an out of towner to bring me to this place and; I am so glad they came for a visit! Our first attempt was last minute on a Sunday, where we learned that not only were we too late - but that Sunday offered a Price-Fix menu and the second seating had already started. Not to be deterred we booked a reservation for Monday. As reported by others, the place is tiny and a wee loud with the open kitchen but once you are greeted and seated you feel like you are in your own little world. We started with a mixed half dozen of oysters: East Coast vs West Coat - I could have eaten them all night. The Island Creek Oyster with migonette won out for me. Â We moved on to the Peeky Toe Crab with cucumber, avocado, black radish - and while delicious in flavor - there were way more shells than I am comfortable with on such a small dish and was a little distracting. The main course brought on the Mahi Mahi with crab fregola, tomato vinaigrette and tiny arugula. I have no idea what my dining companion ate since my face was practically licking the dish the whole time. I rounded out dinner with the Chocolate truffle torte with black cherries - which I was completely unable to finish since I was so happily full, but wasn't leaving with out a taste! I am a big fan of leisurely dining and this two hours was well spent. The staff is helpful, knowledgeable and as much of the experience as the food. I can't wait to book early & try the Sunday situation! The website says reservations are recommended - I think they are a must!
