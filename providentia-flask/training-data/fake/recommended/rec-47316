Weak. First, the current host of this place would be hilarious, if he weren't ridiculous. I walked in, it's a French guy, who with elaborate hand motions and overly enthusiastic strutting abilities, speaks to you in french when you ask for a table. He spoke French to me twice. I get the point, yes, you may be French. But it wasn't until I said, "EXCUSE ME where shall we sit?" that he pointed to my table. Second, the $$ rating is a mistake- this is a more expensive restaraunt. One note is that the cheapest bottle of wine is about $50. That's fine at a nicer restaraunt, but when you match the wine price against the entree prices (generally ~$20), it's sort of out of wack. But I guess there's no law against pricing your wines higher, my mistake in assuming a more standard correlation. Third, the service sucks. Been here twice, both times the waitresses get to you when they feel like it, sort of have an aloof attitude. Food is good, wine is good, not bad if you don't care about price. Good date spot too.
