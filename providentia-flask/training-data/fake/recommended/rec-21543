I love this place!  The burger of the week is one of the things that keeps me coming in for food.  I like trying something new all the time, even if my friends think i'm nuts... perfect example the KRISPY KREME BURGER!  While some people think eating a burger with a bun that's a krispy kreme donut and bacon dipped in chocolate, i thought it was AMAZING! Also, The owner has fun days like "snow days" where there is open bar during the day, or he'll bring in his video game system and play with everyone. The night parties are pretty good too & one of the best things are the bathroom stalls... almost never a wait!
