This was my first venture in the new 'hood, and I am off to a good start.  Be warned, we pigged out! First, get a table outside.  The patio is lovely, and it is very very very noisy inside. The fried shrimp appetizers were great, the mango and duck summer rolls were  pretty good.   The pork fried rice was superb.   We licked the plate.  Whole, fried, striped bass was an overwhelming sight, but tasty and fresh and well worth the effort.  We rounded things out with mixed green veggies and tofu.  Ask for fresh tofu, the fried is chewy. Plates are American sized.  Go hungry. And be patient, service is spotty.
