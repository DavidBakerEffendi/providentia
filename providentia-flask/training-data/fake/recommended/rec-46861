We came here for my husbands birthday. I really loved the feel of the place. Very cozy and romantic. I started with wine and my husband a $15 mixed drink. Expensive but he enjoyed it. We then had a endive salad and chicken croquettes.  Both were good, not amazing. I then had the scallops and my husband had ribs. This is where my warning to not come hungry comes in. There were 3 measly scallops on my plate. Fine but not for $25. They were average too. Husband had 3 ribs. Overpriced!!   The dessert was less then to be desired. Overall it's average food for a huge price.
