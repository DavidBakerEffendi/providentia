We stopped for a few drinks. Unfortunately it turned into one drink and a basket of fries before leaving. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy. The service was subpar. Our waitress didn't seem to go out of her way to check on us. The martinis we ordered tasted pretty terrible. It lacked flavor and tasted of pure alcohol. The fries were decent but based on the drink and service we left immediately after paying our tab.
