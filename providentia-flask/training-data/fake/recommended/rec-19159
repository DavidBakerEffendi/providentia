I've never been in the store. Always ordered online. There is a language barrier which sucks but sometimes the put someone on the line that speaks better english.. Doesn't hurt to accommodate customers by learning a few english words.. The portions are big, the rice is ok but their oxtails are on point.. i've had the stewed chicken, oxtails and roast pork so far..
