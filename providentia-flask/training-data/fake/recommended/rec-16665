Not sure I was here on a bad day, but this was not even close to being the best burger I have had in New York. By the looks of things I will be out numbered here. They gave me any burger in a matter of minutes and was dark and over cooked. When I want a quality burger I want them to cook it fresh and not something that must have been sitting on the grill for a while. The bun fell apart in minutes. A good sign for the burger being juicy, but this was ridiculous. They did have really good bacon on the burger and was at a affordable price in the village. Here is a list of my favorite NY restaurants so far newyorkcityreviews.wordpâ€¦
