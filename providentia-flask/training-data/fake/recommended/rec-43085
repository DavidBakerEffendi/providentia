Mmm...still love this place.  I've been maybe 50+ times and have never been let down.  Whatever you do, don't listen to Maria's insane review...she sounds like a super-hipster, high-maintenance nut.  Hopefully she'll stop tormenting the awesome people at Lomzynianka now! p.s. It's pronounce wom-SZI-nyan-ka.  The szi is between a "shi" and a "ji" sound.
