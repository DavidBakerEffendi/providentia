It's a short walk from Church St. Marketplace (touristy shopping area) and the waterfront. We arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday, no reservation, and the wait was 45 mins. Luckily, we grabbed the last two seats at the bar instead, no wait. We devoured a large pizza completely: half VT sausage & half punctuated equilibrium (veg with goat cheese) - both were very flavorful, well-done but not burnt, had generous toppings, and wasn't greasy! We washed it all down with some hard cider and IPA cask ale. I saw locals come in just to buy growlers of beer from the in-house Zero Gravity Brewing. Service was efficient esp. with the crowd. Atmosphere was warm and lively. Prices were very reasonable. If I lived in Burlington, I'd probably be a regular here.
