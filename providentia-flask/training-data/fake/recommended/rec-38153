Came here with a big group of girls before our school break, we were all extremely hungry when we showed up so some of the food disappeared before I could snap a picture! Our waitress was so friendly and she got our orders in right away. The fresh guacamole is incredible. The restaurant is so clean and has a cool aura, and the design of the restaurant is very fun. The nachos were a great sized portion and managed to be completely consumed immediately after hitting the table. Our burritos and quesadillas were very well made and good sized portions, I wasn't in love with how the chicken was not shredded in the burrito, but was more of a slice of chicken, but it was still delicious. Great for a date night or evening out with friends!
