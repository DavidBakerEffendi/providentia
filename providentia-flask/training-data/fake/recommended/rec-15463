Found a needle in a haystack. This restaurant should receive more stars. Truly was an amazing experience, service and food was impeccable. The surrounding customers were also pleasant. Greeters were welcoming everyone with big smiles! Service: This restaurant should pride themselves on customer service, I've never met so many happy and nice waitresses and waiters, they made the dining experience so much better. They were knowledgeable, professional, and extremely friendly. Their attention to detail was great, my water glass was always getting refilled without asking (I really appreciated that). The staff looked happy, no one was serving with crummy faces and it made me want to genuinely leave a generous tip. Food: wow. I've taken advice from other yelpers and ordered the gnocchi (house dish, I believe) may I say it was amazing. The dish was presentable and the flavors were captivating. We also ordered the truffle oil/cheese flat bread which was also super yum. Portion size on both dishes were decent. Really really really enjoyed this place, definitely coming back and absolutely telling all of my friends!
