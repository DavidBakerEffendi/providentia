The famous Roast Pork Sandwich: Â The Pork, the star of the show, is just okay it somehow isn't very flavorful. The broccoli rabe is underdone. The sharp provolone was lacking in some bites....more would have been nice. We also had the roast beef with peppers...that was actually tastier then the pork, but still just okay. Sadly this place is nothing special; just over hyped! Update: Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America?!?!?! You've got to be kidding me?!?!? Guess that mean's I can't trust any reviews coming from Adam Richman!
