I'm so glad this place moved into the neighborhood.  It's basically fast (good) food with beer.  It has a nice, modern interior and plenty of seating.  When you place your order, you get one of those little buzzers that goes off when it's ready. Everyone who works there has been very nice. I have had sushi rolls, chicken teriyaki, sweet potato fries, seaweed salad... all were great.  But the most addictive item on the menu is the pork bun.  It's the size of a hamburger or pulled pork sandwich.  Braised pork topped with banh-mi-like veggies (think cucumbers, radish, carrots), a bit of bbq sauce and I think a hint of spicy mayo.  It's a crack sandwich.
