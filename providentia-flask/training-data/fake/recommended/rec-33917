I was pleasantly surprised by this place down the street from my old apartment. I lived a block away for a year and never made it in, but I'm glad I finally did. Everything we had was very fresh and simple. Prices were affordable, and the atmosphere was warm and relaxed. Could do with a few more choices of wines by the glass - only 3 reds. But the bottles were reasonably prices at around $35. Our waitress was very knowledgable about the menu, and did well to suggest add-ons. Though her over pronunciation of every Italian word was kind of ridiculous, I mean, come on, we're in Bed-Stuy people. You're not fooling anyone.
