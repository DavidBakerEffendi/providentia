Sat quickly on a Monday night. Great ambience, good service and all of the food was delicious. In a neighborhood where Thai places are a dime a dozen, the food was good, hot, well priced.  The drinks were ok - a bit pricey all things considered.  Tuna Tartar and fried Calamari apps were really excellent. I would def go back and didn't think this compared in any way to the old Room Service Chelsea, which has sinced closed down. Keep up the good work!
