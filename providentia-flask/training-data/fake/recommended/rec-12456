Everyone says to get it, so honestly just follow the crowd. The chicken nanban is so tender and juicy. It strips away easily. The tartar sauce gives it a really great flavor, and it comes with salad, rice, and soup. The portions are generous so I'm always busting by the seams when I'm done eating, or I'll have a few pieces to take home as leftovers. Also, the service is good, and the waiters are friendly, smiley, and attentive. I've also gotten the katsu don before and it's also very tasty.
