Saint Austere is aiming to be a cosy bar that's a great place to have drinks....and when the fun gets a little too intense...it's a place you can dig into some seriously delicious and high-concept bar food. I've eaten at places like Alain Ducasse in Paris and Jean George in NYC and I've NEVER had a polenta like that the mouth-heaven you'll find here. It was a fantasy-come-true in your mouth. One of my friends actually suggested the dish was made with Unicorn horns. I kinda want to believe her. This Sh*t was magical. Don't share is all I can say. You won't want to. Seoul, the CIA grad Executive Chef was beyond rad. He is seriously someone to keep an eye on. He sent us fabulous patatas bravas that were spicy with just the right amount of mayonnaise, and then since we were celebrating a special birthday, we scored some meatballs. Thanks Seoul! These were light and airy, in a super-fresh tomato sauce. Additionally we ordered the octopus, the bone marrow (very unique, great presentation) the broccoli rabe and the tomato bruscheta (they were having an off night, bread was stale). Â  Anyway, to say the lease we feasted. And just when we thought we might be done, we decided to order MORE POLENTA. Like I said. Sharing this stuff is criminal, I think you see where I'm coming from. All in all, the place has a relaxed atmosphere and the owner Fabrizio has done a great job creating a neighborhood hang that you'll return to over and over again. And not just for the polenta. Although maybe...
