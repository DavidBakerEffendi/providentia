This place is the bomb-diggity! It's one of the coolest places around, and definitely the coolest market I've ever been to! You can get anything there, and I mean, Ah-NEA-THING!! There's over 80 different vendors, selling anything from yummy imported chesses and susages, to home made ice creams and chocolates, to veggie, Indian, Thai, Mesican restaurants, wine shops, butchers and fresh fruit vendors. Get the idea?! I love going here, getting a freshly made pastry and hot chocolate, and just wandering around and taking it all in. It is awesome!!
