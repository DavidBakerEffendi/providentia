I went here with a large group and had a great time. The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. I had the falafel and hummus platter, which was delicious. It came with a very fresh salad and side of pita bread for dipping. The rest of the group ordered a variety of dishes that were equally as satisfying. The service was decent and could have been a little better. We had to flag down the servers to get a refill on drinks, and it took a while to get our check. Otherwise, great place! I'll definitely be back.
