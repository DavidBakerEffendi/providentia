So I wanted to dress up like Pitbull and be *that* person at brunch. Ha. Needless to say I chickened out. We went for Sunday brunch and since my friends are notoriously last-minute or *spontaneous* as they like to call it, we didn't have reservations. We pretty easily got a couple seats in the lounge area. The problem with that area is that, to my knowledge, there is only ONE server for that area. So every time he came over, each table attacked him to get the one thing that kept getting forgotten. Pros: -Food was surprisingly delicious! I'm always wary of drunch locations but the hash was DELISH -Decor is quite nice and the dining area is quite large! -Really on-point Sangria! I tried two reds and a white and all were good. Would go with the white again. Cons: -The plates are HUGE and don't fit on the tiny tables. It was a constant balancing act that got old real quick. -It took 15 minutes to get our drink once ordered. I know it's busy but it even took 15 minutes and asking 3 bus boys later to get our WATER. I'll be back with a reservation at table. It's a great gem in my home of the UWS!
