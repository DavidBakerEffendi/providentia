Went for an impromptu dinner with husband and 5 month old baby on a Saturday  night. They were incredibly accommodating both with our baby (getting us a great table outside--they moved one from inside to the lovely outdoor spot) and to my gluten allergy (celiac disease). I was thrilled that I could eat most things on the menu and that they knew that gluten/wheat was in things like soy sauce so I didn't have to explain myself. Hubby ordered chilled corn soup which was the weakest of everything we ordered. His criticism ; all the unexpected flavors (honeydew, crackerjack popcorn and smoky infusion) did not hold up together. I ordered the Tako taco. A blue corn taco with goat cheese and octopus. Very fresh, delicious. Entrees: I ordered salmon. It was a great cut of fish, cooked well on top of a bed of potatoes--basically homefry style in addition to asparagus laid on top. I ate it all. My critique: it was just too salty. I know that is the flavor palate these days but it overwhelmed a simple, fresh dish that could basically stand alone without the excess salt. My husband ordered the beef tenderloin. Excellent, flavorful and good texture. Good cut of meat.  Great  prices made even better by the BYOB policy. $50 tab--we stopped at the Bedford wine shop and got a great bottle of unoaked chardonnay for $8 before.  We will definitely be back.
