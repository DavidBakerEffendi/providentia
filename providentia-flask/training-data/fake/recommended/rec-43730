Finally finishing this review up! I've been here twice already and both experiences have been great! We were here yesterday for my brother's birthday dinner. We had a lot of people in our group but they were able to accommodate us since we made reservations. We were seated in their back room, I guess their party room and we had the whole room to ourselves. Once you get seated they bring out bread and salad. The bread was really good especially with the butter and olive oil! My girlfriend and I just shared the Filet Mignon on a Hot Sizzling Stone or as its known "Steak On A Stone", since we've had it before and we knew how big it was gonna be. Once u get it at your table and start cooking and putting the garlic butter that comes with it your mouth starts to water and can't wait to take a bite!! The plate comes with rice and fries(Potato chips). Be warned now because you will definitely smell like food after you're done eating!! And also the servings are pretty huge on some of the meals so share!! We also had the Chocolate Souffle, but it was more like a Lava Cake than souffle. It was good nonetheless! When I feel like having a Steak On A Stone this is the place where I'm def going to!!
