Went here for brunch today. Avoided the 20 min wait by taking seats at the bar. Enjoyed the coziness and charm of this place, as previous reviewers have already described. The "pumpkin" waffles were very good. Full of flavor, and moist. WARNING: "fakin bacon" doesn't even come close. It's very tempeh like and not so bacon like. I say go for the real deal or none at all. Cappuccino is worthy, but have a double cause the cups are small. Overall, a little pricey, but worth it for the homemadeness and real maple syrup.
