Exactly what I've been looking for in center city. A combination of old school and modern, underdogs is a reinvention cooked for success. The ambiance was well put together, sublime playing in the background of the small store front. The store located underneath a much bigger building. I knew it was going to be good. I just didn't know how good. The menu was on the wall, the cook was singing to the lyrics and the other workers were laughing about some inside joke. It felt homey and happy. I ordered four dogs: the california dream, the tryp, the chicago and the warsaw. All were delicious, but the two that stood out were the tryp and the chicago. The first was a twist on the thanksgiving platter and the second a perfectly concocted traditionally structured dog: yellow mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, sport peppers, a dill pickle spear and celery salt. I was engulfed in flavor immediately. Basically delicious. And to top it off (pun intended) the owner walked over to our table personally and on his own, making sure we were enjoying the meal. Furthermore, he gave us a quick hot dog history lesson on east coast vs midwest coney dog. I simply can't complain. But then again, maybe their name shouldn't be underdogs.
