I went to this place not knowing what to expect being on the LES. I saw the reviews about the pancakes so I had to try them. I must say they were the best pancakes I have had since being in NYC. The small cup of warm maple syrup that comes with them is just right for he already moist stack. Along with the pancakes I had the southern breakfast, (cheese grits, sugar cured bacon, fried green tomatoes and scrambled eggs ($26) Being from the south I was skeptical about the cheese grits but they were to die for. All in all I will be going back for breakfast and dinner. I must note it is a small dining space so plan to wait for a table but it will be worth it.
