This place has awesome food! The burger! The duck fat fries! I can't afford the rest of the menu. So for food, at least the limited amount I have been able to try. A + On to drinks. It is cute to have such a long whiskey list, but what does it matter how many whiskeys you have if you aren't charging fair prices for the whiskey. Nice that you have ten different ryes, like reading about them on the internet, but I can only afford the old overholt. Oh well. And to be the winiest little guy. Can I ask why this place is charging 6 and 7 dollars for 12 ounces of beer that would sell for five dollars a pint down the street? Seems gratuitous me. Anyway. This has to be a once in a year or so kind of joint because the rent is too damn high. Also the service is meh. Last time I ordered the duck fat fries, they brought me the regular variety. blah
