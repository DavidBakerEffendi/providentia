My first authentic Philly Cheesesteak experience was SO GOOD. We were freezing but so hungry, and we were a little shocked at first to find that the only seating that there was was the benches outside. Mind you, it was like 20 degrees and there were 2 women sitting on the bench eating like it was no big deal - I thought that was awesome. The guy at the second (fry) window was so helpful. I asked what we were supposed to do and he told me just how to order what I wanted so I didn't look like an idiot. He also directed us over to the bar across the street (The Garage) so that we could sit inside and eat our food. Each of our sandwiches were amazing. Perfect little strips of steak, cheese wiz (which I thought I was going to hate, but there's seriously no other way that you should order this sandwich), and onions. Bread was perfectly toasted and didn't get soggy right away - gotta eat it fast! I will likely try the rival place across the street (Pat's?) before I return, just for good measure. But as far as I know, if Geno's was the only PCS place to exist, I'd be in trouble if I lived in South Philly.
