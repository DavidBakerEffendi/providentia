I loved this place. It was spacious, tastefully designed and decorated. You can tell that the owners pay attention to detail. Everything down to the silverware and plates was beautiful. I'm a sucker for presentation, and the folks at Fare captured my heart.  Plus they have homemade sparkling water. So refreshing. We got there around 8:30pm on a Saturday night without a reservation. There were no tables available until 10:30pm so we were instead seated immediately at the bar by the window overlooking the street, perfect for people watching. Here's what we ate: caramelized onion soup with grilled cheese and fennel sandwich: This was good, a little more like tomato soup than i would have expected. open faced bison burger with spinach, feta, herbs/yogurt, lemon, mint: My cousin had this, and I didn't try it. But she had no complaints. chicken thighs, marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic, paprika, mint, coconut brown rice: This dish stole the show. So delicious. I find myself thinking about this chicken frequently ever since. Mmm.... grilled flank steak, coriander red wine potatoes, grilled radicchio: I ordered this medium or medium rare, I can't remember. But it was perfect. The portion sizes were great. We left feeling satisfied, and not so full that we might burst. The service was fine; if I remember correctly the waitress spilled my water a bit and didn't notice, and she had basically no knowledge about the wines, but she was nice enough. Overall, I'd recommend this place for anyone who wants a nice, classy dinner but doesn't want to deal with Stephen Starr's gaudiness or Jose Garces' tiny, expensive plates. Definitely good for those who don't want to deal with a center city crowd on a weekend night.  It's fancy but not over the top. It's good a good vibe, check it out.
