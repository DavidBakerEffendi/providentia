I've been here on and off for years and am never disappointed. I usually show up in the middle of a drinking spree so it was nice to go during lunch and actually sit down inside. I opted for the small, as usual, and got the special that includes 3 dipping sauces for like really cheap. The sauces are BIG and i didn't even finish them all by the time my fries were done. Â  I've never had an issue with oily fries which is good because most of the time I eat them as I walk (really stumble) from one bar to the next and I've never had a case of the greasy fingers. Overall, I'm glad I don't live nearby and that most of my hangouts are now further away!
