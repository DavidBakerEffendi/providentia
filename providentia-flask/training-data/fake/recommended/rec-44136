I have tried many Indian places in Central CT, and one of the problems is that they frequently dumb down the food when it comes to spiciness.  This place, so far, has the right spice level, without having to say you like something spicy. Ordered salty lassi--which was fantastic with fresh herbs and ginger, and not too salty (some Indian restaurants offer salty lassi, which is only yoghurt with salt). Balti baigan was outstanding.  Nice level of heat, with discernible spices.  Clearly made fresh. Garlic/chilli naan can't be beat.  Fresh, fluffy, delicate. The sabji bhaji was kind of blah.  But we probably should not have ordered a dish with a "mix of vegetables."  That's what brings the star level down. It is an elegant place, with a nice dining experience.  We did not do a buffet--the critical reviews deal with a buffet.  To be honest buffets are not the best way to judge a restaurant--food is prepared in large batches, and often sits on the counter. The food we ordered was made for us and it truly tasted that way. We will likely be back to try other vegetarian options.
