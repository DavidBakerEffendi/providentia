My girlfriend and I went here during out trip to New York this past May. In short, the food was nothing short of outstanding and the wait service was phenomenal.  I ordered the duck fois gras ravioli and my girlfriend ordered the spaghetti.  The pasta most definitely lived up to it's hype. I will certainly come back again.
