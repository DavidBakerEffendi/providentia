My rating is based on their breakfast sandwich! I Just had a Taylor ham, egg and cheese (mozzarella) roll and it was amazing! It literally had five pieces of Taylor ham, two eggs and a thick, melted slice of cheese. It cost about 6 bucks and it was worth every penny. It took about 10 minutes to prepare and they're cash only. Only thing I'm worrying about is a possible heart attack, but again it was worth it! Much better than spending your cash on the stuff at DD. Enjoy!.
