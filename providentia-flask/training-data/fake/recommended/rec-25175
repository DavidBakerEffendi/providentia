Located at the end of an alleyway, Freeman's is trendy, lively, and pretty delicious. The restaurant is laid out almost as a house - walls still in place, stairs in between dining rooms. We were seated in a smaller room area where there were 4 groups.  I was worried about the proximity of the other groups and that it would be hard to have a conversation, but it actually felt very intimate and private! The only downside about the layout was that the server definitely had to take extra precautions when maneuvering to our table with food and drinks. The food was very good. The menu seemed to contain a lot of classy, new twists on traditional American dishes.  I'm not too eager to go back anytime soon (there are too many restaurants to try!), but it was a great date spot and would definitely recommend.
