I pretty much like everything about this place. The food is delicious and great quality. The vibe, atmosphere, and music are great. The owners are super personable and nice. The portion sizes are on the smaller side (which is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars). Its just that the food is sooo good that I want more!! Lol
