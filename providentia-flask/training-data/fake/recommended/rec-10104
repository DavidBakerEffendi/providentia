I have to preface this review by warning you that I am a huge fan of Mario Batali, and I think everything he does is great. So I may be more willing than some to overlook the crowds and long lines at Eataly. The week that Eataly opened up, I waited patiently for a seat at their pizza/pasta station. The amount of people packed into the space was pretty overwhelming, and it hasn't changed much since. The pizza was completely worth the wait. I ordered the Ventura Pizza, a heavenly creation with fresh arugula and delicate slices of prociutto. Accompanied with a glass of Birra, it was the perfect meal. I often shop for groceries at Eataly. The produce section, while small, has most ingredients I need for a meal. One complaint is that I have yet to find bread crumbs there. However, I'm guessing Mario Batali would just tell me to use day old bread. The pasta selection is incredible. Tons of imported Italian pastas in any shape you can think of. And the cheese...oh, the cheese. Fresh mozzarella made right before your eyes - sure beats the sad little packages I get at Food Emporium. There's also a great selection of fresh and dry meats. The Italian sausage and the pepperoni are amazing. I'm also a fan of the fresh bread at Eataly. If you can't wait 30 min for a pizza, a good alternative is the delicious ham and cheese focaccia that you can get at the bakery. Sure, Eataly has its flaws. It's perpetually crowded, the layout is less than efficient, and the lines are long. But it exemplifies everything that is good about Italian food, it's not overpriced, and I am so thankful for its presence in the city.
