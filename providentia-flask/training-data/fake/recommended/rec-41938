First dined here a little over a year ago and were so unimpressed we neither returned nor bothered to write a review. So, we couldn't remember much about it last week, when we finished our dance lesson at Society Hill Dance Academy famished. Granted, we are vegetarian and perhaps are missing Xochitl's star dishes. But I largely stand by my original impression. The place was nearly deserted, which ought to have tipped us off. However, it was such a welcome change from our prior experience (a crowded Friday night), that we enjoyed the quiet. Our waiter was friendly enough, although the bartender who seated us looked at his watch as soon as we walked in.   We started with the Xochitl salad, which had the potential to be good. If it wasn't incredibly salty. I suspected, and our waiter confirmed, that the kitchen forgot the lime dressing. Bad when the restaurant is busy. Regrettable when the restaurant is nearly empty and you have a full kitchen staff. But UNFORGIVABLE when it is nearly empty, you have a full kitchen staff, AND you realize the mistake and don't take it off the bill.   For dinner, my friend ordered the Huarache de Hongos, with seasonal vegetables instead of the usual mix of mushroom and artichoke. I liked it better than he did, so we ended up switching plates. I ordered the mushroom tamale. I am not a big fan of tamales in general but it was one of the few vegetarian options and I decided to give it a shot. It was inexplicably deconstructed - which a tamale should, in my opinion, NEVER be - because it was a few slices of bland corn mush with a dollop of the mushroom "filling" on the side. It is a good thing we are trying to diet, because the portion sizes were tiny for the price. The drinks were better than the food. The Xochitl margarita was tart and freshly prepared - the way I like it - and the Mexican mojito was crisp and refreshing. But my glass was 90% ice. They definitely make a lot of money from their liquor sales.
