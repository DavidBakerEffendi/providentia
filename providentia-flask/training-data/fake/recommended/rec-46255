Been here twice, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Had to wait about 30 min to be seated but we went to chickalicious (amazeballs) down the block meanwhile so it wasn't that bad. Shabu shabu is ok, we got the prime rib eye and the quality of meat is pretty good. But the broth and the sauce are nothing to write home about. We also ordered some appetizers: eel/egg omelette was delish, roasted duck was ok and the pork belly was too salty. Service wasn't that great, they didn't really explain anything. I kinda had to figure things out on my own (I just dumped the scallion and radish thing they gave us in my sauce, did I do it right?). My friend and I were confused when they nonchalantly put down the mugs with salt and pepper towards the end of our meal and walked away. I had to flag them down and ask (no, they are not mugs, they are soup bowls for the broth). I love the location though since it's on the same block as chickalicious!
