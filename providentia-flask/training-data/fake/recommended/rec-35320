Came here back in the day when I was traveling to Philadelphia and asked a few of the locals what I had to try... Pretty much expected to hear "Philly Cheesesteak" from everyone. However, the first few responses that I got was "Roast Pork Sandwich from Tommy Dinic's!" I definitely do NOT regret getting this sandwich or waiting in that line ( which passed by quickly). Â The workers are super efficient and handle the orders very quickly and politely. They provide generous portions and you definitely should get some veggies to go along with it! Definitely try to avoid the lunchtime rush because you'll be left standing in line smelling the goodness that is the roast pork instead of enjoying it !
