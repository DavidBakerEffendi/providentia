Just had a chance to try this new restaurant.  What a wonderful addition to the area!  I just hope the business success will be as strong as the hospitality and the food!  My husband had Tandoori Chicken, and I had a wonderful pumpkin dish (Bolanee Kaddu), both served with a nice salad and Naan bread.  It was all great, and the prices were quite reasonable. Our server helped us (anglos) with the menu, was extremely friendly. Clearly worth a return visit!  Yumm!
