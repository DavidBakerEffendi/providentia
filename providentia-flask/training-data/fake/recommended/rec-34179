We went to Woodbines for dinner over St. Patty's Day weekend and enjoyed a Guinness, a Guinness-beef stew, a Woodbines burger, and the nice pub ambiance.  The service was lovely and portions were on the generous side.  The only thing not to like was the deep-fried pita chips served with the spinach-artichoke dip.  This restaurant is subtitled "craft kitchen," and deep-frying food is not craft, it's McDonald's.  Or maybe the real problem is that I like healthy, tasty food too much to really go for the meaty, oily food that is the pub fare genre.  That said, if you are in the mood for a pub on the nicer side, Woodbines will not disappoint.
