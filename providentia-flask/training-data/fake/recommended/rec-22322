I went here this past weekend with my boyfriend and some friends. I couldn't believe that the 2 hour wait would be worth it, as he insisted it would be, but it was. Another shocker, the mashed potato and bacon pizza is to die for, and not in a fat kid way. It is truly delicious. I'm psyched to visit this place again! They don't take reservations for under about 10 people (I believe) which is annoying, but plan ahead, grab a drink at the bar and make a night of it.
