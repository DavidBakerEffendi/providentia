++++ - I like the price fixe brunch menu (Although, they are very stringent on substitutions) ++ - Persian bee and pomengrante kiss were refreshing - Wife got the lamb burger, as the reviews noted, it was very good - Seasoned fries were a plus - I always dig free coffee refills - It was pretty empty on a Sunday around noon, I there was one other table being occupied + - Steak salad was nice and juicy (Just a personal opinion, but I would have liked something extra, like a cheese, tomato, or nut) TIP: - CASH ONLY!!! - the fries are not sweet potato fries, they are some seasoned regular fries
