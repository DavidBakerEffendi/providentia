Great place for a casual, yet hip, dinner. Good wine and cocktail list ... and something for everyone on the menu. Had the build-your-own salad, and for only $14 it was HUGE! Split the oreo cookie sundae with two friends and we barely finished half. Wait staff was friendly, and didn't have to wait for a table at 8:30pm on a Friday night.
