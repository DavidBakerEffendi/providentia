If you are looking for the same Village Whiskey food and drinks from their Atlantic City establishment inside the Revel casino you will be disappointed! I went to the VW inside of the revel and had the best whiskey sour of my life!  The apps were on point! Even the drink garnishes were out of this world! I went to work and bragged to my friends about this place.  We found out there was one closer so after work we stopped by this one in Rittenhouse.   Thoroughly disappointed.  The whiskey sour was not good, the apps were mediocre and the amarena cherries that were used in AC were substituted for the cheap, sweet cherries you get in any bar drink. There are so many other bars to choose from in the city. I don't know if I would revisit this one. Nothing stood out.  I will however definitely make it back to the revel's VW!
