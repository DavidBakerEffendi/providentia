Only come here when you're really, really hungry.  I really wish I had a bigger appetite- I'm going to have to make a second trip to make up for what I missed! Tried both the sigara borek (philo dough with feta cheese) and a zucchini pancake special for appetizers.  Both extremely tasty and filling.  I had the iskender kebab (lamb and beef) as my entree.  It was fantastic and a HUGE amount of food.  Fortunately, it tastes just as good as leftovers.  The dessert menu looked good and the one person in our party who had room for the baklava really enjoyed it.  The service is great and the prices are extremely reasonable for the UES and for the size of the portions.
