Soooooo dissapointed. My boyfriend And i pass this place everyday On our way home I finally decided we had to go... And what crap the environment is cute I felt like I was in a barn I. The city the bathroom was nice also.... But the food was horrible. The lemonade was more like water with lemons squeezed I. Very quickly. The food itself was crap too I got the chicken and waffles which did not go well together the syrup was like an apricot which really made it crappy. I was soo surlrised that this place had bad food I spoke to many people in Manhattan who traveled here all the time just to eat here. Capitol Â ewe...I'll pass.
