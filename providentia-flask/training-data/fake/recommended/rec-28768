One of our favorites. The space is small, so you will be sitting close to your neighbors. We loved the sheep's milk ricotta, the farro salad and the two specials we had (shrimp and paparadelle and braised short rib). Don't strike us down, but we thought the Budino was just "good". Great drinks, and the overall value is great for the level of food. The service was efficient and friendly.
