Man, this stuff is good.   I've had this place bookmarked for quite awhile now and I'm in that area often, but for some reason never stopped by.  I was missing out big time! I was fortunate enough to arrive when there were only 4-5 people in line, unlike the legendary lines** I've heard about on here.  While in line, one of the workers came by and gave everyone in line one of those reusable shopping bags with their name on it...don't know if that's a common practice but it was nice since we were carrying a bunch of stuff around with us.  The short line moved quickly, there are 4 people working the cart, but I would have stood there for much longer smelling that delicious smell and being stunned by the gigantic piles of meat on the flat top.  Food cart heaven. And then of course, the best part, eating that delicious pile of meat and rice.  like I said, Man, this stuff is good.  I'm sure if you've stumbled across this review, you've already read somewhere else that the white sauce is great...no lies there.  Just pour it on.  Be careful with the hot sauce though, it's a bit more powerful than you might expect.  I love my spicy foods, but just be warned, its not the tobascoesque sauce you will get at other carts/restaurants.   I can't wait to go back. Tonight sounds good. **There are at least 2 other carts in the immediate area with guys wearing the same shirts...can anyone confirm that the food is the same from these? Because there was absolutely no lines at them.
