Wow! I had a Greek Salad there for lunch and it was really good.  The salad ingredients were very fresh and crispy.  I really loved it.  You got a nice warm pita with your salad and the dressing was on the side.  The Greek Lady is very clean, bright and comfortable.  The staff was nice and courteous.  My only complaint was that they only had Pepsi and not Coke.
