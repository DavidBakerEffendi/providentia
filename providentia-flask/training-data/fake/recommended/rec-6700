Delicious! Love their sushi! Be sure to check out half-price sushi Tuesday and Thursday evenings. I have been a regular here for the past several years. Due to my work schedule I have had to rely on delivery more then actually visiting the restaurant. They are always quick and the food arrives fresh. Service is friendly. Nice decor. Only once or twice have I gotten a so-so meal. Highly recommended.
