Yo, best meal I've had in awhile. It was my friend and me. We each got a cocktail. His was called Fresh Meadow and tasted like you were drinking the most refreshing cool cucumber ever. Does that make sense? Try it. We got the hallowed brussels sprouts - I never knew tiny cabbages could ever be so rich that one couldn't finish a bowl! I don't know what was in that sauce, but whatever it was...yeah it was good. We shared hummus with what I suppose you could only describe as pillow soft pitas. Along with that we had lamb and beef meatballs in a cherry sauce and the beef schwarma or however you spell it. Everything tasted great. The schwarma was served with spices and stuff (I don't know what anything was called exactly) in a pita pocket type thing. I could have eaten 10 of those. We had a team of servers and they were all friendly and attentive and enthusiastic about the food. For dessert we shared the candy bar - the crust is the best part! ililil is special. And remember when you go that sharing is caring!
