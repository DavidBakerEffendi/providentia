I have been here two times, the first visit I would give a 2, the second visit is the 1 star I am writing about.  I was at Bartaco on a Monday night with my husband we were seated on the patio right away.  We waited, waited and waited.  Perused the menu, decided what we wanted, waited and waited some more.  No glass of water, no drink order, no attention at all.  I remembered from the "service card" they give you and put it on the stand.  A woman with a water pitcher came and took the card down and asked us what we needed with a chilly tone, seemingly implying that we had no reason to put the card up.  We told her we hadn't been helped and she said she'd send someone over.  She didn't offer us water.  Waiting, waiting, still no one!  We decided to walk out and no one said a word to us on the way out.  I was totally turned off by the way we were treated and I won't be back.  Too bad for the server, because if someone had come to the table we were going to order their $48 carafe of margarita.
