This place is definitely top notch, the other two reviews are spot on about good people, service and food. I just wanted to say they also sell cold cuts at pretty good prices. I like to grocery shop at trader joe's but hate prepackaged cold cuts, so I head here for my cold meats. mmm. Just thinking of Kotch's makes me want Bob Kotch special (ham, turkey, swiss, slaw and russian dressing on rye)
