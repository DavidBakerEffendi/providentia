El Vez is a great spot for a dinner out with friends.  It's trendy and the decor is fun!  It's a little on the pricey side but every now and then one should treat themselves!  We were told we would have an hour wait so we sat at the bar to get the party started.  Lucky for us, a table was ready in half the time! We ordered a pitcher of blood orange mararitas which helped us get the night started.  For an appetizer we ordered the guacamole and were not disappointed!  We also ordered the shrimp ceviche which was also good.  The portion size was not impressive compared to other places that I have had ceviche but it was tasty. For dinner I ordered the chicken tacos which was a perfect portion size for me...although if you're hungry you need to make sure you order appetizers because it's more about presentation than quantity of food for your $$.   Personally, I like to have a night out like this once in a while where it feels like someone took some time to prepare your food and make it look appetizing instead of just throwing it on a plate with sauce. This might not be a spot I'd hit up weekly because I can't spend this amount on mexican food on a regular basis...but it's great for a night out for drinks with your friends!!
