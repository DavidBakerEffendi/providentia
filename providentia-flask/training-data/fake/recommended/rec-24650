I look back at my Reviews and I have a lot of 5 start places, so I have to make this a 6 STAR place.  We went with another couple who have never had Lebanese food.  Had the Mezze selection and the food simply blew me away.  Had many dishes that are available at other middle east restaurants, but here there was a special extra to the flavor.  As many have expressed, the brussel sprouts were amazing, the fries out of this world.  The candy bar dessert was the bomb. The highlite of the night were the fiddle-head ferns which were a special spring dish.  The lamb was spot on.  The hot foods were hot and cold were a nice room temp.  Have to give big props to the wait staff. They were there when you needed them with outstanding explanations  of the dishes for the uninitiated and great suggestions.  This place is one of my top 15 ever.
