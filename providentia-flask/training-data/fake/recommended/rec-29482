went for the chicken cheesesteak.  not bad.  the regular cheesesteaks looked tastier though.  fries were also good. wait time was just as bad as Jim's just across the street, even though Jim's appeared to have 5 times the customers... not sure what this was all about. one cheesesteak, small fry, and medium drink ran $12.. there are better meals on south street to be had for less. probably won't be back.
