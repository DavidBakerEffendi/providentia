SKIP this place. Chevy's or even taco bell is better than the food in this restaurant. The food is extremely bland and left a "I need to eat something else to get that blah taste out of my mouth"   Restaurant is clean and service is good but that's kinda about it (that's why there is 2 starts).  Oh yeah.... the table-side guac, no taste at all....  very very very disappointed.
