Good food, bad service. So much for service. Not only did we wait 48 minutes for our 15 minute wait for a table, but two parties who entered after us who clearly did not have a reservation were seated before us. When I sat down at the table, my glass had a lipstick stain on it. Food was good (I just had the chicken pad thai), but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. I would only do take-out.
