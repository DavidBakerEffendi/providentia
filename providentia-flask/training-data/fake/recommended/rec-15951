Taking into account the total package, this place gets 4 stars. A nice little spot (probably can accommodate about 40 people).  The menu wasn't enormous, maybe 2-3 pages, but the creativity in each dish delivered offerings that could satisfy your craving.  One nice feature is that the pasta in any dish could be substituted with a gluten-free penne (in the event someone has any gluten-intolerance).  The prices aren't too expensive either, with all but one dish under $20.   The atmosphere works for many occasions, whether you want to go on a casual date, or just grab some good food with a friend. I wanted to note they were very accommodating, considering I was able to push my reservation back an hour at the last minute.
