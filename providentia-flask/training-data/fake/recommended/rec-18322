Seriously disappointed. The noise level was so high it was hard to hold a conversation. I was prepared to put up with this if the food had been better. Everything was seriously under seasoned. We ordered the shaved pork belly with watermelon and the meat had no flavour. As the table had no salt and pepper I am assuming the chefs would have fine tuned the seasoning. The steak was so under seasoned we had to request salt.
