This time we got a groupon for this place and were delighted yet again with the food. Everybody at the table enjoyed their meal. I got the Prix fix! It was a great deal! Came with soup, salad, app, entree and choice of ice cream, for $18.00.  Service was great too.  The atmosphere is relaxing and it's decorated in warm tones. There is always tons of parking as well.
