I give this a 4.5.  Considering how much of an establishment they've become I think it's time for a bit of an upgrade, at least some more seating options.  I don't like stalking people to get up just so that I can sit down at a table that already has three other people.  Then when I'm eating, the same happens to me, someone's watching me to finish just so they can take my seat. That said, the fries are GREAT.  Not too oily or salty, just right!  And the dipping sauces are just to die for. Sweet mango, smoked eggplant, sun dried tomato, pomegranate teriyaki ..I could go on and on about the great dipping flavors! Le sigh...so yummy!
