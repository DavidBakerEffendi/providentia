I heard about Clinton St. Baking Co. from The Food Network when the chefs/owners at Clinton St. Baking defeated Bobby Flay in a Blueberry pancake throwdown! We got really lucky, and only waited about 30 minutes for seats. We ordered the Wild Blueberry Pancakes, Egg Benedict, and the Strawberry Layer Cake. And as expected, the Blueberry pancakes were amazing! The pancakes were soft, fluffy and the best buttermilk pancakes I've ever had. The edges of the pancakes were crispy, and buttery. Every bite had blueberries, and the maple butter syrup was simply to die for! I love butter, so this was the best concoction ever created for the enjoyment of my tastebuds! The eggs benedict were nothing special. It was good, but nothing over the top. The Strawberry Layer cake was so delicious! The fluffy vanilla cake was so moist, and the strawberry buttercream was the perfect sweetness to compliment the cake. It was THAT good, that after we left, we decided to go back to grab another slice... There were two more slices left, so we bought the rest of the cake to take home! Clinton St. Baking Co. please expand to the West coast, so I can eat you for breakfast on a weekly basis. Haha :)
