ErMerGerd!!!!! You need this place in your life. The roomie and I went here for a light lunch before drinking and we were blown away by the deliciousness of the food. First the ambiance was beautiful, very dark with lovely music lightly playing in the background. The only thing is I felt corny with my six pack of PBRs 'cause I thought the hint was going to be similar to Pio pio - NOT. The menu is nice but we stuck with starters and they were uh-may-zing!  The Sashimi style app was mind blowing I could have ate 4 plates right there on the spot and the Jalea was so good.  The roomie and I were fighting over fish from the Jalea.  This is BYOB, and reasonably priced, the atmosphere is quiet and romantic, small tables and right on Bloomfield - we loved it!
