Excellent bakery on Park Street! When I lived in CT, I had gone to other bakeries in the area, but not this one. What a pity that I can only go whenever I make my pilgrimages home. Got a papa rellena (usually called relleno de papa by true boriquas) and tres leches cake. I quickly ate my stuffed potato ball as I pulled out of my space on the side of the street. Glorious! It must have been because I arrived at 7 am, because the outer breading was amazingly crispy and not greasy. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and and provided the perfect background for the inner treat of seasoned ground beef. Simply delicious. Criolla cooking at its very best. Tres leches was consumed before 8 am this morning as well. It was well made, but since I also make tres leches, I typically prefer a less sweet milk bath for the cake. The frosting is a merengue one, rather than whipped cream (which I don't like as much, though I recognize that it is usually the Latin Caribbean adornment for this dessert). Ladies, if you are frightened by catcalls, maybe going in the morning is the ideal time. Mostly middle-aged men in the area, though my experience was that they were polite (maybe extra nice because of my magenta leggins, knee-high boots, and leopard print scarf?) but not dirty and did not say/do anything to make me feel uncomfortable or in danger. Expand your horizons and start your day with Sol de Boriquen. That is exactly what I did today and already my day is starting out marvelously.
