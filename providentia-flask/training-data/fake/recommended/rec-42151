I had the lunch special here which is pretty generous. It's all vegetarian and I was interested in a degustation of it. I ordered the sesame seitan and hot & spicy soup. It seemed like a chewy type of chicken, taste was good. I didn't care for how chewy it was, it made it taste like it wasn't as fresh as it could have been. Overall an OK experience. Meal comes with free tea.
