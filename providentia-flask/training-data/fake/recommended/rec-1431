Amazing food! Great selection of fresh pasta, sauce and cheese. It is a little pricey, but I will never buy jar alfredo sauce again after having theirs. It was SO good! The fresh pasta was great and is something I will definitely treat myself to occasionally, it is very expensive compared to boxed pasta. Love checking out their specials as well!
