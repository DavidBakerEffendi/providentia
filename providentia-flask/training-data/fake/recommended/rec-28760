Best sub shop around. I like their cold cut subs, but they've got a variety of grilled chicken specialty sandwiches that are great too. Very friendly staff and filling food for the price. This place also has the best honey mustard sauce I've ever had; I know it's a weird thing to call attention to, but it's true.
