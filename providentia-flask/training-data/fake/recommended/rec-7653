Fine dining this is not, but it IS like going to your Oma's house and eating her solid, respectable German cooking. Â Great beer menu, sausage samplers with duck and elk in there, jagerschnitzel, spatzle, mushrooms- it's heavy, not entirely elegant food, yes, but completely delicious and charming. The waitstaff is friendly and even bear it out wearing German frau outfits, the decor is all the tchotkes and fake flowers your Oma refuses to throw away, and in a word, it is all GREAT.
