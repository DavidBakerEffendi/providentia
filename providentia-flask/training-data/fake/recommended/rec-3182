I went here for lunch one time and steamed buns the other time. I found the ssam (korean burrito) to be very good. You choose what you put in it and you can stuff it til it's about to explode. I am sure it is not lo-cal--but it sure is delicious. And the fillings seem fresh. I think there is a good balance of different flavors, too. And of course, the buns are great. But why no vegetarian option? The mushroom ones at Momofuku proper were so good, I was disappointed they didn't have them here.
