tried Pats and Geno's at the same time tonight. i was so thoroughly disappointed in this place. i really can't understand what the hype is all about. they are more impressed with handing you their sandwich before even giving you your change than making a great sandwhich. the meat seemed unseasoned and lacked any flavor what so ever. not to mention, i didn't even taste the provolone that was supposed to be on it. the service was also sub par, and that was very difficult considering we were only standing there for 1 minute. will never return to this place when in Philly again. it seems like they are settling in on their reputation as opposed to making good food.
