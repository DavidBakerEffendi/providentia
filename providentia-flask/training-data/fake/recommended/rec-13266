Dos Toros was started by some dudes from my hometown who were unimpressed by NY's Mexican offerings and wanted to make something akin to Gordo's.  For this I am eternally grateful to them.  I would say that Dos Toros is about half a star down from Gordo's but, as New York is the antithesis of Mexican food I can't really blame them.  Their burritos are good for two meals so the price is totally worth it, and definitely get guacamole.
