We came up to celebrate a friend's birthday a few weekends ago.  Finally sitting down to write a review of this amazing restaurant!  Our friends live in the area, so they invited us up to Seoul BBQ and Sushi for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  We were impressed the second we walked in.  Our children were amazed by all of the Korean art and artifacts hanging on the walls.  We were seated in a private room - a little tight but nice to have our own space.  So much easier to contain a rambunctious 4 year old :) We had a couple of different servers who made a few recommendations.  We settled on pork kalbi, bulgogi, dwenjang chigae, and sushi.  The banchan (side dishes) were delicious.  My favorite was the kkaktoogi (radish kimchi).  The bite sized pieces were addictive.  The bbq marinades were incredible!  The ssam jang (bean paste to eat with the meat) was perfect.  My 7 year old loved her sushi - "Two thumbs up!" ** To the reviewers who complained about cooking their own food - this is what makes Korean BBQ fun!  Part of the experience is grilling your own meat!  Korean BBQ is NOT hibachi.  The servers will come around, get you started, and check on your meat, but the point of having the grill at your own table is that you get to cook it!  My kids love this part.  At most Korean restaurants, they will cook the meat in the kitchen for you if you don't want to grill it yourself, but it definitely doesn't taste the same. ** Being from NYC, the prices weren't outrageous to us.  The amount of food you get is well worth the price. The only negative is being in a room, sometimes you get forgotten.  We did have to pop our head out to ask for refills on banchan.  They happily obliged.   Wish we lived closer so we could visit more often!  Like my 4 year old said, "This restaurant is DEEEEEEEEEE-licious!"
