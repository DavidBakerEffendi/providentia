Came here for brunch a few times, once on the weekend and recently on a Monday (yay for weekday brunches!). It's a cozy, fairly charming bistro made even cozier on weekends when it's packed. I have had the Eggs Benedict with ham, which comes with a good portioned salad and thin-cut fries for when I want savory as well as pancakes with mixed fruit (it was strawberries and bananas last time I came) for when I'm craving something sweet. Pancakes are all the rage here when it comes to brunch. They are incredible; don't bother dousing them with syrup, so you can savor each bite. Pricing for brunch is pretty fair at $10 or less (unheard of!) not including drinks of course. Make sure to bring cash as they don't take cards!
