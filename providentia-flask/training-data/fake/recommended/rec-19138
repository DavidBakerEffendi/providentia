I'd highly recommend popping in to Ruby's on an afternoon when you're doing some shopping amongst all og the great stores on Mulberry, Mott and Elizabeth Streets.  Ruby's is a no frills, kickin' music, little Aussie joint that seats maybe 15-20 people max.  Spartan wooden tables and super friendly Aussie surfer types complete the vibe....big windows open to the street when it's warm enough.   Menu is simple. Burgers and chicken sandwiches and a few smoothies.  The signature burger is called the Bronte and they really do things a bit differently on the burger front.  First, you get a side of field greens so you can ease your conscience a bit after just having gotten over your hangover.  The burgers are served on a longer french roll and are topped with sweet chili sauce.  I'm telling you, the sauce just puts these burgers over the top!  The smoothies are solid as well and I'd recommend the strawberry - banana.   Finally, they have one of the best mixes on their i-pod which ranges from top-40 rap to rock and roll, and they keep it just loud enough to get you amped up, but not so loud as to kill your conversation.  Have been a few times and have yet to be disappointed.  Check em' out next time you're getting your shop-on!
