Mother?  You're not Ruined (punny... groan). How I found myself at a house party in Soho where the amount of starched shirts rivaled the racks of the local dry cleaners', I'll never know.  What I do know is I needed to escape, I convinced my cohorts to escape with me, and the first place that came to mind was Mother's Ruin.   See, I'm a second chancer.  I had known I'd return to Mother's Ruin since writing the novela below, and considering my starched host had just served me a plastic cup full of warm-gin/splash-of-tonic (it must have been this drink that earned gin the nickname of 'mother's ruin') the time was nigh.   It was a Saturday night, yet everything fell into place so seamlessly.  There wasn't a line at the door.  We made our way to the end of the bar, and just as we were ordering our drinks four people left their barstools.  We sat down.  Let me say that again, WE SAT DOWN AT THE BAR.  A man with the opposite of a starched shirt (IE a mohawk) served me something cold, balanced, and delicious.  Patrons were cool.  Bartenders were cool.  Drinks were cool. You and I... we're cool, right?   Right. (Fist-bump)
