I like this place for a number of reasons. First off, the service is very kind and good. Very accommodating when it comes to seating their guests, even though they don't take reservations for parties under 6 people. The ambiance and detail to architecture inside is very fancy and pretty and the chandelier right in the middle is gorgeous. In regards to the food, I don't eat a lot of thai food, so i can't tell the difference between amazing and good, but i enjoyed my plate, which was an order of the room service pad thai. I also had one of their cocktails and the green tea ice cream. The cost is awesome. You'd think for a place so well decorated and popular, the food would be more expensive, but i think my plate was only 14 bucks, if that. I highly recommend coming here!
