Really disappointed. We came here on a really busy saturday night. The place was bustling, really really loud,  and we were excited for a great meal as we had heard great reviews. After the apps, (stuffed clams and 2 simple salads) the meal went downhill. 1) There was plastic in our pasta dish, they said it was guanciale casing - even so, that stuff should be taken off, it's inedible, literally! 2) When 3 mains came out at the same time, we inquired about the 4th, the lamb chops.  We were told that they had been overcooked so the chef was preparing a sauce to moisten it up.  Can you believe that?  I appreciate the honesty, but if you over cook a chop, you shouldn't serve it. They did serve it, and as described, it was over cooked . . . and covered in a strong alcohol flavored broccoli rabe. The servers never asked if we were ok with it (we weren't), and they were too busy for us to get their attention! 3) The chicken parm and veal parm were fine, but nothing special.  Tasted like they had been fried in advance, and just covered in red sauce and cheese and put under the broiler before they came out to us.  I should know better,  ever since I ate at Parm over on the east side,  no other chicken parm will do. If you haven't been there, check it out, the food is much better. 3) The ricotta cheesecake was unattractive to begin with, but was unacceptable when we tasted it.  1/2 was frozen, and the other 1/2 was hot, microwave? really? 4) We ordered 2, 1/2 bottles of wine and were charged for 2 full sizes.   5) Service was neither friendly nor efficient, though I appreciated that my glass was full of water.  3 hours later I'm still drinking water because it was so salty! Anyhoo, I don't review things that often, but I really wanted to like this place and was so let down.  I'd say spend your money elsewhere.
