I wish they had restaurants open all hours of the night like this one. I went with my 2 cousins and had the meal of a lifetime. The hors D'oeuvres were absolutely wonderful and the main course was to die for!! I truly enjoyed dinning at this venue. It was a great atmosphere to chat with my cousins and catch a late dinner.  If I lived in New York I would be there at least once a month if not more.  I definitely go every time I visit though. : )
