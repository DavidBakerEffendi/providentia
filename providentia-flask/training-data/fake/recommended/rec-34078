Holy S***, this is good food. I don't believe in over-hyped reviews, but Comme Ci Comme Ca is more than deserving. It's addictive. My co-worker got my office hooked, I got my boyfriend hooked, and he got his office hooked. This is my second trip back. I've had both the bismati and cous cous. The lemon chicken is my favorite, but I also enjoy the beef and kofta. The merguez doesn't ring my bell, but some of my co-workers favor it. The Royales, in my opinion, are an overload of flavors. It's just too much. I ask for just beef and chicken - over bismati they charge *I think* $9. I don't have much experience with Moroccan food, but the flavors are incredible. The Andalusian and Casablanca sauces are a must. I've yet to try to the olive sauce, but I'm excited to have it next time. Portions are huge, 1 plate is lunch for two days. It's never heavy, I don't feel weighed down. I encourage everyone to try it.
