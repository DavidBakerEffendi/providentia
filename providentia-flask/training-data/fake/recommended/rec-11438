I went here for happy hour a few weeks ago, and as I was disappointed that there was no "happy hour" I was not disappointed in Â my experience in village whiskey. The drinks were fantastic- great exotic combinations. The veggie burger was probably the best I have ever consumed. I have been here several times when I cannot even get in for a seat, so be prepared. The drinks are small and expensive but delicious, but hte food is reasonably priced. I will definitely be back!
