Came for Sunday brunch.  Place was loud and lively, giving it an energetic atmosphere.  Went for the unlimited / bottomless cocktails, $15 for 1 hour.  The coconut margarita was a bit of an odd combo and went for regular ones after.  They were pretty strong without tasting too strong, which is a win in my book.  The guac was phenomenal and the fish tacos were DELICIOUS - although there were just 2 small tacos which wasn't enough food.  3 would have been perfect.
