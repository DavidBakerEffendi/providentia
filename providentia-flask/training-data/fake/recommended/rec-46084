Come here for breakfast if you want properly cooked breakfast. I always come here when I crave omelette which comes in big serving. Â I like to come here on off days to do some readings over breakfast and have some peaceful time away from the kids. Pancake is good, although would have preferred it with a tad less salt. Staff is enthusiastic and helpful. One time DH's burger came out raw in the middle. The server had the kitchen cook another one quickly. It can get a little pricey here, for 2 adults and a kid, our bill was around $30 with beverages. That's why we come here for brunch and make the buck go further.
