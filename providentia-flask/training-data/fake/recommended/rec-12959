THERE IS A HEAVEN, and it is at SOCO with its fried chicken and sizzling mac-n-cheese. Best of all, your arteries won't feel clogged afterward! This place is happening .. DJ lightly spinning on Friday nights, food is ridiculously good, drink menu is creative and fresh .. I'm drooling as I'm writing this review. Service and ambience was on-point. Staff was kind and considerate, and always checked up on us at the right time and made sure the food was good, even on a busy Friday night. TRUST THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS! Unlike every other New Yorker, they're not trying to hustle you. Definitely worth the wait and the return trip!
