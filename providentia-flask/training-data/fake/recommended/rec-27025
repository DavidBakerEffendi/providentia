3.5 stars. Hostess was clueless....but the bartenders were amazing. Great place to watch the Sox Royals game. Very great local clientele base....with a ton of ales, beers, and libations. I like that you can try 3oz of various ales. Food looks pretty darn good too......It is very busy though on the weekends.
