An incredible spot tucked inside an art museum. Oysters bolognese, smoked mackerel and juniper potato salad with the best damn hot toddy I ever had. In general I despise the concept of lunch - so boring and predictable! But M Wells gives lunch a whole new reason for being. If Only they were open for Dinner!
