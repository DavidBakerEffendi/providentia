I come here for lunch every so often on workdays, and am always happy with my choice. The burritos are made with fresh, non-greasy ingredients, so you won't feel awful about yourself after eating it. I would say it's like a higher quality Chipotle, but the prices are about the same. The atmosphere is generally friendly, but be prepared to wait in a line during the lunch rush.
