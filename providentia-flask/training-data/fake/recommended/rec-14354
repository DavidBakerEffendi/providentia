This is a great hole in the wall with quality cheap food. Note that this is NOT a place to dine in....it's a little dirty and very hot Â inside, and there are barely any seats. And while there is some seating outside, you're going to be facing a construction site and garbage cans. It's definitely a to-go place. So I had the sesame pancake with veggies and fried veggie dumplings. The pancake blew me away. So yummy and so very filling! The veggie dumplings weren't anything special...I stopped eating after 2. It basically has the filling of a spring roll. Overall, good experience, and a haven for vegetarians looking for authentic chinese yumminess.
