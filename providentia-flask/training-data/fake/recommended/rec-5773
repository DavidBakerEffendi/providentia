It's a "nothing special" type of place, but good for people like me who need a food study break and something pretty quick and easy. My friend and I always share the fried shrimp dumplings, which are pretty satisfactory and a good way to whet our appetite. Nothing to complain about there. I always have General Tao's chicken with white rice, and I appreciate the pretty generous portions which I can take home and, voila, I have a meal for the next day. The chicken isn't heavy on the sauce, which I appreciate, and is slightly spicy, but still good. I prefer it to the Chinese place on 40th (Won's Oriental Restaurant). The ambience is pretty regular, again, nothing special. Overall, a good place for a study break, but definitely not a place to bring a date.
