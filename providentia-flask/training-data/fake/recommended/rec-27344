I had a friend take me here who grew up in the neighborhood eating their pizza.  It's not a fancy place by any means but the pizza is out of this world!  The ingredients are fresh and you'll see this when you watch them make your pie.  The olive oil they use is superb.  Make sure to ask for basil on your pizza - it makes a difference.
