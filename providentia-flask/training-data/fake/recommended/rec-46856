It's been awhile since I came back to Sabrina it was usually a good experience, but whatever you do, do not believe whatever time the hostess tells you. 25-35 mins? Sound reasonable. Until you wait for over 45 mins only for you to ask them how much longer the wait it. "Only another 25 mins" wtf. Seriously just tell your customer a fair estimate base on the previous wait time. So an hour and 15 mins later....but no worries.... Only another 25 mins before the food comes out of the kitchen. I didn't know you can "call ahead". There was 5 calls that call ahead and the hostess told all of them 35 mins. On another note, why is there empty table next to is when there are a bunch of people waiting before us?
