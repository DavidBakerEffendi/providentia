Cracking little bar with a very simple style yet an extensive wine and beer list. I've frequented The Other Room for a number of years and have seen it change from 'undiscovered gem' to crowded 'after work bar.' Â Ultimately the bar is fantastic when its not busy due to the fantastic wine and beer selections, enhanced by an educated indie music selection. If crowded standing patrons are sandwiched between the high banked seats and their accompanying tables and backs of guests chairs sat at the bar.
