I went here late afternoon on my birthday, on a Monday. I had GREATt service and I let the girls waiting on me pick the food, three courses. Fluke, ham and pork buns. All delicious, very friendly and fun. I'm confused as to why people would complain that the pork is fatty?? it's from a PIG for Christ's sakes! Pigs and pork are known to be fat! Am I wrong? DO I want to eat it everyday? (Well, yes, but I won't) everything in moderation...
