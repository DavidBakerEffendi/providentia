After looking at Frankfords website and Yelp, i was expecting this place to be raging.  We entered and there were almost crickets.  The restaurant was huge and maybe there were 15 ppl at the most.  I was expecting to be dining at the communal tables with the locals, that didn't happen.  We also came in the winter, i would like to come back in the summer when the patio is lively.  One plus of an empty resto was how fast the food came.  I made it through my whole trip without having a pretzel, so i had to order one.  The pretzel was larger than my head, deliicious.  We both had the brat and cabbage.  I guess the cabbage is traditional, but i didn't need it, the brat was perfect on its own.  I had the spaetzle which is basically like german mac and cheese, it was warm, creamy, and satisfying.   Overall, the food was well priced, arrived fast, we just missed out on the whole Frankford Hall experience.
