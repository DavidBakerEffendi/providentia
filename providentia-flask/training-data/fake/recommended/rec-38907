This place is not getting five stars only because we had to wait over two hours to get seated and get our food. With kids in tow, this was so painful - but the amazing food, really nice cocktails and swell staff completely make it worth it. (I would suggest, don't be silly like us Â - don't bring your kids, even though it says 'good for kids -yes'. It should be 'No' just because of the wait. But the kids did like the food too.) The best dishes we had: shellfish chowder, hangar steak, cavatelli with oxtail, pork buns, horseradish beets and polenta. Also, anywhere that plays Built to Spill is cool in my book. We will come back - on a date night.
