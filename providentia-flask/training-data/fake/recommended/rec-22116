If you don't mind waiting 45 minutes for brunch, you will surely be in for a treat. It also helps that two doors down there is a cozy bar where u can pre-brunch with a few mimosas while you wait for you're table. French toast was so yummy. A little tight on space but we had the table out front in the window. Worked out great. Love it!
