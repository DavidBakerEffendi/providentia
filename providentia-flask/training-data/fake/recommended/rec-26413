Stumbled upon this place while in search for a light meal to ease my hunger until dinner that was scheduled for late in the evening. I wanted a chicken soup, but they were out of it, and was recommended the chicken pozole soup instead.  So I did, and what a great decision that was. The broth rich green soup was mildly spicy, limey, and extremely delicious.  I imagine this would be a perfect winter warming dish when weather gets colder. While the price was on the higher end ringing in just a little over $12, they give you a sizable portion plus two toastados, which was way more than the snack size I anticipated, so over half had to be taken home to be consumed later in the day. Based on another yelp review, it appears that they change up the recipe, using different ingredients (my soup was green), and chicken, pork, or maybe even fresh fish.   This soup is not on the regular menu, so ask for availability.
