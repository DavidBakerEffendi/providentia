El Camino Real was really delicious! I started off with chips, salsa and guacamole. The chips were lightly dusted with a chili powder mix so that helped me to not eat as many! The salsa was so-so, heavy on the cilantro but the guacamole was incredibly fresh and quite tasty. For the main course, I would highly recommend the enchiladas. They were out of this world! There's a crunchy tortilla layer on the bottom, then 3 good-sized enchiladas smothered in a perfectly spiced red sauce with a fried egg on top for good measure. I had the cheese variety but there were several other options for meat-eaters as well. I sat at the bar where the service was exceptionally quick even though the place was pretty packed. If you're in the Northern Liberties area and enjoy good Tex-Mex, I would highly recommend a trip to El Camino Real. I can't wait to go again!
