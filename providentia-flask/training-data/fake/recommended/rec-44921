It's good ramen, but really good ramen should not require reservations or a 2 hour wait. Granted, the two hour wait gave me time to subway back to Brooklyn in order to fetch my car, but that's just silly. That nonsense aside, quite good, fine service, and I don't remember the ambiance since it was late, and I was too hungry to notice. I would go back, but this time I'll plan on reserving or showing up at 10:30pm.
