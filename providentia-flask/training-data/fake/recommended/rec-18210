There seem to be some really negative reviews of Osteria related to the service and the quality/portion size of the food, but I have nothing but positive things to say about my recent experience.  The lady and I stopped in for dinner last night and enjoyed a lovely meal and drinks.   We started off at the bar for a glass of Prosecco, which was crisp and refreshing and were whisked away almost immediately to our table.  We debated our meal choices for a few minutes, which I'd attribute to the many appealing items on the menu. We shared the Pecorino Flan and the Barbabietole pizza to start.  Both were tasty, though the pizza was larger than we were expecting and we subsequently ate more than was necessary or advisable. Next up was a couple of pastas.  The Goat Cheese Gnocchi for me and the Rabiola Francobolli for her.  This time, much more reasonable portion sizes, but this is where we should have called it a night. Instead, we exercised some questionable (and undoubtedly gluttonous) judgment and started on the next course.  Another pasta (the name and contents of which I've suddenly forgotten) for the missus and the Braised Pork Ribs for me.  Good grief.  So tasty and so much food.  All of this paired nicely with a couple glasses of the Montepulciano. And did we have the Blood Orange Tiramisu for dessert?  Yes.  Yes we did. While the argument could be made that food should not generally cost this much, it's nice to know that when it does, it's going to be crazy delicious.
