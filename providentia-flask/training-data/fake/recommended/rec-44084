Awesome hand pulled noodles. I was entertained watching how the chef made the noodle. Amazingly fast and skillful! I got the sliced beef noodle soup and my boyfriend got the lamb. They were both delicious, but the sliced beef was the better of the two. The broth had more umami than the lamb. I'm so glad I tried this place out. I can't wait to check out the hand pulled noodle places in NYC
