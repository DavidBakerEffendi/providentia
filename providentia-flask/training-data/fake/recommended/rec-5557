I was a little disappointed with Tia Pol. Yes, the space is nice, they take reservations, and the service was very attentive. However, the food didn't really live up to my expectations. The best thing we ordered were the fried chickpeas. Dusted with a spice blend, they almost resembled popcorn. The tortilla came out, and was too stiff and cake-like. It shouldn't be gooey by any means, but it should be a little softer. This seemed like it had spent too much time sitting out. We also tried the pan con tomate with 3 salsas: stewed peppers, fava bean puree, and olive tapenade. There wasn't enough garlic rubbed on the bread, and the tapenade was off. I didn't even go back for more, and I usually inhale tapenade. The croquetas and patatas bravas came last, as they were the hottest. You can't really go wrong with ham and cheese croquettes with bechamel; they were good. The patatas bravas were definitely subpar. They needed more spice, more garlic, more kick, and less Hellman's. The mayo was too tangy and Americanized, and not the perfect Spanish creamy aioli that it should have been. Sigh, still searching for my perfect Spanish restaurant in NYC..
