I live just down the block and always enjoy my brunches here. The food is fresh, made on-site and the rosewater in the fruit salad is heavenly. I also like the mini complementary scones. Friendly wait staff to boot! My one complaint is that i find sometimes that there is a peculiar odor leading up the stairs into the restaurant - it's that or that the restaurant needs to use better smelling cleaning products that are not so acidic to the nasal passages. It is off-putting to smell this before you enter and are prepared to eat. But nonetheless, I now just plug my nose, enter and enjoy a great brunch.
