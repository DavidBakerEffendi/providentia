I experienced Giorgio on Pine with fellow Yelper Matt L. and we had a really pleasant experience.  We went for lunch on a Sunday and the owner was there, ready to serve with a smile.  I had heard from the glutenfreephilly blog that there are GF options for pasta and pizza here.  I did not try the pizza (shame on me) but we both tried a pasta dish each, shared the beef carpaccio salad, and had creme brulee for dessert.  It was so nice to go to a real Italian restaurant who knew about gluten free, and labeled his menu accordingly!  How convenient! The beef carpaccio - thin-cut beef with capers, field greens and just a touch of olive oil - was good.  The owner guy split it for two so we shared.  All pasta sauces are gluten free here, so you can take your pick (woo hoo).  I had fusilli with a creme/tomato sauce, peas, shitake mushrooms & prociutto.  It was very good, a touch salty but hey, I'll take it.  The GF pasta was cooked perfectly - al dente.  It's very easy to overcook it.  Beef ragout looked good, too, which is what Matt L. tried.  The creme brulee was good  - definitely was freshly "torched".   I cannot wait to go back and try the pizza!
