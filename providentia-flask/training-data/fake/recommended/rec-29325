One of the best beer selections in the area.  Unlike many other bars, they actually do a print menu with tasting notes for each beer which is really helpful when deciding what to try.  The crowd is quite heavy during happy hour and it can be difficult to get to the bar.  Go later in the evening and you'll get right in.
