It's a diner....but it's a good diner.  As good as Tom's Restaurant on the UWS of Manhattan or any number of NYC diners (which I desperately miss - O how, o how did I end-up in Joisey???).  And its open 24-7.  And it's got a parking lot.  Madame Cash Register can be a bit brusque sometimes; but she is efficient. My only question: what the hell are "disco fries"?!?  This seems to be a key feature of cuisine de Nouvelle Jersey that I have somehow missed-out on completely...
