Was out in Philly for the weekend and was trying to find a good place to get a good cheesesteak. Everybody I spoke to mentioned either Pat's, Geno's or Jim's as being the go-to spot. We chose this place because it was on the way to the airport. I'm glad we did. The cheesesteaks were amazing. Humongous pile of meat, seasoned to perfection, perfect amount of cheese. And they were actually nice (which from what I hear, is not the norm in Philly). Great experience. I'll come back when I'm back in Philly.
