Yummmmm I just want a bottomless pitcher of their margaritas! We all know margs can easily be disgusting. Too sweet, too sour, too salty, etc. These were just the perfect mix. I'll be dreaming of these... Could perhaps be the reason the food tasted so delicious as well. Because I was probably 2 to 3 pitchers deep (it was shared, don't worry!). I had the portabello burrito and it was stuffed to the gills with the good stuff. I shoved the whole thing down. No lie. Also, I must note the pickle chips. Fried pieces of pickled heaven. My mouth is watering as I type this. Sadly, I hear they're taking them off the menu. Maybe a petition needs to be made to keep them on. Great bar food option! I'd love to come back here for the casual atmosphere, but more importantly, those smooth margaritas!
