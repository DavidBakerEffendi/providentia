Wow, awful, awful service. I imagine most of the employees are relatives of the owner, and that's why they are able to keep their jobs after doing such terrible jobs? This place is run awfully. My husband and I just ordered $40 worth of food from Coppelia through Seamless. An hour and a half later and it still hasn't been delivered. I call and speak with Erica, who is extremely rude. She says they didn't have internet, and thus never got the order. She believed it wasn't her fault. When I asked why they were still taking orders via Seamless if they weren't processing orders, she rudely said that decision was made by the owner and I'd have to complain to him (of course he's not around for me to talk to). Ugh. Ruined our night. My only time eating in house was also a disaster.  My food took forever, as a gaggle of servers just stood around the entire time. When I finally got my bill, they had overcharged us by $100! When my sister and I pointed that out, the server acted as if we were the ones who made a mistake.  It took them 20 minutes to give us the right bill, even after I asked them to hurry since my sister had to catch a bus out of New York. It was one of the only times I've ever not left a tip. It's a shame too because their food is pretty decent.
