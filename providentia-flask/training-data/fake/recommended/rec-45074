Little Owl is one of my favorite restaurants in the whole city.  It is the quintessential West Village restaurant -- intimate, charming, unpretentious, and romantic.  I've never had brunch here, but everything on the dinner menu is AMAZING, with the tender, melt-in-your-mouth scallops being my favorite.  In my experience, the waiters have always been friendly, accomodating, and helpful. The only problem is that the restaurant is tiny and very popular, so you generally need to make reservations at least a month in advance or you will end up having to wait for an hour or two.  Sometimes there is a wait even if you have reservations.  Regardless, the oustanding food, atmosphere, and service make Little Owl well worth the wait!  If it was less expensive, I would eat here every night.
