Wait... so I'm in the West Village and you're not going to charge me $20 for a burger? And you're not going to give me a menu with things I've never heard of on it? And you're going to give me a deeelicious burger. Well alright then. The super-meaty, medium-rare, no-frills burger seriously hit the spot. Sit in the window and people-watch while you sip your McSorley's with that. Major win all around.
