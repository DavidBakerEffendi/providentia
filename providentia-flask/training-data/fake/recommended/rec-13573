Looking for a nice and cosy way to spend your evening in TriBeCa? Then head to the Greek. Really good cocktails (ANY cocktail...), and traditional greek food. Try a little bit of everything, since a lot of the plates are like tapas. The place looks really amazing, with wood everywhere, nice big tables. You can sit at the bar and talk to other people, or choose the privacy of a small table. You can also enjoy a table outside, as it is not a crowded street. Loved it!
