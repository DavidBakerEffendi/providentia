The most reviewed Halal Cart in New York and you know why it is. They are open late and the line is always there. This place should be shown on food network if it already hasn't been. I wish I was just more hungrier to eat it all. I ordered the combination which came with rice, chicken, gyro and pita. I added the white sauce and spicy sauce. The spicy sauce is spicy. You have to make sure you watch how much you put. I'm not much for too spicy but this will give you some punishment if you don't watch it. The white sauce was great. I wish I added more. I should have saved my leftovers to have for breakfast but I didn't. I wanted more in the end.
