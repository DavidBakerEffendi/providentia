Oh, Cafeteria... Where else would you enjoy amazing mac & cheese + PDA at 3 AM on a Sunday morning ? The crowd and the menu are equally tantalizing. You will likely have to wait without a reservation, even in the wee hours of the night. But don't despair, the bar is more than welcoming. Brownie points: - Flexible with off-the-menu requests; - Attentive service, maybe a little too attentive! (really, if my plate is half full and food was brought 10 mins ago, it may not be the best idea to ask if I'm done.)
