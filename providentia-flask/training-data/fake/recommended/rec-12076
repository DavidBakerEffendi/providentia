I had a terrible experience here.  After a two hour wait for a table we come into the crowded dining room.  Since it was so busy here when we went, the service will not be included in my review or rating.  That one star is for the food alone. To start off, the prices of the menu are high but since I did not enjoy the food one bit, it's a terrible value.  The beer selection is nice though with many microbrews to choose from.  The lounge waiting area is a good touch. The rootbeer tasted AWFUL.  I've had homemade rootbeer before and i usually enjoy it but this tasted absolutely foul.  The milkshake tasted literally like MILK.  It seemed there was enough ice cream just to make it slightly more thick than heavy cream.   Now for the entrees.  We all got different types of burgers.  My grass fed beef burger literally TASTED LIKE GRASS.  It was awful.  I've had grass fed beef before, but it never had the stench of grass like this did.  I will admit though that the other ingredients did seem fresh.  The turkey burger tasted pretty ordinary.   We left here very dissatisfied and hungry still. The best thing about the farmhouse is the beer but theres plenty of other places for that.  It seems very popular among the younger late 20's to early 30's crowd.
