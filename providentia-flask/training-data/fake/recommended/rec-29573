Besides the not so spectacular beer menu - the food is horrible. I went here with a friend of mine after hearing some hype about this place. Service for drinks and food was slow and served with attitude - PLUS when I did get my beer, the glass my beer was served in has lipstick all over it! YIKES! Hello?? is anyone at the bar paying attention? Needless to say, that was my first and last trip back there. And if you are looking for Belgian beers, there are MUCH better places in that neighborhood and around the city!
