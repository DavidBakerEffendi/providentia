Awesome rehab. Corrected everything I didn't like about layout of former tenant, Mugshots. Coffee is better at Rybread, but you can't beat this view. The food is generally excellent, but I've had a few disappointments. Their baked goods are often hit-or-miss. My last meal there was a summer squash sandwich which was very tasty and reasonably priced. I don't go here too often because it gets chaotic on weekends. I'm glad OCF came to Fairmount, but they need to figure out how to handle the saturday crowds a little better.
