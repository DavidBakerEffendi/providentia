Delicious dinner last evening. Everything was perfectly prepared. This was our first visit and we were greeted warmly. Server was knowledgable and excellent.  The asparagus pizza was perfectly cooked and asparagus were not overcooked. Scallops amazing.  Side of beets and carrots delicious. AND the chicken presentation really complementary. We will be back ! Yum!!
