COuldn't have asked for a better place to ring in my birthday!!  Was not expecting this place to be so busy on a weekday evening but thanks to my tiny tot in hand we were given a table right away.  The ambience is very interesting...the music LOUD (you really have to talk aloud to be heard over the din)...the servers enthusiastic  & the food's delectable.  ALl in all a very fun experience.
