Daily News Sept. 4, 2011 did a Best of NY page on "Best Dumplings" & whereas Joe's Shanghai (3 locations) got #1 - Prosperity got a commendable 2nd listing with their price being the best deal. E. Dumpling House on W. 106th came in 3rd. Â I remember making a special trip down there years ago & accidentally found myself there once again which is rare considering they are in such an odd place. You have to really be hungry & in the mood for Chinese dumplings to warrant the visit. If I lived nearby I'm sure I would go all the time & probably be fat & unhealthy. I haven't spent much time on YELP & am mainly writing this review in order to find the info quickly next time I'm heading out to lower E. Side/Chinatown area. How else do you earmark favs here?
