Hunting for real merchandise in the "bootleg triangle" of Canal, Walker, and Centre Streets can really work up an appetite! But where can you go to get a decent meal when you've spent all your money on polo shirts with upside down embroidery, or designer cologne made from a whole slew of chemicals listed on the EPA's most toxic list? As long as you have a dollar in your pocket, you can satisfy your hunger at Prosperity Dumpling, located on nearby Eldridge Street. In all honesty, I love this place. The dumplings are delicious and an outstanding value at five for a dollar. I love seeing giant woks of these little pockets of pleasure steaming away in the kitchen. Inevitably though, my eyes are bigger than my stomach, and I always purchase more than I can eat. As good as this place is, I probably wouldn't travel out of my way to eat here. Fortunately for me, there are an abundance of birthdays on my calendar, so I'll be back to the triangle for gifts galore, and dumplings at Prosperity Dumpling...oh so many dumplings!
