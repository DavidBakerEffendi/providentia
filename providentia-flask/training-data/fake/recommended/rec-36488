What a great joint, in the French way. Total brasserie. Sat at the bar (1&1/2 hour wait on a cold windy Saturday) and it was perfect. Bloody Mary, omelet (perfect) and the how famous fries. Topped it of with a great glass of Cote de Beaune. For a over hyped and somewhat overpriced spot, it delivered. With that reputation, the food better not be just fiat or the chef off his game. It will be a must every time I'm back in the city. My first 5 stars!!!
