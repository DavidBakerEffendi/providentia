Really, really good pizza, but still not convinced it was worth the line. And yes, I'm sure this had nothing to do with my spoiling my appetite with some luscious butter pecan icecream from the adorable place at the end of the boardwalk. It's just - over an hour? Come now, certainly you jest? Yes, the crust is great, and sure the sauce and mozzarella complement each other well...but really? I mean, have you tried Spacca Napoli in Chicago? The pizza may be just a tad pricier, but just as fabulous (if not a tiny bit, dare I say it, better!) and the there's no line in sight. You may wait a while sometimes, but getting a table fast mostly involves only good common sense. Namely, don't arrive at 8 pm on a weekend evening. That's all. I've said my piece (haha, the pun was unintional but amusingly appropriate). Don't hate me.
