Yum! Yum! Yum!!! The Taquitos De Carne are the absolute best I have ever had! The only other tacos I have had that come close to these are a little stand on Melrose and Vermont at 2am (Los Angeles). Lol! But seriously, this place is perfect for people watching and having fantastic tapas! Check out their daily specials also. I frequent Yuca's every time I am in the city; it's worthy of your time and taste buds!
