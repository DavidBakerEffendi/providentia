Cute little restaurant, delicious food, and great service.   We got the oysters, goat cheese and beet salad, blackened catfish, steak and chocolate banana bread pudding.   Everything was excellent but the catfish was a star.  The creole mustard coleslaw and black-eyed peas and bacon were the best accompaniments to a generous serving of perfectly cooked fish.  Bread pudding is probably one of the best I've had - a close runner up to the one from Blue Ribbon Bakery.   Can't wait to go back and try their famous fried chicken!
