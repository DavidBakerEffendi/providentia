Best pesto I've ever had... seriously (including Italy).  Try the Penny Egg Sandwich on a croissant and french fries for breakfast, you will be dying to go back.  Always a line for brunch Saturday and Sunday's, but worth the wait (plus enjoy your coffee while you wait from the self-service machine near the host stand). Best brunch place in Murray Hill (possibly even Manhattan).
