I tried the Pop up last year when I was in town for New Years. This time back in NYC, I HAD to give the new MU a try. The space was amazing, love all the details in the design of the space. I tried the Mu ramen, UNI, Gyoza and mussels this time and everything was ahhhmazing. The UNI was just like how I remembered, fresh and decadent. Gyoza was rich with foie and quince compote. The mussels was my favorite dish out of all the treats. They add a rice ball to the broth at the end when you are done with the mussels. So fun The Mu Ramen was delicious, rich with flavors of oxtail and bone marrow. Game changer to the ramen scene. Wish I lived closer so I can come back more often. Alas, see you next time Mu Ramen!!
