If you like NY style pizza, you'll love this.  It's a million times better than the other pizza places in the area.  It's most similar to Ramunto's in Lebanon, but better for many reasons.  One of the things I like best about the place is that they use as much local produce as possible.  Their meat and cheese comes from McNamara's dairy farm down the road.  They have local craft beers on tap, e.g. Harpoon, Dogfish Head.  The atmosphere inside is pretty nice - good wide screen tv's, gentle mood lighting that isn't too dim nor too bright.  I can vouch for their pepperoni pizza, cheese pizza, and buffalo chicken pizza (although I skipped on the blue cheese and asked for a side of ranch, persona preference).  The staff are all nice and helpful.  The only downside for me is that country music was playing on the stereo, but it was background music.  I don't know if they vary their music at all.  Oh yeah, they also have amazing happy hour deals 7 days a week. For the reviewer who gave it a 1, read the coupon next time.  Ramunto's coupons have the same limitations (good Sun - Thurs only).
