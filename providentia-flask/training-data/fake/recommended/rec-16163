This may be the only non-tourist spot in the Times Square area.  I've come here on a number of different occasions and for a number of reasons and I've always left happy.  For a quick bite to eat and drinks before a show, they're fast and friendly...During a business lunch, they're attentive, but not pushy, and for late(ish) night drinking, they make sure your glass is well tended to. The burgers are fantastic as are the mussels (which is to be expected from a Belgian restaurant!)
