My boyfriend and I were visiting Philly, and El Vez was the first place we stopped in (for dinner) when we got to town. It also happened to be Cinco de Mayo. We were a bit surprised to arrive at what appeared to be more like a club... super loud music, dancing, etc. But, we were excited to be in Philly, so we went for it. I got some fish tacos... they were a bit much. The flavor was rich, but they were very greasy tasting. We got some chips and guacamole, and it was overpriced and not that great. The chips were super greasy as well. The reason this place deserves two stars at all is because of their blood orange margaritas -- they are amazing. But that's it.
