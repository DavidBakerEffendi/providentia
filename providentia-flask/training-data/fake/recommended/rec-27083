Dirty, poorly managed, terrible service, staff doesn't even understand English well enough to get your order correct. Â But damn, they have the best bagels in the area; especially flat bagels! That's the only reason I gave a second star, and the only reason I come back. This place is literally filthy, the walls have stains on them, and the staff itself is scarcely much cleaner. I would not touch or eat anything in here except the bagels. I once saw a staff member knock an entire stack of paper coffee cups on the floor (which is grimy and disgusting). The stack rolled along the floor and under a rack display chips. The staff member simply retrieved the cups and put them back next to the coffee without even attempting to clean them. I woild have liked to see her throw them out and put out a new stack, or at the very least to try and clean them or wipe them down with a (clean) rag. It turned my stomach.
