I Visited beautiful Rittenhouse Square and wished to eat brunch overlooking the glorious park. I chose the trendy but corny "Rouge". As expected the view was superb. However, the food sub par and service a disgrace. We ordered drinks which we didn't receive until after we began our main course. The waitress never returned to inquire if there was anything we needed. The food bland, uninspired and would call it typical but fancy bar food. Unfortunately, bad bar food. Let's hope the owner sells to a businessman with culinary talents and the love for a historic, beautiful area that deserves so much more.
