I love this place. The atmosphere is right, the servers are friendly, and the food is great. It gets crowded on the weekends, but it's worth waiting. Make sure you have everyone in your party there or else they won't seat you...or else get excited about hanging out at the bar (not such a bad option - & if you're alone you can enjoy the sounds of Barboncino - 2 parts patrons' conversations, 1 part jazz).
