$32 for the difara classic - onions, mushrooms, sausage, peppers The good Topped with basil -gives it a nice touch Crispy thin crust made to order freshness flavorful fresh toppings The bad $32 is overpriced a tad overhyped 1 hr wait Half the pizza was burnt - I don't appreciate  the taste of cancer in my mouth Its good pizza but if you think through the hype its just an expensively fresh high quality half burnt pizza. You can taste the patience the old gentlemen puts into his pizzas but this will probably be a one time thing for me. I would recommend this place to others who want to try "the best" pizza in the US shine.yahoo.com/photos/a… $5 a slice or at least $28 for a whole (8 slices). Getting individual slices yields less of a wait time ~20 mins versus getting a whole pie.
