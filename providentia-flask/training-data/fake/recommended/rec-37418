This is an awesome and hidden spot. Natural light from the ceiling windows.  Theres literally a tree in the middle of the place! We tried the sashimi don everyone is talking about and it was delicious. Fresh sashimi!! I wish the sandwiches had a little more, maybe a salad on the side or something... But you get what you pay for.  I got there at 10:10AM ish and it filled up really quickly. It smells a little odd, maybe a little earthy, but i think its because of the tree and because the floor seemed mostly untouched. The waitress didn't have good peripheral vision and it took a while to get her attention when i needed something.   Food: 4 Service: 3 Mood/ambience: 5 Total experience: 4
