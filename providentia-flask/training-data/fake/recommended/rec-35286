It's alright. Nothing to rave about. Had the chicken/avacado summer roll (dry and tasteless), Thai ribs (also dry and tasteless ) and the only decent two meals: pineapple and spicy pork fried rice and veggie pad Thai. Also mediocre. We sat at the bar and it felt like the bartenders were watching us. Loud/younger crowd.  I could see it being great meet up for geoups, but personally not a fan. Most likely not coming back unless I'm in the area and all other restaurants are booked. [And NO, I wasn't on my phone writing a review or taking pictures  while the food was cooling on the table.]
