What a pleasant surprise! Saleya was able to easily accommodate my group of coworkers for an impromptu lunch and in turn blew us away with the food and overall experience. In a crowded scene of eateries, Saleya is a welcome addition and a flash of life. The majority of my group ordered some variety of pizzas and sandwiches, and each was outstanding. Walking in, I knew I would be in for some tough lunch choices as everything we went passed looked more appealing than the last. After all the orders came, I felt the need to sample nearly everything that was ordered and came away particularly impressed by the Wild Mushroom & Truffle, and Spinach, Bacon, and Goat Cheese pizzas. Both are delicious, come served with a small salad, and are visually appealing for all you instagram-minded folks out there. As a testament of the popularity they've already gained in the neighborhood, there were at least 3 separate groups waiting to grab our tables when we finished. I'll definitely be back in again for food, and have aspirations of stopping by for a happy hour; the vast selection of libations look mouth-watering.
