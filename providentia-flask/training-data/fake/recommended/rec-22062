Fav spot in hood! Great wines, which makes sense for a wine bar, but if you want to start off a great meal with a cocktail--no problem--cocktail menu is perfect. The food has never been anything other than AMAZING. I suggest the meatballs, polenta and the charcuterie. The atmosphere is warm but sophisticated. Love this spit for cozy friend evening, date night, or just go out by yourself night.
