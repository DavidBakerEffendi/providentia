NYC you're so lucky to have the meatball shop! I love coming here for lunch or dinner when i'm in the city. I love the ambiance, music and vibe here. I walked here for lunch today and sat at the bar. I got the original balls with tomato sauce and provolone cheese. The side salad served was awesome. love the dressing and sliced apples... and for additional sides we had spinach, risotto and palentas. Couldn't pass up the ice cream sandwich and ordered chai ice cream with ginger cookie. Great place for lunch and dinner. Lunch seems like a better time to go wait wise. A def must if in NYC!!! Thank you meatball shop of being of existence. If you're looking for something simple get the naked balls! Love the menu/ordering set up. 5 stars for the win! I'm a fan! Miss Yelp 2014
