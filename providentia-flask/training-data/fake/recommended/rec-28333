I've heard a lot about their pizza - so one night after work I stopped by with the bf for Artichoke pizza slices.   It was delicious, hot, gooey, cheesy & all over YUM! It is thick and basically spinach & artichoke dip on pizza. However, I HATE that you buy your slice and stand in the sidewalk to eat it.  Personally, it's uncomfortable and a hot mess. So next time I will go to their sit-down location for my fix.   *Tip:  Check-in on yelp and get a free beer! :)
