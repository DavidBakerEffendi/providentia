Awesome, decadent, over-the-top buttery meal. Highlight was the lamb (simple and stand out) and chicken/poached egg starter. Just perfect, creamy, deliciousness. Monkey bread is great (no brainer) but actually don't recommend it because it cramped my hunger for the rest of the meal, which made the experience a bit less enjoyable. Crab pasta was also phenomenal. Kiwi/grape cocktail was really yummy but not the best pairing with savory food.
