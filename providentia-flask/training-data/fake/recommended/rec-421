We came here during the Feast of San Gennaro to escape the maddening crowds. Glad we made that decision! I had actually seen previous Yelp reviews and had booked mark Pellegrino's for when I get my next pasta craving (which is pretty often). The outside seating is extended further in the road, as they shut down Mulberry street during the festival. This is where we sat and it was a perfect day to do so. Everything was fantastic - from the fresh, warm bread to the freshly grated parmesan cheese they offer as a condiment to the home made pastas. I am a huge Gnocchi fan, it's safe to say that "I know my gnocchi" and this was the real deal. Small rustic looking potato dumplings in a fresh, favorsome basil pesto. Topped with great service, a bustling ambiance, and not to forget the Sangria - it all made for a perfect Sunday afternoon lunch. I'm glad I booked marked it and made it there! Would definitely recommend this as a good choice among all the options in Little Italy.
