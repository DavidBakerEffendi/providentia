Is there not a way to give more than 5 stars?? This place was amazing. Best meatballs ever. The server wasn't super nice but he was true Italian, and very funny. I felt like we had a true Italian experience. We sat on the street patio during the street festival and had a great view of the street madness. Had a chat with the owner, who was nice, but the food was amazing. Great spot!
