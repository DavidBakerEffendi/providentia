Damn good lobster rolls!!!! I tried the Connecticut style roll (in butter) and the traditional Maine style (mayo), both were great. But I have to say I'm a sucker for that mayo! The lobster claws were just packed onto that small roll and it was delicious!!! I was broke after, but it was worth the try! Would I trek all they way out to no where again for the roll.... um... prob not. If I find myself in that part of Brooklyn I'll stop by, but with gas, traffic, and paying $15 for rolls that won't really fill you up, I'll find some other place. We did head over to Difara's for pizza right after, so I wasn't planning on filling my tummy with lobster anyways.
