This place really impressed me - not only the ambience, the quality of food, but also the surprisingly reasonable price, friendly staff, and great Beatle's music. We came with three people so we decided to try a la carte instead of the tasting menu so that we could try more dishes. My favorites are Fois gras soba, pan roasted branzino (the best fish entree I have had in a while), and the fried mountain burdock. Everything else we tried are of great quality (shortrib sashimi, mini burger, ikura uni rice bowl, fried sweet potato). Drink wise, I loved the Rosie - not too sweet and very refreshing, and the touch of rosemary worked perfectly with the whiskey based drink. The service is attentive, polite, and appropriate. It is a place you can come back many many times and feel like a friend's kitchen. Great for date, friends' catch up, or even just by yourself for a relaxing evening.
