Brunch at Venturo is a must. I have to admit that when I came during restaurant week for dinner, I was completely underwhelmed. However, brunch blew me away. Beautiful roses sat in vases on the tables and the sunlight lit the restaurant beautifully. I could tell this was going to be a good meal. On the recommendation of the waiter, I got the Farro egg bowl with confeit tomatos, brussel sprouts, goat cheese and pesto (and a side of bacon). I was blown away. It is a simple dish packed with flavor. It was light and refreshing and perfectly filling. I would have left the restaurant completely satiated and just the right amount of full, but decided to indulge. A side of bacon which was cooked perfectly added a bit of savory to my main. I topped it all off with a lemon tart for desert which was like a key line pie (my fav!). The waiter also gave me a sticky bun topped with maple syrup and almonds (which I'll pass on next time). I'll definitely be back for brunch. I think this is a love affair in the making.
