Just had mother's day brunch here and it was yummy!  We tried most items between the 3 of us (eggs Benedict, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, French toast, blintzes, home fries, penne vodka, Lobster ravioli, assorted fruits and veggies, donuts, cannoli, so many cakes).  We didn't have any of the fish, chicken, beef, or ham dishes.  No particular reason, just went for the other stuff.   Almost everything was great.  The pancakes, French toast and waffles, while delicious, were cold and didn't feel super fresh.  Everything else was perfect. Highlights were the home fries, the pastas, the orange juice, the donuts, and the cheesecake. I would absolutely recommend and go again.
