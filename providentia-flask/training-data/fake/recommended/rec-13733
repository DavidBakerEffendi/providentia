I fell in absolute love with Jimmy's after my very first bite of deep fried deviled egg. Since that fateful day it has become my favorite diner in the 5 boroughs. I'd like to think that statement carries some weight, as I hail from NJ. Literally everything I've ingested at Jimmy's in my several dozen visits has been uber-yummy. I have never received a plate of food that wasn't done as well as it was the last time I had it. Anything fried here is stand-out good, notably the eggs, chicken, homemade tater tots, etc. They do a KILLER burger, and a hella good milkshake - get the key lime pie flavor, with bits of graham cracker crust in the shake. Your stomach will thank you, even if your heart doesn't.
