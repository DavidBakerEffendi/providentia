We went here because A) we had a groupon to try SuzyQue's and B) we love BBQ.  There was no wait and we were seated immediately in the main dining room.  The first thing out of our waitresses mouth was "do you have a living social deal or groupon?"  Why yes we did. We started with the wedge salad.  Half a wedge of lettuce over tons of blue cheese, chopped cherry tomatoes, and bacon.  It was tasty, and large enough for two, but after a few bites it was too salty for my liking. For dinner we each ordered the BBQ Combo Platter.  This is definitely a good entree to start with if you are new to this restaurant: brisket, chopped pork, St. Louis Style Ribs, Baby Back Ribs, and chicken wings.  Just to note: I think people who don't like the ribs here must not be fans of dry rub.  I love dry rubbed ribs and these were good ribs that I would definitely come back for.  Normally I don't go crazy over Baby Back Ribs, but these were big, meaty, and oh so good especially covered in their St. Louis Style vinegar based BBQ sauce.  I didn't care for the chopped pork, but the boyfriend liked it.  In fact I think he liked everything because he almost wiped his plate clean.   In terms of the sides get the mac and cheese.  It is so freaking amazing good that I easily would have been happy ordering mac and cheese for dinner in a BBQ Place.  The sweet potato fries are like any other.  The potato salad was nice and creamy with a vinegar bite.   The boyfriend says 2 thumbs up.  Large portion for the price which I find nice.  Would definitely come back for the mac and cheese and "baby back ribs...BBQ sauce."
