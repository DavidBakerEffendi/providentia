After seeing that this restaurant received nearly 100 reviews at almost 5 star, my husband and i decided to try this place. First i want to say  the service was great. Everyone was very kind. On the other hand, the food was just ok. The menu sounds delectable and you really look forward to tasting everything.......once the food came out,  It had awesome presentation but the food was bland I was very disappointed. My husband and i selected from the tasting menu and pretty much everything needed more flavor. While the food was not bad I cant say that it will make me come again. It is certainly not worth the price.
