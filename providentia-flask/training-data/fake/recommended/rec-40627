Consistent with the other Starr restaurants - good food, good service, comfortable seating, slightly pricy.  We stopped by for Sunday brunch.  Wife had the tuna tacos, kids had burger and grilled chicken, I had the fried chicken and waffles.   The bloody Mary's were the highlight of my meal - the perfect drink for Sunday brunch!
