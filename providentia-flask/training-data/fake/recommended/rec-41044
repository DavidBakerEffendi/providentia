Great wings, ribs, and pizza at relatively cheap prices. Had a decent beer selection also. The only thing I didn't like that much was my cocktail, the La Candela, which had too much ice. The Tartufo pizza was particularly good. The decor was dark with a lot of wood. I liked it. There is a backroom where they sometimes have music and upstairs that is a little less pub-like.
