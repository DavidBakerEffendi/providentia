Ate here three times in as many days, it was first rate every time.  Came in for lunch and had the veggie mezze, everything was fresh and tasty.  The owners take great pride is making sure that the produce is fresh and as much of it comes from local producers.  You have to have the homemade harisa.....the chili sauce adds a little heat and a lot of flavor to all the dishes!  The only draw back is that you can't get refills on coffee....but now that I know why I am okay with it.  They don't do drip coffee that can get stale, they make each cup with love.....and it tastes like it!
