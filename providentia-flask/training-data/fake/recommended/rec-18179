I just want to add to the other reviewer's comment on the no sampling policy. They also have a no returns policy. Over the summer I went out on a limb and tried one of their 'sour' beers. After the first sip, I thought it was skunked. It was awful. I told the waitress I thought it had gone bad, and she assured me that was what it was supposed to taste like. She said that that particular beer couldn't be returned, so clearly many others did not like it either. She instead "offered" to bring me something else, which I would also have to pay for. That's just bad customer service and bad policy. I've been back, but only reluctantly. Most of the food is only so so, however the fish and chips is really good.
