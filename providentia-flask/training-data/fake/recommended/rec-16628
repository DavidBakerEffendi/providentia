Place is excellent. Great food and great atmosphere at a decent price. Only complaint is the size. A cozy restaurant can be nice, but this was just a little too small. We ordered five dishes plus one dessert between the two of us. Left extremely satisfied. Each dish is served one after the other, so you can really enjoy/appreciate each dish individually.
