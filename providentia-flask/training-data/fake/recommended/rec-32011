I love dim sum but often I have found some of the dishes you get csn be less than satisfying.  But that is not the case at Dim Sum Garden. Everything we have tried has been very good.  The Shanghai soup dumplings are the best. The scallion pancakes were very flavorful and the greens perfectly woked. But the red bean cakes are the best.  Flaky pastry, red bean paste and sesame seeds on tops.  I fell in love with red bean cakes in Shanghai and haven't tasted good ones in the USA. Dim Sum Garden are the best I have had outside southeast Asia.   The restaurant is hugely busy on weekends and the lines are bad.  But try it on a weekday lunch or dinner and you'll get seated quickly with quick and friendly service.
