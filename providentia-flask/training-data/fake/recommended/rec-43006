Oddly enough I usually go to Public after what one might call several happy hours of tasty beverages. They're open late and the vibe is always great. Fabuloous service and the food here is fantastic and has yet to disappoint. Now granted I am a bit toasty when I'm here so perhaps my point of view is a bit skewed! But I will hands down always reco this place to anyone looking for a great place to have dinner and a great bottle of wine.
