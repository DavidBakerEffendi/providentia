Yesterday I took a couple of visitors from out of town for a long stroll on the High Line, and we wound up at Cookshop for drinks and a bite to eat. We managed to get seated outside with minimal wait(around 7 on a friday, perfect weather, no reservation---a pleasant surprise), and thoroughly enjoyed a varied grazing-from-the-appetizer-menu sort of dinner. This is my kind of place-menu based on what is seasonal and fresh, everything well-prepared and not fussy. Asparagus soup with creme fraiche was silky and delicious, pizza with sauteed ramps homey and satisfying, and the fava bean hummus the perfect complement to the cocktails. Oh, and the cocktails! Asked the bartender, while we were waiting for a table, to make a recommendation. I am picky, do not like sweet drinks, and a lightweight besides, so ordering the wrong thing is a serious bummer for me. She totally came through, and if you get a chance, definitely try the "new cumber". mouth-watering, refreshing, and just the right amount of buzz ;-) Perfect for a warm evening! One of my friends had the same, the other ordered the strawberry habanero margarita, which was another winner. I live uptown, but as I tend to visit the High Line whenever I have houseguests, I will definitely make my way to Cookshop again. Soon, I hope.
