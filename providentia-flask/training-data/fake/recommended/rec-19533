First, a big THANK YOU to Lex C who recommended this place! Second, this place is a fry lover's dream! There was a long line to get the fries, but it was SO worth it. The fries were delicious, hot, and salty. There really is nothing I can say to describe how good they are. You will just have to try them yourselves. We ordered a side of wasabi mayo which was really tasty. We took our bag of fries and ate outside. We both ate with one hand since Jeff was holding the fries and I was holding the wasabi. We got a few stares but it didn't matter. They warmed us up and it made for a great lunch. We will definitely be going back!
