This is THE best sushi spot in the city. The Godzilla and Spartan rolls are amazing. Their specialty rolls are much different from what I've seen on other menus. It's always best to make a reservation here, though, since the place is tiny. The fact that it is a BYOB is the icing on the cake. Who doesn't love that?!
