I agree with the previous poster who said this place was a tourist place.  I ate here on my first night in New York and we were less than impressed.  I will say that the food was delicious.  It was just me and my boyfriend so it was too much food for us.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Our waitress left for 10 minute stretches at a time.  The waitress of the next section over did the majority of our serving. The table next to us was about to go to a show and they couldn't finish their Tiramisu so they gave it to us because there was almost half of the family-sized portion left.  Our waitress was totally pissed and told us we were violating health codes.  I'm sure we were.  I also can see that she might think we would tip her less, but I was intending to compensate had she been half-way decent.  Our drinks were empty the entire time.  I had to get up and ask someone for the check.  I had to get up and ask another person for a box.  My boyfriend and I were actually done eating when she stopped by our table and said, "Oh!  You got your food!".  Uh, yeah.  No thanks to you. I was expecting a wait, so the 25 minute wait didn't bother me at all. There are way better Italian restaurants in the city than this.  Just sayin'
