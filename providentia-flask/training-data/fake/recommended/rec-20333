I've been to Caracas twice, once in the East Village and once in Williamsburg.  The BK location kicks EV's ass. So much roomier and more attentive service. Went on a Saturday night for dinner with a few friends.  Wait was about 45 minutes long but passed by quickly with a few cocktails.  Had their signature Venezuelan Punch in Guava which was good, but not great.  Curious to try the other flavors next time. Got the special miniature Arepas with the "best topping ever" for an appetizer. Quail egg and Canadian bacon were just two of  the cacophony of ingredients.  Presentation was so cute and the arepa were delicious. Wished they were a little bit bigger, either that or that I didn't have to share. Had the roast pork arepa with tomoato and mango salsa, La Pernil  I think.  The pork was perfectly juicy and succulent.  Add a little bit of hot sauce and it's the perfect combination of flavors. Only wish Caracas was a little bit closer and a little bit cheaper.
