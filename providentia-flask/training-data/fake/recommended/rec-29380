I had lunch here the other day. I ordered fish and chips at the bar with a beer based on a recommendation from a friend. I thought it was ok, but not great. I would definitely come back again to try something else for lunch. The bar is very old-school and inviting. They have some great beers on tap...beers that really are for "beer drinkers" i.e. people that don't drink Miller Lite when they want a real brew. This place seems like it would be great for drinks and rock/jazz music on a Friday night.
