This is a great neighborhood bar with really good bartenders and great food. There are tv's everywhere. There is also a jukebox. The burger is really large but delicious and the menu is simply and yummy. There are different night specials, like one night; 1 large pizza w a pitcher of beer for about $7 bucks. Great place for a drink with your friends!
