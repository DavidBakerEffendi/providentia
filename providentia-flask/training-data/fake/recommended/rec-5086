The tacos here are delicious, as are the nachos. The price is alright, though I'd be happier with it if the service were better. I've ordered to go a few times and it takes a long time and they've yet to get my order right on the first try. This place has gone on my list of places to go when I have absolutely nowhere I need to be and can wait however long it takes them to actually get the food ready. Sometimes, a delicious taco is worth the wait.
