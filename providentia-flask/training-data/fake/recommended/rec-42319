Old school pizza at it's finest.  I've had the pleasure of having gone on somewhat of a Brooklyn pizza tour recently (Saraghina, Totonno's, L&B Spumoni Gardens & now Grimaldi's), and without question this plce stacks up right along side the best in the city.  I haven't been in over 10 years & the product is consistent...even in the new location. Before you stand in line, pop inside to see if there are any spots @ the bar.  I did that recently & my wife & I avoided the long line of tourists outside :)
