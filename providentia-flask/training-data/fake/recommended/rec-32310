love love love. cutest and most charming spot! they're sandwich plate is hard to resist. two mini sandwiches that aren't so mini, corn soup which is amazing, and a Mediterranean-like chopped salad for $12! my roommate is a big fan of the taco rice.. really savory and hearty japanese style brunch. definitely worth trying. I eat here sometimes two days in row on the weekends. new favorite brunch spot!
