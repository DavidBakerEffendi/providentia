Quality food and lots of choices - we love coming here for Sunday brunch. There is always a wait but it's worth it. The space is very small and the tiny (2-3 person) tables are packed tightly. I love the atmosphere in here; it's cozy and intimate. Don't try coming here with more than 3 to your group; it's just not that kind of place. Coffee is excellent as well, and the crepes are spot-on!
