This seems to be the place that my family stops when we are on our way to the Bradley Airport .  The food at this location is pretty good though  I highly suggest the Branford location.  The service and food quality is much better in Branford. My husband  absolutely loves the wasabi tuna that is usually on special at this location.  It is rare tuna coated with a wasabi sauce and has mashed potatoes as a side.   I love the macadamia crusted talapia with the sweet fruit salsa.  A good blend of sweet, salty, and tangy.  The lobster roll is a good choice too! The restaurant is crowded and you will definitely wait at least 20 minutes at  night for a table.  The interior is cheesy and tacky but it works!   If you feel like dinner and a movie there is a  great independent movie theater, Cinema City, located next door.  Other than that I don't think there is much else to do in the general area.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at this location.  It is located in a somewhat desolate area.  If you are craving New England style seafood in a tacky setting, head on over to the Branford location instead.
