I was really looking forward to having delicious meatballs as many Yelpers eluded to. Ordered: Standard meatballs w/ marinara sauce +side of mashed potatoes. The Verdict: Not bad but nothing to write home about either and certainly not worth waiting 45min for a table on a Friday evening. Â If you gave it 5 stars.. You need to get out more. If you are destined to try this place just for the sake of trying, the bar and side tables are 1st come 1st serve. That's your best bet if you want to avoid the table waitlist.
