I recently reserved the entire 8pm seating (25 people) for my wife's birthday party (redacted years old).  We arranged to have a 3 course meal - the highlight of which was a Salmon dish with Brussels sprouts, apple, sauerkraut, and mustard sauce that was amazing.  It was a perfect meal in a perfect setting....it was a great night.
