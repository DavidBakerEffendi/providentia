Had the chorizo omelette brunch special on a casual Sunday. Great spot for an intimate date or lively meal with a few friends. It was crowded, but not overly packed during a busy brunch time on Sunday. Service was quick - the host and my server were friendly and efficient. Only downside was that there isn't so much of a variety. The regular menu looks like alot of sandwiches (maybe the lunch menu?) and the Brunch wasn't so much variety. But the food was tasty. I'll definitely come back!
