I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. It was a nice experience. He liked his beer, and I enjoyed my sangria. He was okay with the crab cakes, but he wasn't blown away. I ordered the pork tacos, and the portions are VERY generous. Three huge soft shell pork tacos, pico de gallo, and sour cream. All pretty tasty. Overall, a nice restaurant! There were a few things I didn't like so much though... Indoor seating is tight. All the tables are very close together. It's a very small dining room. Also, there's no greeting station. When my boyfriend and I came in we felt like we walked into a party where we didn't know anyone. We just stood in the dining room looking around until a waitress came out, and sat us at a table. A little awkward, but I suggest you check it out! Go with an appetite! Oh! Before I forget. Outdoor seating looks magical! I can't wait to go back in warmer weather. The twinkle lights, the garden, the mural... It's beautiful.
