Ghia happens to be RIGHT by my friend's house where I was staying this past week, so my boyfriend and I decided to check it out for weekday brunch. Another tiny place with chalkboard specials and homemade sausage (does that mean they killed their pet pig and served him? hmm....). I got the vegan scramble, which was tofu, braised kale and sweet potatoes with lime "cream" butter (which means vegan) with toast. Yum! Also a tiny $4 glass of freshly squeezed OJ. I savored every drop. :)
