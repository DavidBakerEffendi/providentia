i feel funny saying this, but i was a little underwhelmed by abc kitchen. i had the crab toast. (who doesn't have the crab toast here?) the flavor was spectacular, but the dish was oilier than i expected. i had the asparagus wrapped in fontina and prosciutto. the asparagus was super fresh and perfectly cooked, but i found the fontina/prosciutto combination to be a little too salty. prosciutto isn't one of my favorite things though. i had the fried organic chicken with baby bok choy, ginger and spicy gravy. the gravy threw me a bit. it tasted like regular bbq sauce i used to eat with chicken mcnuggets when i was a kid. but the fried organic chicken...this might have been the best chicken breast i've ever had. i don't generally eat white meat, but abc kitchen has truly mastered the art of cooking a tender, juicy breast. i had the salted caramel ice cream. it was so rich and smooth and sweet and buttery that i should have been vomiting rainbows out of my mouth. if i'd just had the chicken and the ice cream, i'd give abc kitchen a million stars to dance around the rainbow byproducts of my dessert. if you're going early on a weeknight (before 7 pm) and you're a party of 2 and abc kitchen tells you there are no reservations available, you should go anyway. they'll seat you at one of the cocktail tables, which are perfectly comfortable to dine at for an hour or two.
