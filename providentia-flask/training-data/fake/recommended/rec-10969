The growing pains are high here, about a 3.5 hour wait for a table to order hot food & slow service. Was told we could order raw food at the bar and paid $12 for 4 pieces of shrimp with measly shrimp cocktail sauce. The "list" was awfully taped to the hostess table and showed the long line of folks waiting, meanwhile there were 4 open tables. The space isn't utilized well as the downstairs had a couple tables, no wait staff and just seemed like an afterthought. A small beer bar downstairs with 1-2 wait staff would've been helpful to those sitting there and those playing cornhole & miniature golf in the blazing sun. Would be nice if a food truck or a BBQ pit was parked outside and we could eat on the sidewalk and go back in to drink in their venue. Otherwise, eating at Fairway will do for now.
