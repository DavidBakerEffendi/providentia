oh continental. how i love you. an ex-boyfriend (boyfriend @ the time) and i used to go here alllll the time as "our place". the design is amazing (leave it to stephen starr), and the menu is pretty decent. perfect atmosphere. the drinks are probably my favorite drinks, anywhere, ever. super sweet and tasty. the service is always friendly. lots of good memories here. definitely a place you need to go if you're ever in philadelphia.
