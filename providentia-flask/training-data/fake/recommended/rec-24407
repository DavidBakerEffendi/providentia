our first time at this very nice restaurant.   we started with the appetizer zucchini and then had the pork loin and skate for the main course.  it was great except for the boring mash potatoes that came with the Pork.  for dessert we had the cranberry pear tart...very nice.  very cozy place and the service was excellent.
