New menu extremely over priced. $13 for kids pasta with butter. Sodas $3.25. Really bad service, noisy and inexperienced wait staff. Â Entrees came out cold and took forever. Ambiance is very nice, but very loud. Kids finished their pasta and were still hungry and waiter wanted to charge an additional $13 for another kids pasta entree. No salt and pepper on table, bread was lousy and hard as rock. Definately wouldn't go again.
