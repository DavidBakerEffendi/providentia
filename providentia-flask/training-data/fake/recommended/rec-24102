I absolutely love Honeygrow I have been going for the past 2 months and have fallen in love. I was introduced to the noodle initially they were good but once I tried the black and brown rice I was hooked. Farm to table means nothing if the taste isn't up to expectations, however honeygrow has proven that you don't have to render taste in order to go green. This is my first review and I had to sign up just to give them 5 stars... btw Google Honeygrow and Yards event on the 15th day of May 2014... I can't wait to meet the CEO
