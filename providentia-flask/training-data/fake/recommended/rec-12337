I haven't eaten from Iron Chef House in a over a year and I really don't know why. I just had their sashimi for the first time and WOW - I'm really impressed. For $2.25 you get two HUGE pieces of delicious salmon sashimi. Usually sashimi should be cut a little thinner but I'm all for this because not only do you get more at such a value, they were actually able to keep the fish tasting so delicate and fresh. It was honestly some of the best salmon sashimi I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The avocado salad was also so well done - complete with almond slivers, dried cranberries, carrots, baby spring greens, romaine, etc. and a nice vinaigrette to go with it. The sushi itself has just a tiny bit too much rice for my taste (sushi should be 90% fish, 10% rice) so I'll probably just stick to the sashimi from now on.
