I've just had one of the BEST meals last night at Market Table.  It hit all the spots - wonderful food, decor and service.  Along with the food, we ordered a few glasses of wine.  The total came out to be c$210.   FOOD Hamachi Crudo - Light dish, esp liked the blood orange - Well executed by MT, but not a standout.  Unlike the salad... Forest Mushroom and Roasted Brussels Sprout Salad - This was FANTASTIC!  Loved that they topped the dish with a sunny side egg.   - Hearty, somewhat healthy, delicious! [Entree Special]  Seared Duck Breast with Duck Leg Confit - EXCELLENT!   -  The duck was cooked to perfection, and I loved that the skin wasn't too crackly.   Sautéed Halibut - Another light seafood dish For dessert: Apple Pie with Sour Cream Gelato and Pear & Ricotta Sorbet -  The sour cream gelato was delicious -  Apple pie is so comforting; perfect dessert for the temperature -  Pear sorbet was amazingly refreshing, but more of a summer dessert - Ricotta sorbet was good, but overshadowed by the sour cream & pear flavors At the end, I was full and happy, but not stuffed.  Good portions. DECOR Most restaurants swing from stuffy (Dovetail) to unoriginal (Oceana).  Market Place was beautiful with clean lines.  Some of the walls have exposed brick.  I loved the simple flower arrangements.  The windows are enormous and go up to the ceiling which gives you the sensation of eating outdoors.  What I like best is that you can come here for any occasion - dates, friends, or family.     SERVICE The people at MT are friendly and attentive.  I liked that they gave great recommendations on the spot without hemming and hawing.  I'm sure all the food is at least good, but sometimes I'm overwhelmed by all of life's choices and just need someone to tell me what to do! ... I mean, what dish to order.
