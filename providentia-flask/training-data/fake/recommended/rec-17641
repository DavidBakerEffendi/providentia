Oh wow.  Nutella?  And french toast?  Amazing.  It doesn't take much to make me happy, but Penelope sure knows how to take it above and beyond.  Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was friendly and helpful.  It was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait more than 20 minutes for a table and our food came pretty quickly as well.  I would DEFINITELY try this place again for brunch or maybe even dinner next time!
