I was expecting more from the smoked salmon bagel (without tomatoes) for the price. It was a perfectly good bagel -- the salmon was fresh and plentiful, they let me get a garlic bagel instead of a plain -- but it felt like for $8 it should have been... just better. Don't get me wrong -- it still hit the carb-craving spot. Quite empty on a Sunday early afternoon, so quick and friendly service. Lots of seating.
