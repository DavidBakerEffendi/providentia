This place always has a line of poor gypsies outside waiting to eat here. Tonight i decided to be a gypsy and finally try it. What a load of garbage. I mean cold, not fully cooked pizza. No joke, elliots frozen pizza is ten times better. May i also point out, if you like thin crust, proportioned amounts of cheese and tomato and bread, you will have a better time at 2 Bros Pizza. Just the fact that it was uncooked is disgusting. This place es una porqueria, y puedem meter la pizza en mi culo.
