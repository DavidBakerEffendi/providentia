Very busy on a Saturday night. Very good food for a brewpub. Excellent salad with my salmon entree, which was cooked perfectly. My wife had spinach salad with perfectly cooked teriyaki chicken on top. Their Oktoberfest beer was great. A group of bratty kids at the next table was only downside but not restaurant's fault. Who brings kids to a brewpub? Nice outside seating.
