With a bazillion reviews already tallied up for this place, I think I'll cut this one short. The line outside- ALL hype! Pizza definitely made with fresh ingredients and I appreciate the quality, but it's mostly hype! I can think of 30+ pizza places making pizza just like this (and better) so I'm not about to call this the best pizza I ever had in my life. Â Aside from that, you would think this place could afford real wine on their menu. If I ask for a bottle of Chardonnay, please don't bring me the "blended to taste like it" version. Half the waiters dont speak English, the other half talk like they're from Queensbridge projects so it's useless. Once you place your order, dont expect anything else. You'll get your food/drink and you wont see your waiter anymore (unless you stand in the aisle and flag him down) until its check time. Expect noise, expect tourists, expect to see fools eating pizza with a fork!! If I'm in the area again, I *might* do takeout if the line isn't down the block, but never dining-in again. Meh, I say Go if you've never been...get your curiosity subdued. Cash Only.
