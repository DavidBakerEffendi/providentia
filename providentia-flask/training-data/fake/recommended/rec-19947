i never thought food could really give a man an orgasm, but i was wrong.  my boyfriend and i got these lobster rolls at the Brooklyn Flea while looking around for some cool trinkets.  he wouldn't stop talking about his lobster roll for at least 4 hours after he ate it.  there is nothing i can do for this kid that will make him happier than this lobster...and that is kind of sad. the maine style is my favorite, but they also have a warm butter version if you are into that.  the lobster is so fresh that i didn't mind paying $15 for one sandwich.
