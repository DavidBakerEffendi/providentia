Came in a big group on a Saturday night. The place is so cute inside with an open kitchen view from the corner table where we sat.  I also liked the lighting and the chalk board on the walls that had the specials written on them.   We tried a couple of the apps, all good especailly the beef carpaccio. The entrees that we ordered were the pancetta wrapped pork tenderloin, scallops, and chicken-everything came out nice. The desserts were especially yummy, we tried the chocolate cake but the winner was the upside down pineapple rhubarb cake. These type of restaurants in the west village are making me venture out there more than my usual EV/LES area.
