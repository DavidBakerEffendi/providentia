I used to walk by this place and just stare at the giant stone bowls of guacamole that diners were eating outside (don't worry, I never peeked through the windows salivating...that's just weird). I've been telling myself to come check this place out for almost two years, and I finally did a few weeks ago. Came with a party of 12 for C's farewell lunch (we made a reservation) and they were very accommodating when we needed extra seats. My crispy mahi-mahi tacos were good, not mind-blowing or super memorable, but good. I was actually a little disappointed when they came out, because they weren't as aesthetically pleasing as the chicken and beef tacos my friends got. But it's all good. They were tasty and pretty filling, despite the portion size. Speaking of portion sizes, the Macho Nachos are ginormous and really yummy. A few people also split a pitcher of the frozen blood orange margarita--I didn't have any, but they seemed to like it. As for the guacamole, we got the original and the De La Hoya. Both were absolutely divine--we scraped the bowls clean! I just wish we had ordered more! Some of them sound pretty intriguing/delicious, like the "Indian Red" Lopez (with spicy crab) and "Bazooka" Limon (goat cheese and pistachio, whaaaat). I'll definitely be back, but I might just get chips+guac and nothing else. I also really liked the decor--this place is colorful and fun, but not obnoxiously so! I especially liked the bicycle hanging from the ceiling. They also have a photo booth which seemed a little random, but I'll probably check it out next time.
