She Said...." Definitely the best cheese steak I've ever had. I don't think I will be able to order a cheese steak in MD or any other state. If you go here just be ready to know what you want, or else they will pass over you. They have the cheese wiz which is amazing and real steak, not the stringy fake steak. The fries are really good too. We will def make a pit stop here again...only problem was they didn't have coke but we went across the street to their competition Geno's to get a coke, we might have to try that place too." He Said...."So this place was really, really good. The best cheese steak I've ever had. They quick and efficient with the ordering so be prepared. I had a cheese whiz with onions and its was really good, I had the juices of the cheese steak dripping down to the paper wrapping, that's when you know its done right. I like how you order the drinks and fries in the second window, so that those tourists don't get in the way of regular people. Now driving to this place was interesting; it looked like a trash truck emptied their trash in the middle of the street. You don't need to buy a newspaper in this area because there are minimum of 5 newspapers blowing around in the streets...so just get one of them....I mean a piece of trash got stuck on my leg....and if you drive you can apparently park in the middle of the street or in the intersection in this part of Philly.
