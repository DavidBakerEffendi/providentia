The food, service and drinks were all 5 stars.    The service here was the best I've experienced in Astoria/LIC.  We had a large group, and ate steak, chicken, tostones, guacamole, nachos, sangria, mojitos and all were very good.  Server was great and manager came by several times.  Just a great overall experience.  We'll be back for sure.
