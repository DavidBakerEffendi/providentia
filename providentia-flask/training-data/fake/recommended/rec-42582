I love, love, love the food! It is absolutely 5 star and I can say it's the best pizza I've ever had. I recommend basically every dish. They have a great Caesar Salad! Plus as a money saver, the groupons they do keep me coming! The reason I can't give it 5 stars( OWNERS TAKE NOTICE) there's a very nice older gentleman who is either a manager or the owner. He is always pleasant and a great guy but everytime we get our food, he stops us so he can take pictures. But this isn't the biggest offense just a slight annoyance in comparison with this next problem. We went to this place for dinner and this same man was there, nice as always, but when we were getting our "doggie bags" for our leftovers, he insisted on doing it even though we asked to do it, we let him, and he then took it to the front counter area and put the food in the box, WITH HIS HANDS, RIGHT AFTER TOUCHING HIS PHONE! He is a very nice man, we like him but that's gross. We didn't even want our leftovers after that. Everything about this place is 5 star worthy except for the bad habit of this man. We haven't been back since this happened. MESSAGE TO OWNERS: Please have this man stop this habit and you'll have a faithful customer in myself and my family. Thanks
