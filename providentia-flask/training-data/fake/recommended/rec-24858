Amazing place! I still think about the burger! yummmmy is an understantement! Also, their drink, I believe it was called 210 - made with cognac and St Germain! Unique and amazing. And, the location is out of this world, very surreal ! Loved it! Next trip to Philly will surely include a re-visit to this great restaurant!
