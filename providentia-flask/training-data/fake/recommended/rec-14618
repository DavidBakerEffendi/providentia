Pippali is an Indian restaurant with a homestyle (Thali) serving, mainly catering to working class people during lunch hour. Pippali has some really good options for both veg and non-veg thali. We had veg thali and it was delicious and filling. I enjoyed all the different contents of this thali, which is very rare because most restaurants put something that noone liked yesterday. Well, they dont have bad options only delicious ones. They were remarkably quick in their service. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick and complete indian meal in the flatiron district.
