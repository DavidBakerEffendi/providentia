My friends and I came here this past shneester for a late breakfast. When we got there I was a little hesitant because the place was hoppin and looked like it could have been easily an hour wait. Before entering we had sign waivers because they were apparently filming a TV show for BBC. We decided we weren't about all of that so we asked to sit outside, we were able to be seated immediately, which was tight. The food came out surprisingly fast and was honestly incredible. I got a Belgian waffle with cinnamon apples and ice cream, which I regretted almost immediately. I mean, anyone can really do a good waffle, but this one was pretty spectacular. The three if us all tried each other's food and the breakfast burrito is probably the best one I've ever had. Anyway, they did end up filming outside and long-story-short, if you're watching some food critic show on BBC, keep a look out for the kid in the glasses chugging a bottle of maple syrup as the host passes him.
