I have heard sooo many good things about this spot! Unfortunately I give it a 2 star because of the service. Let me give you a run down right quick PROS: Lovely area! Makes you want to buy a bike with a basket and put a little yorkipoo in it! Food was okay. I ordered pancakes with sausage (nasty) and hashbrowns...which the hashbrowns were BOMB! Pancakes really tasted homemade and light...sadly I love ihops pancakes way better. YIKES! CONS: The hostest was really nice but thats not what made the experience bad...She was OVERLY nice...so nice we waited an hour and some change to be seated and the place wasnt super packed as expected! There was a group of women who finished there meal about 10 min ago and was just sitting there talking about how lonely and single they are (im sure). The hostest asurres me that their tap is being rung up and we should be seated in 10 min. Kool...but then 20 min pass by...and I ask politely if there getting up soon. She said o yes they are.....OKAY 45 min go by and my friend walks in there and tempts to ask the group of ladies nicely when will they be done?...but before she could finish...the hostest said "They'll be done when there ready" WTF!? How rude of her to let paying customers who have been so patient wait for overly talkative women just sit there like their the only freaking people in the world!..I think the hostest should have politely told the group another party is waiting to be seated. She was waaaay to nice in letting them just sit there. She had no balls to tell them to get their butts up!.....but since she told my friend "they'll be done when their ready" was an invitation for the group to chill longer..which they did!!! No way! With that said....I dont care much to go back....food wasn't all that. ihop NEXT STOP!
