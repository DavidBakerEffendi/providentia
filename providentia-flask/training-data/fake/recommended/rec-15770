Awesome and fun spot for a date night or with a bunch of friends (guys or girls). Ordered a bottle of white wine, the mushroom & parm Bruschetta, salmon for me and bolognese for my date. Wine was great and they were constantly attentive. Food was delicious although we agreed that the Bruschetta could've been warmer we think it was sitting for a few minutes when they confused our appetizer with someone else's meat and cheese platter. Aside from that the night went smoothly, we weren't hurried out and the service was lovely. Not cheap, not overly expensive. I think the right amount for a nice night out. I'd definitely be back.
