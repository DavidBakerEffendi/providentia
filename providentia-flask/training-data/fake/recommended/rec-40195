Great place. Their wines are always fresh because they used tap system rather then opening a bottle, which may be open for multiple nights in a regular bar. Their beer selection is fantastic, however they still have yet to fully utilize the iPad. Although ahead of most bars their system is a little bit clunky in that it does not show you the price and some very important aspects of the beer while you were looking at the menu. Thankfully the service more than makes up for any deficiencies in the iPad system. Pro tip: if you are very temperature sensitive I would recommend sitting toward the back, otherwise there is a bit of fluctuation during the most extreme winter chills.
