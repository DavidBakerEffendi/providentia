This place put Fishtown on the map for those who didn't grow up in the River Wards. Â It's my "corner bar" and I couldn't ask for a better one. Pros: great, gritty feel inside; amazing upstairs music venue that showcases acts that usually would be in a much larger venue; food that is better than you'd expect to find in a bar BY FAR; servers will get to know you and remember your "usuals"; great variety of music; most nights it's not hard to find a table. Cons: menu doesn't change a lot (which should only matter to those of us that go there 3 times a week!); some of the bartenders aren't super friendly and/or quick but they'll usually get replaced very quickly; can be very, very cold in there at times so bring a jacket and scarf you don't mind leaving on.
