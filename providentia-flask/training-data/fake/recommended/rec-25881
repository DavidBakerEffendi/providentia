Ok...so Grimaldi's is definitely the best pizza I have ever had in my life.  The crushed tomatoes were a little too crushed, but the amazing crust and their perfectly seasoned sauce is absolutely to die for.  All toppings I had were good...definitely loved the pepperoni and the sausage wasn't bad either.  The mozzarella was extra yummy.  Seems like a lot of places use fresh mozzarella now, but it doesn't have flavor...this place has figured out how to get both.  So the wait is insanely long for this place and since it was  my first time it was absolutely worth it...especially if you have friends and can take turns buying hot chocolate from Jaques Torres around the corner (liquid chocolate baby!).  If i were to go here again, which I definitely will, I will order ahead and do pick up.  Highly suggest that if you aren't too picky about having some straight out of the oven pizza goodness.
