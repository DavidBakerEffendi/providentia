Simply delicious!  Went for a late lunch at 2 thinking there wouldn't be a line, but still had to wait 30 min (fun fact: we were interviewed by a Japanese TV station while waiting). Food was well worth the wait. Started with the yummy pork bun - bread was fresh (next time I'm ordering it w no mayo). I ordered the spicy pork ramen and loved it - not too spicy just perfect, but get extra spicy if you really like heat.  Got extra pork bc you don't get that much & looooved the bamboo shoots, insanely fresh must order.  Broth flavor was excellent. Friend enjoyed the miso ramen - she said it was very comforting. FYI, they are cash only!
