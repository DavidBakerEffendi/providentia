The pizza is absolutely, incredibly, deliciously amazing.  They have all kinds of interesting ones, ranging from plain to Rigatoni alla Vodka pizza, caesar salad pizza and many many others.  Regardless of what kind of pizza you get, the cheese/sauce/crust ration is absolutely perfect.   The problem is that it becomes an addiction and everytime my sister or I are home we must order it/eat there.
