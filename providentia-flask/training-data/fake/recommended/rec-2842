I love this place, in part because I can walk there and crawl home if needed LOL.  Seriously it is a fun, casual place with good, basic food (burgers, chili and homemade fries are standouts) friendly service, good jukebox, shuffleboard table, lots of big screens to watch your game of choice.  Bands are coming soon.
