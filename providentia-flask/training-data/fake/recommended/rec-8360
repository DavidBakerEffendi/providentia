I've eaten here several times, take out and delivery too. The food is VERY consistently pretty good. A great option in a neighborhood with limited choices. They do fried fake meats well, but could do straight up healthy veggies a little better. Always the same friendly woman who works the counter, she is a gem. I like the scallion pancakes. 3.75 stars. :)
