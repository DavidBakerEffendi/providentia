I can't even begin to describe how amazing Bohemian is. I don't typically give out 5 and this place actually deserves closer to a 10! If you can somehow get in, this is a must in NYC. The highlights: -Secret location and exclusive= instantly cool and not pretentious at all. -Service is world class. Our waiter was extremely nice, very attentive and passionate about the food, informative/educational on the dishes, was able to recommend saki and food choices based on our personal preferences as well as how much we should order for three people. -Everything we ate literally gave me a foodgasm. A few musts- sashimi (freshest fish that literally melts in your mouth) washu-beef short rib sashimi, mizo black cod, the branzini and we had a soba noodle creme brulee dessert with orange blossom vanilla ice cream. -The atmosphere, decorations and even the plates are all one of a kind. Â They work with an artist who creates each plate, cup, carafe, serving dish etc. by hand. Each piece is gorgeous. I wish I would have asked for the artist name! The table and chairs make for a comfortable and intimate dining experience. I could go on and on about this place but it's words don't do it justice. You just have to experience it for yourself! I would go back in a heartbeat!
