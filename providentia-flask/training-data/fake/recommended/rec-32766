I stopped in here for a quick lunch recently. I immediately ended up in a line of new patrons who were staring at the large menu on the wall, just as I was doing. Once I thought I had settled on something, I proceeded to the registers to order and was greeted by a small picture of the BBQ pork mac and cheese. My life had just been turned upside down, and all notions of what I had decided to order had gone completely out the window. I completely forgot what I had picked from the menu and instantly changed my mind. It was love at first bite. I just may have to put BBQ sauce in my mac and cheese from now on. I was slightly skeptical, but it turned out to be a good choice! Overall, it was a good experience, and I'll make some time in the future to visit again.
