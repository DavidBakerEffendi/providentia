i'm a little late to the party with my review but i have been coming here since the day the doors opened....SOLID everything about this place... the food, the vibe, the folks... all of it.  get the beef rib... just do it... embrace the flinstone-ness of it all and girls get over it.  you better come here ready to get down,  dig in & and drink up! oh, and check out the live music in the saloon... yes. live music+saloon. i said it. xokQ.
