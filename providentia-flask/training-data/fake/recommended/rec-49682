Miami Mikes Sports Zone is attached to the Ramada Inn up in East Hanover. This is the best sports bar that I have found in the area (and it seems like it may be the only one in the immediate morristown area?). According to their website there are 45 HD TVs and big screens. I went a few months ago on a Saturday night for dinner/drinks and to watch some baseball. Food is your typical American fare with a selection of burgers, nachos, quesadillas, chicken etc. I recommend getting a meal that comes with fries as they were pretty amazing. The guy in charge of the remote (I think it may have been Miami Mike himself?) was friendly and very willing to accommodate our viewing requests (He even changed one of the tvs to the Red Sox game for me). I have recommended this place to my friends and definitely plan to return.
