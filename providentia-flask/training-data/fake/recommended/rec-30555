Amazing food. We tried the mushroom cigars which were okay, but the entrees were out of this world! Our waiter was eccentric, but attentive and the vibe of the restaurant on a weekday night felt unique compared to other restaurants in the HK area. I tried the Thai Marinated Lamb Rack and it was to die for. Sensuous and complemented by potatoes and cabbage. And best of all, you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee. I've tried another place called Ivo and Lulu and was extremely disappointed with that place. This one delivers and will be back very soon!
