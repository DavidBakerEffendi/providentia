I've been wanting to come try this place for the longest.  I love pizza but I hardly ever eat pizza baked in a wood burning oven.   I finally had a chance to eat here.   I was planning a get together dinner with my friends, I picked this place.    It was something different because every single time we get together for dinner, we always end up eating Thai food.   I like it but got really really tired of it. We were a group of 4 and we ordered 3 pies.   The artichoke, the meatball and the eggplant and zuchinni.  The eggplant zuchinni pie was a bit soggy, but I understand how much water can come out from zuchinni when cooked.  Later on we ordered the clam pie.  That pie was my least favorite. There also wasn't much clam pieces on the pie.   For $17, they can scatter a few more clams around the pie.   My favorite was the meatball pie.    The hot olive oil was also really good on the pizza, for some spice. I would like to come back to try their other pies.   I was eyeing the arugula pie.   The waiter was also very attentive.   He was nice enough to let the pizza makers know that we were eating the pies family style, they cut our pies into 6 slices rather than the normal 4 slices, without our request.
