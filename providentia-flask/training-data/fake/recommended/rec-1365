LIsten to me fellow Yelpers! I am SORRY!...I didn't believe or heed your reviews! This was seriously one of the worst cheesesteaks I have ever had. It really is over-hyped. Why did I go here? I am stationed in Maryland (Go AIr Force!) and my family and I were driving on I-95 here in town and at around 3PM i had a vision of an amazing dinner! For some reason Philly popped into my head. So I told the family, "Hold on; we are going to Philly; I want a cheesesteak...from that famous place!". So, I stayed on 95 going North and braced for the 2 hour drive. Got to Philly...never been; very nice! Drove straight to Geno's and was amazed how cool the environment was. Its a cross between Ghetto and Suburban...Pretty sure the cops and the mafia have told the thieves, murderers and gang bangers to STAY away from the tourist and white people! lol....because there were alot of white people and oddly enough kids and stuff in that area. Anyway...it was inviting but yet made you stay on your toes about where you actually were...in a big city! So the line to get the sandwich was quick ($9...cash only!) then another line to get drinks and fries! All and all its about $30 for 2 cheesesteaks and 2 sodas and fry. Enough about the dumb stuff, here is the down low: Pros: environment culture lively experience Cons: expensive crowded no exceptional taste to sandwich dry bread was chewy So all and all, the place was cool, lights definately made a difference in my choice of places (Genos or Pats), but it really did suck! Seriously...there was nothing special about it! Enjoy the post!
