Love this place. Great coffee and especially the outside seating area. And the super friendly staff! Will come back to explore the desert menu more thoroughly. :) Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the somewhat, uhm, unconventional choice of background music. Not sure what the 80's German pop does to the feeling of authenticity, but it can get mildly annoying and certainly won't be popular with the student crowd. But if they change that, I'm definitely coming back with the 5th star. I could see this becoming my favorite place in town.
