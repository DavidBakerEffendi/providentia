Almond serves an AMAZING Brunch! Meeting new acquaintances & good friends of days gone by, we needed a fun, cool, yummy, spot to meet & catch up & Almond did the trick They don't have many tables that seat large-ish crowds (we only had 5) & the original table we had wobbled too much so we asked to be moved......and they gladly obliged - hassle free! Table got Bloodies & I opted for the Mimosa. They absolutely ROCKED in their own ways - multiple drinkys for the table! Brunchie fare consisted of Eggs Benedict (no ham please!) was outstanding! The English Muffin was incredible & I never thought I'd ever say this about this bread.....chewy & crispy at the same time & soaked up the incredibly tasty Hollandiase.....the eggs tasted fresh off the farm & had the thickest, yellowest yolks I've ever seen.....nice & runny but in the correct amount B-fast Potatoes were crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside & didn't even need ketchup Others got the signature Almond Hash (with duck confit & cracklins) as well as the Red Flannel Hash (with beets & bacon) & both were declared tasty, crispy & meaty w/ the right amount of runniness in the poached eggs that accompanied We hung out way past their 3 PM close but never felt rushed or that we needed to leave. Staff was awesome & we had an absolute blast meeting new friends & catching up w/ dear, long-lost loved ones Would highly recommend Almond!
