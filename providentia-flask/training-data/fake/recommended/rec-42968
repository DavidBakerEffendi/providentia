I want to give the beer selection a five and the service a 2.  I visit at least 1x a week and the service is good MAYBE 50% of the time.  The woman waiting on you is either crabby (can't be bothered by your pesky needs) or lazy (forgets that she's at work and chats with frat boys for 15 mins instead of tending to her guests)  or dumb (too worried about her makeup and tight half tank and chomping her gum like a horse to be bothered to work). I'm so sorry to say that but it's true.  If they hire an entirely new staff, this place will be the best bar in NYC.
