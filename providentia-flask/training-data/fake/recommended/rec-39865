You know this place is legit when can still enjoy it traveling across the country about 12 hours later hahaha  No joke! My bf went back to NY and brought the one and only 53rd and 6th halal plate with half chicken and lamb to California for me and my girlfriends.   I removed the lettuce and heated up the goods.  One is enough to feed 2 of us!  STILL DELICIOUS.  I totally miss this!!!
