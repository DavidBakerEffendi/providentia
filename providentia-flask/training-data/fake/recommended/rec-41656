A step up from tiny fork, but staff friendliness is hit or miss. I am living across the road and was excited to see a new place after the failed oyster bar. The Derby seems to be a better fit for the neighborhood, but the new staff is shaky. Yesterday the bartender was brilliant and knowledgeable (recommended me the best whiskey so far: buffalo trace), today the two girls were too busy complaining about the clientele, hence not being able to serve the new clients. Fail!
