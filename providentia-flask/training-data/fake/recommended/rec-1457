My friend and I had a reservation here for brunch this past Saturday, and when we walked in at 11:00 we quickly realized that we didn't need the reservation. This restaurant was almost completely empty, and seeing this made me get very nervous, very quickly. Basically every place around my neighborhood has an hour wait for brunch, so coming into this establishment and seeing no wait made me worry about the quality of the food. My worries quickly went away upon seeing the menu and receiving my "Fare" Mary cocktail. It was served with plenty of accouterments - olives, bacon, celery, and lemon. The bacon was crispy and a little sweet, and the olives were so delicious I wanted a whole bowl put in front of me. The Bloody Mary itself was also good - nice and spicy without being overwhelming. The food was also amazing. I got the chorizo breakfast burrito. The burrito came stuffed with chorizo, sweet potatoes, spinach, egg, and FLAVOR. It was so, so good. It also came with a side salad and even that was tasty. My friend got the caramel and banana French toast, and upon stealing a bite I immediately went into shock at how good it was. The French toast looked completely normal, but it was like there was a little bit of a sweet, crispy caramelization inside the bread. I hate frequenting places more than once, but I will have to make an exception to bring my husband here. The food was just too damn good.
