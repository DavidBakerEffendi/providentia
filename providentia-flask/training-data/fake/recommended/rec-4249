Horrible horrible service. I've never been so insulted by a restaurant before. I happen to work with a lot of Hispanics and we always order together from here. However anytime i call at home to order they seem to despise the fact that i am not Spanish. I often get placed on hold forever and sometimes hung up on. A few nights ago i tried to order and the Spanish lady on the phone told me the kitchen was closed! Then she had the audacity to say that i should speak Spanish and "she no speak English". Very very disappointed by this racist attitude and im not the first to complain about it judging from other reviews. The food is not even that good or healthy for them to be treating people like this. I just liked the large portions and the fact that its cheap.
