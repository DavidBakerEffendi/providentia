I'm with Rob C. below... I ordered the chicken, and asked for it "in corn tortillas" as was one of the menu options, thinking it would be like tacos. Here, however, that means over about three large tortilla chips. So for $12, I got chicken nachos, and there wasn't really much chicken to speak of. My wife had the brisket over fries, and found that the amount of non-fat content (yes, brisket usually has a lot of fat) wasn't enough. She was disappointed. We're from Texas, and didn't expect it to be Texas-style BBQ in CT, so I wasn't really grading it on that expectation. We drove about 30 minutes over here hoping for something close. But, sadly, it's just not that great of an experience.
