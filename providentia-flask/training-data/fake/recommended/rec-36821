I was looking forward to trying out Perilla for some time (not only because of Harold!) I thought that the ambiance of the restaurant was great - laid back, elegant, and simple. Reservations were for 6:30 and they were ready to seat me when I got there. I opted to sit at the bar while I waited for my friends. I started out with an excellent Austrian wine that I continued to drink throughout the rest of the night. I should have just gotten my own bottle.... Anyway, the food was excellent too. I had a tuna tartare that they split for me and a friend without even asking! My main dish was some sort of fish. Cod maybe? I remember it being pretty good. Overall, I had a very enjoyable time and would highly recommend Perilla. My only complaint that the service was TOO attentive! They kept taking away our wine glasses, dishes, etc, before we were ready to part with them. And yes, Harold was walking around while we were there. :)
