I spent a rainy Sunday evening in the North Star Bar with my friend Leanimal, her roommate and a local drunk named Al playing cards.  There was some live music going on in the other room, but from what we heard calling it 'music' is a bit generous, although the people preforming were most definitely alive. As far as dive bars go this one had no special characteristic (besides the live 'music,' I guess) to separate it out from all the other dives along Poplar street.  I will say they were letting underage kids in to go to the show, which does give them some extra dive-bar points, but not enough to push it over the top.   Since we were playing cards, Leanimal kept trying to turn the lights up, and the waitress kept dimming them.  Which we did not understand, because we were the only people in the bar who were not at the 'concert.'  After a few rounds of this game the waitress finally told us that the owner has cameras all over the place and watches the feed at his house, and he was calling in and saying that the lights in the back were too dim.  WTF?  The owner of the bar sits at home and watches live feed of the back room of the bar?  I'm guessing some pretty shady stuff goes on here after closing hours. The PBR pounders were cheap and the french fries were greasy, but there is really nothing too spectacular about this place to warrant a return visit. Oh, also, their website claims that they are 4 blocks from the Philadelphia Art Museum.  If by 4 they really mean 15 then they are correct.
