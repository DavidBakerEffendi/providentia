The other reviews weren't lying. This place deserves a 10! A true Creole gem. You don't find many places like this and thank God I don't have to travel to NYC to get here. Long to short: excellent location, excellent decor, authentic Creole food, authentic Haitian service, great Haitian music, more than reasonable prices. It's a 10 all the way. Coming back here isn't a question.
