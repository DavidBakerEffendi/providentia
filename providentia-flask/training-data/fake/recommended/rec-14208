(Jan/ 2007) Who honestly spends a half an hour trying to find a food cart in New York City? *raise hand* We do! After giving heat over how ridiculous we look attempting to find the right Halal cart in the streets on NYC, we finally found it. And let me say.. YUM! With a handful of other Halal carts just lined up across the streets, there's something to say about the cart with the line. We tried a chicken and rice platter combo. It'll make you crave for more. Beware of the hot sauce! It just goes to show you can find great food everywhere-- even on a street cart!
