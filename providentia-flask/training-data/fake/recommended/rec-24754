Two stars for the vibe/atmosphere and attentive service. Drinks are OK but nothing too creative or special. Food is disappointing, and frankly, overrated. Ordered their famous burger medium rare, which came out medium well. Had a few bites and the server replaced it with an extremely rare burger -- steak tartare, anyone? I just sort of gave up and left half of it on the plate. My dining companion's chicken was decent. Tuna tartare appetizer was uninspired. For this we spent nearly $200. Won't go back any time soon.
