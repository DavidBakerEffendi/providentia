This place rocks! They are so very friendly and even opened 45 minutes early for us the second time we came with my GF's fam so we didnt have to wait around. The food is simply amazing and the portions are not too big. You may not have leftovers but the food is so damn good you wont want to leave any for later (this is where the not Umerican portions come in handy, you don't have to feel guilty for finishing the whole plate and licking it because it is not gluttony, it is a foodgasm). The atmosphere is calm and intimate and the staff is like family! Seriously go here and order anything and you will be hooked!!!!
