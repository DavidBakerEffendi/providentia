I literally just finished my first encounter with street meat and it was everything I ever thought it could be and more. For $5 I got yellow rice, a mound of lamb covered in hot sauce and cucumber sauce and a salad (for good measure). I really don't know what else you want me to write about that.. all that for $5! and It's awesome!! All in all, this is getting put into the lunch rotation, nuff said.
