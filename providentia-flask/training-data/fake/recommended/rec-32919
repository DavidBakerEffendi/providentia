At fat salmon, my friend and I tried the combination handrolls, and several of their specialty rolls. The sushi would been otherwise delicious if it weren't for the very soggy rice they used.  They either added too much vinegar or used too much water when making the rice. I would try this place again to see if this is just a one time blooper.  Service was excellent, however.
