very very excellent. two of us ordered: patatas bravas- rough cut, perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  smelled delicious, tasted delicious.  probably the best in the city. navajas- loved the texture; served with bread to soak up the delicious broth.   chorozo con chocolate- so interesting!  served like a pintxo- a small piece of bread with smeared chocolate and a slice of chorizo on top.  the chocolate is rich and slightly bitter, kind of like a savory chocolate-only nutella. specials- sardines- marinated in sherry vinegar; i found these to be tasty but i imagine it to be an acquired taste. pimientos- the usual blistered peppers with sea salt.  yummy, but not mind blowing. and a bottle of wine. i totally love this place.  though like the other tapas places in the city, a bit too expensive for a regular evening dinner- if we had come hungry and ordered with abandon, we could have easily spent over $100/pp. this will be a swing by for a glass of wine and a couple of tapas for a snack after gallery-hopping or a special occasion dinner; otherwise it could break the bank!
