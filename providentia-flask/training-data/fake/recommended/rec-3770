The Social-Ecologist in me was pissed at the money grab of using paper plates, but the Broke-Ass Motherfucker in me was elated at spending $26 on a Manhattan Dinner for 2 with Beer. Alas, I stand a divided man....porkchopsandwiches! (BTW, Money Grab = Using Paper Plates because Paper Plates can be quickly whisked away and tossed without the need of a busboy who know the meaning of hot water and soap...this all equates to higher rate of turnover and the social-ecologist in me saddened by the exorbitant amount of paper used) Corner Bistro is a great place...the menu is a tiny chalkboard at the end of the bar...DON'T BOTHER LOOKING...you'll just put a crink in your neck. Bistro Burger.  Fries.  Beer. and some of you found this not memorable.... Memorable?  Well it's an American Burger (Red Meat, Chedder Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickles, Onion)...but it's a delicious one and it's a classically fun place in West Village not trying to be anything else....so if you don't find it memorable because of the "Uniqueness" of the "Burger" you need to come to my house and I'll make you what my girlfriend and I made last night...a truly gourmet burger (my first ever by the way)...YOU READY....OK: Gino's Bistro Burger: -Shoprite 93% lean Ground Beef mixed with Cilantro, Garlic, Olive Oil, Pepper, Red Pepper and Prime Steak Seasoning -Land 'O Lakes Swiss Cheese -Grilled Onions in Olive Oil with Mamouns Hot Sauce, Batampte Delicatessen Style Mustard, Curry Powder, Pepper -Tomato -Baby Arugala -Wheat Rolls IT WAS FUCKING GOOD TOO...way more memorable and probably tastier than Corner Bistro, but hey sometimes you gotta leave it to the professionals and why not the one's that charge a fair price in an old building with a middle finger pointed at the pretentious Manhattanites aflutter outside with hot bodies full of bullshit looking to drop $200 on a steak. I'd give you my burger for free and use porcelain plates by the way.
