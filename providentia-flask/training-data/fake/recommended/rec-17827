This is where you go for Rodizio and Sangria.  The meats are cooked and seasoned just right.  The sangria is awesome. You will leave this place feeling totally full and satisfied, with a severe case of the "itis" but it's all good. The salad bar is decent, though I have seen better displays before, but it doesn't matter because it's still awesome, and you want to save room for all that meat anyway.   You can also order off the menu, but I don't see myself coming all the way to Newark and skipping out on the rodizio.  It's just too good.  I saw people at another table who ordered lobster and filet mignon cooked on tile, and it looked and smelled amazing... maybe one day! Our waiter was cool.  I think his name was Rafael, but I could totally be wrong.  He was helpful and always joking around, which made our experience all the more enjoyable. At the end of your meal they bring over a whole pineapple that they roasted in cinnamon and sugar! That was the first time I have ever tried a tasty combination of flavors like that... Definitely going back again!  Wish it wasn't all the way in Newark, but it is what it is...   If you are planning on going, make reservations one or two days in advance otherwise you will have to wait about 45 minutes or so for a table, which isn't all that bad because you can have some sangria at the bar and watch them roast all the meats, which will make you hungry.
