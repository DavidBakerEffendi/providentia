Went here with a group of 8 and got booth seating - it isn't often that I sit in a restaurant with loose pillows on its booths. This decor gave the restaurant a very homey vibe. They handled our large group seamlessly. We were in and out in about an hour, which was impressive. The food: I got the fried pickles and the fish tacos - both were pretty good. I realized that I don't like fried pickles, but the chipotle aioli dipping sauce was creamy with a little kick, and the pickles served as a good vehicle to eat the sauce. Coming from California, I hold fish tacos to a certain standard. The fish tacos here were good and came with fried taro chips.
