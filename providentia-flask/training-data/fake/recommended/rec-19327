Stopped in here by chance last Sunday and was totally surprised by how much I enjoyed this place. My friend and I were rushing to see a show at the walnut and needed to grab something in a hurry. We saw this place had pizza and we hoped to grab a quick slice or two. We ended up getting a small pie (8 slices) in about 5 to 6 minutes perfectly and freshly prepared to order. It was delicious! AND to top it off: it was only $5!!! Where can you beat a deal like that? Especially when we got all sorts of toppings added to it as well. Cheap. Tasty. Plus, the whole service staff was delightful and super fun to talk to. Very accommodating to our hurried situation. I cannot wait to go back and actually sit down at a table and enjoy this place for an hour or two!
