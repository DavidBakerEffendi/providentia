I've been to several filipino restaurants and this is my favorite by far.  the service was great, they were very attentive.  their menu left you with more of 'they all look so good i don't know what to get" feeling.  the food was great...it really reminded me of how my yaya used to cook her foods back home.  my boyfriend is american and he himself found himself saying "yum" a few times over the course of dinner.  i was actually shocked that he ordered red horse instead of san miguel...but he actually loved it...now i have to find a place that sells it here in my area.  i will definitely be returning to this place next time we are in the city.
