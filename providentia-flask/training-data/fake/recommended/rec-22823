After moving form Chicago to Connecticut this past summer, I was on the hunt for a good Vietnamese restaurant to have some good comfort food. This was the second time I tried out Le's with a friend and I have very little complaints about Le's as I do with other Vietnamese restaurants that I have tried here so far. Atmosphere - take it for what it is, it's a family owned restaurant. Nothing too fancy. It's rather large compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants here. It is true, from other reviewers and pictures that the decor is a bit quirky but I didn't ruin my dining experience. Owner/waitstaff - every employee there are all kind and genuine. As soon as you come in, it's as if you walked into a relative's home. Customer service is great! Food - The first time I ate at Le's I had Hieu Tieu and the second time I had the Pho Dac Biet. Both were great. I wasn't expecting much but there wasn't any msg and didn't taste like the broth was made from powder. It was really on point. At the end of the meal, they brought out free dessert! Cakes! Highly recommended!!
