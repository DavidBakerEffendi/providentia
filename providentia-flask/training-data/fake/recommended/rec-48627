I've been coming here since 2005 and I love every visit!  The bartenders are hilarious and always engage us in entertaining conversation -- especially Joe, who even gave us one of his art prints (that hangs in our living room!) Tattooed Mom's is tiny, cozy, dim, and is full of every type of person you can think of.  The couches and games on the tables are a fun plus. The food isn't really my type of food, but decent for what it is and CHEAP!  Drink selction is good, too.  Joe has made me a blue drink that tastes just like a raspberry Dum-Dum and it's the best thing I've ever tasted!  Mmmm. Their jukebox has SLADE in it, which is a big plus. Sometimes, I even feel slightly dirty while at Tattooed Mom and I mean that in the best way possible!  There's no pretentiousness here at all and it's a great backdrop for a night out with friends.
