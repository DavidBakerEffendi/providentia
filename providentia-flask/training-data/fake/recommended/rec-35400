Just have to say that if you're aching for some Japanese curry and you want the real thing... this is a great place to get it.  I walked in, was out with my bowl of katsu-curry in five minutes, and have loved every bite of it. The store has an amazing katsudon smell, too.   Katsu-hama gave me just what I needed! A teeny bit pricy for what it is, though.
