I love coming back to my hometown of NYC and trying new places! This neat little spot on the upper westside certainly did not disappoint. To start of this is owned by MIchael Psilakis the semi celebrity chef you've seen on food network.  WIth this in mind one would think this would be an overpriced trendy restaurant with tiny portions.  You would be wrong. The food is good and more importantly good value.  I had the braised lamb shank and my girlfriend had the greek tubular pasta.  Both dishes were flavorful and perfectly cooked.  Even more amazing is the fact that both entrees were under 20 bucks.  How can you beat that? Now to the atmosphere.  It was cozy, maybe a little too cozy.  The dining room can get  loud like a NYC street in rush hour.  So go at an off hour or talk really loud. I won't bore you with too many more detatils, just go give this Greek place a shot.
