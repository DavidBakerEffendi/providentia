At night, I feel the quality of service that I receive is directly proportional to how cute I look. The cuter I look, the lower it plunges. Cleavage, I've found, has a similar effect, resulting in eye rolls from the European (?) hostess, which results in my walking out. (I must add there is one blond, curly haired vintage dress loving waitress who is sweeter than Dupont's Bi√®re de Miel). It breaks my heart, because I really do like The Belgian Cafe. Almost every other review is right; it is Monks II with a shorter wait time and a greater chance of actual conversation. Their food is on par, with slight variations. The best experiences happen in the afternoon. Take the day off, and grab a beer, or two, or three. The bartenders happily talk about beer with grace during those select hours.
