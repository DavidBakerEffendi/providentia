I really, really, reeeeeeally wanted to love this place. After hearing so many wonderfully delicious things about Umami and its burgers, I just had to finally see for myself. Before I get to the meat of the...burger?...I will say that I appreciated the fun, hip ambiance and friendly service. We got lucky on a Saturday afternoon and were immediately seated. Now, the food. I have to say, the Umami burger did not live up to its hype for me. I found the burger to just be okay...kinda small, kinda boring. Yeah, it was juicy and had good flavor to it, but I was expecting something more...special? I actually enjoyed my fries more than my burger and loved the various dipping sauces offered. Sorry Umami-lovers, my life has not been changed nor am I currently dying to go back.
