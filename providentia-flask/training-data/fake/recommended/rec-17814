I came here once before, like 2 months ago. By then everything from the moment I step in to moment I step out was great. Unfortunately today only food and drinks were great. Our server (Grace) was terrible!!! She bring all food together - appetizer and lunch (big minus for that) and salads should have come with extra chicken but I guess she just forgot as she did with whip cream on coffees before. Please change your staff because you'll lose your customers soon.
