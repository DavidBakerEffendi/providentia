Typical Cheesecake Factory.  I always seem to enjoy my meals here, probably because I am exhausted after shopping.  I usually get a salad or the Thai Lettuce Wraps but every once in a while, and depending on who I am with, can pig out on the meatloaf and/or cheesecake.  Service is good, pricing is modest and food portions large.  The only thing that can be annoying is the long wait at peak times.
