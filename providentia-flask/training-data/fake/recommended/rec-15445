After battling the Bloomingdale's Christmas crowds, my husband, daughter, and I had lunch at Sukhumvit 51 yesterday. My thoughts: Ambiance: This restaurant is quite small but very clean and nice. Just be prepared to feel a bit closed in. Service: Servers are all business here so don't expect any friendly conversation. We were okay with that. Food: Overall quite good. -- Tom Yum with Shrimp: Good flavor but there were only 3 shrimp in the bowl. This was a bit disappointing. -- Thai Papaya Salad: Good, fresh flavor. -- Original Thai Basil with Chicken: My husband and daughter couldn't stop saying great things about this dish. I don't eat chicken so I can't comment but since they are usually negative about all things food related I'd say this dish is probably pretty good. -- Sticky Rice: I liked this but nobody else enjoyed the coconut flavor. -- Pad Thai Noodle with Beef: Again I didn't try this (I don't eat beef) but it received raved reviews from my husband and daughter. Overall: We will definitely be returning, because even if my food wasn't extra-special, my husband and daughter were thrilled. And since it's all about them, all the time, we'll be back I'm sure.
