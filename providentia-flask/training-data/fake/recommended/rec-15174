I've never had a philly cheese steak before so not sure I'm the best judge, but I have to say their famous cheese steak with cheese whiz and grilled onions was outstandingly delish! Our guide told us this was the best place for cheese steak sandwiches and she was correct. Can't go wrong here. All other stuff looked good too. We were planning on a big dinner later so we shared a sandwich.
