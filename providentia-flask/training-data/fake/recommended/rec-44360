Had my bday dinner in the private room last Friday. Everything was flawless. There were 13 of us and we did a pre set family style menu w/premium wine and beer for 2 hours. Highly recommend this for a party. The room is absolutely beautiful and has private bathroom and your group's own host in the room the whole time. The whole staff was very gracious and accommodating from the planning stages through the evening. The good was delicious as well. Everyone in my group was very impressed and had a great time. Will do this again for sure.
