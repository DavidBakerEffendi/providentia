I am obsessed with this place.  Unpretentious in staff, clientele, atmosphere, and prices. Everything I order tastes like it's been made with love.  The ingredients are always fresh, and they have an extensive menu with fare for everyone.  They do particularly well with seafood, offering a range of items as well as a variety ways to cook them.   The portions are ginormous so you'll have more than enough with the "half-portions" that they offer.  Most of the entrees come with sides and salad and I'm always taking home extras!  I'm particularly attached to the scrod with any sauce they offer, as well the stuffed mushrooms.  Ridiculously satisfying.  The place gets pretty packed on weekends, so be prepared to wait.  It's absolutely worth it though.
