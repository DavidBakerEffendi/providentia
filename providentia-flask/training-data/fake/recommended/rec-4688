Nice atmosphere, food is good, not great. Drinks were good and not over priced. The calamari and friends app is different than I have had elsewhere and was the highlight of the dinner. also has the shrimp trio which includes 3 different types of shrimp but the buffalo shrimp over powered the others because the sauce ran across the entire dish. Overall would go back.
