This is a handsome little coffee bar. The baristas seem knowledgeable but the few times I've been there I've been disappointed. I like to use coffee jargon as sparingly as possible but I wish I was more specific about my cappuccino---really wet (not much foam, too much milk). It was on the cold side, too. Bummer. I'm not a fan of lattes and prefer my cappuccino dry. Chai is made with store-bought concentrate. Also a bummer. Pour-over, however, was good! Seating is very limited and uncomfortable, very small tables. I still really want to like it here and will likely try again next time I'm in the neighbourhood.
