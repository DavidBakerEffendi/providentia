I LOVE THIS PLACE. I've only been once but it was fantastic. The carpaccio salad was awesome. I love how they offer fresh shavings of Â Parmesan cheese and offer garlic in oil for the bread. My wife loved the mussels and the pizza isnt bad for gluten free crust(although it was lacking) They place is noisy but I think it adds to the charm. I also like the open kitchen where you can see the head chef and team cook up your meal. I can't wait to go back!
