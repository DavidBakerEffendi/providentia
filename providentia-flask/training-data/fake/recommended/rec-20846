My boyfriend and I ate at Sapori last night for Valentine's Day and we can both honestly say that it was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Our reservation was for 6pm but because of all the snow and traffic, we got stuck behind a bus on Valley Road (right in front of the restaurant) for a good 20 minutes. I was thinking that being almost a half an hour late for a Valentine's Day reservation, we had no shot at sitting down. However, the staff could not have been more understanding and accommodating. They went out of their way to set up an extra table, open our wine, and take our orders. The servers are extremely friendly and the owners stopped by our table several times to chat and ensure that we were enjoying ourselves. The food was some of the freshest and best tasting Italian I have ever had. Having traveled to Italy and living in close proximity to Arthur Ave. in the Bronx, I am very familiar with authentic Italian cuisine. I was so very impressed with this food. It was fresh, delicious, well-prepared, and reminiscent of meals I had while in Napoli. My boyfriend and I both can't thank the staff enough for not only an incredible meal, but an incredible dining experience. We can't wait to go back!!!
