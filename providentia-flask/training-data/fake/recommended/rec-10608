I've been here several times for brunch and lunch.  It is consistently delicious.  There are options for a healthy light lunch and a heavy hangover-curing breakfast.  Great salads, Huevos Rancheros, Benedicts, and the side order of bacon is probably enough for 4 people plus its super crispy which I love!  I've never had a bad dish or a nary word from my companion.
