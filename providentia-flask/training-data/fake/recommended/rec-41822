I'm nostalgic for early 90's in Downtown Manhattan. Early Supreme / Phat Farm / Zoo York / Shut / days...17 years ago, I witnessed my homie DJ Stretch Armstrong and Mike D from the Beasties ordered from here and ever since this has been been my go to for Italian on the Downtown's westside. While its not Il Bagatto, Pepe's has big portions and great prices! I get the calamari its great with their bread thoooo....my weakness. They have a great nicose (sp) salad...honestly the food reminds me of my Italian "grandmother" on the 5th floor's cooking... (Grandma Margret, Bless her sweet soul) but it made by these little South American dudes in the tiniest kitchen!
