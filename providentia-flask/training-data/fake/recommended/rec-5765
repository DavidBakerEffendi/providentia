I had brunch here on the recommendation of Alycia J. and it was a good choice. The decor is fun and unique and the service was friendly. I had the pumpkin waffles which tasted like autumn. You know your food is good when you can describe it as a season! I feel like this would also be a great place for late night dinner and drinks, so next time I'm in town I plan on stopping by again.
