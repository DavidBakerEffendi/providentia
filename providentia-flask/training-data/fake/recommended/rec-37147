I loved this place!  It seemed so cozy when we walked in.  It had nice decor and service was great as well, but that's not even the best part.  The food we ordered was delicious.   I came with a few people.  We ate the bistrot steak frites as well as two of the specials: the striped bass and the coq au vin.  The food absolutely blew us away.  The frites were very addicting.  Not to mention the striped bass was cooked nicely with its slightly crispy skin covered in lemon and sitting atop asparagus and almond puree.  I could go on about how delicious it was but it's better to try it for yourselves. We didnt stop there though.  We also ordered all three of the desserts.  I'm not too sure of what the names were but I know one was the creme brulee, another was an apple pie and vanilla ice cream, and the third was another pastry with vanilla ice cream inside covered in chocolate.  These were also equally as delicious.  The apple pie wasnt too sweet so it wasnt overpowering and the vanilla only helped to make it better. The only item we werent too fond of was the duck pate appetizer.  It wasn't our favorite, but all in all, we all agreed we'd definitely come again.
