I have been back a few times and wanted to update my review.  Every time I go to Fare I think - wow I really like it here! The menu is varied and everything is marked whether it is vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. I really appreciate that in a restaurant. I am a huge fan of the "very clean martini" and have tried a few of their wines which have been really good.  Even their house wine at $6 is really good and very reasonable.  Their tofu scramble is great if you like tofu scrambles - I must say this one is great.  It is a great place for a lot of different occasions: date night, dinner with the parents or in-laws, dining with picky eaters or dietary restrictions.
