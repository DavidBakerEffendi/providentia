*Groan* I have such a bittersweet relationship with Umami Burger. On one hand... both hands actually, it's messy. On the other hand (does this analogy still apply?) it's so tasty, that I've regressed to the point of apathy & all I want to do is smear my tongue all over my powdered sugar syrupy hands. I'm talking about the Monte Cristo Burger. After admitting defeat at attempting to keep my hands clean, a bite into this burger & all I wanted to do the remainder of my dinner was to eat meat & grunt like a caveman.     My friend ordered The Umami Burger *scoffs* how unoriginal. We were both enamored with our respective meals that there was an unspoken agreement not to share, so I can't attest to how good that burger was, but he seemed very happy. Sidenote: Our waitress had a cute butt     I can't say if the Monte Cristo Burger is still on the menu; from my impression, it was a limited time thing. Temporary love is just... low, which is how I feel. My spirit is breaking. The burger itself has a permanent place in Diabetic Heaven. Smothered in syrup & powdered sugar... & happiness. I love sugar. I once named an ex Sugarbutt. She reads these reviews. Hi Andrea.
