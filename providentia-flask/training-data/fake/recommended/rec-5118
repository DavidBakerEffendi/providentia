This is a tasty, tasty BBQ place. We were a group of 6, easily seated in the HUGE space that they have, and proceed to eat as much of that grub as possible. Frito pie, pulled pork, cornbread with pepper jelly, ribs falling off the bone, FATTY BRISKET. The meats really stand out, but everything was super awesome. And, to top it all off, we had a really fun time with our waitress. Psyched that this place has moved into the neighb. See ya soon, Morgan's!
