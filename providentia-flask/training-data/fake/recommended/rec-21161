For $5 its a dream come true!  I LOVE the chicken/lamb over rice combo.  Its so good.  The first time I had it it was after a very late night oh I say around 4:30AM and we all know that EVERYTHING tastes good at that time.  So I needed to give this place a try again but this time sober and when the sun is out.  After a day of shopping I wanted something quick, cheap and good.  Being around the area and I decided to give this another try.  After turning the corner all I can see is the long line of ppl and the smell of grilled meat in the air.     I gave them my $5 and asked for more of their white sauce on the side.  I don't know what the white sauce is...I believe its yogurt sauce but truly its something worth putting lots of on.  Not really much of a pita person so I'll pass on that and ask for more rice and meat with no extra charge! yippee!  If you like it spicy ask for their red sauce on the SIDE .  Beware.. it could kill ya! There are many of these all around the city but the one on 53rd and 6th is the BEST!  You sometimes can see ppl filming around them.   THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN NYC!!!
