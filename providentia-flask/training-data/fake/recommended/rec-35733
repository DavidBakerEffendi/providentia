I ate at Tinto for the first time yesterday night, and my mouth starts watering when I reminiscence about my meal. Â We went with a large party (10), and we did have to wait 20 minutes after our reservation to get seated, but the food was so amazing it definitely made up for it. My friend and I decided to share 6 plates between us. We got the Boucheron cheese (a softer, spreadable cheese served with green apples, a jam, and crackers/bread), the roast pork bocadillos (1 small sandwich but REALLY REALLY delicious), the revuelto de cangrejo (good crab, but not my favorite dish), the figs (4 figs wrapped in bacon--sweet and salty, good combo), the pork belly (delicious! but fatty), and the patatas asturianas (really delicious). I also had a bite of their bomba rice and it really was the bomb! i loved the lemon flavor of the dish. If this place wasn't so expensive, I would definitely come here on a weekly basis! However, being a student, I will probably only get to come here on special occasions. That said, between the two of us, our 6 dishes ended up being about $27 per person (with tax and tip).
