SO impressed with Bartaco! Walked in and we were seated right away. I ate here with a friend from Mexico who is a much harsher Mexican food critic than I am. While he said the food wasn't authentic (e.g., falafel taco) it was still the best place for tacos he's had in the US. Guac was delicious too. Great atmosphere at night if you're up for loud music and lot's of 20 somethings. Will definitely return!
