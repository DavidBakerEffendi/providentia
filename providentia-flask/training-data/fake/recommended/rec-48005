3.5 stars, but just not enough for 4. Went there on the recommendation of a friend from TX regarding their fried chicken. The chicken was indeed excellent. Other food was good as well, though not overwhelming. The squash salad and iceberg wedge were very good, albeit the wedge was a bit small (especially for the price). The low country shrimp left us somewhat disappointed, and so did their drinks. Overall, a good experience but it seemed overpriced for what it is - if you love fried chicken give this place (and Bobwhite) a try though. Friendly service should be noted as well.
