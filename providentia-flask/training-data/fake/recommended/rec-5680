I am on a quest to find the World's Best Veggie Burger and Village Whiskey is a strong contender for that title. Considering Jose Garces' credentials, this is hardly surprising. The guy's an Iron Chef winner, a star of the Philadelphia restaurant scene and named best chef in the Mid-Atlantic by the James Beard Foundation. The veggie burger seems to be a paean to Garces' Spanish influences as the homemade black-bean and lentil patty is seasoned with cilantro, garlic, cumin, cayenne and onions. The toppings also have a decidedly Latino flare -- fresh, unctuous guacamole and a garlicky cabbage slaw whose tingling heat derives from Spanish guindilla peppers. My fiance raved about his burger. Devoid of the Spanish influences of my veggie burger, the Village Burger is pure Americana through and through. High-quality, farm-raised Angus beef, well-cooked and seasoned, served with the standard toppings - lettuce, tomato and pickle. One lament -- the fact that the burgers do not come with fries. We ordered a side of tater tots and the duck-fat fries. The tater tots were hot, crunchy and quickly disappeared from the table -- in short, everything you'd expect from hot tater tots. The duck fat fries, on the other hand? Tasty but not exceptional. A good gimmick and one that will definitely pique the interest of foodies, but it's not like they were the greatest fries in the world or anything. Added bonus about grabbing lunch at Village Whiskey? It's right across the street from Capogiro -- home of Philly's best gelato. I don't know about about you, but burgers and ice cream? It's a pretty perfect lunch for a sunny Saturday afternoon.
