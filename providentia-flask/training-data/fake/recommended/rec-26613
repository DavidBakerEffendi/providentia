My favorite place to go before Devils games!  Alcoholically speaking, I love the $3 tall can PBRs and the draft specials they seem to run at random.  And the beer towers rule.  My girlfriend hates beer and she loves all the big crazy frozen drinks they have here.  This place has my favorite burgers and fries.  I usually get the brick city burger.  The fries are always on point and taste like theyre from burger king (in a good way).  I dont recommend the wings just because they come on a small plate of only like 6-8 wings. When I get wings I like to get about 20 like a sicko.  Bottom line this place is cool and way cooler than some of those more expensive spots that opened up across from the Rock.
