Love Fuel! My boyfriend & I come here almost every time we're in Center City. We love their smoothies! We've eaten here twice: my boyfriend always loved his food. The first time, I got the egg plant & goat cheese on a wrap. I wasn't a huge fan of it because it kept falling apart. It definitely had awesome flavors though! The second time, I got the sweet potato risotto rice bowl. One of the most delicious things I have ever had! I can't wait to go back and have it again. I recommend it 100%. There were so many amazing flavors. My favorite smoothies are the Islander and the Protein Buster. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. Can't wait to come back and try more smoothies & rice bowls!
