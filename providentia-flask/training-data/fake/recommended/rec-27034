My husband and I wanted to like this place based on some of the reviews we read but unfortunately I can't say that we did. We kept hearing how FRESH the food was while looking over the menu, so we were cautiously optimistic. While the appetizers (spiedini and clams casino) were good they were served luke warm. We barely finished that course and our main course was being served. Way too quick for our liking. My husband had the shrimp parmigiana . It was bleh. The shrimp were OK but the pasta was missing something (salted water to cook it in). I had the fish special. While the meal was hot and the first bites were good the balance was fishy. When I expressed my disappointment to our  waiter the reply was 'it happens'. REALLY??!!! That was unacceptable. If this is what they consider FRESH they all need to go back to culinary school.  Montclair has so many other excellent restaurants I suggest going to one of them. We will not return.
