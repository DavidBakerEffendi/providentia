I came here for dessert and drinks. Upon walking in, the front area was fairly dead. After putting my name in, I was told "less than 5 minutes" for a table. However, larger parties that came after me were seated while we continued to wait. We were seated after about 10 minutes. The dessert menu looks good - but beware. The actual desserts are about what you'd expect to receive at your garden variety "Applebee's." I ordered the ice cream pop fondue, which looked good on the picture in the menu. However in reality, it was a TINY ice cream pop that was pre-wrapped, like a tiny version of one you'd get from the grocery store. The actual ice cream, and fondue dippers, were bland. My girlfriend's tiramisu actually tasted sour, and was a soupy consistency. I'm not sure how it was supposed to be tiramisu, since the flavor and consistency weren't even close. I've had better desserts from a Mister Softee truck. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs. Also worth noting: the bathrooms are single-person only, which creates long queues to use them, the layout is awkward, and the decor is less than impressive, unless you're an 8 year old. Of course, you'd probably have to be an 8 year old to think the food is good here.
