After making a mistake and trying Geno's first we headed over to Pat's to try an authentic Philly cheese steak. It was juicy and delicious and I have to say I loved the provolone cheese on top, we also preferred the onions at Pat's they were flavorful without that greasy after taste. We found the bread to be soft and tasty as well. Hands down Pat's offers a superior product and with friendlier service.
