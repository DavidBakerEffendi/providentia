I've been going here since it opened last year.  My wife and I used to have to drive and try to park at the Standard Tap for this up-scale gastro-pub style food.  We live in this neighborhood and its really nice to see good things sprouting up.  We rarely have to wait to eat, and if we do... the beer menu is fantastic.  Great draft selections and really interesting bottles.  The food continues to get better, always interesting soups and the hanger steak is perfect.  The staff there has always been quick, accomidating and pleasant.  This is where we bring friends and family who are in town for a few days when we are trying to eat relatively affordable.
