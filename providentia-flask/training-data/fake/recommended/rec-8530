Wonderful neighborhood spot! Had the "short stack" (2) whole wheat pancakes with chocolate chips. Great flavor, and you won't feel like a boulder has been lodged in your stomach after consuming. The service was very friendly and personable, and the restroom immaculate...always a plus after coffee!!
