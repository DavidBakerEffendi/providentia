I was very excited to come here after looking at their website, which showed they had a daily changing menu, which had my favorite item on it--duck--on the day I decided to go. I got to the restaurant a bit early for my reservation and the waiter asked me to wait outside, in the cold, until my table was ready. The table was ready right on time though. After I was seated it was a good 10 minutes before a waiter even came over to offer water or to take my drink order. Also, I had noticed the menu did not have the duck entree that I was so excited about. The duck was the only thing on the menu that I had enticed me to try out this expensive locale. The waiter apologized that the menu was different from the online version, b/ut really, is it so hard to use the same menu online as in the restaurant? Especially when the website specifically says this is what is being served TODAY. A small setback, but I settled on ordering the short ribs. The waiter did not, however, take my table's dinner order until we were almost finished with the appetizer cheese plate we ordered. I was very hungry and ended up filling up too much on their homemade bread, which was pretty good, but I would have preferred to have been able to fill up on my order. My short ribs were pretty good as was my date's lamb dish, but we did notice that several components on our dishes were exactly the same. They must just have a bunch of things in the back and then they assemble a plate when you order, but were that the case, you would think it wouldnt take so long to get food out! For dessert I had their sweet potato cake, which was pretty good and my date had their gala apple crisp, which tasted like they spilled a whole box of sugar in it. In all, I would say the food was good, but not memorable. It seemed they were trying very hard to serve a gourmet meal that really just missed the mark. It was pretty unexciting food and not worth the price.
