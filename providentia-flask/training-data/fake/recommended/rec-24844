The hostess was so sweet, she felt bad that even though we did not have a reservation, there would be a 15 minute wait to seat us. That was okay, we went to the bar and ordered a drink. Before the bartender was even done making them, they had the table ready for us. We settled up at the bar as instructed and sat down at our table. Our waitress, Leslie, was horribly rude. She was annoyed that we were already had drinks and didn't want an appetizer. The food was good, but Leslie again was annoyed that we wanted just entrees and not the desert menu. While I was in the bathroom, I overheard her complaining to another waitress that we just ordered entrees.
