A few friends and I tried to eat at Little Owl, but they didn't have a four top table, so the host recommended that we check out their sister restaurant, Market Table. He even called and reserved a table for us so it was ready when we arrived a few minutes later. I started out with the special for the evening, the leek and potato soup, and it was to die for. Just the right consistency, not too thick, and the mixture of potatoes, mushrooms and leeks was perfect. For my entree I had the halibut and it was just as good as the soup, and beautiful to boot. I couldn't make it to dessert, but they had a polka dot cheesecake that sounded really good, I'll have to try it next time. It was a bit pricey at about $50 a person (without drinks), but I can easily say that the service, atmosphere and food at Market Table were well worth the money.
