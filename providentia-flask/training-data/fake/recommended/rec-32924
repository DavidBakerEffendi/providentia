Had all of our orders mixed up.. No set waitress.. And they all act like they don't know what you're saying and are SUPER RUDE. Took almost 45 mins to get all of our food.. Also when I ordered my food they had shrimp stool in the dough of my sumai!!!! Disgusting!! Never will go back and don't recommend to anyone! Felt so disgusted and sick after leaving that disgusting place!
