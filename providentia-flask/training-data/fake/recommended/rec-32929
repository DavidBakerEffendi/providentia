Very good food for brunch! Had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict ..very delish! Side of grits..very good...French toast...fabulous! It's a fun environment to have a casual brunch with friends. Service was good, although due to the amount of the customers there, it took a while for us to get our.waitress the few times we needed her. Arrived there around 11am on a Saturday, and the wait wasn't bad at all. However, when we were leaving...it seemed to be a very long wait. So get there early.. Overall...great food, ok service, fun place for a brunch!
