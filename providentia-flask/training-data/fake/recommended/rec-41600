I attended a dinner here last weekend with a large group, we have come here for several years in a row during a benefit weekend we are all in town for. Last weekend will be the last time I ever dine here, not only was food and service mediocre at best. But the owner was rude to my guests, right to their face.  They miscounted the table settings and hadn't had enough seatings ready for our guest count. One gentleman set at the head of the table which would've been fine. Except the owner Franco, told my him that this was not okay and he was "too big to be in this restaurant." As well another lady asked were was the best area, for an elderly lady, who was on a walker, to be sat... again the owner said just plop her corpse over here.  I was mortified. I was embarrassed for them. And had we not been a large party that otherwise couldn't just find easy accommodation for a Saturday night. I would have walked out. The owner knew he was wrong, and tried to joke with then both and pretend this is how South Philly is. I would beg you, you rude little ignorant man, to find some people on the streets, where my family grew up, who would even think what you did was humorous, let alone indicative of the people in this city. I dare you. I am livid at the fact I had to have my friends subjected to you and your small minded pitiful disrespect.  I will however be sure to tell everyone I know who dines there regularly, and make it a point to publicly tell this story on every social media or review site I can. You will quickly see how your mistake of talking to guests is going to cost you your business.  For an owner to even think of speaking to a guest like so is appalling. High Note Cafe has clearly hit an all time low. It has lost a customer. And likely any of my friends who I would have gladly introduced to it.  Never again.
