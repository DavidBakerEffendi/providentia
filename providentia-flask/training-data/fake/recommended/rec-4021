I stopped by Char No. 4 for a drink and a snack before heading out for an election night party.  Usually a beer or wine drinking gal, I decided to instead try one of their specialty whiskey cocktails, since it is a whiskey bar after all.  The Horse Drawn Carriage (ancient age whiskey, sparkling pear cider, fresh pressed ginger) was refreshing and boozy without overwhelming the senses.  I also couldn't resist trying the cheddar cheese curds-- delicious, gooey yet airy balls of cheese deep fried with a delicate crust.  A fancy-pants take on the mozzarella stick with a spicy dipping sauce.  Char No. 4 was a bit of an indulgence, but the friendly staff and cozy atmosphere made it worthwhile.  I'll be back for brunch!!
