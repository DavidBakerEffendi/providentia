Cozy and cute.  Food at the table drew a range of reviews from "amazing" (for tagliatelle with pork) to "bleh" (polenta with eggs, cheddar and mushrooms).  The latter lacked some subtlety -- apparently too much cheddar and therefore quite heavy.  In any case, I would go back -- the place is cute and the menu on the whole interesting and local.  Everyone is nice.  NB it's quite loud in front because of the small size ... too loud for my taste but the booths in back are more quiet.
