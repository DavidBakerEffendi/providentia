Have been going here for about 10 years.  It's a great place.   Price:  Reasonable. Food:  Great and consistent.  I ONLY get the Chicken in a White Wine Garlic Sauce, not because I do not like anything else that they have (because I do) but because I love this dish so much and for the life of me, cannot replicate at home.  Their rice and beans, OMG to die for! The food is just great and it's so consistently good.  You're never surprised! Drink:  It's great! They are big Bacardi brand people.   Location:  Near Bloomies - great option when you want some flavorful food. Ambiance:  Cute and island-y.  It's very tight quarters however.     Staff: So great! It's as if they only have their family working there.  Everyone cares about their service and their product.  So wonderful.   Eat here soon.  Everyone!!
