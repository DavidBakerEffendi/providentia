service is great, food is delicious, atmosphere is wonderful!!! the polenta and fennel risotto were to die for!!!! went there around 9pm on a Thursday, wait was 2 hours for table for 4, which I was expecting... then again on a Friday for lunch around 2pm and there was no wait, for a table for 2. a must try! good for groups, but expect to wait.
