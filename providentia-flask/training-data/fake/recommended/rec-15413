Let me start by saying I love this place for a great variety of food and awesome curry dishes! Service very often forgetful, and almost every other time i have been here something didn't make it to my table, or I had to ask for it a few times. Still I keep coming back for a good casual meal with friends. Except today I witnessed something aweful. While I was in the bathroom one of the waitresses left the bathroom stall without washing her hands and went out into the dining hall to pour tea and serve food!! I was simply speechless!! I was next to her in the washroom and right behind her leaving - completely in shock! My friends asked why I didnt report it to the manager? At that point we were already leaving and my friends were waiting outside. Ugh I don't know but maybe I should have. I'm completely disgusted! The wait stuff must be re-educated on amount of diseases caused by simply not washing hands!!
