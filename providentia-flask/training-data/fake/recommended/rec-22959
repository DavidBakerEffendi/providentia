Our reservation was for 6 pm and we arrived on time and were promptly seated. We waited for one hour and a half before our meal arrived. The volcano sushi did not have the crisp sweet potato sticks, our appetizers never arrived and the tempura was greasy. Poor service and lack of quality control in the kitchen means we will not frequent this restaurant again. Those seated near us had similar complaints.
