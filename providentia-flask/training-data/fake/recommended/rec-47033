I see there are a lot of great reviews on the pizza here...I would kind of agree with that. However, I also ordered the hot buffalo wings from them. What a mistake that was. How would I describe it??? I would say garbage. They were mushy and the skin had a weird texture. When you eat wings they are supposed to be crispy, not slimy. The biggest complaint I would have though is when I called to let them know how dissatisfied I was with the order. I spoke to one guy who seemed so upset with the truth that he hung up on me. Then my friend called to let them know they should take the wings off the menu...they didn't like that either. In fact the manager called my friend back to yell at him and let him know just how great the wings are. My guess is he's delusional. In conclusion, the pizza here is pretty good, just save yourself the trouble of ordering wings from this place.
