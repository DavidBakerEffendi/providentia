Phenomenal baked Mac N Cheese! Comes out bubbling hot and has a thick consistency. Huge serving for 8 bucks!! Loved the Fried Catfish sandwich too...def one of the best I've ever had...served with a side of amazing crispy spicy french fries! Overall, Juniper was a nice discovery last night with some friends. It's a small place so I wouldn't go there with more than three friends. The Asian lady who serves everyone is super nice and was really accommodating with our champagne and cupcakes we brought for a celebration! Will definitely return to Juniper soon!!!!
