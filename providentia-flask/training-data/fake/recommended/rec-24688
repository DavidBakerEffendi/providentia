OMG! Finally a place that rivals my mom's pork/chive dumplings. Better than Lamzhou in my opinion as I prefer more meat & vegetable to skin ratio, Lamzhou doesn't put as much filling. Prosperity dumpling is a joke compared to these, very plain taste wise comparatively. The noodles with peanut sauce is amazeballs, never had this before, you have to try it if you like peanut butter. Also had the meat within the rice balls (number 14 on the menu), again taste just like the way my mom makes them!! While this place does have a B food rating (who cares...), it has a decent size seating area in the store front (much bigger than that dump we call Prosperity) and IMO cleaner than Lam zhou's interiors.
