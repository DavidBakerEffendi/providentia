Fairmount is a decent staple in the neighborhood - decent food, decent price.  My only major complaint is that 4 out of 10 times my order is wrong.  And to add insult to injury, they don't usually run you new order out immediately...  they wait until the have other deliveries going out!  Not the best customer service.  Unfortunately, this is what is going to lead to me find a new delivery spot for boneless wings (my fav). The wing sauce could def. be a better too.  Meh.
