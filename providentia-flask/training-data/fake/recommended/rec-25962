Could be my new favorite place to eat! Â We came for Sunday brunch. The decor inside was modern, comfortable, open and welcoming. The menu was phenomenal - never had I had such a hard time choosing what to order! We shared the eggs benedict (because it's usually what I want on a Sunday) and the pork schnitzel. Both were perfection! Both dishes came with salad (as opposed to potatoes, which is a good thing because it's less carbs, less guilt :) )And you know when you can't decide whether to get something salty or sweet for brunch? Problem solved with a side order of French toast bites served with lemon curd and maple syrup - genius! The price was reasonable, actually great for the quality of the food and the warm attentive service. I can't wait to come back to try the many other brunch items on the menu and then come back for dinner too!
