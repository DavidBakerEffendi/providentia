So many side dishes, refillable for free (as all Korean places should be) 1 fried fish per person, and that's just the start! This is the BEST soondubu place ever, and the rice comes in a heated stone bowl. The service is special, to say the least. Even people who don't usually like soondubu find the soondubu here to be good. I've only tried the spicy and "danger" spicy, and like someone noted, there is an inconsistency in the spiciness, (as spicy and danger tasted about the same) but that's the only thing. A definite must go.
