I tried Uva for the first time last night (Thursday), and I had an amazing experience.  The wine list is extensive and unique, and I would highly recommend that you try one of the sparkling red wines served in a bowl (The menu has an interesting story about the history of drinking wine from white ceramic bowls).   Both the patio and the main restaurant have a great atmosphere.  I loved the rustic wood tables and exposed brick walls.  The staff were friendly and attentive, and happy to help with our wine selections.  I was there for drinks, but the food looked amazing, and I can't wait to go back for dinner!
