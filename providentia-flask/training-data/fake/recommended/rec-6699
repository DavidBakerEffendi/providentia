The sesame pancake wasn't all too great, but I had the boiled pork and chive dumplings and they were DELICIOUS. 5 for a dollar, can you really beat that? Definition of your classic, delicious hole in the wall place.. definitely don't expect to really eat here though, it's REALLY small and barely any place to stand let alone sit and enjoy the amazing dumplings.
