As i have some Moroccan in me, I might be a harsh critic since my mom cooks similar food; this was just ok. The hummus is decent (i have had better), the labne was ok (i definitely had better), but what i was most disappointed with was the mix grill platter. The chicken was REALLY good, but the lamb lacked a whole lot of flavor! I split this dish with my girlfriend, even though we were ok after eating so much bread, it was just simply not so much food (at least for 2). They give you 3 pieces of chicken and 3 pieces of lamb on a skewer. If i am paying $21 for a dish like this, I expect a little more meat.. Overall, it was good, but I've definitely had better Mediterranean food.
