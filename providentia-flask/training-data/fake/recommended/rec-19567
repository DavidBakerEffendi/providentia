Looks like the owner of Sabrina's has figured out Philadelphia," put a lot of food on a plate, and charge not too much for it." Can restaurant owners, please, find another bread besides challah to make a french toast with? It's not novel, anymore. Sometimes, large portions don't cover up mediocre food. That said, I had a pleasant experience at Sabrina's. La Colombe coffee is always a good thing. My friend and I only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Our food came quickly, and our server was nice. My friend had an egg white omelet, that looked burned, and I wasn't really blown away by the french toast. All in all, I can't give it more than 3 stars.
