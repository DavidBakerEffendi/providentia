Best Italian experience to date!! Right when we walked in the door we were graciously greeted by all the staff. The restaurant was super cozy and felt like I was transformed to Italy. Our server was very knowledgable and explained anything we asked about the menu to a T. We started with the grilled octopus. The sauce on it was so unique and tasty. Then came the meatballs...best meatballs I've had! Since they get their meat from Pino's, you know it's organic and fresh. They were so moist and delicious. I ordered the vegetable lasagna as it was recommended to try by our server. This was probably the freshest, best tasting (to my standards) lasagna I've had. This place is a must try and I'll definitely be back after the wonderful experience I had!
