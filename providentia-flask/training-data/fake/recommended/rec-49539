The sushi here is amazing! Very creative combination and one can see the attention to details in the different sauces. The colour combination makes the sushi look really enticing. I tried the Spicy Mang, Pickle Me and the monthly roll. They were all bursting with a variety of flavours and texture. I was expecting the rice to be a bit more chewy, but then I think it would allow the crunchiness of the pickles and the creaminess of the avocado to stand out more. I do however wonder how it would taste like if the grains are more chewy. Â  I also like the contrast of the spicy cayenne and the veggie mix, against the sweetness of the mango, making the flavours more well-balanced, not too sweet. The monthly roll has an interesting flavour because of the jerusalem artichoke. I thought the kale chip makes it look fun but didn't think the flavour blends well. Also tried the seaweed individual piece and that also had a really nice texture. I had the spicy shroom and that was also delicious. Good combination of texture again with the crunchy cashews, contrasted with the lettuce and the mushroom. The wrapping also has a nice firm texture. Can't wait to come back again and to try all the other sushi.
