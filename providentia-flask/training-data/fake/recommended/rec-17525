I really enjoyed this place.  The staff was very friendly and the service was good.  I came with a group of people and they gave each of us a separate check (most places won't do that). I had the 'ten silver dollar sized pancakes with strawberries' and I ate the whole plate. Pancakes were light and fluffy, butter was soft, strawberries fresh.  I will be back here again.
