I kinda feel sorry for myself everytime I come here...by myself. This is the place for loners I guess. Since I am taking classes nearby, I don't have much choice or time for real food around this neighborhood. This place is set up for loners and lovebirds who can't afford a decent night out. [no offense, I really think it's super cool that the chick would actually dine here with her boytoy. It means either she has no choice. Which is sad. Or she really supports the poor dude. Which is also pretty sad. But hey, for richer or poorer...] The buffet is located on the right hand side. There are hot food in containers ranging from $3.50 - 10?? The cold stuff are located near the drinks on the left side. So when you walk in, you'll see a bunch of single chicks (it's that sad!) mostly hanging out near the windows by themselves, eating jap chae (korean glassy noodles) or chow fan (fried rice), or staring at the walls, eating the same stuff. There may be one or two nerdy Asian guys with a "serial-killer in gold rim glasses" look sitting in the middle table. It reminds me of high school cafeteria all over again. Pretty segregated between genders. And it really freaks me out everytime I sit here because you never know if you're sitting next to a serial killer. Gosh, I have to stop watching horror films. Just be polite and don't stare. Or look like a serial killer yourself to avoid random small talk with those who might be one. Food wise, I try not to think which are the leftovers. The ones in the container, or the ones in the buffet table.
