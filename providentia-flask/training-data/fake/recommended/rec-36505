Went there last night with my fiance and my dad.  We sat in the tavern room which was a little more laid back.  The head chef Michael could not have been nicer! He came out to say hi to us and you could tell how passionate he is for food and Danny Meyers vision for restaurants.  The food was great! I had the chicken and raviolo which both were amazing!!
