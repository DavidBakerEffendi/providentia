Historical pizza place with lots of locals and out-of-towner's looking satisfied and having fun.  Primo ingredients and delicious pizza with perfect thin, crispy yet chewy crust.   Check out the back where they bake the pizza in the big red hot fire oven.  It's like a pizza factory and the chefs have it down to a rhythmic science. Don't bother going all the way into Little Italy for a great slice or pie, this place borders East SoHo and has lots of nice little shops and other restaurants without the herds of people...like on Mulberry or Broadway.
