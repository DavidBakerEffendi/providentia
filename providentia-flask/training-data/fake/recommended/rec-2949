I took the family here last night for dinner. We were greeted and seated promptly and given menu's. We met the owner Anthony who was very knowledgeable with beers and wine. My wife was not sure what wine to drink so he brought her samples of pinot grigio Â to try, which i thought was awesome. i had a pint of Bells Two Hearted ale which was delicious. We ordered burgers for the kids which were perfectly cooked and came with sweet potato and regular fries(nice touch). My wife and I shared the cheeseball salad, Lima beans and beet ravioli all of which were fantastic! I must say our whole experience was great from service to food and drinks. Great addition to Fishtown...Great job! BTW, they have a great deck for outdoor dining!
