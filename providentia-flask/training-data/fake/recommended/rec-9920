Went there with a Groupon. Normally with a discount, you would think the place is not good, but Tia Pol was amazing! The waiters were very friendly, the food was amazing. We had the squid ink rice, ham platter, lamb on sticks, and a salad. Everything tasted great, and I will definitely go again even without the Groupon!
