Man, I love this place! Excellent traditional Korean food! They make their own tofu, and the interior feels like old Korea with lots of wood and a big caldron in the back. Their banchan (free side dishes) are all good -- probably the best among the Manhattan Korean restaurants. My favorite entrees are the sizzling pollack and the kimchi beejee chigae (ground soybean and tofu soup). mmmm.... But if you are new to Korean food, this is probably not the place for you. You may either love it, or most likely be scared by it and then scared of Korean food. So try somewhere else first if you are a Korean-food-virgin.
