I know it's a WED NIGHT..... but still... Firstly there was a 1.45 min wait! so we decided to wait@ Bar JAMON  around the corner and a sister restaurant. 2.(hrs)10(mins) later we were seated at the right hand side far bar. The bartender (pleasant) was more inclined to helping first come first served!..... so she served everyone else first.  Sounds fair! However speaking form a restaurant background myself I know it is possible to greet your patrons and let them know you will be with them shortly!On top of that when it was our "turn" .. she took the order but did'nt have much to offer in terms of recommendations!. She actually said there were no favs! on the menu when I asked!!! So I relied on my own expertise!... and was NOT disappointed in my selection if I may say so! The food  was fulfilled to expectations... BUT... goes to show you in the restaurant world that's ONLY  the HALF of it!!! Service is the other half!!! IT deserved One star but I cant lie... The food was good so I had to be honest and give it ONE more....BTW.... I'm writing this at 11:18 pm right after I got home !!! How much more real do you need this review to be!??? OVERALL.. It did not deserve more than ONE star but I had to be Honest about at least the food! The service on the other hand leaves Much much more to be desired to put it ...nicely
