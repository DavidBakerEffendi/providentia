I'm only rating Vivo on their food, and I think they have the best tapas in the ironbound. The tortilla espanola, pulpo, squid, and stuffed mushrooms were all delicious and very affordable for the neighborhood, especially compared to Mompou just up Ferry St. Go to Vivo for tasty, cheap tapas so long as you can tolerate dining in a club with changing neon lights in the background.
