I was so disappointed with OCF Coffee House.  The space is nice, and the service was good and pretty quick, but I was totally underwhelmed by their coffee and bagels/bagel sandwiches.  The bagels are basically bread (not true bagels) and have ZERO flavor.  I had to add quite a bit of salt to both my buttered sesame bagel and my husband's bacon/egg/cheese on a wheat bagel.  The prices aren't cheap either, so I was expecting at least a tasty breakfast and good cup of coffee.  Also, the coffee bar was a complete mess when I was there.  Cream, sugar, trash all over it.  I suppose they were busy, but someone should routinely wipe it down.
