This was the first time I went to a Brazilian Grill and I absolutely loved it. If you've never been, you have a card that you flip over when you want people to bring you meat. Waiters carry around different cuts of meat and will ask you if you want any if they see your card's up. Once you turn your card over, they'll stop bugging you so you can chow down. They have an excellent salad bar. What I liked the most were aged cuts of Parmesan cheese. They had other goodies, but I have heard many stories of people getting filled up on the salad bar, so I spent little time there and left lots of room for some meat. The garlic beef and chicken were the types of meat I liked the best. There were many pieces of meat that I didn't even get to try. An easter egg is to check the menu for the "specials" and ask for them directly from your waiter. I found that the "specials" didn't come around often so catching someone with a special cut of meat rarely happened. Asking directly will ensure they'll be over with a cut especially for you. If you have $50 to spend on a nice dinner, I highly recommend you stop by. You'll eat very well and maybe have some cuts of meat that you may never have had anywhere else.
