Wow. We waited an hour for two at 8pm on a Thursday night - it really is worth the wait (we just spent the time at a nearby bar). For $35 a person, pre-tip, we got pork bun appetizers, a bowl of ramen, green tea ice cream for dessert, and a beer. One of the best deals you can find in NY. Great for dinner, I would totally go back. A must for ramen lovers. Plus it's way better than Momofuku.
