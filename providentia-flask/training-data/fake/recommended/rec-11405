Have been 3 times and every time has been amazing.  Place has an incredible vibe, excellent service and incredible food and drinks.  Love the energy.  The raw oysters have always been delicious.   Every dish (both small plates and large plates) have been delicious.   If you like tequila with a kick, definitely get the Blue Heat cocktail !
