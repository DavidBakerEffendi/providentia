The best way to describe the food is definitely hipster comfort food. But it was delicious. I came with four people around 8-9PM, and it was a little busy but we got to a table right away. The waitress was really nice and attentive and really helped us in selecting out food since I had no idea what I wanted. I ended up getting the Fried Buffalo Chicken Sandwich that came with spicy sweet potatoes. The chicken patty was cooked perfectly, the only downside (which isn't even a downside really) was that the patty was bigger than the bread. Eating it was kind of a maneuver but worth it. The "spicy" part of the sweet potato fried was just old bay, and being from Maryland... it just reminds me of crab, not that spicy at all. I also ended up getting a root beer float, which was AMAZING. I loved it, I mean you can't really go wrong with Hagen Das and some root beer right? But when I drank all the root beer the waitress was kind enough to bring me another mason jar full of root beer. The glassware for the water are little mason jars, which I found to be adorable. The walls in the bathroom were filled with chalk drawings which to me were charming. I really liked this place, I would totally go again.
