Recently had a superb dinner here.  This is a great place to celebrate a special occassion or go when your parents are in town and they want to treat.  That said, our celebration dinner we had the other night did set us back a bit more than we expected, but it was worth it because of the great and friendly service we received, and excellent quality and well-prepared food we ate. I appreciated that the menu consisted of very fresh and seasonal offerings, many ingredients which are not considered "conventional."  For example, my dinner consisted of a special-of-the-day roasted squab appetizer (tender and still very rare) followed by a smoked cod in asparagus broth with barley, while my bf started with a decadent creamy lobster "broth" and had a monkfish with pickled watermelon as his main.  I wouldn't recommend however, that you go to this place with picky or unadventurous  eaters, they just might not appreciate it all as much. Oh, and the warm chocolate souffle, which I hope is a regular on the menu, is absolutely to die for and so decadent.  So amazing.  That dish alone could get five stars...
