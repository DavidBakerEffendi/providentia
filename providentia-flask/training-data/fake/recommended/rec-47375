Really good. I went here on a first date with a very cute boy. We got one oxtail hand-pulled noodles and one duck handle-pulled noodles. We were supposed to share, but it was so good that I ate all of the oxtail in my noodles.. before I could share with him. He forgave me, because he knew it was that good.
