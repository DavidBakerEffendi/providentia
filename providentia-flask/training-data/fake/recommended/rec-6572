If there ever was an unassuming place which could deliver fantastic food at very low prices, THIS IS IT! Serious Syrian cuisine which should appeal to everybody. Michael, the owner, prepares all the dishes himself with a happy smile while singing to his favorite music. No doubt, you will like everything on the menu. Just start from the top and keep going back until you exhaust it! Then start all over again. Among many favorites, I'll mention a few. The tabooleh is made to order (only place I know that does this) and is therefore several notches above superb. Hummus and baba ganoush are great. The lamb sausage is worth its weight in gold. All of the grilled meats served as sandwiches or platters with pilaf are great but my favorite is the kefta. Dishes like 'ful' - kidney beans with a cumin garlic sauce - are very authentic and flavorful. BYOB and go often. AND NOW THE PLACE has been renovated, so it has improved immensely in what used to be its only real shortcoming. Service can be a bit slow when the place is really busy, but then again Mike always serves his creations with tender loving care.
