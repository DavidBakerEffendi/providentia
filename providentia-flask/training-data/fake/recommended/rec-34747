Very happy with this recommendation.  I'm punjabi and I absolutely love when Indian restaurant owners keep the food authentic.  They kept it real with the masala, haldi, ginger, cumin and garlic!! I was here for NYE and it was recommended by a fellow indian gal friend. Amazing. And they said indian food in New York is bad..whatever.
