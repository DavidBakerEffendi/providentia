I've never been a fan of seafood, so sushi has generally not been something I go for. Until this place. Yes, it's vegan - but the food is really tasty, flavorful and unique. We had: -Nutty Buddy Wrap -Spicy Mang Sushi Roll - Mighty Mushroom Sushi Roll - Black Bean & Sweet Potato Brownie I wasn't as big a fan of the Mang compared to other stuff we ordered, but it too was quite good
