When we walked in, it was a pretty quiet afternoon.  We saw lots of empty tables, but they sat us right next to the bathrooms and stuck a family of 6 with little kids right next to us. I ordered a "Classic mojito".  What they didn't tell us is that there is no alcohol in the mojitos (at all!), which I would have liked to know before buying...juice.  The food was alright, but I wouldn't return. "Meh..." really summed it up.
