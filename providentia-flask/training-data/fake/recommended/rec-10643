Great food. Friendly service. Parking lot is small so get there early or later unless you don't mind a short walk. Our old Japanese place changed owners and the quality went down so we went looking for new places. We finally found wasabi and it is now our regular place. We are here about once a week. Â Keep an eye out for coupons too.
