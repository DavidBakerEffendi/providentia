The place was awesome.  The service was great and the food was excellent.  I had the shrimp pad Thai with the sundried shrimps.  It was different but interesting.  I loved the fried calamari and I also tasted the tuna tartar. I will be back.  It is in a really great location in the theatre district but you don't feel like you are in that neighborhood.  I felt like I was in the village.  The music was pumping.
