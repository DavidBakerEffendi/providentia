I had a very late dinner at this place at 12:30 am the second day I moved to NYC and loved it. It felt like a club/diner in a GOOD way which sounds weird and potentially awful but it's NYC, so it's extremely cool somehow. The decor, vibe, music and presentation of food combine for great ambiance. We had a drink at the bar because we have to wait about 10 minutes for a table (but were told 35). The Mac-n-Cheese Spring Rolls were awesome. So was my Veggie Burger, mainly due to the aged provolone it came with which was incredible. My boyfriend got Fried Chicken and Waffles that he raved about it. I am confident I will eat here a lot.
