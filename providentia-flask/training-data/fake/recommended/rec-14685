i've been to this place twice and had desserts and teas each time. they were all lovely. the servings, however, are ridiculously small. the $17 chef set (3 desserts, 1 pot of tea) really should just be for one person. the desserts are worth 2 bites each, and the tea, 4 cups. since i'm on a limited budget, the serving sizes especially peeve me. if you're loaded, you should keep coming back, but i'm not going to.
