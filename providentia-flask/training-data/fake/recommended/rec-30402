I have been to Cookshop several times now for dinner. The food and service are always superb. The atmosphere is lively and loud, so while It is a great place for dining with friends, it is not suitable for a business meeting. So keep it in mind when you are in Chelsea Section of NYC and looking to escape the business for awhile! Good choice of wines and cocktails, but if you want something unique that is non-alcoholic, try the blueberry fauxjito
