Well....I went at 7 because I couldn't wait until 9. Bad joke but good food, great service and staff. I have dined at many of the 9th Avenue Thai restaurants and really enjoyed this place. The restaurant is on the smaller side and had a good crowd and was very upbeat. The food is creatively prepared and quite beautiful. The taste was delicious and the portion size just right. In my personal opinion there is better and more authentic Thai food to be found but this by no means implies @9 pales very much in comparison. What really won me over was the bartender and staff. Amazingly hospitable, social, attentive and kind. Will I go back? Â You can bet a lychee martini on it. Khob khun krup to the team at @9
