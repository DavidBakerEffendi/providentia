Great, old-world feel. Stellar customer service. And, possibly the best blackened swordfish I've ever had. Amazingly succulent. And, everyone else in our party raved about their entrees, too...especially the Camarones Enchilados. You in NYC this week? It's worth a trip over to Newark's Ironbound District. Very cool.
