Amazing Tapas! Great Service! I've been to Yuca Bar several times, mostly on a Tuesday cause they have 1/2 price Tapas. The Espresso BBQ Costillitas Â are delicious. They literally fall of the bone and the sauce is really different and flavorful as well. The squid, the Platano Relleno and the shrimp and squid in the green sauce are also some of my favorite dishes here. The tapas are small but completely worth the Happy hour price. Only complain I have is that the tables are too close to each other and it sometimes gets too loud.
