This cart is good homestyle cooking by Maggie. The noodle soups are wonderful, and can be vegetarian (tofu or veggies) or meat (chicken, pork or sometimes beef). The best dish in my opinion are the Xiao pai gu (little pork spare ribs). Like most medical center carts, the dishes $5 for three choices on rice or a large soup. Small soup is $3. There are dumplings (jiaozi) and steamed buns (baozi) which are not homemade, but she dresses them up well with her homemade sauce and cilantro.
