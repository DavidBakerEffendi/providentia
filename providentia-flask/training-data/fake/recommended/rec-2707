Food was wonderful, especially for the price.  We had coconut soup, lemon grass soup, chicken satay spears, veg pad thai and shrimp in curry sauce.  All of the tastes was full bodied and the "one pepper" spicey designation was suitable for an American who likes spicey, but not overpowering food.  Service was prompt and attentive, the decor clean and quiet.  Tom (owner) and wife Anna (chef) have been in this location for a year replacing the East European restaurant that "retired" recently.  They have some 20 years experience in restauranting, which shows in the menu and preparation.  The menu is a 50-50 combination of traditional Thai dishes and Tom and Annna's creations in Thai cuisine.  The whole menu is available for take-away, which given the neighborhood of young professionals is a brisk business.  Nice people, great food, great prices, BYOB.
