This restaurant had the worst service i have ever had. I ordered salmon which was very old and fishy. I told the waiter and he took it from me immediately. He came back 20 minutes later (when my party had finished eating) and said there was nothing wrong with the fish and insisted i must buy something else. He became very frustrated and infuriated and stormed off The food was also not the best. Some dishes were alright. The fried rice was not authentic on any level. They simply just drenched it in soy sauce until it was almost black. I would recommend the papaya salad or drunken noodles if you still choose to eat here. Ambiance was pretty nice. Quiet and pleasant.
