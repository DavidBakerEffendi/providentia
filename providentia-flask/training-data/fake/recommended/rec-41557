Super cute place for Japanese tea and dessert. My friend and I came here after a long several hours of shopping.. Apparently a lot of places in this hood close around 3 to prepare for dinner service. Yelp to the rescue! This place was 0.3 miles from where we were standing. Our experience started at the entrance. There are beautiful photos of their desserts welcoming you upstairs. Once seated, we just stared at the plethora of teas and tea equipment. Sitting at the bar, we got prime seats to seeing the masters prepare tea (with all sorts of tools). Too bad we are coffee fanatics for life. We got the green tea mochi and black sesame creme brûlée. The former was great, but the latter is the best dessert I have ever had! The scoop of black sesame ice cream with crispy wafer on top really nailed it! The desserts were 5 stars, but the pricy-ness takes a star away. We thought the food here was too pricey, so after our delectable dessert break, we hopped to a more budget friendly locale.
