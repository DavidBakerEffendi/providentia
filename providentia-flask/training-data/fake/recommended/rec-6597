I noticed Brunch in Manhattan invariably involves poached eggs. Anyway, Tartine provided shaded seating on a perfect Saturday early afternoon. Warning - if you get the seat all the way at the end by the railing, and the table facing you inside is seated, you will probably be greeted by the back/ass of the diner sitting inside. However, despite this awkward situation, which was really only recognized by the two of us dining outside and made conversation all the more interesting, Tartine is quaint and the brunch special arrives w/ tea or coffee and orange juice. Service was flash gordan fast, and as for the aforementioned poached eggs - they were well done. I had the poached eggs w/ some norwegian lox, which came w/ a side of their well-seasoned home fries. I'm not sure if it was b/c of my hunger, my rationale that I would be walking the whole day, or the fact that the food was just that amazing, but I scraped my plate clean to the point that my mother would have been proud.
