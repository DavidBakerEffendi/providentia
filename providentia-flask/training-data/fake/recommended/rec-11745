I can see why people like this place so much. I went with a fairly large group and we were able to make reservations for 8 (essentially, HALF the restaurant) on a busy holiday weekend without issues! I would definitely recommend making reservations here. Now on to the tarte flambee!! Tarte flambee is essentialy "french pizza," but no, it's not "french bread pizza" like what you pick up at your grocer's freezer aisle. This is essentially fancy french cheese (typically, soft cheeses like gruyere, goat, munster, etc.) w/ fresh veggies and light sauce on an INSANELY light, fluffy, crispy, flaky crust FLAMED to perfection. Now... let's be clear. This ain't no NYC pizza--and I'm a HUGE pizza fan, so I don't say this lightly. If I want NYC pizza, I'm going to go to John's or Grimaldi's. Maybe even Artichoke. But if you're looking for something a little different, perhaps brunch instead of dinner, and you don't want to stuff your face (and coronary arteries) to the brim, I think tarte flambee is a fabulous, adorable, charming, and warm little establishment. My one complaint: on busy holiday weekends and days, tarte flambee should hire an extra server. The poor waitress serving on New Year's Eve morning was the ONLY waitress in the entire house! It's a small restaurant, but especially if multiple parties come at the same time, it would help to have some crowd control.
