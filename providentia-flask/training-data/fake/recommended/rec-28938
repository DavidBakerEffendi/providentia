We went to a Wine Tasting next door at Jack's WIne Sense and we came out of there hungry and in no condition to drive.  Fortunately Mamma Flora's was open and serving.  We went in and were seated quickly. There was a one man band playing at an appropriate volume level.  He regaled us with song as we waited for our dinner.  I had the chicken parm.  My friend had the lobster ravioli. We both enjoyed our meals.  It was generic Italian fare but it was tasty and filling. I would not seek this place out again but I certainly would go back if I was in the neighborhood.
