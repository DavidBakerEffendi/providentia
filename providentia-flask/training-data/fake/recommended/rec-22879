Came here for lunch. Great place with a nice decor. I had the spicy basil rice with crispy duck (not vegetarian duck, paid extra for real duck). It was very good, would definite go back for more. My friend had the Spicy Pad Kee Mao which was equally good. I love spicy and these dishes had the right amount of spiciness. Some other place say spicy, but lacks the kick that I enjoy. This place is now on my list of good Thai restaurants.
