This was quite the wait, but SO worth it! I've had pancakes here in the past (we were lined up and one of the first in that day, thank goodness) but even waiting for sandwiches around lunchtime is a breeze when they're this awesome. Given the wait, I don't make this a weekly stop-off when I'm in the city, but if you're in the area and don't come by and try literally anything on the menu, you're missing out!
