We ate here last night for the first time and had a wonderful meal. Our server was perfectly attentive.  She uncorked bottles of wine for us, knew about the dishes on the menu and was able to answer all our questions, and took great care of us.  The ambiance is casual, but the wait staff are very professional.  The restaurant seats only 25 or so diners, and the kitchen is in plain view of where you eat.  You can see the chefs plate up dishes, and their smiles and intensity let you know they love what they do. The food was fantastic.  As a party of three, we shared two appetizers... a ceviche with lobster and red snapper and a toro with tuna, cucumber, and watermelon.  Both were palate pleasers and made us even more excited for the main course. There were four main dishes on the menu last night: scallops, cobia, wreckbass, and skate.  We had all but the scallops, and all were great.  We oooed and ahhhd as we sampled each other's dishes.  With this, our first visit, we have confidence that we can order anything off the menu and should be pleased. The portions were generous and we were too full for dessert.  Overall, a fantastic meal and I look forward to coming again the next time I am in Philly.
