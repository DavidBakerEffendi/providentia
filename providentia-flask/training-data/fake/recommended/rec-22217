I've been here twice with my boyfriend.  The first time coming here I was underwhelmed but he loved it so I decided to give it another try last night and they definitely redeemed themselves.  I had the mushrooms and goat cheese which was delicious along with the spaghetti squash which was terrific.  Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend had the leg of lamb and as usual he was obsessed.  One of the waitresses recommended a glass of wine since I'm not too familiar with Spanish wines and it was great.  We were too full to try desserts.  I think we tried dessert the last time we were here but like I said the first time was underwhelming I don't even remember what I got.  Next time we will definitely be trying desserts and we will for sure be back.
