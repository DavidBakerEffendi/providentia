I have a friend with whom I almost NEVER agree on restaurants, and we are both very picky in our own ways.  We have also both eaten out a LOT in NYC.  Olea is the first restaurant we have ever agreed on - and we both agree that it is THE BEST restaurant in ALL of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  In fact, getting my friend to come down to Brooklyn used to be like pulling teeth - now I mention Olea, and he's on the next subway. I can't speak about the entrees or the brunch, because I've only ever gone to Olea for the tapas.  But I can say this: the tapas are INCREDIBLE, the sangria is delicious, the atmosphere is simply PERFECT (the restaurant is both literally and figuratively warm), the prices are reasonable (especially compared to Manhattan restaurants), we've never had to wait for a table, the wait staff is CONSISTENTLY friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient, and there is live music on Friday nights.  I was raving about this restaurant to a friend and he jokingly asked me, "How are the bathrooms?"  Little did he know that I would go on for another full 5 minutes about how absolutely adorable and clean the bathroom is!!!  This restaurant can simply do no wrong. I highly recommend the fried goat cheese, the patatas bravas, the Turkish cigars, and the tsatziki with pita.  And DO NOT leave this restaurant without trying the Greek yogurt with sour cherries, candied orange peel, and walnuts - it is simply THE BEST DESSERT I HAVE EVER HAD.  I get it EVERY time I go. Overall, this is not to be missed.  I would like to keep it a secret, but I am just too giddy about this restaurant to do so.
