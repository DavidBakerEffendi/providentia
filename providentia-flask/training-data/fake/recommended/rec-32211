The food is amazing. They have the best vegan burger in Philadelphia. That being said, the service has truly declined. We have been eating here since it's opening and were always happy with the service. Recently, we attempted to eat here on a Friday. We attempted to call ahead and order food. They would not allow us to order. We arrived and it was crowded. A very rude and abrupt cashier with blue hair asked us if we were eating in or carrying out. We answered eating in as she walked away from us she muttered 35 minutes. She then did not return to the counter. I had to yell across to her to ask if we could carry out. She then told us 45 minutes to carry out. I could understand her lack of manning the counter if she was helping out in the kitchen, but she was not. She was rude and brusque.
