Very small and homey- good for groups a casual couple delicious.  had the tasting menu $35- totally worth it... Sooo much food, but it was so good we couldn't stop eating. 1) Started with a the salad- interesting dressing, light, but too salty 2) salmon sashimi- good quality 3) fried pigs feet- yummmmmayyy.  crispy outside.  not as nasty as it sounds.  promise.  (lots of collagen- great for the skin... ladies) 4) Chicken wings- sweet glaze 5) Hakata hot pot- had a mixture of things including pigs feet, etc etc.. -keep in mind after you're done, they take it back and fill it up with more soup and add your choice of Ramen or rice.... yes MORE FOOD 6) Dessert- Cheese Mousse (like a very light cheesecake) and homemade black sesame ice cream: both AMAZING.  I don't like cheesecake bc of the richness, but this was so flavorful, light and rich at the same time- something you could only expect in a Japanese restaurant... delicate and delicious.
