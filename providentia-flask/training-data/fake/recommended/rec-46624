As far as restaurants in Chinatown go, I'm not usually one who goes back to a particular restaurant a second time. Not because the food or the experience was bad, but more because there are so many really good places to try. I could not wait to get back to Terokawa. The ramen soups were outstanding. My 12 year old daughter called the udon "possibly the best soup I've ever eaten". The pan fried gyoza were tender; the dipping sauce light. The takoyaki were creamy outside with a sweet tender bite of octopus in the middle. With hot green tea the color of jade, attentive service, and a price tag under $36, we left with our tummies full and smiles on our faces.
