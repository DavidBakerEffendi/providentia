I have a hard time knocking it any points.  The food is satisfying.  Yeah, I don't feel like it's the healthiest, but the price is right.  Service is great.  I like the full size cheesesteak and the western omelet, and I don't feel like I need to stray from these.  I think I've tried some of the more exotic combinations, but haven't felt very good by the end of the meal--my fault, as my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  All in all, a great spot.  Usually open late (e.g., I typically stop by between 10pm and 2am on a weeknight), but they are sometimes closed randomly.  The wait is longer than I want, so calling ahead with an order is my m.o.
