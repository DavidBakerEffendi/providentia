So a 5 star rating doesn't happen often. I don't know how these guys came up with some of these combinations - who would have thought that pineapple goes with cauliflower and that potato chips add an extra layer if awesome- but it's just sooooo good. I always get the Once Bitten. The portobello goes really well with the sweetness of the fig/pomegranate and the heartiness an tartness of the goat cheese. All combined with some mixed greens and its one of the best wraps I've ever had!
