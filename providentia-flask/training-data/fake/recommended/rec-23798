Servers are super friendly and knowledgeable. Food is delicious, and the portions are definitely not petite. The beer menu has a great spread of craft beers on draft and in cans. I'm so excited for the weather to warm up to take advantage of their fabulous outdoor seating. Sad it has taken so long for me to go, but glad I did!
