I love thin crust pizza and Posto does it right. It's become a regular eatery for my visits to NYC. Keeping it pretty simple, I usually opt for the pepperoni or pesto pizza and their caeser salad. These pizza pies are always tasty, never too greasy and delightfully crispy. And if I could order a Posto caesar salad as an appetizer for any other restaurant meal, I would. It's strange since it's just a caesar salad, right? Maybe because it's evenly dressed? Or the crispy thin croutons? I don't know what it is, but with the pizza pies and caesar salads, consider me a satisfied customer.
