Simply Mmm, Mmm, GOOD!! When in Burlington, this is the only place I care to stop for lunch.  I love their signature Red Onion Sandwich, but since I am not much of a meat eater I actually prefer their Veggie Sandwich.  They load it right up with all of the most delicious vegetables; the meat is not missed at all.  The last time I was there they piled my sandwich so high that I could barely open my mouth wide enough to take a bite. And the bread is damn good as well; so FRESH. It is tough to get a seat around lunch time and sometimes the line is crazy long.  If you get there and the line is long, leave and call your order in over the phone. You basically cut the line, yes I know kind of sleazy.
