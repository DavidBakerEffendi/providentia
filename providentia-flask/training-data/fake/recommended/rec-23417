Everyone knows that Roberta's is good. I don't need to say that. This review is for their catering team. I used Roberta's for my wedding last month and they were AMAZING to work with. During the planning process, they were super professional, accessible and answered all of our questions. On the day of, they brought the pizza oven to the venue and their team took care of everything - they brought all of their own equipment, brought us menu cards with each pizza's ingredients and stands for the pizza to be displayed on the buffet table. They worked well with my other caterer's servers and you can tell they are a well-oiled machine by how smoothly everything went. The biggest and best thing I can compliment them on is that my mom can't have gluten or dairy and my aunt has Celiac's disease and can't have gluten. Since it's a medical issue, and they obviously can't have pizza, they provided 2 gluten free, dairy meals for them. This was SO accommodating and appreciated. I would highly recommend working with the Roberta's catering team. Tucker and her crew are the best!
