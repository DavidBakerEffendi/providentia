Feels bad to give these guys two whole stars....but in an airport I feel like I have to admit there's not a lot better available. The teriyaki option is a lot of rice or noodles, some optional (and quite terrible) veggies, and a heap of chicken on top. Oh and I forgot to mention the grease. Grease in the noodles, grease on the chicken, it's artery clogging city, population you. But it's quick, cheap and relatively friendly. So say your apologies to your body and give it a try.
