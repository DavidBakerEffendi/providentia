I came here for drinks with a friend and was far from blown away. Yes, the food is okay - decent, even - but Terroir Tribeca touts itself first and foremost as a wine bar, and on those grounds it really isn't anything special. Indeed, it's actually rather mediocre. I don't think it's unfair to expect any specialist outlet to be good at its purported specialism, whether that's steak, coffee, beer, delivery etc. So just as I'd expect staff at specialist stores to enthuse about their products and make memorable recommendations, I expect the staff and products at a specialist wine bar to make the case for wine. The menus here talk the talk, but the service provided by the staff and the products do not walk the walk. I tried a couple of reds - a grenache and pinot noir - neither of which really offered anything. My friend and I also tried a couple of sherries, for the admittedly bargain happy hour price of $2.50. One was horribly dry; the other (the Moscatel) far superior. Service was mixed, ranging from friendly and attentive, to slow and sullen. The food was okay if somewhat pricey. In all it's very close to being 2 stars for me - if I hadn't benefited from happy hour prices for those sherries I probably would be 2 starring it. But those prices, plus the Â odd good parts about the wine, service and food just about push it into 3 star territory.
