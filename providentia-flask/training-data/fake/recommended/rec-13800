After all the anticipation, forgoing breakfast one sunny saturday, and walking across the brooklyn bridge to sample this much-yelped pizza at the stroke of 11:30am... we were stoked! 1st downer: it was closed! opens only at noon on weekends! But there was no queue at all, so we were wondering if it's all it's hyped up to be so walked around the waterfront to snap some pictures planning to be be back 10 mins before noon. 2nd downer: at 10 mins to noon, there were already at least 60 people in line ahead of us. And it was the same queue for dine-in and take-out & most people opted for take out, but we still had to wait for their orders to go through slowwwly. Once the first batch of people got in, the rest had to wait till the quickest of them decide to leave. And on a hot sunny afternoon like this, nobody's gonna leave the A/C to be back in the sun. So we patiently waited 1.5 hours to get in, and even the famed Brooklyn Ice-cream couldn't help curb our appetites (and sweaty brows) much. 3rd downer: Our large extra-basil sausage pizza arrived. And our first thoughts were... MeH! Even the bland Angelos tasted about the same level as this... heck, i've had better pizzas delivered from Dominos! Definitely not worth the 1.5 hour wait. Ok, the staff looked super stressed by the weekend queue, but for a place touted to have NY's best pizza they should be well-used to handling that by now, right? The basil was definitely insufficient, despite ordering extra basil, and the meat coverage was spotty. Also the crust was inconsistently baked (slightly undercooked at some spots, but sooty at others), which was still better than what the next table got... an overburnt sooty mess! On the off chance that the cooks cook better during weekdays, we MaY be back... but after all that hype, I'd say go check out the other Pizzerias in Brooklyn if you're hungry.
