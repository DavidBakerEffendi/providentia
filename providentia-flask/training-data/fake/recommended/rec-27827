Literally my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant on the East Coast (so far). As a Mexican, I'm a tough customer to please when it comes to Mexican food, even more so because I grew up on the West Coast. We came here for a friend's birthday and there were a lot of us, easily 12-14. Ofrenda is pretty small, but somehow they made it work. THe food is really flavorful and fresh. Even better, they offer more than your standard enchilada/quesadilla/carne asada/fajitas combo so common everywhere else. I would suggest trying the queso fundido (made with Chihuahuan cheese, which I haven't been able to find anywhere else in NYC) and the carnitas enchilada (so GOOD). Amazing. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
