Love the place. I go here for drinks fairly often and it's always the best / classiest around. The Manhattans and Old Fashioneds are great and the Tom Collins are delicious - the perfect refreshment. Excellent selection of beers at all times too. Above all, the bartenders & owners deliver classy, friendly service. The hardest part is passing up the food, which I've tried on occasion and though pricey is completely worth it. Everything I've eaten here was delicious - clams, scallops, stuffed cabbage, soup, dessert...all AMAZING.
