When we visited our friend last year, he insisted he take us here for brunch.  I'm soooo glad he did. He warned us there would be a wait, and sure enough, there was.  We joined the line of people in the windy, chilly weather.  But, within a few minutes...some guy was walking down the line with a tray of coffee, cream, and sugar!  I've never seen anything like it.  A few minutes later, little triangles of french toast appear.  A few minutes after that...strawberries and cream.  We were inside and seated before the next round made its way down the line.  As someone else said, I don't think I've ever felt so...welcome before.  That was customer service to the extreme. The food was excellent.  Don't remember what everyone else got, but I got a Florentine omelet.   It was cooked perfectly, as were the hash browns.  I remember having samples of everyone else's food and loving it just as much.  My friend got a side of grits with his, and they were to die for: perfect consistency and flavor. The only (small) downside was that it was a bit cramped in there, which makes it a bit of jigsaw puzzle in winter trying to figure out where to stow all your winter gear.  But hey...makes it more cozy, I guess.  You definitely can't beat that kind of atmosphere. Right now I'm scheming for a way to visit again just so I can come back here for another brunch.
