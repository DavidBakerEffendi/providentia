I was working in the area for 5 weeks & went here everyday for lunch. Best 5 weeks of my life! The lobster roll was to die for! My favorite lunch special by the way.  Second favorite: the grilled cheese which has a slice of apple and truffle oil. Delicious! Small & always full at lunchtime, but the service is fast & friendly. I'm from the Bronx and my work in this area has come to an end but  & I would definitely travel here for lunch. Reasonably priced too.
