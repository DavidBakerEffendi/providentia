Solid. Solid. Solid. $5 delicious bloody marys, sassy waitresses, and huge omelets...could you ask for anything more? Details: I believe there is some sort of bloody mary special on the weekends ($2.95 for a smaller version... I am all about the big BM though) Waitresses/Waiters are awesome! The kind of wait staff that calls you hun and toost.  They are sassy but still make sure you finish your veggies! I am a creature of habit when I go here because it is so delicious and never disappoints. ( egg white omelet tomatoes onions mushrooms). PROS: service! bloody marys, omelets, six packs to go, huge menu selection, outdoor seating, people watching, some might think the decor in the place is a CON but I think its part of the charm( beveled mirror walls, fake plants, 90 year old patrons eating egg salad sandwiches), AFFORDABLE, delivery CONS: hash browns are quite bland, I mean its a diner so its not culinary excellence (but who is expecting that at a place called Little Petes). Overall: If you are penny pinching but want to live like a king go here for brunch.  Have a drink, watch the people on Fairmount, and don't break the bank.
