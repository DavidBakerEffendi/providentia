Staying at the Crowne Plaza for a few days I decided one morning to ask the doorman for a recommendation on a breakfast joint. He mentioned a few locations including Sabrina's, which he had high praises for...he pointed the way & didn't take me long to walk the distance in the crisp morning air. Upon walking into Sabrina's it seemed like a madhouse! Every table was full & employees looking busy but efficient...and it was mid-week @ 9 a.m.! There's a very small waiting area by the entrance & that also was full of waiting patrons. I spotted a lone seat at the counter & ask if I may sit there. I was seated almost immediately! The staff behind the counter were quite hipster/bohemian, witty & quick! While waiting for my dish to arrive I watched the interaction between the patrons & servers! This is quite the fun bunch. Loved the atmosphere & absolutely enjoyed my dish. I had the Huevos Rancheros on black corn tortilla & the home-style potatoes! This breakfast was overflowing with deliciousness with enough on the plate to have been shared with another person. The eggs were fried perfection & topped with a zesty sausage sauce. The pepper guac is to die for! I highly recommend this dish for anyone that desires that flavor bursting experience. I had a satisfying Cheshire Cat grin all the way back to the hotel. Thank you Sabrina's Café, for an excellent time & a superb breakfast! I'll definitely be back when visiting the Philly area! Another deez® public service announcement because you deserve it! Eat, be merry & drink responsibly.
