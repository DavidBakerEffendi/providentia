Historically, I am a pretty simple guy to satisfy. Give me tasty food and decent service and I'll consider writing a halfway decent review. However, give me terrible service and terrible food and I won't hesitate to trash you. El Camino Real accomplished neither of these. What they did was prepare delicious food, but provided the most rude and demeaning service of my life. Thus 3 stars. I'd give the food there a 4 or 5, but our waitress shouldn't even get a zero. I went to El Camino with a group of friends all eager to eat and have a good time. In no way were we raucous or disrespectful. What did happen was one of the people in our party grabbed a glass off of our server's tray. It was an innocent mistake. As a former server, it was admittedly not good practice for a patron to do that, but what followed was far more unsavory. Our server flipped, and proceeded to rip into our friend. She then proceeded to basically act like our table was a thorn in her side. She punished the entire group for one person's actions. She spoke to us like children and only provided us with a weak, "I'm right, but I guess I'll apologize" apology. I think that was only once she realized that we were all in agreement she should NOT be tipped the normal percentage. I was always told that "Tips" stood for To Insure Proper Service, which we definitely did NOT receive. So much so, that I have written words of emphasis in ALL CAPS. While I WILL eat at El Camino again, I can guarantee you that I will ask to be moved should that young lady be my server again. Holla back youngin.
