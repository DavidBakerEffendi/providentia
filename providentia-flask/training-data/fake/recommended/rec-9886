I've spent a month travelling through Thailand and I don't mean Bangkok and Phuket. This is the most authentic Thai food I have had in the states. Its a small space so you don't go here for comfort or romance. The food is VERY reasonably priced so this is not the place to impress your date with your wad of cash. The food comes out swift and spicy and plentiful. I could eat here every day!
