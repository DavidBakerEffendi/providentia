After a dinner, a lunch, a brunch and take-out, I still find myself struggling with Birra.  When I first saw the menu, the prices and the style, I wanted to view the restaurant as a competitor to Steven Starr's Pizzeria Stella.  Same number of pizzas on each menu and the average price of a pie is less than 25 cents higher at Stella.  Unfortunately, the best comparison I've come to for Birra is as a hipper but more expensive and less satisfying take on Stogie Joe's just a block down the street. You can expect a local crowd that skews young and you can expect pizza.  In my experience, everything else has been inconsistent. Pizza has arrived over and under cooked (the main complaint from friends who have sworn off the restaurant), service has been uneven on every visit, the spreads & breads dish and the salads were not memorable enough for a second order.  The margherita is most satisfying with the upcharge for extra fresh mozzarella cheese.  The Mac & Cheese was satisfying, if paralyzingly heavy. For brunch, the crust on the brunch calzone was perfect and delicious.  Unfortunately, the menu didn't indicate that the frittata was cold and what came out was unappetizing texture-wise.  "Roasted seasonal vegetables slowly baked" made me expect a warm, savory dish. Birra is a-ok, especially if you're local to the restaurant.  If you have to travel for your fancy pizza experience, however, I'd recommend you search for other options in the city.
