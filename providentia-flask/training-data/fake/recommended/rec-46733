This place is slightly pricey. The food and drinks are quite good. The atmosphere is also nice & festive. Wait staff is friendly and prompt. We parked on the Boston Post Rd. strip-mall side... If you drive around the side of the building there's ample parking and a main entrance to the restaurant. I definitely recommend Ola for date night or a special occasion.
