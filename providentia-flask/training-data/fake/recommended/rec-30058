This group owns a bunch of the restaurants in the Princeton area.  Generally speaking the food at all of them are pretty good.  The only issue I have had is that they are always a little more expensive than they is really justified.  Eno Terra is probably the best value, but even I had to do a quick double take on the bill.  We went there on a Friday night, and there was a pretty good sized crowd there.  The interior is really cool.  A good blend of a little modern with a rustic feel.   Good bar scene too.  The place has an excellent wine list, heavy on the Italian.  I even looked up a couple of wines that I know, and the mark-ups seemed to be pretty reasonable. The wife and I split the bruschetta (okay, I can't spell) which was excellent.  We also split a salad, which at best I will say was decent.  For dinner the sausage had a little kick that I wasn't expecting, and the gnocchi, while very rich, was really tasty.  Excluding wine, two apps two dinners and a split dessert came to $100.  Not out of control, but not exactly value. At the end of the day, I would go back...occassionally.   Couple of other last minute thoughts.  The service was excellent.  I read a couple of early reviews that said it was a problem, but overall we were very satisfied with the service.  But the tables we a little too close together.  We did feel as though we were a part of the group that was sitting right next to us (and they were really annoying, so that sucked).
