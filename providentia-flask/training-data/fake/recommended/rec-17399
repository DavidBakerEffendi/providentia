It was pretty damn good to me, there's no reason I shouldn't give it a 5. I'm not Hispanic or anything so there was a minor language barrier. I went to eat here 2 nights ago with my girlfriend. She speaks Spanish so language was no longer an issue. It's a spot that you wouldn't think about taking someone on a date to because of the ambience. The food made up for that though. We had a pitcher of Sangria, I ordered the skirt steak with fried green plantains, she ordered the fried rice with beef pork and shrimp with avocado salad. That's a huge portion, so we split the food. We both cleared our plates and washed it down with Sangria. It was great, service was good too. There wasn't a wait and it wasn't too pricey. Good food close to home.
