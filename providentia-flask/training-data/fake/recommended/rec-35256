Food - 5 Service - 5 Decor - 5 One of the finest dining experiences in NYC. The food is just excellent, I cannot stop praising this place. This was one of the first fine dining restaurants I ever went too, and to this day is still one of the best. From when you enter it, that smell of apples. I also feel like they over feed you, the food just keeps coming and coming. The lobster main course the lobster was prepared immaculate and the steak was amazingg. Highly Recommended.
