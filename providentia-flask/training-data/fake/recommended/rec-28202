I don't think these guys need my good review, but I love them so much I have to share. I wish I could tell you I stopped eating long enough to snap pics of our food, but I didn't 'cuz the food was too damn delicious and I forgot. Lol. The prices are actually pretty reasonable for city quality food (and then some). We had 2 special apps, 1 special main, 1 main, 2 glasses of wine, and a piece of lemon cheesecake for about $117 w/o tip. Astoria eateries, take notes, these people are outstanding w/ service. I mean out friggen standing. You feel so totally spoiled and special here. You don't even need to ask for anything because it's already on it's way to you by the time you can think of anything you'd want or need. Everyone is so friendly, nice, helpful, and polite. Only semi-complaints: I kind of wish I liked their bread more (it's not bad by any means but it's not amazing which is probably good 'cuz I'd eat it all and be full before my meal came). I could drink their olive oil from the bottle on the table, it's so damn good. The special app which was a stuffed fried zucchini blossom only came w/ 4 pieces. Kind of expected a bit more. There are so many specials it's crazy. Lol. It's hard to hear your waiter sometimes and remember everything they say, so listen for things you like and then ask what that was when they're done. That works for me anyway. It's impressive the waiters remember everything and can recite it though. Otherwise, you cannot go wrong here. The food is unreal. They are super accommodating w/ dietary stuff, so if you're vegetarian or vegan, this place is for you too. Â  2 words: Mezza Luna!
