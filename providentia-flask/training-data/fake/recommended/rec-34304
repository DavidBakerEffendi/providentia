I visited as a result of a coupon and was disappointed from the start. There is a limited menu and they were out of several of their staple items. I started with the ham croquets and found them greasy Â I then ordered a beef dish that said it was made with peppers and onions. However when it arrived it was loaded and I mean loaded with green olives. A strange thing to leave out as an overwhelming ingredient. Not impressed and sorry but I won't return.
