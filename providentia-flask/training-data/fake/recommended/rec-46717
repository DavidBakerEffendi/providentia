Moussaka. I don't think they know what it is. We got rock hard ground meat with something akin to gravy or pudding and potatoes. Kinda reminded me of poutine. It was just crap. I've been to Greek festivals and other restaurants and this was pathetic. I saw little that resembled eggplant. I had a Greek salad with it and there were no olives and almost no feta in it. Breakfast is pretty good there. Skip the Greek food.
