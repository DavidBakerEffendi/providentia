Loved their Indian vegetable... The dal makhani was okish... The garlic naan was really soft even wen we ordered home delivery... The delivery takes 50 mins or so...so u better order ahead..that cuts 1 star for me..since I can't wait that long wen I am hungry.. Also the spicy vegetable was also bit sweet..that cut 1 more star for me..other than that I would order it again..
