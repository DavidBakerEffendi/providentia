We went early on a Saturday night because we had our 6-year-old daughter with us.  The maitre'd Angel was great with her, and us, as was the owner Giovany.  Very classy guys.  We weren't very hungry at that time of night so just ordered cocktails and appetizers.   The cocktails were expertly made.  I had the Concoction made with rye and my wife tried the Poquito Picante made with Gin, hibiscus (I think) and a red hot chili pepper for a real sneaky kick.  I loved it so much I drank almost half of my wife's drink.   Of our three appetizers, we liked the hamachi ceviche the best, with a nice peanut sauce.  We liked the guacamole but were expecting it to be green, like most, not almost like a beige sauce.  Looked funny but tasted good.  The trio of French Fries was interesting; well-breaded stalks of avocado, watermelon and something else.  Unique but I probably wouldn't get it again.  (There are plenty of other things on the menu and I look forward to going back to try their entrees.)  After those three apps we were stuffed and called it an early night.   Service was excellent and everyone was very friendly and welcoming.   The space is nice with an exposed brick wall.  FYI: they have a private room in the basement that is very nice.
