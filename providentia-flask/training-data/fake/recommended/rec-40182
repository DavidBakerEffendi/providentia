Very nice restaurant in Times Square. My group and I ordered the shrimp pasta with angle hair noodles and the portions are huge. I can usually put some food away, but this one was really BIG. I practically roll out of this place. Thank goodness we did a lot of walking. Get there early or make a reservation because this place gets packed.
