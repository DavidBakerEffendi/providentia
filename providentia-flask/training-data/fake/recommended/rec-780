This place is worth the wait! The food is amazing and the drinks are even better. If you can get past the parking and long wait , you will enjoy the atmosphere once you are seated. I had the chicken fajitas and my friend tried the steak fajitas and both tasted fresh & well seasoned. FROZEN drinks are a must if over 21!! Pina colada was amaaaazing!!! It was only $6.00 The prices are great and affordable also! Very casual place to eat any day of the week. I left happy & i will be back again..
