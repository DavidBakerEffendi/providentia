Finally.  Thank you Krupa Grocery for breaking through as the first true destination place on Prospect Park West (not counting Double Windsor, a great bar indeed).  Have been a couple of times for lunch and finally went for dinner.  Have yet to be disappointed.  Highlights have been cavatelli with lamb bolognese peas and mint, squid with watermelon and chilies, gnudi with chard, butterscotch pot de creme (suprisingly not too sweet which was perfect), and crispy pork belly with coddled egg grits and chilies.  All perfectly cooked and delicious.  Only slight misfire was skate sandwich whose bread/fish ratio favored the bread a bit too much, but this is nitpicking a bit. Bottom line, the place looks great, has a relaxed vibe, friendly service, awesome beers/wine and espresso and is a much, much needed addition to the hood.
