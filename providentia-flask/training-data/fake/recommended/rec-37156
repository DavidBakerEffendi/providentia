The burger destruction tour of NYC makes a pit stop at Corner Bistro... -tasty burgers NOM -nice staff and bar tenders- for such a crowded place you can only expect so much speed but I appreciate the manners and politeness! -Great beer specials -Don't be fooled by the size of the bar- more seats in the back but certainly not spacious. Came in with a large group and waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. Tables turnover quickly here! I dig!
