Really glad we decided to try this restaurant. We stopped in on a Saturday night at 6pm... luckily we were able to sit immediately. Â Ordered a bottle of wine to share (~$30,) entrees (~$10 each), and dessert ($6). He got the tom yum soup and I got the yien ta four. For dessert was green tea mochi ice cream. We are normally fiends for the classic pad thai & pad see ew, but decided to be more adventurous at this new place: we did not regret that decision!
