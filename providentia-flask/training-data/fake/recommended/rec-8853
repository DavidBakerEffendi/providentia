We ate at Blue Ribbon last night.  Loved the place and we will be back next time we are in New York.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  The staff could not have been better.  Best fried chicken I have ever had.  One person at our table did not finish his meal and did not want to take it with him.  The staff that cleared the plates told the manager who came over to ask them if everything was ok.  He wanted to make sure that it was cooked well and that he enjoyed it.  Great service and incredible food.  Great place to go after theater because they are open late.
