I will keep this short and to the point.  I grew up in the area and I honestly believe this is one of the better places to get a good, fresh piece of fish and have it prepared how you like.  There is almost always a wait if you go on a nice night, but they will open your wine/liquor and have live music on certain nights.  I always recommend those looking for good seafood to stop by here.
