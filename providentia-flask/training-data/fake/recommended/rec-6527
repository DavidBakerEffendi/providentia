It actually pains me to downgrade my previous review because the food, drinks, decor and live music here rock my world. That said the service was so bad last night I got to do what a girl's got to do.... Make sure you book and make sure if you are going to sit outside around the corner - i.e. out of sight of the waiters - that you make your presence known. We sat outside but got forgotten about. When we moved inside they forgot our drink orders (twice) and then when we decided to have another verre de vin instead of dessert we were asked to leave because people a couple were waiting for a table (ahem, yes we were the last to arrive of all diners eating and drinking at the same time). In short fabulous when it's quiet and they can cope but not worth it on a busy Friday night.
