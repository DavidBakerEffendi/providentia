Cute place, good food, seriously hostile maitre d. Its a happening neighborhood, a bustling little place-- good pizza, good pasta, not overpriced (in the New York scheme of things). Then what's the problem? Maybe just us . . . but I don't care to be hustled out of a restaurant after spending $150 . . . "we have a waiting list for this table". Part of a meal is having a cup of coffee and a desert after, or so I'd thought. Apparently not on the program here, as the host suggested "well, you could have it at the bar", though his demeanor suggested that he'd prefer we'd just leave. The host seemed frazzled by the restaurant's own policy -- no reservations-- though I can't be sure. Whatever the case, from arrival to exit, he treated us like a burden. Maybe just a bad night (though this was Wednesday night at 10 PM, the crowds were hardly storming the door), perhaps the mood will be more gracious on other occasions. Me, I won't be back to find out-- New York is hardly short of Italian restaurants with great food where the host treats diners nicely.
