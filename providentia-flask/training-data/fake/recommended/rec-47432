Went up to the city for a weekend visit and tried Extra Virgin with a few of my girlfriends. I was so so impressed. The wait at 8pm on a Friday night was only about 15-20 mins, the perfect amount of time to down one of their yummy Extra Virgin specialty cocktail. We ordered and I highly recommend: Fritto Misto, Roasted Artichoke Parmesan, Caprese Salad for Apps Grilled Salmon and Loin of Pork for Entrees Warm Apple Tart for Dessert Yummy Bottle of Sancerre Rouge Wine to Sip It was great and I will definitely come back next time I am in the city.
