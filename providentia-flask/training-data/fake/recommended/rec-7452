That place is nice and the food is delicious! We had blood pudding (which was amazing) with apple mustard (the highlight of the meal, so sweet and sour, so subtle, really delicious) and cabbage with pancetta. Then a salad with spanish ham, curry and endives (and croutons and roasted almonds), very flavorful. For dessert, we shared the famous black forest charlotte and it lived up to its reputation, a real treat! However, it is sold for 2 but would be more appropriate for 4, which means that we took half home. Anyway, it was my only (minor) regret and it was as delicious when we had it that same night. Service was extremely kind and nice and while I'm not small (but not the tallest either) I had no problem fitting in the school tables, and liked the atmosphere of the place very much (and the great music).
