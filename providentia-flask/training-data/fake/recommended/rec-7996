Excellent food, lamb bolgenese is AMAZING! Beat salad was also delectable.  The apple cider was just perfect and delicious.  Will definitely be back.  Service was slow to seat, despite reservations and the kitchen took 40 mins to get our entrees out.  That was annoying, but the food made up for it.
