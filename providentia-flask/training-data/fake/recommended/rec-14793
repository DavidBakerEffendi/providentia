I don't eat burgers a lot but damn, this burger was one to remember. We walked in around 4:30 pm and got 3 seats at the bar. We started off with drinks - i got the spicy cougar and it did not disappoint! We got 2 orders of truffle fries and I ordered the hatch burger, cooked medium rare. It was cooked just right and evoked every sense of the word Umami. It was juicy, savory, and made me want to try everything else on the menu. The bartender was friendly and she took up the challenge of mixing my friends a bourbon based drink from scratch which they were both impressed with. The place started to get busy shortly after we arrived, there was a wait by 5:30 pm. Wish there was one in Philly, would definitely stop by for a burger next time I am around!
