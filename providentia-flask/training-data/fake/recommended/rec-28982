We tried this place based on Yelper reviews, and the food was fantastic.  There isn't much in the way of service, the guys do tend to be watching tv more than waiting on people, but considering the price and the food I'll take the trade off. We had the house fried rice, steamed dumplings, general tso's and beef & broccoli.  Everything was cooked perfectly, especially the broccoli.  That can sometimes be overcooked and soppy but nope, was perfect. I should have gone back instead of trying another restaurant today...
