Came here on a Saturday night, got thru the supermarket to get to the elevator to get upstairs. We were meeting friends and the host was telling us we can't go up they reached capacity and I explained to her agian we are meeting friends who have a table for us once she understood we were able to get on the elevator. The menu is not very large, some things to offer but not much. I got the apple and fennel salad and the lamb chops but again wasn't too impressed, the protion was small and not as great as I would have expected it to be. If you are coming here to get some beers and enjoy the view its totally worth it but for a sit down dinner for a filling meal try some where else.
