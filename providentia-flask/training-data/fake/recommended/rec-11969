To this day I have heard more hype about the Corner Bistro burger then any other place in the city. I had a lot of reservations about it because of that fact. I feel that when I hear TOO many good things about any band, movie, or restaurant.... it can lead to great disappointment when it falls short of the praise. While I didn't hate the Corner Bistro burger, I didn't love it either. It was a huge portion of meat, almost too much. I want a burger, not a giant meatball, or a meatloaf. While it wasn't quite that bad, it was close. Also, the bun was kinda weak and flimsy. I would give this a 3.5 if we were on the half rating scale, but Yelp don't play that. I did love the decor. It's a shitty bar, and that's a good thing. Actually that rules. I had this feeling I was going to walk into some posh restaurant and be bummed out... no way. It's very classic and old school. By old school I mean, two old dudes working the bar and tables, holding it down. I like that. Not your average NYC restaurant vibe. While, I haven't wrote Corner Bistro off yet, I am not completely sold either. Only time will time if I will return. Until then, try it for yourself and be the Judge. Get off the Internet you freak.
