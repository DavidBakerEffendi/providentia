And the award for Most overhyped burger goes to Corner Bistro! - Yes, its cheap. - No, its not better than the average bear would make on a grill in the summer. - Yes it's divey, dirty, grimey. - No, I am not impressed with Budweiser priced at $3 for 8 ounces when I can get a regular 16 oz hoegartaan at most places in this city.
