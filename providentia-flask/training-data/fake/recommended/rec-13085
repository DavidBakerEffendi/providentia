Best brunch place I've had. Line is insane long - but if you come by yourself, you can get a seat in 15 mins at the counter. Had the potato pancakes - just the right mixture of crunchy texture, flavor, not too greasy, and just loved the overall taste. Had rum in my latte which warmed me up quite well and prepared me for Hurricane Sandy. Lovely place, gotta come back here when I am in this area.
