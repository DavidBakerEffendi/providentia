Bone Marrow & Oxtail was very tasty. The oysters were good.  They had two kinds, but I forgot which one I liked the most.  East coast? Or west coast? Argh! Both were good.  One was more meater and has that "oyster" taste.  One was more delicate. Short rib, was ok.  We didn't need to order it.  We only ordered it because we heard the waiter said it was one of the popular items. I think it's a good late night bite or a before dinner drink place to go.  I would definately come back for more wine and bone marrow if ever I venture out to New York again.
