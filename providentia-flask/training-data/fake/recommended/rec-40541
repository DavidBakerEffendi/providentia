This is a bare bones Chinese restaurant with very good food.  The food was flavorful and plentiful.  (Huge portions!)  In general, everything was as you'd expect...although the wonton soup threw me visually since it seemed to have 'deconstructed' wontons (broken apart) instead of the usual full ones -- this led to sort of a blend of wonton 'skin' and cabbage, with the wonton 'innards' serving more like mini meatballs.  The hot tea was particularly excellent, although I can't explain why beyond it seeming to have a rich flavor that stood out to me.  The prices are good as well.  There wasn't much in the way of décor, other than plain colors and several photo prints of locations around the world.  The staff was somewhat brusque but efficient.  (And I was intrigued by the bill coming with the items listed in Chinese characters instead of in English.)
