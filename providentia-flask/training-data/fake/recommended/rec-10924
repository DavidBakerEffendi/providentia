This is no frills, literally. You order at the register next to the lobster tanks, sit at the picnic tables next door, or take your food to go. They serve soda or you can BYOB. The lobster is as fresh as it gets and for $25 you get a lobster dinner, (lobster, corn, cole slaw, potato salad and butter), on Wednesdays there's a $20 dinner special. It's all a Â good value and the lobster I received was huge. I ended up splitting my sides with my friend who got a lobster roll that was devoured. NOTE:Please don't be rude to the kids that work there and tip them as well. I was behind a group that didn't include the word PLEASE in their vocabulary. So, BE NICE, peace and enjoy.
