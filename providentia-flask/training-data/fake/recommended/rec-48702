I came here with a few friends and we each ordered a bistro burger and shared some fries. It tasted like any other burger, nothing fantastic. For all those who said it is the best burger they ever had, I can't help but wonder what you've been eating all your life. I would rather have a Bubba burger that you grill yourself. I do like how they do not rush you out even when you are done eating so people can take their time catching up with friends. Prices are reasonable. Not many options.
