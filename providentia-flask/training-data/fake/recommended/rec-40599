My friend took me here while I was visiting Philly.  Down home comfort food done right! We started off with some of their monkey bread and a basket full of warm blueberry muffins, delish.  I ordered the huevos rancheros which were incredible.  Unfortunately I couldn't try any of their cocktails because I had to drive 8 hours that day, but they looked delicious.  Service was excellent and the decor was cute and funky. Will definitely go back if I'm ever back in Philly!
