This is inventive comfort food at its best. 1) I am grateful that there are so many delicious vegetarian options. Fried pickles, mushroom grinder, coconut club-- it's all delicious and unexpected. 2) Beer is abundant. There is always something new to try-- and so much of it is local! 3) Staff is attentive and so helpful. If you don't know what to order, the waitress will make suggestions which I love. She makes it feel like eating at your families house. It's not close to where we live but it's definitely worth the trip. Memphis Taproom has never let me down.
