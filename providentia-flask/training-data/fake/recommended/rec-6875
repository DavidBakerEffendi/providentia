Seize this chance to have Chef Patricia Jackson cook just for you, or so it feels, in this beautiful, tiny restaurant on North 5th, just off Bedford Ave. The staff is so friendly and welcoming it feels as though you've stepped into someone's home -- someone who can cook way better than anyone else you know. The prix fixe menu means the chef can do whatever she wants, in our case a tiny bowl of heirloom tomato soup, homemade pasta, a crunchy little salad with piping hot pretzel rolls, seared tuna, and because I don't eat meat, a delicious stuffed squash blossom just for me (while my friend had the regular bacon-topped appetizer, which she loved). That last-minute squash may even have been the best thing of the night. Or was it the tomato soup? Or the homemade pasta? Or the little desserts that followed? Or the homemade chocolates that followed that? I may have to go back to figure it out... very soon.
