We Yelped this after our walk on the Highline, which we thought went much further but ubruptly ended on us.  So as we walked toward our Hells Kitchen destination we looked for food nearby.   This popped up and we thought pizza sounded good. Location is interesting, liked that the doors roll up and there is a nice open feeling. I totally agree with someone else that said service was confused.  They actually forgot to make our pizza and we watch everyone else receive their pizza and then we watch the pizza chef head out the front door to take a break.  Then we watch as one of the waitresses runs after him and then another and 5 minutes later they all walked in pissed off.  Our waitress actually then comes over and asks if we are still waiting for our pizza and obviously our answer is of course we are, you dont see it in front of us do you? She basically points to the pizza chef like SEE? and he very pissed off like begins to throw together a pizza for us.  We were a little worried that it would taste like crap because there was no love going into it but it was actually good. Just that whole situation then made us uncomfortable, it seemed like they blamed us for not getting our pizza or something and they kept staring at us. We also had the gnocchi with ragu - this was good as well but the whole situation just ruined the food for us. They need to figure out their service and then the food will be even better!
