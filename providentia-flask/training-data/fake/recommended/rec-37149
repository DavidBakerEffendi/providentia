Where do I even begin....if your on a tight budget and you wanna go to a bar/lounge/restaurant, this is definitely the place to go. I went there for my birthday yesterday and I had a freakin blast in a glass lol. The drinks are cheap and great the food was cheap and they played great music (hip hop rap and R&B) it was a great birthday!!!!!
