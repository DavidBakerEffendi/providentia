OMG this place is AMAZING! It seems pretty north of everything on a map, but rest assured it is pretty accessible still via metro and bus! I am, of course, writing as a one-weekend visitor of Philly who was staying south near the airport. Anyway, my fianc√© and I came to Alla Spina for Sunday brunch, and was super pleased with our meals. I highly recommend the breakfast Poutine (with mozzarella curds, pork, fries egg, and fries) and the Polentu (with cheesy polenta, pork rib and fried egg)! Not your typical breakfast foods, but you still get the most delicious combinations of egg, cheese, meat, and carbs! Unique and satisfying! The atmosphere definitely adds to "the COOL" of this place. Very urban and modern, with graffiti art. Really fun environment for brunch or dinner with friends! Next time I'm in Philly, I hope to come back again and try dinner.
