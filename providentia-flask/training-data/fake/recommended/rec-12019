man oh man, what a breath of fresh air. deceptively simple food, done very well. goes to show that you don't need to bombard people with culinary tricks and confusing layers to get results. just have some respect for the food, know how to cook and season properly, and let it speak for itself. you can tell there's a lot of care going into all aspects of this place.
