I had my birthday party here this year and I can't speak highly enough of the space and staff.  We were able to take over the entire basement and they even provided a GREAT DJ.  The bartenders and manager on duty were excellent and attentive.  The ambiance is as close to perfect as I can imagine.  Love this place!
