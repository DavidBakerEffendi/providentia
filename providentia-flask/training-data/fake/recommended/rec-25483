Very good raw bar. The oysters are delicious, as are the clams, the shrimp cocktail, and the tuna. The beer and liquor are good and not too overpriced. The service is hit or miss.  I have had excellent service, and terrible service...it just depends. The cocktail sauce used to be the best I ever had - in my last 2 visits, you could tell they pulled it from a fridge where it had been sitting awhile...not as fresh as it usually is (though you can tell it's homemade).   Food is 5 stars, service is 3...so a 4 overall.
