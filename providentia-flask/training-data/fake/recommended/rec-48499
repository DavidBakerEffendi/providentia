Absolutely the BEST Chicken wings I have ever had and I have had thousands throughout the years....cooked in a wood burning brick oven, with Rosemary and lemon flavor, natural spices...no greasy gloopy sauce needed...they are perfect and flavorful....just Wow! The Lasagna was also fantastic, sauce like the real way it should be done...no shortcuts, true flavor and melt in your mouth pasta layers....great atmosphere, great service, in fact everything about this place is great! Attention to details everywhere...
