For my birthday brunch a friend of mine says 'Let's check out Toms Restaurant. It has pretty good Yelp reviews and it's easy to get to (it was Sunday - we all know how the MTA runs on Sunday)... the only downside is that there is usually a line' Since I wasn't in a rush and almost always eager to try something new we took a shot... O-M-G... I'm in love. Yes there was a line. No we did NOT: A. have to pay for the coffee we got while waiting in said line, or for the cookies, French Fries, Oranges, or Turkey Ham (with Lemon which was delicious and I would have never thought of trying it if it hadn't been free) B. wait that long, maybe a half hour -- PLUS they gave everyone in line hand sanitizer so that while you handled your cookie, orange, etc your paws weren't all grubby. The staff was amazing. We met the GM, Billy (I think that's his name) while we were waiting in line and he casually asked us what we did for a living... he then introduced us to another employee who had some connections in our industry... wow most NYC restaurant GMs don't take the time to say Hello and here they are giving away coffee and networking. The food is inexpensive and very tasty. I say give them a go - but if sleek decor and fancy food is what your heart desires than this is not your kind of place.
