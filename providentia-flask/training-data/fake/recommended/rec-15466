The menu offers a variety of wines and a broad selection of meals. I planned a business meeting knowing that my boss loves wine and Italian food. We were a group of ten, we were seated on benches (not appealing to the gluteus) we were served out wine. It took about 25 minutes (in a very small restaurant) Â to even get noticed again to order entrees. All in all food was good, atmosphere was good.
