First of all, we had a reservation for 5:00 pm. The guy taking my reservation said you prolly shouldn't need one, and I said well we have to be somewhere at 7:00 so I'd like to make it just in case, so he made it for us.  We show up and guess what...there is no table ready for us...not a huge deal (yet)...we finally get seated after 15 minutes of waiting in the bar. We take our time ordering and the four of us ordered at the same time.  A side order of plantains came out within 10 minutes.  The first entree came out anther 10 minutes later.  After another 10 minutes went by, a second entree came out.  Mean while, our original waitress hasn't been back to the table to see what was going on.  She finally comes back to get us more drinks and goes to check in the kitchen to see what's going on. 20 more minutes go by and finally the last 2 entrees come out. The only positive is that the Cantina Margaritas are on point...and they ended up comping the first two entrees... I won't be back to the Cantina.
