I've never written a review here, because normally I go somewhere, it's ok, and I go home.  That being said, my entire experience at Do or Dine was nothing short of fantastic.  The moment we got to the restaurant and waited outside, Justin Warner, the owner and winner of Next Food Network Star, came outside to make sure we knew we knew we were in the right spot.   From there after a couple drinks at the bar, my girlfriend and I got dinner with a few friends on a Saturday night and were served by Warner ourselves.  He was gracious and funny, and the food was even better.  We got the Nippon Nachos and Dr. Pepper Glazed Frog's Legs and both were great. As entree's I got the Chicken and Waffles, my girlfriend the Chinese BBQ Pork Chops, and our friends, the Steak and Potatoes.  Tasting all of it, it was really all delicious, but also what made the experience enjoyable was the lack of pretension.  I usually eat in Williamsburg or Greenpoint with all the other hip-folk, but this place was different not for the sake of being different.  I can't recommend it enough.   It's nice to go somewhere where the hype is deserved. Totally worth it.
