Oh my, that's a huge table! That was my first thought the first time I went in there. Â Having been back there now for couple of times, it can only mean one thing. It's good. And it is. I like their selection of sake and all the little yummy dishes. It's like a fancier version of an izakaya. But every time we go there we walk out happy.
