DiNic's a great place to go for sandwiches if you're ever around Reading Terminal Market. There were so many places to choose from, but I came for one thing, and one the only- the Roast Pork Sandwich. When it was finally my turn to order, they already ran out of Broccoli Rabe! I was a little disappointed, but not worry, I got the roasted peppers instead with provolone cheese, and they were fantastic! It was definitely worth waiting on line. Next time, I'll remember to come early for the broccoli rabe!
