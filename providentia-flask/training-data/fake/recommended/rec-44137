It had been quite sometime since I last visited this place - so I was glad my friend suggested dining here, especially when he reminded me of the thousand layer bread. We got two orders of thousand layer bread with both curry potato dip and vatana dip (I preferred the curry dip) - the bread was delicious, although I wish it were warmer when it was served. Since it was lunch, I took advantage of the lunch special (quite a deal at $6.50) and chose the coconut tofu with white rice. It was delicious and not as rich tasting as I thought it would be (which is a good thing). The special also came with a negligible salad with seasame seed dressing on the side. There's a good selection of vegetarian options - Monsoon Vegetable and Jungle Tofu are on my to-do list for next time...
