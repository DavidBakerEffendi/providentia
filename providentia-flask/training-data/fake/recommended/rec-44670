The best spot for brunch in the upper east side, hands down. The back room is gorgeous, the bar is gorgeous, there's a great drink selection, and it's somehow sort of affordable (triple bonus, since I live in the neighborhood and everything else is exorbitantly priced and mediocre). Also, don't know what some of these people are talking about - the servers here have been consistently awesome, helpful, and not pushy. The burger and the chicken are great for dinner; for brunch, definitely think about the pulled pork.
