...Yawn. I know this place is or was supposed to be one of "the" places to visit in the Philadelphia dining/nightlife scene, but I can tell you, save your money until the pretense - and the prices - go down. The interior was "luxuriously and fashionably" appointed, sure, but I just can't fully enjoy myself in an environment surrounded by loud, pretentious jerks. I suppose I can't fault anyone for wanting to feel "important" when they've paid those prices for the same level of fare attained at a P.F.Chang's, but I'd rather go somewhere less "fabulous" looking and, ah, be able to hear my dining companions. Â (The food at P.F.Chang's is actually a bit better, truth be told. Sad state of affairs.) That said, the giant Buddha is great, but not worth the price of admission. The dessert bento box was the highlight of the meal, so don't miss that if you go. Other than that, if you're trying to take someone there to impress them, I think choosing a place with a truly unique menu and original atmosphere will impress them more. Unless you're one of those aforementioned pretentious jerks. I DO know a couple cool people who like it here, so I'm not calling you a jerk if you do - I'm just saying the vast majority of the clientele make me... er, want to go somewhere else. Very. Fast. Website's cool, though. ;)
