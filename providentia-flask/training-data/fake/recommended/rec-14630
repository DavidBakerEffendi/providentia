I ordered the Risotto with feta cheese and chicken. It tasted a little bland but it was still very good. The breadsticks could have been served warm, but they were delicious also. The waitresses were very attentive. Even though the place is very tiny, the seating was still comfortable. Its a nice place to grab a late night meal.
