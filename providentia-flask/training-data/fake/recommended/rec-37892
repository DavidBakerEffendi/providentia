We are so lucky to have stumbled upon this gem. Â The atmosphere is relaxed. Seating is a little close - I recommend the bar seats. The cloister cocktail is great - I also recommend the morning glory fizz. Burgers are great. I recommend the duck fat fries. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and good with recommendations. Just loosen your belts and enjoy this mix of comfort food and gourmet.
