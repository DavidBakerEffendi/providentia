So, I am off work early..... It's chilly I am exhausted and it's 3! What to do! I came across Buvette (which means the bar of friends)....I walk in computer bag, purse and stress in hand and plop myself down at the bar.....I order a glass of wine (which by the way if you are a winey- they have a map on the back wall that points out region as well as price LOVE IT)! I start to relax a bit more and then decide to order some cheese........fabulous......the food is AMAZING..... from the steak tartare to the lamb, rabbit and mussels.......Jody is an amazing chef and has out done herself......and she's savvy enough to make it that you walk out completely satisfied.....and knowing the price is just right!!!!! Impeccable!!! Best news they are breakfast, lunch and dinner!
