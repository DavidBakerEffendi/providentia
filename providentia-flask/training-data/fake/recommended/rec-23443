Errrrrbody in da club gettin' tipsy EEE eee EEE eee EEE eee.  That's the jam I was vibin' when I rolled all up in this joint like whaaa?  Took me 10 minutes to balance my healthy helping of paddycakes up on one of them tinya$$ barstools, but once I did, I was ready to drink from the sweet teat of Mrs Hennessey if ya know what I'm sayin.  What I WASN'T ready for was their arousing assortment of meats.  Let's just say I had their meat man runnin his delivery truck around town on a Sunday when he should be at church.  Minus one star because I couldn't find the crapper and they didn't have any baked alaska on the dessert menu.  CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT ALASKA.
