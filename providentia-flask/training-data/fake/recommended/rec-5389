So close by figured we finally have to try it. We went at 3pm on Sunday so there was only one other table there. The waitress was nice, but most of the staff was just talking to each other in the back which I guess is OK since it was kind of empty. I got the pulled chicken sandwich which was really flavorful, my husband got the cornmeal waffles which were pretty OK, but a little hard and lacking flavor. The decor is cute and the music was swing/south which was pretty interesting. Would probably go back to try more things on the menu, the brunch menu could use a few more vegetarian options though.
