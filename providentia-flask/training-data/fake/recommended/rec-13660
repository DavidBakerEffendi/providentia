To state for the record: 1.  I am not a morning person 2.  I hate breakfast food So my girlfriend has been nagging me for a good year or so to have brunch.  I finally gave in today and we went to Clinton St. Baking Company.   To my surprise and delight, the food was good.  Very good indeed.  I ordered the spanish scramble ($13) and she had the southern breakfast ($14).  We shared a daily special french onion soup ($8) and hot apple cider ($3).  Let me tell you... you rarely receive 6 pieces of bacon when ordering a breakfast platter.  SIX DELICIOUS pieces of godly tasting, SUGAR CURED bacon.  Fresh raspberry jam is a nice way to start a morning as well.  The chorizo in my scramble was not too salty.  The food overall was not over-seasoned/dressed.  The two pieces of sourdough on my plate were perfect for our french onion soup -  dunking them in there, getting the strong hits of beef broth and wine. We had a great time and you should too.  They serve breakfast all day, all night.  Not too crowded on a weekday at 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm when we went, but i heard it's packed on the weekend.  The space is comfortable and the service is spot on.
