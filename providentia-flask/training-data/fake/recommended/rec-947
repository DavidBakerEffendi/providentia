Completely underwhelming. The steak was very dried out and also fatty. Without the cheese there was no flavor, just a rubbery and bland taste. The cheese whiz tasted just like cheese wiz and its only saving grace was it brought some resemblance of flavor to the sandwich. The provolone and American cheese wasn't any better. Together the cheese and steak left a feeling of dissatisfaction and perplexity at how this place remains so well known.   The worst part though was how over priced it was. For a little under $10 there was very little steak  and a lot of bread. For an additional $7 you can get fries and a drink. The fries tasted good, especially with cheese. Overall however, for spending nearly $20 for the sandwich, fries and drink, your money can be spent much better else where.
