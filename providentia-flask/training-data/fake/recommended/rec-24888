One of the best price/value relationships for lunch in Rittenhouse. I just had The Hungry Texan -- grilled chicken and beef topped off with bar-b-que sauce on an Amorosa's roll. That, plus a 12-oz. soda for less than $6. And that's a tasty meal. They move fast at Grill Master. And it can kind of look like chaos in there at lunchtime. Don't be daunted...stand still and get the pace of the place. Order...then wait just a little time. You don't pay until your order is up -- no matter what. I recommend the Jewish hoagie and the BLT from there. They also do tasty breakfast sandwiches.
