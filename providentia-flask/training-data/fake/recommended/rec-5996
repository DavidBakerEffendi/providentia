This is the way crepes should be! My boyfriend and I shared (devoured, really) the crispy apple crepe with Vermont maple syrup, apple slices, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream. The funky decor and delicious food really won us over. It would be a great place to linger over a book or catch up with friends.
