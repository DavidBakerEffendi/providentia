As a person with food allergies visiting NYC this place is a gem. It seemed like a place only locals go to, which was awesome. PROS: -They have allergy free options that DO NOT have cross contamination. -The Gluten-Free bread was yummy! -Friendly and allergy-knowledgable staff. CONS: -It's a bit pricey for the food I'm used to getting. -There isn't a clearly marked sign for the restaurant, so it's easy to miss. OVERALL: Go here for a nice allergy-free meal.
