I'm on a quest to hit up Philly brunch locales and WW made the list.  I came for  brunch and had the Eggs Benedict - nothing great there.  A friend had the pancakes, which have NOTHING on Sabrina's pumpkin pancakes.  The brunch menu was brief, and the service average.  Given all the other great brunch spots in QV and BV, I would skip over Wishing Well and head to Sabrina's, Green Eggs, or Morning Glory Cafe instead.
