Great breakfast place for the entire family... stopped in recently after an overnight stay in Burlington, VT. Fast, courteous service. Great selection of breakfast choices. Note that the breakfast egg choices DO NOT include toast (which has to be order separately). For the "sweet tooth" fans... there is a delicious selection of sinful looking cakes (by the slice) and sweet treats... Mmmmmm.
