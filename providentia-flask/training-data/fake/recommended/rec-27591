I've been to North End Grill on two occasions now, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I had the same waiter both times. For food, I would give North End Grill four stars.  For service, two -- shocking, I think, for a Meyer restaurant.  Let me explain. My lunch visit was with business colleagues.  The food was quite good; excellent beet appetizer and interesting fish mains.  Nothing extraordinary, but quite good.  The service, on the other hand, was terrible.  The waiter knew nothing about the menu, seemed nervous, forgot to bring us a bottle of sparkling water that we ordered, and was generally inattentive.  Well, the place was in its first week, so I cut him some slack. That same week, I placed a call to North End Grill to make a reservation for dinner on Valentine's Day.  Fast forward a month, my girlfriend and I show up to find that they have no reservation.  No reservation and no record of my existence--my phone number was not in their system, nothing.  A frustrating experience, to say the least, but my compliments to the hostess, who offered to take our number and call when a spot opened up at the kitchen counter.  Since we live across the street, we took her up on the offer.  True to her word, she had us seated at the counter about 45 minutes later.  With the same waiter from my previous lunch experience. Dinner that night was quite good.  We managed to get an order of onion rings (traditionally only on the bar menu), they are magnificent!  Raw oysters and the standby beat salad were quite good as well.  Our entrees -- risotto and lamb -- were good but not exceptional.  I think that I would stick with the seafood entrees in the future.   As mentioned at the outset, I would give NEG a 4 for food, but a 2 for service drags down the overall rating.
