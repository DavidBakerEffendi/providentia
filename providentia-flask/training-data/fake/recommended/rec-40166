Before it became Devil's Alley, this space was home to a local branch of Jews for Jesus.  I can't help but think they had that in mind when they named it.  But despite the space's dubious past, the restaurant that is there now is a versatile, convenient and consistently good eatery.  At one time or another I've eaten every meal of the day there (including that enigmatic late-night 'fourth meal').   Some standouts for me include the bagel and lox (always enough salmon to generously cover both halves of the bagel), the turkey burger, the trio of sliders and the grilled chicken sandwich.  I love their french fries, mostly for the way in which they evoke memories of those eaten in high school from McDonald's.   They have a pretty terrific beer selection and the atmosphere is rarely overly meat market-y.
