I hated this place when it first arrived in the neighborhood.  Why?  I have no idea.  I'm like that. After week upon week of my wife dragging me here for brunch, however, I've decided that I can barely live without the cheese and chorizo sandwich.  It's pretty much the only thing I'll eat when I come here, even though everything else appears to be good.  The portion of sandwich, potatoes, and salad are generous and the taste of all three are very good.   That said, I've had the French Toast (good, but not great), the bacon (properly crispy but miraculously without distinct flavor), the chocolate croissants (good), lamb sandwich (also good, but not amazing), and a variety of other things I can't remember but were also pretty good.  I've never had anything bad here except the eggs on Parmesan toast with peas -- altogether too many peas and the description makes it sound infinitely better than it actually is.   All that said, of course, it's not perfect and so it gets four stars.
