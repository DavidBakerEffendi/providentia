Best restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. I know that sounds extremely exaggerated but it's true. The service here is impeccable. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly.  Our server's name was Jose and he was amazing!!! They treat you like beloved family here. I can't explain it, it's something you have to experience for yourself.   And to make it EVEN better!!!!- their food is phenomenal. We had guacamole, yucca, tostones, paella and short rib entree, and pastel de chocolate dessert. Guacamole came out a little oxidized, but it tasted perfect. Great guacamole! Yucca and tostones were your standard so nothing jumped out. The entrees though, oh boy. The seafood in the paella was fresh and perfectly cooked. Saffron rice were amazingly seasoned.  It doesn't come with the crispy rice on the bottom like traditionally paella but still a great dish. Short rib- omfg... It was like perfect pork belly. Crispy on the outside but so tender and soft on the inside. The short rib just fell apart- didn't even need a knife!!! Dessert- chocolate cake with mint ice cream and a tequila blueberry sauce. Nuff said! Also- had the poquito picante (little spicy in Spanish) and it was divine!! Perfect mixology in my opinion.  It's funny because originally last night we had planned to start out at Angel's Share but they were having a health inspection so weren't open. I was pretty bummed but in retrospect, I am SO happy that happened bc I wouldn't have tried this gem. There were a lot of regulars and I can see why. I am movin out of the neighborhood but any time I am back, I will definitely be coming here!! Best experience ever. Seriously.
