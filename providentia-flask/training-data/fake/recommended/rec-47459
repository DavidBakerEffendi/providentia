Wow, how has this fallen under the radar? Ruby's is a fantastic hole in the wall cafe in nolita. When you go (not if), get the peacan salad (caramelized peacans, spinach, blue cheese, sliced apples) and/or the blueys burger (the best chicken sandwich you'll ever have). Its not on the menu but they usually have a bottle or two of Yellowtail open so don't be shy in asking for a glass of wine. Fun fact: If you pass by in the early afternoon you will usually find it full of beautiful blond Australians (of both sexes). Its quite the phenomenon. Not that I'm complaining. Nolita = Little Australia?
