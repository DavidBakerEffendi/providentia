BAR has, without a doubt, been disappointing every time I have been there and I will never spend money there again. Their policies are idiotic and here's why. 1) This past Sunday afternoon my husband, his brother, and I went to get pizza at BAR. There were children everywhere in sports uniforms eating pizza with their parents. We asked for a table for three and were asked for our IDs. I told the hostess we just wanted pizza and she said we needed to be over 21 because it's a brewery. My husband and I are 28 years old, but his brother is 19. I said "but there are children everywhere" and she told me "but they are with their parents." So we were not allowed to eat there. The hostess was nice and even checked with the manager, so I don't blame her. But that has to be the most ridiculous policy I've ever heard. So let me get this straight, a 7 year-old can eat pizza because he's with his parents, but a 19 year-old (who definitely consumes more pizza and can pay for himself) cannot? And at what age are they cutting off people or deciding they are too old to have a parent with them? Should we have lied and said the 19 year-old was our son? I am hoping this is just an idiotic policy and not at all racially motivated since my husband and his brother are black. 2) They wouldn't allow my brother in with boots on a Saturday night. I had been out there before and had never heard anything about a dress code before. 3) They confiscated my ID while I ordered pizza to go inside. This is probably their way of stopping people from sneaking into the club part, but really? I'm not comfortable letting someone hold my ID, while they are working the entrance to the bar and not paying attention. Moral of the story is, BAR does not seem to have any idea how to keep business, by making it extremely difficult to get pizza there.
