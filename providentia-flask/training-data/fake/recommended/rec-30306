Perfect place to stop at mid Highline! we ordered the bluefish "Nicoise", the fish tacos, and the pasta w/a basil pesto walnut sauce. My bluefish Nicoise I thought was the winner with a gorgeous slab of fish over deliciously seasoned and crisp vegetables. Bread was amazing as well. Â The tacos were also really good but I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp being breaded....the pasta was decadent, rich, and comforting but since it was so hot out, a little too heavy for the weather. Attire: casual to chic, anything goes here! Some people looked super crappy, others looked put together :) Service: great! Our waitress even blended different iced teas together for us (though the green iced tea was awesome as is!) Price: completely justified for quality ingredients and deliciousness!
