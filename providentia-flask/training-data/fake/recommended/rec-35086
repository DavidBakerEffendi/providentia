You will know it by the long line that awaits the majesty of The Halal Guys. They open late, get the chicken and rice with lots of white sauce and a few dabs of red sauce and you are good to go.  This is the perfect late-night food because it's really filling and you get a lot of it.  We went there aftering doing MOMA on the Friday free night and it was the perfect way to eat out.  There's a lot of food and I had plenty left over for the next day.  Make sure to get plenty of white sauce, because it is so good.  This is a food truck...so seating is where you can find it.
