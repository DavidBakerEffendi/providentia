I'm so happy this place exists! I've been hoping for a spot near my apartment that serves cheap/delicious/healthy food. I had the falafel (only $4 and super tasty) and the kale avocado salad (AMAZING). The people who work here are incredibly nice and thoughtful. It took about 10-15 to get my food once I ordered, and the cashier gave me some snacks on the house (and assured me the wait was because they were making the falafel fresh - not that I was complaining!). The space feels brand new (cause it is) and is very bright/blue/pretty. Order at the counter, plenty of space to dine in if that's your jam. It'll be amazing in summer when they can open all the front windows onto the street. This is my new go-to spot. Looking forward to trying more dishes.
