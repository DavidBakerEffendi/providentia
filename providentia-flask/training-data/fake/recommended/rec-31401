A lot of shoreline Connecticut folks will say that Pepe's is for the tourists, since it's expanded to other locales and seems more media-savvy than the unperturbed Consiglio family at Sally's, or that dark-horse contender for best pizza, Modern.  For my money, that's a ridiculous argument, as I've had pies at Pepe's that were simply transcendent.  Another bone of contention is whether the pies at Pepe's or The Spot are better; honestly, I've eaten in both places many times and enjoyed them equally. It's a great pie, and giving my two cents, locals can lighten up a bit on Pepe's regarding their expansion (with regard to the New Haven place only, I haven't eaten at any of the other locations). A bit less char than a Sally's pie on average, I would say, and I would recommend the clam pie at Pepe's over Sally's, even over the clams casino pie at Modern.  (By the way, if you are from out of town and order a clam pie at Pepe's, I would give the nosy advice of ordering light garlic--- the regular portion is overwhelming).  Between Sally's and Pepe's, if I had to choose only one, I would choose Sally's, but probably occasionally rethink the choice.
