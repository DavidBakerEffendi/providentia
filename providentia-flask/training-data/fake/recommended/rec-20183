Let's start off by keeping in mind I was in pretty bad mood and very hungry....with that said I walked in, I was not greeted at the door or even acknowledged but I thought I'm in a bad mood play it cool. But then a couple walks in, sit at the bar ( mind u I was in front of the bar plus the place was pretty empty in the front) and is acknowledged to the point where they order drinks and food then after following and calling out to the woman behind the bar im able to place my order (lamb burger and sweet potato fries to go $18). The couple is served (mind u I went to the store and my car then came back and went through the same thing of not being noticed) and im still waiting. But then I notice a take out bag. The woman who took my order walked passed the bag twice and was asked about it by a coworker, but didn't make an effort to look for me. At one point someone who may have been the manager walks by me (does not ask if im being helped) goes to adjust the lighting (which is 2 feet away from me) without saying a word. At that point, I'm done and just want my food. So I get up from the stool I was sitting across from the bar 5 feet way to get my food. THE FOOD: was great the lamb was well seasoned and the sauce was great. The fries appeared to be fried without much flavor. I would go back for the burger but if I get the same service I don't care how the food is im out Â bc it will kill the experience.
