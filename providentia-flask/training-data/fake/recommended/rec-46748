We had a great experience here, and will agree with all of the other positive reviews of Zinc. The ambiance is very nice - especially for a "date night". The cooking is inspired and well executed. Yes, the duck nachos are very enjoyable. The hanger steak was great, although a little too salty. They had ricotta gnocchi with meatballs for the main course on their market menu. While the meatballs were excellent, the gnocchi was a bit undercooked. Our server was stellar, and the kitchen had their A-game on as far as delivering the food (almost too quickly). The only real complaint was that the bartender did not have his/her A-game on. A mojito does NOT have vanilla-flavored rum in it. Fortunately, this horrific mixology faux pas did not detract from the overall dining experience. We'll be back.
