I moved to South Philly a little over a month ago. My boyfriend is Dominican and all I eat is Spanish food (obviously I'm Cambodian). It got to a point that I missed my mom's cooking and missed being around Khmer people. So my boyfriend and I decided to stop by Khmer Kitchen, thanks to Yelp, and was greeted by a young looking server. He was genuine and sincere when my boyfriend was lost at looking at the menu. I ordered the beef with duk-pahok and was about to cry from deliciousness before the food even got in my belly. Â I don't know what my boyfriend ordered, but it was definitely something my mom made. The portion was a large size and my boyfriend couldn't finish it so I had to help. The server was friendly and explained how his mom, aunt, and grandma were the only cooks since it is a family owned restaurant. He introduced us to all of them and his dad. Oh, and there was the most adorable little girl that came out the back of the counter. She was smiling and everything, it was sooo cute. Definitely will be coming back soon. :) it's BYOB, and CASH ONLY.
