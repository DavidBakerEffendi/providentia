As a bacon lover, I really had high expectations from this place, especially the way this place was advertising itself. We walk in and we are welcomed by crazy aroma of bacon. thumbs up.....service...got a table within a few minutes even on a friday evening....2 thumbs up...then it all went downhill. The bacon flight was ok, nothing spectacular I would say, I was expecting a nice thick cut piece of bacon with full of flavors, but it was ok, thin and over fried. Drinks were ok as well and the food was just like any regular bar food in the city. Sorry but not impressed :(
