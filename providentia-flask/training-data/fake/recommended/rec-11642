Great tapas, great sangria! Although the space was small and tight fitting, the service was excellent and the food was just what my friends and I wanted - delicious, savory and filling but not heavy. Although it was a special, I highly recommend the roasted pig - the skin was crisp and the meat was amazingly moist. The scallops (another special) was also delicious. Specials tend to be bigger portioned but we had no problem finishing it. This is a great Friday night happy hour spot.
