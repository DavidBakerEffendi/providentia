The best breakfast I have EVER had in the city!!  Weekdays are by far easier to get a table without a wait, however, for the BLUEBERRY PANCAKES & EGGS BENEDICT I'd hang around.  Attentive & friendly staff are always a plus as well. BLUEBERRY PANCAKES!! First & foremost if you go to Clinton St. Baking Co. & do not try the blueberry pancakes then bless you because even if you do not like pancakes, let alone blueberry ones, you will love these!!  light, airy & the perfect crispness combined with a homemade warm maple butter = perfection!! EGGS BENEDICT...By far the BEST eggs benedict i have ever experienced.  A perfectly poached egg & "ham steak" atop a scrumptious  buttermilk biscuit with hollandaise, chopped chives & tomatoes...quite possibly my #1 go to when nursing a hangover.
