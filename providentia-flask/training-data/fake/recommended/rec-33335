Very charming, very local feeling, and very reasonably priced little joint. The service was average, not bad, not top notch.  It is one of those kind of bohemian feeling places where, if you want five star service, you will be disappointed.  I will say that our waitress was very sweet.  What she lacked in attentiveness, she more than made up in charm. We went for happy hour, and the prices were beyond reasonable.  $1 oysters for happy hour is nothing new, but they were awesome, really good quality.  Between that and the half price drinks, we were there for at least two hours and when I saw our bill, I had to double check because it was so cheap I thought they made a mistake. In closing, great happy relaxed happy hour spot.  Not a first date, not an impress people who are just getting in to town, but just a chill spot with good food and good prices.
