The food is great and the service is usually exceptional. It;s a fun place. The lobster dishes are excellent. The PIZZA IS MY FAVORITE. I like the fries like everyone does. They refill soft drinks and the staff is great. All TV's show everything. Can get crowded but that is because it's GOOD! AND the management is friendly! Caters well to out of town visitors!
