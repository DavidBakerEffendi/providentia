The place is really cute. I went here to catch up with a girl friend I hadn't seen in years. This was the perfect setting for us to relax and chit chat- the dim lighting made you feel like you were in a living room catching up. The food- yes YELPers are right- the corn spring rolls were flavorful. The come four to one order but they're in a square cup which makes the exterior of the roll a lot less flaky--because they're hot and pressed against each other. BUT this is a minor point in comparison to the flavor. Also tried the honey ribs for app and had the basil fried rice. This was probably the best basil fried rice I've had in a long time (sorry DC..but its something you just don't do well). I loved the basil flavor with a hint of spice. I HAD to take away a star from this place though because the service at the end of the meal...ridiculously pushy. Like they guy stood over my girl and asked "Check ready now?" When we said no, they paused like what do you mean no? Soooo feeling like I was getting thrown out really threw me but the food was good.
