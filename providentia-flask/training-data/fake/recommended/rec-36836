This review is for my experience at Amada last night. This was supposed to be a Valentine's dinner for the wifey and I was let down by the quality of the food.  We did the $65 tastings menu and got 14 dishes.  The only ones that were good was the roasted pine nuts dessert, cheese sampling, grilled octopus and oysters.   The main issues were that most of the dishes felt extremely rich (especially the sea bass in some kind , everything related to mushrooms was completely doused in truffle oil overwhelming any natural umami mushroom flavor and lastly the lamb chops were undercooked.  Also it was disappointing to not see any lobster and prawns. In fairness though I think my expectations were quite high since we had an incredible experience at Tinto's and expected more from Amada.  The wine pairing tasting menu was superb and lastly our server Harrison was great and very knowledgeable.
