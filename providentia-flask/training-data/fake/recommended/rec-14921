I don't get over to the Penn-area of Philadelphia too often, and every time I go I leave wondering why not. It's a beautiful part of the city and there's always something new to find. One of those places is Doc Magrogran's. I had been to New Deck plenty of times and never stepped foot into this oyster house until last weekend. We weren't looking for a full dinner or anything too serious, we just wanted to grab a seat somewhere new and "raw bar" jumped out to us almost immediately. And the bar is really beautiful. Not too crowded like some of the other spots in this part of town, relatively quiet and really clean. The beer and drink list is impressive too- I was drinking Mad Elf at the end of February. I'll give you a moment to be jealous... We ordered a dozen oysters and a dozen clams. Their oyster selection is really unmatched to anywhere I had been in the city- so many different types from different locations all over the country, and with a whole list of different flavors. But best of all is how well they are cleaned- for how quickly they came out we were more than surprised to find no bits of shell or pieces of grit in the oysters or the clams. Now that the spring is here we will definitely be back for more. This place is really a gem and a nice break from the normal college-scene bar around Penn/Drexel.
