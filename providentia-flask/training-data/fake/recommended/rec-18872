McGillin's is a classic old pub that I never get tired of.   Officially dubbed the oldest bar in the country and I believe it.. You can find a decent and mixed crowd almost any night of the week. I don't eat there too often but I've been pleasantly surprised each time. Solid turkey burgers and wings.  And the service is always friendly. They have the standard brews except for Guinness so if you are a fan of Guinness, don't bother going to McGillan's. They do not serve the world's most famous stout due to a silly dispute with the Guinness Import Company and the owner.
