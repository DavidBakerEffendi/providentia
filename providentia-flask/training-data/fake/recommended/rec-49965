Bad business. I sat for 20 minutes with girlfriend on a slow night and was ignored the whole time.  I finally found some courage to request a drink in the politest way possible, just because I thought it would be more awkward to walk out without ordering something after everyone else had already left.  I also left a tip only because I felt similar anxiety due to not knowing what type of people would treat customers so poorly and I didn't want to offended anyone more than I did by simply walking in. It seemed like some locals were having a great time when I first arrived so maybe it was just me.  I couldn't figure out what I did wrong and hopefully I never will since I'm never coming back.
