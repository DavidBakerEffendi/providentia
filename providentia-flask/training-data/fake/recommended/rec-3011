This place is fun, easy, and they don't mess around w/their meat. Their dogs are primo and the toppings are fresh and unique. The layout of the restaurant is easy-going, just like the staff. They don't make their own hot dogs but after eating one, I couldn't care less! I came in expecting to get the Saigon or some other concoction on their regular menu, but had to get the "Philly Surf and Turf" instead because I needed to know if it was as good as it looked and boy was it ever! It was a fish fry and a hot dog in one with all the fixins- a tad messy but totally worth licking the finely chopped, pickled veggies off of my hands. The fries are also great- salty, thick steak cut fries in a paper cone. Try the dipping sauces- I got lemon thyme (just okay) and curried mayo (awesome!). They participate in Level Up- score one for South Street- they needed something like this. Average dog costs $5.50- not too shabby.
