Food is very good and owners (Jessie and Adam) are awesome. Great vibe. Have been there 5 or 6 times now with different people and it is always good. It's the kind of food I would make at home, but it would take me most of the night to make it. They also have "grab-n-go" dinners for $10 or so that are very convenient after a long work day. Here's what I have tried and really liked: ham and gruyere panini, brisket panini, whiskey chicken, several soups, veg moussaka, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, mashed potatoes. Â  If you're hungry, plan on spending about $15 for your meal.
