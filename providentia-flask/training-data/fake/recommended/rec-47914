Awesome Puertorican food! The staff is friendly too. We had the pernil, churrasco, rice with gandules, tostones and a salad with the creamy cilantro dressing. We also had the cafe con leche and a flan. This was very delicious. I recommend this to anyone who wants to eat some rican food. The cost is reasonable and servings are perfect. Give it a shot, you wont regret it and will go back :)
