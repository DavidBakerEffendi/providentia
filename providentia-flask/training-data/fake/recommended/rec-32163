Three of us needed a pleasant and quiet restaurant for a conversation, and the one with the local knowledge among us directed us to Savvi's. It was a good choice. The main entrance to the restaurant is off the parking lot, which tucks around the restaurant in an "L" shape; I was briefly confused by the emergency exit on the side of the building (near a handicapped space). The door is clearly marked, but I was confused anyway. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We all had grilled sandwiches of one kind or another, and happily finished them all. Mine was a "Monte Carlo," which puts the same ham/turkey/cheese combination on grilled rye bread. With two of the major food groups well represented (salt and fat), what's not to love? I resisted a Monte Cristo (there's one on the menu) because of my recent experiences with the open face Monte Cristo in central Connecticut. But I think I'll have to give it a try another time. The Monte Carlo was *good.* They've also got very tasty french fries as well. I had no troubles finishing those, either. The midday crowd was a quiet one, so we could have a good business conversation without straining our ears or voices. The table was even big enough that I wasn't searching for a place to put my notebook and pen when the plates arrived. I like it.
