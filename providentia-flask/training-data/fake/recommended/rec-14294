Stone Park Cafe is always a really delicious and pleasant experience--both for brunch and dinner. The food is traditional, but has a nice spin on the style and flavor. It's a good place to go when you have a group of people with varying preferences for food; you can satisfying both foodies and traditionalists with a meal at Stone Park Cafe. The short ribs hash is salty and wonderful and the hangtown fry is fishy and delicious. The staff is always friendly and attentive.
