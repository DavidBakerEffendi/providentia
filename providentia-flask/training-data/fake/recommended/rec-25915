Mémé seems like a great addition to the West Village restaurant scene, generally known for quantity not quality.  Situated in a notable corner of the Village, where numbered streets and avenues give way to a curious mix of narrow, named thoroughfares and pathways, Mémé's location will never be wanting for foot traffic.  Is Mémé on Eighth Avenue or Hudson?  Is the fare Moroccan or Turkish? This new restaurant boasts of some classic vegetarian starters.  The cheese sambousek is an excellent choice and comes in a set of three.  The combination of the crispy exteriors, the feta and the hot sauce make it a delcious must-have, if one is not averse to stuffed, fried pastries.  The hummus-falafel platter is relatively disappointing.  It lacks that distinctive flavor or edge that would separate it from the ordinary.  But I quite liked the fried artichoke with aged manchego, especially in combination with their pomegranate salad. Mémé is hopefully here to stay.  I am sure to return to sample the wide range of menu options.  After all, it's all about me, me, me.
