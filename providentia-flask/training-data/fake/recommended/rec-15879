Perfect place for a lovely dinner  in the city. I love UES in general, I think it's a beautiful neighborhood and I loved Uva. We sat outside (got seated immediately ), weather was gorgeous, seats were great and the service was very good too. We had red wine and  Caprese and some eggplant based appetizer , both very good. I loooooved my duck  entree. It was just delicious. Perfectly cooked and juicy, to die for.  My friend had a pasta dish and he was pretty happy with it. We shared mille fole for dessert , my friend loved it , I thought is was ok. I will be def  going back, especially on a nice summer day or beautiful fall day.   I also recommend this place especially for a date or a bff catch up dinner :)
