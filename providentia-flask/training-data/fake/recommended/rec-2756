Very rude employees and manager. We ordered takeout 3 times and ate there twice. Unfortunately, 2 out of those 5 times we got a complete attitude from the man behind the counter, who I believe is a manager/owner. We are very quiet, laid back people and there was no need for an attitude for just wanting to know how long until our food would be ready. Our order was wrong so we needed to know (some people do have other things to do, and our night doesn't just revolve around getting mediocre food from your restaurant). There were a couple of other strange, rude encounters. I was excited to find a somewhat decent local place, but we will not be going back. We will be sure to recommend Mama Flora's instead to our friends/neighbors, where the owner is respectable and a decent human being.
