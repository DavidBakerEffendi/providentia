Holding it down in the new gayborhood of Hell's Kitchen. Let it be understood that there were many Thai restaurants to choose from on the strip but this one promoted its Thai authenticity. Â With that and a quick glean on Yelp, we checked it out. We were not disappointed and were super excited by the decor. On this night I think the service was little off and by that our waiter couldn't wait to get off, he like in fact told us that and happily passed us off to another waiter and skipped, I don't mean walked with a lilt, skipped out the door into the warm summer night. He left us to have a very good dinner for its price point. I'll definitely hit this place again on future HK sojourns.
