Interior dining area is a fantastic cozy space with wonderful Dios de la Muerte paintings done up from floor to ceiling. Service was also great. Came for restaurant week and ordered the surf and turf and was a bit underwhelmed by the "turf" portion. They definitely cooked my medium rare properly -- it was wonderfully red in the middle -- and the spices were great but the flavor of the meat itself was off. However, the tortilla chips are phenomenal. They are clearly fried on site. Would I go for a repeat? Yes. I just won't order anything featuring steak.
