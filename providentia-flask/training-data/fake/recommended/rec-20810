I am shaking my head while reading the great reviews for this place. All I can say is this. We're from Texas. We know good TexMex. This food was not good. The salsa was the first dead giveaway. We left most of the food on our plates and walked out the door scratching our heads wondering how Chili Willie's manages to stay in business. We will not return. The only reason I gave Chili Willie's two stars is because the service was decent and the portions were huge - huge portions of bad Mexican food.
