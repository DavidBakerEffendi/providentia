I love BXL East, it's a really great place to get a quick (and cheap) lunch in an otherwise not too inspiring neighborhood, and a bit of a refuge from the hustle and bustle of midtown. The service is top-notch and very relaxed and friendly for the neighborhood. I'm not much of a beer drinker, unfortunately, but for a beer bar they have a surprisingly good wine selection. I recommend getting whatever the daily special is, or mussels. Those two dishes have served me well every time I go.
