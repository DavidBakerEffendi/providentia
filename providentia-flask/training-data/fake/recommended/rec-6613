What in the world is in that green sauce and would it please be possible for vats of it to be delivered to my house weekly??? This has been my absolute favorite lunch spot since moving to the city - takeout only though. Trying to get a table during the insane lunch hour rush may cause permanent mental distress unless you naturally wolf down your meals in 10 minutes or less. Black beans, yellow rice, and the roast pork is my go-to, although the grilled chicken is also good. Portions are substantial - I can usually squeeze out two lunches out of one platter...unless I am in pork mode and cannot stop nibbling away at it one tiny bite at a time until there is not quiiiiite enough for lunch the next day so, what the hell, I might as well go ahead and finish it even though I am painfully full. I fall for that trick all the time. Sophie's also taught me that smashing crispy potato sticks on top of your sandwich is awesome and acceptable for adults to do.
