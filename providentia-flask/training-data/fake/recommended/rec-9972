$5, $5, $5, $5, you can't beat a place with great drink and great prices. This place was definitely crowded but after being seated and enjoying the drinks , music, people, and atmosphere I could totally understand why. Came here on a Friday night, and from the look of things on the outside you cant tell how comfortable and trendy everything looks on the inside. Definitely will come back here again, and again, and again...just keep the $5 drinks, cheap food, and great music and i'm there.
