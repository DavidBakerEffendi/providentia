Great new restaurant in Newark (opened May 2013).  We had the lunch special, which included choice of entree, two sides, and a drink.  The most adventurous eater in our group encouraged me to try the curry goat.  It was the first time I have tried goat and it was great.  The sauce/gravy it was in was very flavorful and went well with the seasoned rice I had selected as one of my sides.  We also enjoyed the talapia and the chicken / pepper steak.  For desert, the five of us split a couple orders of yogurt.  The chef makes his own yogurt and I have never tasted better.  It was so cool and refreshing.  Almost an ice cream flavor.  Definitely something to get every time we go.  Service was friendly and fast.  I hope more people discover this hidden gem.
