Portugalia is one of my favorite North American working class restaurant bars.  it is genuinely Portuguese, but friendly to everyone.   The cable television from Portugal features endless replays and analyses of professional soccer games, featuring comely actresses from Porto or Lisbon selling desert estates to tempt a fog-weary Englishman to invest life savings in a plot of land probably far from the Atlantic.  The food is great, if you like diced turnip, pork, potato, and sausage, which I do.  Quantities are prodigious, service is friendly, everything is clean, and the waiters appreciate anyone saying "Obrigado".   It avoids the tourist kitsch of The Ironbound completely.  Order sangria by the pitcher, because it doesn't really make up properly by the glass.   Not for vegetarians.
