I tried the pork feast this time around and it did not disappoint. We had a group of 6 but there's food enough for 8-10. The meal comes with a huge portion of pork, fresh oysters, sticky rice, 2 kimchis, hot sauce and lettuce wraps. It may not sound like a lot but you have to remember you're eating huge slabs of meat. Protip: add the oyster to your pork-filled lettuce wrap for a nice flavor/texture combo. I highly recommend the Ssam Bar for a large group outing and I'm already making reservations to try out the duck (a slightly harder reservation snag). The only downside is the seating is cramped and uncomfortable.
