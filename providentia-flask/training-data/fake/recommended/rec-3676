NOTHING BEATS TOMS! Its not that I live 5 min away or that the diner across the street from my apt. simply STINKS, ( NEPTUNE),  its because everything is delicious! This is not an exaggeration! I've been coming to Toms for over a year & I've yet to be disappointed & that's saying a lot! The costumer service is out of this world!   Of course they're not perfect, you may encounter long wait periods & CASH ONLY. There is a ATM in the restaurant!     Outside of that it's Brunch Heaven!
