I ate here once awhile ago. I personally was not impressed. The inside looks dated.  The parking sucks. I had the lunch buffet and was not impressed with the offering. I generally like Indian buffets because I'm not an expert in ordering something besides Biryani rice.  I went in hoping that the food would be filling I let disappointed. I didn't like that they didn't have much out and the presentation was not pleasing to the eyes. I guess for $10 what can you say besides I'm keeping my $10 and going elsewhere.
