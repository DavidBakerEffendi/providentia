As a foodie to the max, I had been looking forward to getting into this place for a while, and I was not impressed. First of all, the service was No good. They were not friendly, they rushed us, took away plates before we were done eating, and not attentive. For such a speakeasy, that is unacceptable. As for the food, it was just OK. Nothing special. Pretty average. I certainly wouldn't make an effort to go back. It was also quite uncomfortable to sit in those weird, low to the ground chairs. Not worth the 100 bucks (after the meal and drinks, you can't walk out paying less than that). All in all, Bohemian certainly did not live up to all the hype around it.
