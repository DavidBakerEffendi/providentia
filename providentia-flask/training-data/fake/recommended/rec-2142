I finally got to try this place after bookmarking it for over a year.  Why did I wait so long?  These Empanadas are shaped in little half moons of joy! I ordered a bunch of them to try with the family and they were all a hit.  Out of all of them, I was pretty impressed with the turkey and cheese.  Maybe because I wasn't expecting much, but I am glad I tried it. It was well seasoned meat with plenty of flavor.  I will be ordering that again for sure.  I also liked the beef and cheese and the  spinach and ricotta ..... actually, I liked them all!! With all the different varieties, they are marked on the bag and also stamped on the top of the Empanadas itself (not with ink, but an impression) which was pretty cool.  Their house made hot sauce is also a must. I didn't try their ice pops yet, but will for sure the next visit. This place is legit!  The staff is also friendly.  I will be coming back again!
