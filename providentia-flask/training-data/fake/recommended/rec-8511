Okay, Bill's probably has the best breakfast sandwich I've found in Philly. and I've eaten a lot of breakfast sandwiches. Freshly cooked eggs, folded around delicious cheese, on any kind of bread you'd like. How can you go wrong. It's definitely filling, but worth it. And Bill is the nicest guy - always says hello to me!
