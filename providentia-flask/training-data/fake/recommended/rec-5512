Visited DiNic's today inside Terminal Market with the boyfriend and ordered the pulled pork sandwhich with broccoli rabe, sharp provolone, and hot peppers. However, since they were out of broccoli rabe we had spinage instead. Â It was veryyy good! Plus, we were able to split a whole sandwhich and left feeling full. They also have seating and have banana peppers you can throw on your sandwhich for some extra spiciness.
