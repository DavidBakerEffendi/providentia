I live in Park Slope and have always passed by this Cafe. They have live bands and seemed like a fun place to go. Sadly, my boyfriend and I were not impressed. It seemed pretty pretentious.  We saw the server maybe twice. Once to get our order, the second time to give us the check. We saw the busser--seemed to be working way harder than the server--more frequently. The food was a let down. Under seasoned and kinda cold.  The only highlight was that we didn't have a long walk home. I guess I'll just continue walking past this Cafe.
