Oh brunch, how I love thee. Aurora is one of my favorite breakfast places in Manhattan not only because the ingredients are fresh and seasonal but their dishes are creative. They have a great fixed price brunch ($15!) which includes and entree, cocktail or juice, and coffee or tea. I've had the french toast - amazing, melt in your mouth and definitely get the berries on top! Also, the duck confit hash was great -- its not something that I would normally order but the flavor was good I just couldn't stop eating it! I can't wait to come back for more!
