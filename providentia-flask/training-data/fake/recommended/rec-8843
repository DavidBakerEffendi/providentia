Was recommended to me by a bunch of people that work in the area. Hands down the best pizza I've had in New York (so far, been to 8 places). Shit, I've only been here for 11 days...(goes to search for closest retail location with spanks for men) If I'm getting pizza near SoHo, I won't go anywhere else.
