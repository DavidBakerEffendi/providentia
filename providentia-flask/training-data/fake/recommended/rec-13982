One of my favorite sushi places in NY! I stumbled upon this restaurant over a year ago when I moved to the area, and I couldn't stay away. They have some really great rolls and fun holiday specials. I went for lunch on Valentine's Day, and they had some really tasty treats! This Iron Chef wins in creativity, taste, and artful presentation! This is a fairly boutique-sized place, so it's a really cozy neighborhood spot.
