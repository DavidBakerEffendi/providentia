By Far THE WORST SERVICE I have ever received in a restaurant. I have been a loyal patron to San Sai ever since they opened, and gave one of their best reviews in the beginning. Every Saturday night, I faithfully dined - never complaining, even with all of the staff changes. The owner truly needs to re-think who he is hiring. San Sai's current staff is not a restaurant worthy of Vermonters. Last evening's lead waitress needs to be fired. So sad- as the food overall is good. There are plenty of other restaurants in Burlington, with quality- well trained- professional staff. No need to visit San Sai again.
