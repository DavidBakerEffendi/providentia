What a horrible  experience  i had with this  place. i went to this  place after  i read good reviews about it searching for a restaurant in little italy to eat.. and after my encounter with this restaurant  my  best advice is  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!   First off, the   waiter took forever to take  our  order, waited  like  10-15 mins  just to order the food! Secondly,  i asked for  whole wheat  penne  and he gave me regular penne and when i asked about it   he  said  it was whole wheat and  the reason why it  does not  look it is because its their  "homemade"  recipe bullsh*t your homemade recipe  cant be such a  coincidence that it  looks  like regular  penne and tastes  like it too, what are the odds....  point  is  im 100%  it wasn't  whole wheat.... so he didnt mess up on my  order  he  lied  which is even worse thinking  im that dumb to beleive him that what he gave me was whole wheat cuz he couldnt admit  he  messed up on my  order to begin with ! Thirdly, i got a  side  dish on the side  2 medium sized meatballs  which were NOT flavorful at all was  7 bucks  - what a  ripoff. need to focus  more  on the  flavor than the size mr.  chef... quality wins  over quantity. speaking  of  size and flavor. my  pasta  dish was the most  unflavorful and  bland  pasta  i have   ever tasted  in my  life.  i asked  him for  extra  sauce when he was taking my  order  and  there  barely was any sauce  to begin with. even when he gave me the  marinara  sauce  there was  no flavor at all....  the  portion was small which is good not to overeat  because  carbs is heavy   but it was def not worth  $15 when it came to taste and  plus  i wouldve wanted a tad  bit  more penne for  my  bucks. all i know is  im never coming back there  ever again...
