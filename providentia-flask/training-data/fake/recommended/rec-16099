We ate here because of the high Yelp recommendations, and we were terribly disappointed. The water didn't even have ice in it, and the antipasto vegetariano was terrible ... the veggies were soggy and some were undercooked. The dish was obviously just quickly thrown together. The menu and the server said it served two, and we were shocked how tiny it was ... yet not impressed enough to order more food.
