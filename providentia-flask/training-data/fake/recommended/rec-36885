I was in the city last weekend, and we stopped in Cafe Orlin for some late-night drinks.  Once again, it impressed!  It was crowded,  but we got a seat at the bar and got comfortable.  The bartender was really nice and he served up some fine beverages.  I was kind of sad that we were full, as the menu looked quite fantastic.  They also had a sample of the prix fixe menu for NYE, and it also looked awesome.  Next time we'll be sure to save a dinner to eat at Cafe Orlin.
