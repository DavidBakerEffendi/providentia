Tartine is small. It is cozy and cozy in a good way. Yep, you will sit inches from other diners, but no one seems bothered by it. There might be a short wait when you get there, but just go hang outside. It's in a lovely neighborhood. I ordered an omelette with everything in it except ham. It was fresh and not over cooked. Chunky crispy potatoes with savory seasons and fresh chopped green onions sprinkled on top. The stranger inches from me ordered a brioche french toast dish that looked almost like a funnel cake minus the funnel. I was ready to introduce myself, make a new friend, simply so I could ask for a bite of their divine looking breakfast. Good coffee, okay juice, great service. It's a BYOB cash only brunch-tastic place to kick start a Sunday.
