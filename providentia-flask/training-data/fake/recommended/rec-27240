I wasn't scared off by the name Barrio Chino solely because my Spanish is terrible. I was, however, horrified and almost scared off by the ancient Chinese Dynasty decor and realizing the name literally means, "Chinatown" en Espanol, thinking, "Why are they playing Passion Pit?! This must be a weird fusion restauraunt."  I'm so glad I stayed for an amazing meal! Elderflower margarita and guacamole were delish to start off with! Then the friggin enchiladas verdes... ay Dios mio! I get enchiladas verdes/suizas at every mexican place I go to, and these were some of the best!  YUM! GO NOW!
