The food is excellent. Highlights: Hands down the best rib eye steak i have ever eaten! Cooked to perfection and mighty portion. Also the chivito completo is a massive sandwich filled with many layers of ingredients but somehow all works together and is so very savory. Honorable mention: scrumptious empanadas! I love the dim romantic ambience, location is tucked away and perfect, service is fairly attentive and friendly. The only con is cash only.
