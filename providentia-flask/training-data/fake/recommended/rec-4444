I have been her twice and had for delicious noodle soups. It is a Taiwanese restaurant which has a little different flavors than regular Chinese. The reviews will tell you it's very busy but has been very quiet at lunch when I have visited. The first time I went here I had a delicious and very clean and warm in my stomach pork noodle soup with mustard greens. It just made me happy and really want to come back. The second time I went with the waitresses suggestion of the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. Tons of character. Very spicy and savory. Better even than any Pho I have had. There was also a very sweet family next door. The young child was happy and silly, the husband a math professor at the University of New Haven a nice guy. The wife was from Taiwan and the owner gave him a contact. He said the food was as good as his in laws. One of the best Chinese/Asian places I have ever gone. It's worth a trip. Remember to bring cash, they are cash only. Delicious.
