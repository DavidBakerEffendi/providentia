From the drinks to the food, everything was exactly what we needed to deal with the cold winter's night. A mini-Yelp get together, we started at the bar while our table was getting set.  I began the night with the Harvest, which had an amazingly smooth apple flavor.  VP had the Sazerac neat.  It was good enough to be our clear recommendation for CP, always late,when he finally arrived.  We went off menu for round two, and the bartender Sweet Lou (I'm not kidding, that's what's printed on the receipt) mixed up excellent. Once seated, we started with a selection of apps: Fried Oysters, Mac & Cheese, and Nashville Wings (a special for the evening).  The menu listed 3 Oysters, however, the dish only came with 2, making it a bit difficult to split amongst the three of us.  No worries, the grits stole the show and there were plenty of them to go around. The Mac & Cheese was solid, I've had better but was far from disappointed.  Finally, the Nashville Dill Wings were amazing.  Spicy, but not as hot as I imagined, the flavors danced in my mouth.  VP and I decided on the Pork Hash, while CP hit up the Fish & Chips.  With enough food in front of me, I didn't end up trying the Fish & Chips, but I could see the portions were very generous.  As for the pork hash, not what I picture, but in a good way.  The fingerlings offered balance to the pork and roasted cippolinis. The only downside was there wasn't quite enough pork in my mind.  Presentation and service was great, ensuring I'll probably be back in the future for another meal, probably brunch as that menu looks awesome!
