Travola NY: Manhattan: Garment District 7pm Saturday 11th October 2014 Four Stars We sat immediately. I saw the veal Ragu and knew that is what I wanted. The squirrel couldn't decide on pasta or pizza since they were out of the gnocchi. I had take a phone call during dinner which I never do and when sat back down I felt like an ass. We ordered some white wine and ate some decent room temperature bread. Then I ate my offensive meat ridden pappardelle. (Aside: the Pork industry slaughters pigs much younger than baby lambs). My food was wonderful. I am still feeling the carbohydrate high. On a last weird note. There hard floor floors were rather slippery.
