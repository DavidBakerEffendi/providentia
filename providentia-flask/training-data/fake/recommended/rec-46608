This was my favorite place for lunch when I worked downtown. I'm vegetarian so I can only vouch for the meatless wraps, but I never had a wrap I didn't like. Thai peanut popper and vegan volcano were my two faves though. The wraps are huge and I never needed a side to go with it. It gets crowded during lunch time, but they are usually pretty fast with carryout orders. There's a $5 lunch special on Mondays fyi.
