When I first heard of Ramen Boy closing shop I was upset because they were one of the few ramen joints that didn't equate salt with flavor.  Upon entering Terakawa, I liked the upgrades to the decor and I was so happy to see some of the ramen boy staff still working the house.  The menu immediately caught my attention because not only did it have some classics such as miso, shoyu, and tan tan ramen, but it also boasted a house special Terakawa ramen as well as the visually stunning mayu ramen.  Needless to say, I had to to try the mayu and it did not disappoint.  The broth was creamy with a strong garlic infusion throughout.  The noodles were nice and chewy and the egg was brilliant (a perfect soft boil with a think and runny yolk).  This is a ramen joint that is aiming to please and I will be returning soon to try the other soups.  I gave Terakawa 3 stars but I hope to upgrade that to 4 or 5 in the future because I am not sure if there are any spicy menu options.  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to really ask about possible extra spicy options.  If the super spicy is possible, than I could have a new favorite ramen joint because the staff is wonderful, the atmosphere is chill, and the prices are fine.  To be continued....
