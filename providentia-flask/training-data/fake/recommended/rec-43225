The sushi here is decent, definitely not the best I've ever had, but not the worse. However, their food is very well priced, so you get what you pay for. The rolls are a little on the small side, but since they are so cheap, it's not really a big deal. I would stick to the sushi and sashimi and avoid the teryaki. I had theirs once, and it was very small and not very good. Their service is par for most sushi places, but they give time estimates that are completely incorrect. If you are going to pick up an order, I would add another 15-20 minutes to when you should arrive. Almost every time I go to pick up food, I end up sitting around and waiting for them to finish. Overall, a nice place for a cheap meal if you live in the area. Blue Ashiya fulfills its role as the West Side JC sushi stop.
