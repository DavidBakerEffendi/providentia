Great food, great wine, and great service!! We went here after searching for a place we had not been to before on Yelp. What a wonderful surprise!! Beets, beets, and more beets. I Â highly recommend the fettuccine with beets- I am still thinking about this. We will definitely go back- one of my top 10 places to eat in Brooklyn!
