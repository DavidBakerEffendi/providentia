I live in the suburbs and eat at the White Dog in Wayne often. The experience is always perfect. For my boyfriend's birthday we decided to try the University City location. Our waiter was the WORST. He made our dinner awkward and uptight by making us feel stupid when we asked any questions regarding menu items. My burger was fine but I'm not positive it was cooked fully. Do not ever need to go back and will stick to Wayne White Dog!
