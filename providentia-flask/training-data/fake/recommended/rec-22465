Well, change is inevitable. I was sad to see the old Fork etc. go. I really enjoyed the sandwiches, soups, bread and the coffee. So after two visits here is my take as a local and regular of the old Fork. I went for brunch and for a late lunch. Both were good. The turkey sandwich was really quite nice and the eggs with Lebanon Bologna was also nice. The idea of having a few different pickled condiments on the table is also a nice touch too. But on the other hand I wasn't bowled over either. I used to think that the old Fork had the best latte east of Broad St. Now they changed the brand and didn't think it was more than decent. The service seemed confused both times that I was there. The last time I went there were two staff members sitting near the door not really doing very much and crowding the entrance. The servers didn't seem very friendly and appeared to be stressed. It took a while both times to have someone to come over and had to work at grabbing a servers attention when I wanted the check. So change is unavoidable and going to happen. Fork etc changed to High Street on Market but I'm not quite sure what they changed into. Unfortunately whatever it is so far its not quite up to standards of Fork etc. and the main Fork restaurant. I will give them a few more tries to see if they find their way but right now I would not recommend going there. There are other choices with good interesting food and coffee in Old City.
