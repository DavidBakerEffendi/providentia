As someone who is embarking upon the Paleo Lifestyle, this restaurant was a Goddess-Send! The food is awesome. You can find a wide assortment of dishes where ingredients match the paleo diet and that you're not taking in artificial additives. There is even a selection of wine that is paleo friendly if I remember right. Great spot near 14th Street Union Square.
