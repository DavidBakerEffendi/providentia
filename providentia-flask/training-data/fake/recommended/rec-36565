This Tribeca Â place seems to be the "new" must try place in the area and has that trendy "place to be scene" feel to it. It is a pretty big restaurant that busy and somewhat noisy due to the interior. As expected all of the pastas are fantastic. We also tried some Apps and the stars where the Steak Tartare and the Blue Crab crostini...some of the best I have had anywhere. My only gripe on some of the dishes where a few were a bit heavy on the salt.
