This place is AMAZING. You must get the chicken and pancakes! The 45 min to hour wait is worth it. Kick back and read the sunday times while waiting, and they'll text you when your table is ready. It is consistently excellent but quite packed. The mixed drinks are good, but the bloody mary is a little too cocktail saucy for my tastes, so I've switched to the vodka rosemary lemonade (fantastic). The wait staff is attentive without being obtrusive, and the food arrives quickly. I will be coming back here for brunch for a long time.
