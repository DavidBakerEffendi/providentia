When I entered the place I felt like I was inside a nest because the walls were decorated with twigs. The size to this place was huge: Upper and lower dining area. Dimly lit, and felt like a fancy restaurant. The food: We got the Peruvian combo to share. I do love the chicken from this place. It was perfectly cooked. Sadly, that is all I got to say...it was rotisserie chickens. I do want to comment that the chicken went well with the Â green sauce. The french fries was nothing special for me either. The avocado salad was great because I love avocado. However, I don't think anything special about this combo and way overpriced for rotisserie chicken. Ceviche mixto This is one of the dishes that I enjoyed. I love fresh seafood and this restaurant delivered quality meat. The lime juice was not overpowering. Just enough to cook the meat
