We went here today for Taste of Hartford. We ended up sharing the Paella, which this place is supposedly known for. Got to say that it was pretty bland and not as flavorful as other paella dishes I've had. The appetizers were okay. I got the crab cake and it was pretty good. The highlight, strangely enough, was the dessert. I ended up getting the rice pudding. Never been much of a fan of rice pudding but this was real good. Service was "meh". We had a reservation but they forgot to write it down. Beer selection is pretty bad. Seems like they have a good selection of wines, which makes sense given it is a Spanish restaurant. Overall it was decent.
