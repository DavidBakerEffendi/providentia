Went here the first time and the service was so awful. You sit ignored and there's always 3 servers that come ask you the same questions. During mid-order they run away and leave your glasses empty. The decor is very nice and the food is amazing. We thought it might be a fluke so we went back to see if it were a better experience. Nope. It's a shame because the food is so good but it's hard to enjoy a restaurant when the service is so bad.
