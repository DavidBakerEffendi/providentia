Came here on a Sunday morning at 9:15... Wasn't seated till 11:30 for 3 people. We were going to leave but since we wasted our morning we decided to stay. We ordered blueberry pancakes, potato pancakes and the southern breakfast. First, the pancakes tasted like bisquick that I made when I was 5 and the syrup had the consistency and taste of water. The potato cakes were probably the best and they forgot my side of chicken sausage that was supposed to be apple and turned out to be onion and peppers and dry. In all the food was extremely mediocre and looks better than it tastes... Also the staff acts entitled and rude. I live a block away and won't be returning
