This is a good restaurant if you looking for a meal and show. The service is good and the food is decent depending upon what you order. The are very accommodating to your requests. Table are little to close for my liking and the ventilation is only adequate depending upon your table location. In a pinch this a good place to grab a bite before a show. If you have more time you can do better.
