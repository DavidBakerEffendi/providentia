Definitely one of the best ramen places I've tried. The pork bun itself was great. I pretty much ordered everything in the appetizer section and everything tasted fantastic. I ordered #5 which was the ramen bowl with no broth and just the noodles and the meats. And it was delicious. The only thing that could have been better was to have air conditioning. I believe they said it wasn't working so we just had to deal. The food was too good that we didn't even care for the heat. The food came out pretty quick and the service was great!
