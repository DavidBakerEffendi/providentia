I don't eat seafood- so what am I doing here?!  Well, I love Maine, I think lobsters are cute & everyone loves lobster rolls. We purchased an awesome deal on Gilt City which included: 2 lobster rolls, 1 shrimp roll, 2 Cape Cod chips, 2 whoopie pies & 2 Maine Root sodas for $30...who could resist?  There is seating next door of large picnic style tables & a Maine feeling (buoy's, lobster art & cute lobster salt & pepper shakers). As someone who doesn't eat seafood, I was excited to see a beef hot dog (not sure if it is a seasonal item?) on the menu & will definitely try that next time. I was in awe of how delicious the lobster rolls looked...like pieces of art! The whoopie pie was the best I've ever tasted...it didn't taste like a dry devil dog but almost like an ice cream sandwich as the inside was nice & creamy with the sandwich part being chewy.  I'll now turn it over to the person who actually ate the lobster rolls (haha!). I have tried lobster rolls from Maine, Stew Leonards (I go there for the value $5 for 1) & Luke's Lobster...Red Hooks lobster roll was very filling & seasoned well.  It was very meaty & fresh.  Definitely worth the trip as it is better than driving 7+ hours to Maine.   A tip would be to check their website prior to going as sometimes they alter their hours (ex: today they closed at 6:45).
