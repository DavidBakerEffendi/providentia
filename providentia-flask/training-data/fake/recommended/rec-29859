This place is okay. Not sure what the hype is all about. My friend and I each got 8 pork and chive fried dumplings... ate it for breakfast... at noon =) 8 dumplings is plenty to get one person full. I would have been sated with 6. I do like the crisp on the bottom of the fried dumpling but it's super greasy which I didn't like. Best place to eat these is at the park/playground on the NE corner of Hester and Eldridge.
