Great all around place.  New Moon doesn't really do anything to perfection, but they do A LOT of things and all of them are good.  Sandwiches, salads, breakfast, pastries, coffee.  It also seats like 300 people so you can always grab a spot.  Personal favorites are the cobb salad, scones, and plain coffee.  There are better places to get a cappuccino nearby, but New Moon's is pretty good.
