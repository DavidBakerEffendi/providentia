We arrived at Raymond's just before noon for Sunday brunch on a breezy September morning. The wait wasn't too long at that point and we secured tables in the sunshine in under 20min. Sipping our BYOB mimosas and serenaded by a nearby street musician, the ambiance couldn't get any better. Among the three couples present everyone loved their dishes, which ranged from steak and eggs to huevos rancheros to Norwegian eggs benedict and of course the famed french toast. The crispy bread, dipped in some otherworldly batter and fried to perfection, is surprisingly light. Nevertheless it is difficult to finish the whole platter on your own and sharing it leaves room for Raymond's other delights. My Norwegian eggs benedict was a tad cold on arrival but the generous gobs of smoked salmon still made the dish a winner. All in all, service was a bit slow, but Raymond's is a perfect spot to take in a lazy Sunday morning.
