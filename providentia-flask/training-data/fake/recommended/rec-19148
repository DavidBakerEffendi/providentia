This is perhaps the Sriphapai of Malaysian cuisine in NY. It's been popular with people of all races for as long as I've been acquainted with it. Yet the food remains authentic and hasn't been tweaked to suit the tastes of those less initiated. It's probably as close to what you can get in a genuine Malaysian or Singaporean restaurant as in the city. The adventurous are rewarded in this restaurant, especially if your constitution is amenable to spices, piquancy modulated by subtle sweet notes and heat from a wok wielded with gusto. Some of my favorite dishes are niang dou fu - meat and fish paste wrapped in crispy tofu skin, pan fried then finished in a soup broth flavored with chinese anchovies and salted fish. the seafood hor fun is also reliable, given that they are generous with their seafood portions, and the shrimp and slices of fish are probably sourced right from the fishmongers on nearby hester street. The roti canai is a crowd pleaser and rightfully so. Desserts are recommended if you've never had a southeast asian coconut shaved ice or warm sago soup.
