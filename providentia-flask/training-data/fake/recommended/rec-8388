Burgers are delicious. Literally no comparison to other places with the spirit and scale of service provided. I have to come back and try each burger on the menu. It feels really cool here with nice mixed drinks and all kinds of beers; I can see myself spending hours with friends at the second floor by the bar, snacking on cheese fries and drinking up.
