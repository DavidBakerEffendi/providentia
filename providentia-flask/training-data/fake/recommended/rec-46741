We have been eating at this restaurant for years, unfortunately, not as often as we'd like to, as it is at least a half hour drive from our house.  Food is consistently delicious and FLAVORFUL!!!!  We think it is the best Mexican food on the east coast!  The menu offers a wide variety of appetizers, main courses and desserts.  Main courses are additionally offered as "light portions" which are sensible, so you are not feeling too stuffed when you leave!!!  There are sufficient entrees that would satisfy those who are not fans of Mexican food, also.  Don't let the outside appearance of this restaurant (an old house) keep you away - the food is certainly a treasure, the service has always been good!!!!
