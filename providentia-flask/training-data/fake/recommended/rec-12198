There weren't many people when I wandered into this relatively new establishment. I was in Philly for work and decided to stop in. I was in Tokyo, Japan in December, which spoiled me on sushi, so it's been much harder to appreciate sushi in the U.S. The place is relatively small, but probably suitable to the Chinatown / Convention Center neighborhoods. Wandered over after checking Foursquare and Yelp! for info on sushi places near my hotel. There's a small sushi bar area, and several tables. I took a table and was presented with a menu, the usual - water. I was very surprised to see they actually had two "chef's choice" "Omakase" options, so I took one and was not disappointed. For the price I got a variety of sashimi (thinly sliced fresh raw fish) and nagiri (the style of sushi typically of two pieces draped over a clump of rice). All of it was fresh and delicious. ありがとう, Kabukiza.
