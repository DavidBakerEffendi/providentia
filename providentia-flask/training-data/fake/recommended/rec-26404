I came here on a PayPal run (can't you tell I'm just as obsessed with PayPal runs as egg creams and empanadas? I'm a passionate woman). I picked up 3 crepes that came to about $30. I thought it was a little steep, but I won't splurge like this without PayPal. I ordered a Turkey Delight, shrimp and avocado, and as per Yelp's advice, the Lychee Valentine. All three of those were very delicious and highly recommended. My favorite was the first 5 bites of the shrimp and avocado, the last 5 bites of Turkey Delight, and the entire Lychee Valentine. The first 5 of shrimp avocado because the latter part was too sweet. And the last 5 bites of Turkey Delight because I needed to clean my palette after the really sweet shrimp avocado. But the Lychee valentine was indeed a delightful and romantic feast. I'd totally come back here again, because I'm obsessed with crepes. Service was meh, I should dock a star, but she wasn't terribly rude.
