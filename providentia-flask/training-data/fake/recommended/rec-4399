Holy F#$*ing Crepes! This place is just awesome. It's been on my list to try for some time as I work at Temple and finally today was the day. I went after the lunch rush at around 1:45. I've heard the wait gets a little nuts so I didn't have to wait very long for the magic they were about to hand to me know as Â "Alexander the Crepe" which was filled with gyro meat, pepperoni, vegetables , and cheese, covered in both pizza sauce and ranch. Whoa. So incredibly delicious. First off, it was huge. I was convinced there was no way I could possibly finish it but apparently that wasn't going to stop me...it was just too good. Next, the price was awesome. $5 for a massive, delicious crepe? Done. Lastly, everything inside tasted fresh. The veggies weren't mushy, the meat was tasty and it had just the right amount of sauces. OH and the crepe...well that was great. Perfectly cooked with a nice crunch at the edge that made it perfect to roll into a pizza slice shape. Just like on the streets of Paris. Sigh... Thankfully, my boyfriend loves crepes and can't wait to go so it looks like I'll have my opportunity to eat one of the sweet crepes soon. YES!
