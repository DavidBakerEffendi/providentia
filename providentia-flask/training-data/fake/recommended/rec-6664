It's all about the duck, if your stomach can only fit one dish have the duck with noodles add some beef balls and throw in a heaping scoop of their "special" hot sauce.  Then that's the perfect Bo Ky experience.   This is coming from 20+ year experience of eating at almost every single restaurant in chinatown, trust me i won't steer you wrong =)
