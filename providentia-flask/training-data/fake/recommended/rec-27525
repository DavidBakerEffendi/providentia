I went to have lunch at this restaurant about a month ago.  I walk in and greet the person behind the bar.  She was very rude and told me to sit anywhere.  I looked at the menu and probably should have left right then. But I stayed and ordered a "especial Sincronizades" which is a mushroom quesadilla.  Before I ordered I asked the same rude lady what some of the words on the menu meant.  She answered as if everyone should know.  So she bring me the fancy quesadilla.  It was dry and tasteless.  The only thing that made it edible was the green salsa.  That was yummy.  I asked for more so I could eat my meal without gagging.  When I asked for the bill, the rude lady was suddenly nice and called me "sweetie".  How fake!  I also noticed I was charged for the extra salsa, ridiculous!  I would never eat there again and I would recommend that others stay clear of it as well.
