I went to Xochitl for restaurant week, so I wasn't able to take advantage of the full menu.  But I really did enjoy what I had.  I think the dish I liked the most was their ceviche (theirs has octopus, which I love!).   I had the salmon for dinner.  I have to say, I really didn't like the spices they put on it.  I appreciated the spiciness of it, but the overall flavor bored me. I felt I could recreate the dish easily using some sort of generic McCormick brand spices at my own home.  However, everything else we ate was absolutely delicious!  So maybe you should just avoid eating the salmon, unless you like generic spices.   Oh, dessert was great, too.  I had some sort of apple tart.  Yum! The atmosphere was really beautiful, with vivid colors on the walls.  The staff was very friendly, too.  Overall, I had a great experience.  I'd love to go back!
