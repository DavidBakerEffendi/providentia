Previously, I would have given Reservoir a 5 star rating.  The place is usually packed and their pizza is truly great.  The reason why it's 3 stars is that  we got take-out a few days ago, and the pizza and the chicken parm sandwiches were great, but the rest of the food (Italian sub, chicken Marsala, and pasta w/ meat sauce) were all just average.  The chicken Marsala was overcooked and the sauce a bit thin and it didn't stick to the chicken at all... just overlooked dry chicken in thin sauce w/ a few shrooms.  The pasta was over overcooked and mushy, and the meat sauce wasnt as good as it usually is.  And the sliced tomatoes on the Italian sub weren't ripe... They were mostly green, which is a no-no, especially this time of year.  When I got home w/ the take out order ( even though the waitress said she checked and everything was there, the Italian sub was missing and I had to go back a second time.  Although the staff is usually friendly I had to wait the second time to get the sub they forgot, ( even though it was ready) and wait while they seated other customers, and they definitely could have had a better attitude about giving me food that I already paid for and had to drive back a second time to get (but they did give me 2 meatballs on the side, for free, when I complained about it).  Perhaps it was just a bad night.  I'll go back again sometime b/c 9 out of 10 times, I've really loved Reservoir and would have previously given it 4 or 5 stars... and the pizza definitely still rocks.
