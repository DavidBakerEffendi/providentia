Back in NJ after 15 years... Had to hit a diner. Well, I was expecting more. Had the corned beef hash and eggs. It was fine... Canned corned beef hash. The thing that I don't understand, you have potato on the menu and you have corned beef on the menu.... So why open a can when you can make home made...
