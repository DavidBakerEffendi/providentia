If you subscribe to the theory that the company you're with makes the evening, than this bar is a solid option for you and a few friends. It's the kind of bar you settle for, if you're going out in Center City but don't want all the fanfare of a typical Rittenhouse bar. It's easy to relax here and they do sport a great beer selection...but I don't know that I could ever fall in love with the place. Sure, the music is pretty good, and the bartender is quite the entertainer. But, the place is priced for people that don't know better - La Fin Du Monde at $8? A lager (that's a Yuengling to you Non-Philly residents) for $4.50? Seriously? You can go next door and get that same beer for $2.30...granted that's a smoke-filled dive, but still! Philly is blessed with a ton of great bars, many sporting amazing beer selections. Sure this is a fun place... There's just a bunch of jaw-dropping spots with beer lists that rival this joint. It will be tough for Pistolas to compete - unless you and your friends are determined to hang in Center City.
