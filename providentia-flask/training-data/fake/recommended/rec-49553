I went for lunch mid-week a little after 1 PM.  No wait whatsoever.  I ordered the truffle fries, an off menu burger I had read about, and a draft.  The fries were merely warm when I got them and proceeded to get cooler by the minute.  This did not do much for the truffle cheese melted onto them.  They tasted ok, in spite of this.  The burger was rare, as apparently all burgers must now be if they are expected to be taken seriously.  It too was ok.  The draft beer was cold and good.  With tip, lunch came out to just south of $40.  Not exactly a transcendent experience.
