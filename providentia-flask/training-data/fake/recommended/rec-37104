This is now one of my favorite spots to have Sushi (1) They have a Happy Hour food/drink specials, A selection of rolls and other food appetizers  all for $3.50. Sake/Beer $3.50 (2) BYOB- Yup this spot allows you to bring a bottle of your favorite wine. The first bottle is free the second bottle  is charged a $10 corkage fee. They open the bottle for you and place it  in chilled ice bucket . The wait staff is always attentive in refilling my wine glass when its low (3) Its affordable cheap eats! .
