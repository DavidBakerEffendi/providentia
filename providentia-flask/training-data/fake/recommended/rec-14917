Here's what I love about this place. Let me start with the nachos. Ya see, we've been coming up from Texas the last few years for Philly Beer Week. This place isn't far from the hotel, so we came here for a brunch beer event. We got the nachos because ... well, do I really need to finish this sentence? We got the nachos because that's what you do when presented with a menu that has them on there. These nachos are FANTASTIC. Chicken nachos. Guacamole. Yessssssssssssss (say that like Gollum from Lord of the Rings to really get what I am trying to do here) Believe me -- I had not expected to write that, but we were amazed. I think someone even paused before shoving the whole plate in his/her mouth and took a picture of them. You might want to see what that's about. Secondly, the owner is awesome. He's really got a passion for his place - he has been there every time I have, and is likeable, funny, accessible, and knowledgeable. We've had a few great exchanges in the times we've been coming here. Lastly, their beer selection is great. Again, the staff has been pretty versed in what they're serving, and friendly. Apparently, Friday and Saturday nights get pretty exciting upstairs here, too! If you are in the area, and looking for lunch and some beer. Go here. Get nachos. Be happy.
