My review is made strictly for the bar/music/late night crowd - We did not eat here. I dont normally review restaurant bars/lounges, etc. Brought a group of ladies here on a recommendation from a friend of a friend. The girls were looking to dance, so after leaving Le Bain we came here. It reminds me of home - LA - really fun crowd, DJ played a variety of old and new hip hop. We came on a Thursday night around 11PM and took over the dancefloor. To be honest, it was for a bachelorette - and we really didn't plan to come by here so we were dressed to the nines while everyone else was in jeans. DJ, staff, and the crowd showed A LOT OF LOVE to us Cali girls. The only gripe I have is to invest in some better speakers, I think one of the speakers was blown. Other than that, we had a blast!
