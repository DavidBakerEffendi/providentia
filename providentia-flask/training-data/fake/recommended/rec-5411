What? There's a Jewish Deli in downtown Newark? Indeed and it has marvelous food, great service, and if you are lucky enough to meet the Brummer's you get a free side of shtick. Â  No kidding the sandwiches are to die for, and if you want some smoked fish on a bagel no less they can do that too. Come to Hobby's downtown Newark for a most wonderful meal...... Tell the I sent you......
