Wow, wow, wow, cheap, good and plenty. I was attending LegalTech at the Hilton and wanted to try something new. This food cart met all my expectations. I had the Gyro chicken combo plate for six dollars. (sandwiches are four dollars.) I have had many chicken rice meals at various food carts and this is the best in terms of quality, quantity, and taste. The chicken was succulent. The Gyro and the rice were tasty and the lettuce was fresh. The food filled the entire 6+ inch aluminum container to the brim which was then covered with white sauce (hot sauce is optional). I love this place and highly recommend it to everyone.
