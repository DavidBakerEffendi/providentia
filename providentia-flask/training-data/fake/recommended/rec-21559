Disgusting. I'm making this scowling face at my computer screen as I begin to write this review, not really knowing where to start... ....what happened? I went into the American Sardine Bar fully expecting to enjoy it, but my experience was nothing short of mediocre. I really liked the decor of this place, the intense, rustic and small atmosphere, but the service and food were...eh. Got the pulled pork sandwhich....the meat was so tough that I couldn't chew it. Onion rings were okay. Sauce that came with it was better. Maybe focusing on the food would do this place a lot of good and make it tempting to go back....but for now, I'll just stick with filling up a growler at happy hour and take it to go.
