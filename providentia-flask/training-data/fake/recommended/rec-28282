This is my last weekend in NYC!!! :( So I had to meet up with my long time friend from Panama!!! Yay, be loud and caribbean at our best... Anyhow, he just moved to an awesome place in Astoria, we had a few Negras Modelos because you can take this girl out of Mexico, but cant take Mexico out of this girl, and we decided to hit the scene... but we were hungry too... Midnight. Hungry and thirsty. Where we can go that served food at that hour. THE PLACE He took me to Sweet Afton. Â It was mildly crowded with handsome people. The music was loud enough to dance but we could also talk and hear each other. I liked the music. I had a very good impression of this place. Clean, unpretentious. FOOOOD!!! We order a couple of beers and a burger with a side of fries. The service was pretty quick. Couldnt believe how fast that burger came to my table... And how fast it disappeared!! The fries didnt do much for me. They had good taste, but they were not crunchy, like when they are fried in oil thats not hot enough. The burger though.... I love pickles, but im pickle picky... The pickles on this burger? DE LI CIOUS... Loved them! The meat was cooked just as I asked for, it was juicy, tasteful... So, I was pretty happy with my burger... I devoured it actually... THE SERVICE Attentive but not overwhelming just like I like. Fast. Then something happened. After the burger, we got a little carried away with the music, laughing, drinking, so when by the time we were leaving, I had totally forgotten I havent paid for the last round!!! HELL-OOOOUUUU!!! So, as we were leaving, the waitress comes up to me, and very politely asks me if I had paid for the round... OMG, embarrassing. But she was very nice and polite. She asked me if we enjoyed the place, the food. I TOTALLY WANT TO GO BACK and try the Mac and Cheese... Good ambience, friendly staff and good food... Next time in NYC I want to stay in Astoria!!!
