Dropped in recently and just got plain ole' shitcanned Prior to getting shitcanned, the appetizers I saw looked pretty tasty, but more importantly, our bartenders were money and were super friendly and quick on refills and requests. Due to their efficiency, most of my group dragged ass out of here come the end of the night haha. Otherwise, place has a great vibe, is a 5 second walk from the Hearst Tower/Columbus Circle, looked like it had a solid bar menu and just an overall chill spot for after work libations. I'll be back!
