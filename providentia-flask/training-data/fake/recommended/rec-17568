Not usually a yelp reviewer, but I've had a few good experiences here and a few other places lately and figured I'd put my two cents in! I went here with my mother and fiance for dinner the week after they opened up. It was 7:00 on Friday night and we didn't have a reservation (big mistake) and there were a lot of empty tables that were reserved for 8:00 reservations. I thought they weren't going to be able to seat us, but with only a little perserverance they did, which we appreciated. We felt a little rushed, but only because we felt bad taking someone else's table. It was no fault of their own. I've heard a lot of people complain about the wait, but when a good restaurant FINALLY comes to town, what do you expect? Make a reservation and you should be fine. If you don't they will do whatever they can to seat you of course and good things do come to those who wait! The food was awesome! My fiance and I got a delmonico steak (had to!) and my mother got the filet. I think I actually preferred her filet over the delmonico, but both were delicious. The sides are ordered family style so we got mushrooms and risotto, which were both really good. I'm a picky steak eater and I should probably preface my review by saying that I like steak juicy with some fat on it and practically bleeding. This was perfect. It wasn't too fatty, was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. I was definitely a fan after the first bite! Prices don't seem too outrageous either. Drinks are a little pricey, but good, and they have specials every night (I think?) or most nights at certain times.  They have an awesome bar area with a whole bunch of TVs that opens up to the back where they have a small outdoor seating area complete with fire pit. Can't wait til Spring to use that! The decor is warm, yet modern and the servers were friendly. Did I cover it all?   Overall, loved this place for dinner and/or drinks and will be taking my friend from out of town there this weekend!
