I work for a group of Senior Citizens as old as 102 years old and I take them out to lunch every friday. We picked Up Thai and I need to say the staff was so accommodating to my gang. We all walked away very happy not to mention the lunch was amazing, I can taste and smell all the herbs and spicies. The Ambiance was very nice. Go check place out...
