i'd like to say the few times i have been here were relaxing, but most of time i am on my feet chasing my son around the beer garden.  if you see a short asian woman chasing a giggling little boy around trying to fish pebbles out of his mouth- that would be me.  i'd say i burn my beer off before i leave every time.  even though the atmosphere is quite relaxing and laid-back, most of the time i leave this place far more exhausted than i did when i arrive.  with that being said, i enjoy coming to frankford hall. in this beer centric city, i am surprised there aren't more beer gardens around already.  i am so glad this place is close to my house.  the beer selections are great because they are unique.  the staff are so friendly and kind.  they are not only very sweet on my son, they also let me taste the beers before i made a selection.  the sausages are tender and flavorful.  mustard is wasabi hot- reminds me of chinese mustard.  the pretzels are soft and served warm.  my vegetarian friends like coming here for the vegetarian sausage.  the food is a bit on the expensive side, but happy hour starts at 4pm and the beers are $5 for a 1/2 liter. one day my son will actually start to listen to me, stop eating the gravel, and then i could really chill out at this place for once.  maybe then someone will be well-behaved enough to be treated to their soft served ice cream too.
