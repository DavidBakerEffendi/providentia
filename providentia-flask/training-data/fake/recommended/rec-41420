This may be the closest thing to a SF burrito, but it is still not very close.   I was so excited to go to this place based on all of the positive reviews of their California style burritos.  Maybe I hit them on an off-day, but I left disappointed.   I was encouraged at the sight of the steam table holding all the delicious fixings for an awesome burrito.  The prices even seemed manageable (not SF cheap, but acceptable).  I ordered my burrito and salivated as she loaded it up, rice, beans, cheese, sour cream, a healthy dose of guacamole...then, lettuce.  Lettuce is great on a burrito, but romaine lettuce in big spiney pieces?  Not good.   I got mine with the "hot" chipoltle salsa.  Unfortunately, this salsa was not hot and I ended up having to douse the thing with Tapatio, and nobody wants that.  The burrito, though big, was wrapped quite loosely and poorly and fell apart as I ate it, this coupled with the use of big hunks of lettuce was quite troubling to me. I may give them a second chance.  Maybe. Sally F.  - You need to get yourself out of this tasteless city and have yourself a real burrito.
