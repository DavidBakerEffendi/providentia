Terrible place do not go here! the food is less than mediocre and there are always constant fights outside of the restaurant. Out of desperation I ordered some nachos to go and did not even want to step into the place to retrieve wha they called "nachos". Everyone looked at me like they wanted to fight me! I don't even know how this place is still open! the crowd is shady at best.
