Since moving to the UWS 10 months ago I had been waiting for Kefi to reopen. Many of my friends had recommended the place to me. So, I was thrilled when I managed to secure a reservation last Friday night. Maybe its because the place had been so hyped, but I wasn't overly impressed with my meal. It was good... but nothing I would run back for. The grilled octopus was probably the best dish we tried. But, the rapine was waaay too oily and my simple grilled fish also tasted bathed in oil and butter. The special pasta dish made with a pulled pork was also pretty darn good, but its not that hard to get a good pasta dish in this city. It was also packed that night and we felt a bit rushed by the waitstaff, but that's understandable on a Friday night, and forgivable. Although, jamming so many diners into such a small space and constantly having the waitstaff bump into you really isn't the most preferable way to enjoy a meal. They might want to take out a table, or 3 or 4. The dining room is just so packed. I'm going to give Kefi another try. Hopefully, they were just a bit off that night. And the next time I'll see what all the hype is about and enjoy a great meal.
