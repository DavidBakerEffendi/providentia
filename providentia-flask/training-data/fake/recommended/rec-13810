* Bar review only, to be updated after a meal * I will save the real review until I actually eat here, but I swung through on a Friday night on a guy's night out for a couple of drinks at the bar and liked everything I saw. Whenever I see a dressed-up bartender I know it can only go two ways: A. totally cool or B. too-cool-mixology master-I know everything and you don't know jack-I don't have time for you-look at me, I'm cool behind a bar. Fortunately, this brief query was answered within seconds of entering. The second we walked in, jackets still on, still surveying if we could grab a seat at the bar, the bartender had the drink menu up high and was passing it over the first line of the bar and acknowledging our presence. This was impressive and the way it should be. Even if we were there to eat, you want to put alcohol in the hands right away - mission accomplished. Having just experienced the SixPoint Sweet Action a couple weeks back at a Yelp event my eyes went right to it and here is cool bartender move #2: there was a couple getting up to eat or leave, but there were still a fair amount of people around the bar or coming in. He put the two beers right in the two seats as the people were leaving, thereby marking those seats as ours before anyone else could try to snake them. Hooks under the bar for jackets - done, beers in hand in less than three minutes in a busy place - done. I had already seen the menu and it looked great so next time I come here it will be for the food, but this place will definitely take care of you at the bar where they serve food as well.
