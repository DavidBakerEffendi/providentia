Wow! Two thumbs way up, Fabrizio. This is the closest thing to haute cuisine on Grand Street in South Williamsburg. But don't get me wrong: this is no pretentious joint; it has an indelible hominess with a less-is-more, very tastful decor. Wonderful beer selection (not to mention the marketing genius of a late night happy hour - 11 PM to 2 AM - booya). The tappas are unique, well-seasoned, and well-executed. Damn, I am really having pangs of remorse in posting this review due to my selfish worry that this secret WILL GET OUT! Cheers, Saint Austere.
