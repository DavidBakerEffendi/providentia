Friend and I ordered take-out from here. The delivery man called to say he had arrived, but he wasn't there when we went outside. His phone didn't seem to be working, but he eventually showed up on foot (a bit strange). When we unpacked the food, there were no utensils or napkins. I thought the food was tasty (beef & broccoli, dumplings) but my portion was disappointingly small. Trying a different place next time.
