I higly recommend this place along with the owners other restraunt blue. Compared to the other cajun restraunts on staten island, bayou blows them out of the water. I love the alligator bites and the jambalaya rice balls. Ive been here about 5 times but I really did t care for the lunch menu as much as the dinner options. But either way awesome food. Great service. And I love the decor.
