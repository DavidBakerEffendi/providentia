First encountering Hagi after a walk down the stairs into the brightly lit bar/izakaya, I caught a whiff of stale air, a look at the flat screen TV above the bar with the game on, and a peek at the non-Japanese clientele. These were tips enough that this Times Square establishment is more bar than eatery. A seat at the counter prompted no immediate response from the female bartender, who surprisingly spoke Japanese. The barley shochu recommended to us as having more of a "whiskey" flavor was incredibly mild at that. To Hagi's credit, my dining partner and I have just returned from Japan, arrived at the place on a Monday night around 8, and ordered too much food. That being said, the food was not worth even the reasonable costs. The edamame was half properly cooked, half undercooked, half black around the sides, and half salted. The grilled eggplant was in slices, with the tip charred and presented as a small volcano of a garnish. The eggplant tasted more like the burning remnants from the saute pan than any sort of vegetable, and the bonito flakes dancing atop it lacked any flavor. Its ginger condiment was a pile of sharp mush, totally past its prime. The gyoza had been frozen, thawed, and heated in a microwave, producing a thick outer shell with a wet gruel inside. For larger dishes we ordered the okonomiyaki, a sad gelatinous and chewy cake, decorated with pink spots of "seafood," and served with a heaping spoonful of Japanese mayonnaise on the side. The hakke had such a sheen I thought I might be forking into the display. Simply served, it was waxy, dry, and completely lacking flavor. Unless it's a Saturday night and you're stranded in Times Square due to subway floods, gridlock traffic, and are scrambling to find a place to catch the game, I'd say you can pass on Hagi.
