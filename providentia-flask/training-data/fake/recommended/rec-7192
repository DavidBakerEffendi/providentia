I really like market table. The service was attentive, the wait was minimal if any, and the food was amazing. Prices were reasonable. How much better does it get? It's also located in the west village, which you would think would draw a large crowd of people every night, but this is one of those unsung heroes of the dining scene. High ceilings with plenty of leg room to stretch, this restaurant emphasizes fresh ingredients. I came here for brunch and tried the pancakes as well as a quiche. Now I have been to those other brunch places that make you wait three hours to try their maple butter and special bacon, and it's good, yes of course it is, after three hours it better be damn good. However, let's just say you could get amazing food in a relaxed classy atmosphere, and still have enough hours of the day to run errands, go for a jog, pet your dog, and feel good about yourself? Well this is the place to go. Pancakes were fluffy and light. The quiche was amazing, I have never had a better quiche in my entire life. It was cooked perfectly, not too watery and not too dry. I am coming here for dinner, it is on my to do list. In the meantime, I would have loved to give this restaurant four or even three stars to discourage others from coming here, less the wait time increases and it becomes another overhyped restaurant in the city. But I do love market table, it's the steady boyfriend you always wished you had.
