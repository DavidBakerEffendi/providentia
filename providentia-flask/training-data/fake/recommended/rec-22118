A great addition to the hood! The interior has a great layout and a craftsman touch. Our waitress was sweet and articulate. We had the raw Kale salad, grilled asparagus, mac and cheese and of course, corn bread. Everything was great but the clear winner was the asparagus. It's going into our rotation of regular neighborhood jams.
