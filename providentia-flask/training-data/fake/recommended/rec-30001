Excellent steak on a hot stone.  The cuts of meat are so perfect, any diner can grill them briefly on the hot stone and get succulent results, no sauce and just the smallest dash of salt required.  The meat is genuine. Valenca also offers great seafood and wine.  Given the overall quality and value, this Portuguese place easily beats other local steakhouses, including Peter Luger.
