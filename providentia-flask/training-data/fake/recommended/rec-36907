For the ramen purists, Minca is indeed a ramen factory - small restaurant in the lower east side, with many of your classic flavors (miso, shio, shoyu), as well as some custom ones (Minca spicy!), and a lot of noodle options plus additional items for add-on.  Noticeably missing was a tontkotsu white broth option. I liked my noodles as they were served - definitely more chewy than Sapporo midtown, and my broth was great and very consistent.  What left me desiring more from Minca was that my pork felt like it had been produced in a factory.  It was cold, maybe room temperature at best, meaning it had been sitting out.  At least TRY to trick me into thinking it was just cooked by dipping it in the soup, will ya?  Huge shortcoming there.  Otherwise, the price was right at Minca, I liked the simplicity and no hassle, although addons are expensive.
