We got the vegetarian plate and foule and it was plenty of food for two.  This is not the best Ethiopian I've ever had by a long shot, but it was still tasty.  The atmosphere was nice and service was good.  I'd definitely go back to get an inexpensive meal; it's probably the best food at this price in this neighborhood.
