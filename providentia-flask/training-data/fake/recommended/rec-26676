Loved, loved, loved this place! Came here for dinner and was expecting some good comfort food and was not disappointed. Started out with the Kosher dill pickles (good, but too sour and not enough crunch for my tastes) and a side order of mushroom Mac and cheese. The side of Mac and cheese is large enough to be a meal for one! Luckily I was with a friend, which allowed us to order more food. =) My friend ordered the turkey leg entr√©e and I ordered the mushroom gravy smothered chicken. The friend's turkey leg slid off the bone at the touch of a fork. Solid mashed potatoes and the usual cranberry sauce made this a meal that was reminiscent of Thanksgiving. The mushroom gravy smothered chicken was better than I imagined. Fried chicken had a hint of spicy hotness, a crisp outer shell and moist inside. The biscuits were also yummy, but soaked up a lot of the gravy (which made it slightly mushy- not my cup of tea, but didn't detract from the meal). It also came with a side of grits which was good as well. The portions were huge and worth every cent. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and can't wait to revisit!
