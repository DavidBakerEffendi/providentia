We ate at Ulivo on Saturday night.  It was really good food and we enjoyed our meals.  The spiced almonds were very spiced, so make sure you like alot of spices before ordering.  The bread that comes with them is delicious.  Also, the sweet corn side is so incredibly good.  I highly recommend. For entrees I got the Monkfish dish.  I talked to the waitress about this and was telling her how indecisive I was about the Monkfish or the Gnocchi's.  I chose the Monkfish.  I was thinking to go a little lighter rather than a whole plate of pasta.  Well I was sort of wrong because it was a whole plate of pasta with Monkfish mixed in.  Don't get me wrong it was delicious, I was just not prepared for a whole plate of pasta. The dessert was amazing and all we got was the sorbetto.   I recommend this place.  Next time I will get the gnocchi's instead as I have heard it is their signature dish :)
