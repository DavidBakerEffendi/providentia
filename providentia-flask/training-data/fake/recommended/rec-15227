I could get long and eloquent with this review, but I think I'll just stick to the facts. - Dos Segundos is my go-to place for tequila, Mexican food, and group dinners. - Get the Nachos. - Been coming for 3 years, will come for 20 more. - Super casual - Great food, good margaritas, above average rotating draft beer selection. I don't think I've ever had a bad time at Dos. This is one of my favorite hang out and grub down places in Philadelphia.
