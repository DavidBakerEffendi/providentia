Love this place! We've recently moved to the neighborhood, so still are in the exploration stage. Last night we went to OBAO for dinner; had sugar cane skewers (absolutely delicious), lobster pad Thai, dumplings, calamari and desert. Food was full of flavor, not greasy, extremely fresh and just enough spice! Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. Wonderful service and fun decor.
