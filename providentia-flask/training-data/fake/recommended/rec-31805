I went here with a group of about 5 friends about 2 months ago and had a fabulous time. The atmosphere was awesome (the round booth was fun!) and totally loved the photo booth. The service was top notch (our waitress was very attentive and patient). We all loved the steak nachos!! Now....the downside. The food was great, but it didn't blow me away. Â I got chicken enchiladas and it was alright. My friends were a bit turned off by the size of the portions..tiny for the high cost. I would go back...but probably with my husband for a drink and those steak nachos.
