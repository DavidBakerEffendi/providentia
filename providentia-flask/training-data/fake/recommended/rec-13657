Went there with my girl friend this morning.  Did not have to wait too long.  Mins before we were about to finish our drink, we were seated.   We ordered Mac & Cheese with Truffle Oil, Cheddar Grits, Pancakes with Lemon Zest & Ricotta Cheese, Cafeteria Omelet with Cheddar & Wild Mushroom and Blackberry Lemonade.  The dishes were just tasty, service was attentive.  Personally, if I order the omelet next time, I would rather have it runnier, it was cooked to well done this time. Would definitely want to go back to try other items on the menu!
