We did the Cheesesteak taste test, starting at Pat's I had the steak "wit" & provolone. ( added hot sauce ). The meat was good, but the bread was not fresh. Gino's, across the street, was a little better. The roll was fresh, and I liked the cheese wiz. I recommend doing your own taste test, because as you can see, opinions differ widely. Either way you've made it to the "Mecca" of cheesesteaks.
