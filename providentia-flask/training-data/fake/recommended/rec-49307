What is this place ?! It's supposed to be coffee shop / bookstore/little restaurant !!!??! Well guess what you haven't pulled any of it .  I wanted to to because its a locally owned bookstore This is the noisiest bookstore I have ever been too , with less than mediocre books to offer and even blander dishes to serve I had a  mushroom and cheese sandwich and it was cold greasy and tasted ...well edible to describe at best, brought by very cold preoccupied overworked  miserable waitress   !!!!   Never again!!!!
