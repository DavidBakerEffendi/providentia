The food's fantastic and the people are really nice.  Lets clear up misunderstandings.  First, it is a BYO.  If you want to buy wine, there is a state store (open til 9 M-Sat, 5 on Sun) on the 1900 block of Chestnut (walk up 20th street to Chestnut, turn right & go 1-1/2 blocks, it's on the far side of the street).  If you want to buy beer, there is an excellent beer store on north side of the 2000 block of Chestnut, closer to 21st street (same as previous directions, but turn left).  Second, Tues-Thurs & Sun they DO take reservations.  They do NOT take reservations on Fri-Sat.
