I have been to Suppa twice now. Once for brunch with my girlfriend and again for dinner with friends. I was happy with both experiences. The service was attentive and friendly Â without being over bearing. The coffee was good and refills kept coming. The food was good. Portions are not Olive Garden sized which is a good thing and neither are they "on a water diet" sizes either; rather nice middle ground. It's byob and they have wine buckets and corkscrews. Decor is down home eclectic. It all works well which is nice. I keep trying to get my friends to go when they visit.
