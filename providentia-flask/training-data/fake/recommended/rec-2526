Frankford Hall is a hit or miss kind of place. The challenge is, it's usually hit AND miss on each visit as opposed to one or the other. A giant beer garden style warehouse sized joint, it's definitely not where you want to go for gourmet meals. This isn't to say that it isn't tasty food; it's just all German-themed (but not quite German) and kitschy more than filling. In addition to Spetzel and pretzels you have the standard hipster-restaurant french fries with curried ketchup. (I'm actually kind of surprised they didn't go full-hipster and call them pomme frites.) They are known for the aforementioned kitsch and play off of it. There are boxes of "Jumbling Towers" for you to play with (it's generic Jenga), and they serve plastic baggies full of S'mores ingredients that you can roast over a pit fire. The whole thing is designed for the 20-something beer drinker who wants to feel super cool; and there's nothing wrong with that. It can be a ton of fun! What moves into the uneven zone is the attitude of the staff. I have found that if you don't look a certain way you get a good deal of up-and-down looks and a lot less friendliness. This is *NOT* true of *ALL* the staff, and to be perfectly frank(ford) it comes more from the hostesses than the bartenders. I even put this to the test once by arriving separately from a younger super-fashionable friend, and sure enough the hostess was extremely cold to me at first and then warmed up upon realizing who I was there to meet. The bottom line is that if you go to just hang out with friends and don't care what anyone thinks of you, you should have a decent time; but don't expect the time of your life unless you make it that way on your own.
