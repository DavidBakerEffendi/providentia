Food not very tasty. Employees don't speak much English. You place you order and pay and then you stand there and watch the food cooked on big flattop grills which is a very un√†ppetizing thing to see. All the fried food items are precooked and lying around until someone orders them. I would say get master wok or skip the food court entirely.
