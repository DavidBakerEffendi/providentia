In celebration of Bastile Day, we returned (very overdue and we'd be there every week if we lived nearby) for Brunch.  Absolutely delicious!  I had the short rib hash and my husband ordered the steak and eggs.  The meats were perfect - the steak was juicy and had a lovely crisp char.  The short rib hash was like the beef version of pulled pork, but hit with classic French flavors and a hit of star anise.  Best of all - the most perfectly poached eggs we have ever had.  Fantastic! The whites looked like fluffy whipped cream and the unctuous yolks blended beautifully with the steak and hash. I saw a fellow diner ravishing the juicy burger - thinking of how one of those poached eggs would bring the burger's perfection to an obscene level of pleasure.  We arrived early and the place filled up quickly - we lucked out on scoring a table by the west facing windows. Such a gorgeous view! It's a treat to find a fine restaurant that feels so easy and cozy at the same time.  I've fallen in love again!
