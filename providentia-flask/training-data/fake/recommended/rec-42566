Occasionally I crave for a hearty American breakfast and venture out to diners - the true heart of America! Sadly, the true heart can either be bitter or better and you have to risk it to know the reality. I have passed Omega Diner multiple times and had it in my list for a while and finally got a chance to go there this weekend. Our order was fairly simple - coffee, pancakes, home-fries, french toast, and omlette - the standard breakfast fare, which is also a good way to evaluate a joint. The coffee was decent - nothing extraordinary but good to wake us up. The waiter checked our orders and came back with a wrong one - the french toast was wheat and not white - and this even after she herself repeated the order once. The omlette was worse than my office cafeteria food. It felt very eggy and there were way too many vegetables that drowned the taste of the omlette. In addition, it was not seasoned at all, giving the impression fo a salad, wrapped in egg yolk. The home fries were the worst. I usually like the potatoes nicely roasted, with a bit of a char on them. Unfortunately, the home fries were more boiled potatoes than 'fries' as nothing was really fried there. It was bland and tasteless. Pancakes thankfully were a little better. Again not great, but palatable. Much as I wanted to have a cozy diner that I can go to on a drowsy morning, this will not be it. The IHOP nearby has better food than this one.
