We haven't been in years... so we were a little concerned it wasn't going to be as good as we remembered. Alma is still great!!!!!! We went during restaurant week so we thought the menu would be just okay but it was GREAT! The atmosphere is fun, the service is excellent, the food is fresh and wonderful! They know what they are doing!
