'Tex Mex for the Hipsters Experience' If you want the real Tex Mex experience, don't go to Gueros. The food was good but not so much to rave about. The portions were small but inexpensive. Most of the taco dishes had grated cheese instead of the real thing. If you want real cheese, I suggest you order the Quesadilla. If you decided to take a chance...it's a very is small but cute establishment especially if you want a quick bite or order out.
