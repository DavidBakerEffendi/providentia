I've been here a couple times and found it cute, cheap, and friendly, but the food is a bit lackluster. The menu is a mix of burgers, sandwiches, and wraps along with a few heartier options like steaks.  The burgers are pretty good- big, beefy, and filling- but the fries were overdone which made me sad.  The veggie wrap was tasty but had a bit to much balsamic dressing.  Our service was pretty mediocre this past weekend, but I remember it being better in the past. The dark wood pubby feel, the Blue Moon beers, and the perfect location on Church St. are all very charming, but I wasn't blown away.  Maybe if I'd gotten to see some of that jazz I've heard so much about, it would have pushed Halvorson's up to a four star review.
