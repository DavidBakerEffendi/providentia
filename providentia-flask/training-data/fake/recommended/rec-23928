Found this gem on Yelp and after reading several reviews. I figured I needed to check this place out for myself. And my goodness was it amazing! As you walk down the steps to the place you are welcomed with the smells of an Italian bakery and when you open the door you are slapped right in the face with it! The only slap I deem appropriate! I had their chicken milanese panini (at 10am mind you! Time is no restriction at this resturant! Or myself for that matter haha!). It was just perfect. The bread is made in house, traditional crisp panini bread. Not that "yoga mat" material crap everyone is used to! Â I highly recommend it! And their coffee is on point and don't get me started with their baked goods!
