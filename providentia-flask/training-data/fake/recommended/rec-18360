Woohoo! Where else can I get two full meals for $3? As a vegetarian the soups are out of the question, but those gloriously chewy noodles are still fair game. The peanut noodles are a big tangled pile of yum, add some chili oil and you're set with plenty more left for lunch the next day. My carnivorous counterpart has enjoyed many of the soups, but a favorite of his is the duck. A plate full of jellyfish is also a must (personally it looks blech), and at ~$8 it's one of the more expensive dishes on the menu. Cash only, but with these prices that makes perfect sense. Kudos to Nan Zhou for upgrading their space, it's so much larger & cleaner than the original spot.
