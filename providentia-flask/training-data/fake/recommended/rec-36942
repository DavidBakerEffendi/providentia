I don't know about other people but I liked the overall experience of this place. Burgers are cook properly, my med burger didn't fall apart nor was it bloody. Condiments were fresh, fries were tasty. Lived up to its hype. Wait wasn't terribly long, but then again we did come rather early (around 5pm).
