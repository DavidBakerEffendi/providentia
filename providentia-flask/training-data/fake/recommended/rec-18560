For me the mixture of Senegalese, French and Mediterranean cooking blended like this: well done French cooking techniques, savory Senegalese spices, and fresh vegetable flavors. It all complemented each other quite well.   My favored dish was chosen by my Date. It was fish which is an important staple of Senegal due to its location near the Atlantic Ocean. The fish came with fresh lemon on the side. As well as, pieces of lemon that had been stuffed throughout the roasted fish.I later read, this is characteristically Senegalese.The fish was served with roasted green and red peppers on top. This culminated in a taste bursting with succulent fish,  fresh lemons and vegetables. Complemented by the fresh Senegalese spices.  I had the beef special dish which came with a classic french Wine sauce that went towards the sweet side. Then it was contrasted with savory herbs. I  found it delicious.  Very interesting place and  I recommend it quite highly.
