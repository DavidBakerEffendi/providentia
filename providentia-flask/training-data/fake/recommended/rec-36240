It's been a few weeks ago since I was in NYC, and I can't believe I almost forgot to write a Yelp review on this phenomenal restaurant.  I really was pleasantly surprised when my friend or pseudo-date agreed to take me here for lunch.   Another friend actually recommended this place to me, who told me that it's difficult to get in without a reservation and that it was expensive with authentic Japanese sushi chefs and most likely the best sushi place near grand central station where my date's office is.  My date initially suggested Bobby Flay's restaurant... which I would have been totally fine with, but my other friend wanted to test my date... knowing that my most favorite type of food, hands down is sushi. It was raining that day when he picked me up; my last day in the city which dampened my mood a bit, but when he said lets go wherever you want and told the cab guy the address of Sushi Yasuda, it immediately put a big smile on my face.   Well the decor of the place was modern with light wood; quite stale not warm or romantic, but definitely gears to the business clients in suits.  The sushi bar was decent size with a Japanese sushi chef in front of nearly each seat.  Our chef spoke very little English, but somehow we got by.  Everything we ate was purely amazing.  Each and every fish was incredibly fresh and delicious.  My favorite was the Uni and Toro as always:)   It was also cool that it was like we had our very own sushi chef catering to all our needs.  He wouldn't let us order a bunch of stuff at one time, because he wanted us to savor the sashimi or  sushi that was immediately in front of us before asking us for our next order.  And the recommended sake was just as fabulous!   On normal circumstances, I would not come here on my own because I couldn't afford to spend as much as he spent for just lunch.  SO I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience dining here thanks to my friend.
