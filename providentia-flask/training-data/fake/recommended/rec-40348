Came here for a birthday dinner and I was a bit disappointed. Had high expectations on their food but sadly it wasn't up to par. The service was great. Our waiter had great humor. We had ordered the skirt steak which was very dry and bland. Also ordered the paella. Majority of the table ordered the paella to see how tasty it would be. The rice was very mushy and rissotto like. The lobster served on the paella looked and tasted like its been frozen and defrosted. Looked really soggy. I'm not sure if it was just that day or it usually just tastes that way. For appetizers we ordered the camarones. This wasnt so bad. It was three jumbo shrimps on top of two onion rings on a small smear of avocado. Had two pitchers of the sangria since we were a large group. It didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was premade and just poured into the pitchers. I hope the next time we visit, the food proves my review wrong.
