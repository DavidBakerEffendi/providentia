Came here for happy hour and enjoyed everything I had.  I went with the happy hour grenache, which was pretty tasty.  The waiter was helpful in making my wine selection.  For food I had the eggplant and mozzarella sandwich, which was really good.  The portion size was just right, not too small but also not too large and heavy.  Overall this is definitely a solid happy hour spot.
