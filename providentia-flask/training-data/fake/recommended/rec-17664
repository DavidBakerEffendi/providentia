Loud, Noisy, Obnoxious Loud, Obnoxious Noisy, Great pizza, Awful Uninterested table staff, decent other food, did I mention loud. You're much better off with the bartenders than the table staff. Good place for a cold beer and pizza, with ear plugs......... The same goes for their Fairfield location.
