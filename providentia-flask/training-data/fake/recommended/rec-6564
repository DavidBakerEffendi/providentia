My idea of breakfast is Honey Bunches of Oats.  If I choose to have breakfast, that is.  Or if I'm feeling fancy and/or rich, I'll have some toast with lox, cream cheese, capers, and red onions.  My idea of brunch is... nonexistent. I also used to think "having brunch" was pretentious. Or maybe I was just being defensive of my laziness on Saturdays.  My friends would wake up at 10am and get ready to "go to brunch" and I would think to myself, "ludicrous! I'm waking up at noon at ordering myself a cheesesteak or some pho..." *SNOOZE* Then one day my BF had the crazy idea of "going to brunch."  He told me to find a place and be there by 12:30pm.  Oh, gawd.  This means I have to wake up at 11am latest to get ready for brunch.  I mass-texted a bunch of my brunchin' friends and they all said the same thing, "Café Orlin."  So off I went. Line was long, I was cold and hungry and sleepy, BF was too excited and all dressed up.  The wait wasn't too bad and seemed to all be part of the brunchin' experience.  We go in, I think to myself, "the place is definitely cute enough for brunch," he orders steak & eggs and I order smoked salmon with poached eggs.  Major brunch-flavor-explosion in my mouth ensues.  What the other Yelpers have been saying is true, my friends.  Orlin does brunch right. If I can learn to brunch, you can too, and you should start at Café Orlin.
