This place is frequented by the OG Vietnamese, as compared to Nam Phuong and the other Vietnamese strips along Washington Ave that have become more mainstream. The restaurant is deceptively...dingy. Okay, maybe it's really just dingy. But the food is tasty and delicious so it's worth putting up with the change in atmosphere. It's not like eating at a restaurant; it's more like visiting a family friend or eating at home. We ordered the banh canh cua - Â noodle soup (the thick noodles) with crabmeat (REAL crabmeat!); banh xeo - Vietnamese crepe, and thit heo kho to (braised pork in clay pot). Everything was really flavorful and the servings were much bigger than you'd get at other restaurants. If it's your first time trying Vietnamese food, I'd recommend you visit Nam Phuong first. But if you're accustomed to it and are looking for something more homey, this place is awesome and very reasonably priced.
