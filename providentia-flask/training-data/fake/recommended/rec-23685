I am in town for a conference and looked forward to being able to get whatever kind of ethnic food I wanted. Having lived in ATL, I got used to this, but Las Vegas is an entirely different city, food-wise. I had pizza from Giannfranco's (eh), Indian 2x at Minar's Palace (OMG YUM), and Dinics (overrated). Last dinner of the trip, looked like my best option was Sahara Grill. Next time, I will venture into Chinatown and the Italian Market parts of town. Anyway, I am Lebanese and grew up eating my grandmas and then my moms Lebanese cooking, which was fabulous. As an adult, I learned that Middle Eastern Restaurants wont quite match up, but thats fine they can still be great. I ordered 2 sides of kibbe, 1 hummus and some yogurt. The kibee was very good -- it is the fried football-shaped variety, not baked. I believe that it is made with a hint of cinnamon (like my aunt makes). I prefer baked non-cinnamon, but this was still really good. I slathered the (bagged) bread with yogurt, plopped on a couple pieces of kibbe, and went to town. The hummus was delicious too. Based on all that, I feel comfortable recommending this place. If I came back to Philly and stayed in the Market East area again, I would go back and eat in.
