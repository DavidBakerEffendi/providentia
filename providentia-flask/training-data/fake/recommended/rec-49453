This place is quite a few blocks away from the nearest subway. I went here on a quest for a great noodle soup but left disappointed. The tasty hand-pulled noodles were not tasty. It was just okay and I've had better and didn't have to walk far away either! The broth was weak, the noodles were okay. Nothing special. Their tables were nasty, seems like they never wiped them, nor their glass door.
