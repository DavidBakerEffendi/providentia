Pretty disappointed with my experience here. The menu was extremely limited and over-priced, and even though we visited early on a Sunday evening, service was quite slow. Our water glasses sat empty for long stretches at a time, prompting my dining companions to request more water several times. Our server was polite but mumbled and was very inarticulate and unhelpful when we inquired about certain menu items. In addition, the tomato salad we had was an odd amalgamation of chopped bits of sub-par plum tomatoes, complete with pieces of core. It wasn't seasoned at all either, and didn't seem to go along with the random few soybeans and pieces of basil.
