We have gotten take outs from here ~10 times, although have not eaten inside. It is definitely better and the food quality more consistent than the other Chinese restaurants in Orange and West Haven. We like the Taiwanese beef noodles, Taiwanese braised pork rice, spicy beef tripe appetizer, and the twice cooked pork.
