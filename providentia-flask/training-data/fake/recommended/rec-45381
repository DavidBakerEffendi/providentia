A wonderful place! Fabulous simple italian food done perfectly. Great warm atmosphere with perfect lighting. We had a party of six and we all felt it was a really special place- most of us had the housemade rigatoni with bolognese, my mom had the whole brook trout and we all had the chocolate pudding with olive oil and sea salt which was to die for. The roasted brussel sprouts and the canneloni beans and escarole were also great. Good beers and wine list- and it looked like they knew what they doing in the cocktail department. Go and enjoy!
