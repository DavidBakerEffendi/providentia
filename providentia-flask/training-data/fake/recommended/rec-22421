Uncle Willie's has reopened on Saw Mill Road in West Haven. I patronized the place quite a bit when it was in Orange, but found the New Haven place depressing and out-of-the-way. I'm happy it's back (and I heard others there saying the same). The meat really is very good (pulled pork is great) and prices are quite reasonable. The people who run it are friendly and (as has been written) dedicated to their craft. I went with friends who ordered the hamburger (didn't like it steamed) or the chicken (didn't like it) or whatever and I admit that I sometimes felt there was unevenness in the sides, but the meat was always splendid. There is nothing else like it in Southern Connecticut. If you like real barbecue, try the pork!
