A super unique restaurant with yummy food!  My kids and I went for a late lunch and enjoyed the food - they even have brushes for the kids to "paint" the ketchup on their burgers!  I had the BALT (bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato) sandwich and it was wonderful! The reason for my rating is because Max Brenner's is all about chocolate so of course my kids ordered shakes, one chocolate, another strawberry white chocolate.  They weren't cheap and they weren't very good.  They were more like very cold, slightly frozen chocolate milk and the strawberry one had a funny "dry" feel to it, a little grainy.  I appreciated them as an adult but I can understand why the kids didn't care for them. Go for the food, careful on the chocolate!
