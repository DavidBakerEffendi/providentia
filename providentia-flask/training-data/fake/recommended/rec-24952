Updating my review since they now open early for World Cup games! Awesome! This restaurant is very good but I think they are still working out some kinks.   First the pros.  The space is absolutely gorgeous; you can tell how much thought went into each detail, from the murals on the wall to the fact that they painted the exposed HVAC pipes a beautiful coppery brown.  Even their bar stools are gorgeous.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  My husband and I got two very large, good beers for only $11 and the food on the limited menu is also reasonable.   The fried pickles ($2) are really good; they're cut into spears rather than discs so you're not eating so much breading.  The pretzels are also great and filling, and their grainy spicy mustard is amazing. My friend was craving food from the regular restaurant menu so he ordered it next door and they let him bring it into the bierhalle.   Now the cons.  A bunch of my friends and I went there for the USA-Portugal World Cup game.  There weren't too many people there when we got there around 5:15, but the service was still slow and got slower as it became more crowded.  There was no waitress (which I didn't understand because we'd been there a few weeks ago and we had a waitress).  We gave our orders directly to the cook, who I credit for keeping cool under what seemed like a lot of pressure.  However, when the food was done, this one guy who I think was a busboy brought the food to each table asking if any of us ordered it.  He was very nice but you could tell he was stressed.  There was only one bartender.  I also give them credit for asking everyone to line up to order beer so that there was at least an orderly process. They made the best of it. I will definitely be back, but I hope the service gets worked out by then.  It was definitely a good time.  There was a good crowd and the owner was blowing a vuvuzela when the US scored, which added to the atmosphere.
