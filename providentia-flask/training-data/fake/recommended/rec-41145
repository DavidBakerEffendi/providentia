I am probably not going to write anything that's not been said here, but here goes. Atmosphere: crowded. Line forms through a bar. We found a seat at the bar and were jammed in. Beers: Cheap McSorley's (2.50) but small glasses. Food: fries have mass-produced quality. Burger was v. good: smallish, soft bun, juicy. I got bacon and cheese and the bacon was possibly a bit overcooked, but I didn't care because the meat was so juicy and tasty. Based on its general appearance, pieces of meat on the bar, etc, I worry about the cleanliness of this place, but I have not gotten sick.
