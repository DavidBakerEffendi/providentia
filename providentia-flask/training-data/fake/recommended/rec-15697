Went awhile ago and was so unexcited that I actually forgot to write the review. Needless to say, mundane brunch place and completely overhyped. Had very boring omelette that I could've made better at home and friends had the salmon eggs Benedict or something similar - also not a party in the mouth...anyway, definitely not worth the 1h wait.
