Disclaimer: I've not had much Ramen, so I'm no expert. I got the salt ramen, and it was really tasty,the pork was great, and the noodles were light. However it was just too expensive. Honestly how much could it have cost them to make some noodles with some pork and a few veggies, like $1? Priced at $8, there are much better lunch options. Drop the price to $5 and you easily have a 4 star place. It seems every review mentions the fact it's over priced.
