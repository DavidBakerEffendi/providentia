El Rey did a good job of turning the old diner into a kitchy looking m Mexican place, but the food does not deliver for the price.  The guacamole was sub par for a whopping $10 and they charge $3.50 for chips and salsa!  The chicken enchiladas were about a 3 out of 5. I say if you are looking for good Mexican food tonstick with your neighborhood cantina in passyunk east or northern liberties where the chips and salsa are free, the margaritas are potent, and you get more bang for your buck with the food. If you just want good Mexican food (and don't care about atmosphere) go to El Jarocha at 13th and Ellsworth!.
