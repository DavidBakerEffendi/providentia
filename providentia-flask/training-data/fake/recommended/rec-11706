I know a lot of reviewers here say this is even better than Ippudo...which was part of what led me to try this place out, and I'm going to put it out there right now: It's not as good as Ippudo. It probably boils down to personal preference. Totto's ramen soups are all chicken based, which is a deviance from the norm (generally, it's more pork based) and interesting, but it doesn't have that...creamy, "fatty" feel to it. I got the Mega Ramen, which was delicious and incredibly filling, so you're getting a good amount of food for your money. Protip: Go about 10-15 minutes before they open for an early dinner. Put your name down. You'll be in there in a flash. In general, I find that doing your research about wait times are popular restaurants pay off. You KNOW this place will have a line. Beat the line. Beat the crowd. You win.
