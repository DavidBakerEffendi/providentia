Turkish food tuned for spice-sensitive palates in a nice colorful setting with casual atmosphere and accommodating service. If you have visited Istanbul, or any point east of Italy, and like lamb or middle eastern spices & flavors, then this place is definitely not for you. The food lacks authenticity,  is "toned down" for a spice-sensitive palate, and doesn't represent much of what Turkish food is known for (cumin, corriander, cloves, cinnamon,  etc.). The eggplant appetizer tastes bland, the bread a couple days old, sheppard salad is made with hard wooden tomatos, and a iskender kabab is nothing more than tomato soup poured on a tasteless pile of gyros meat that tastes little like the real thing. Having had lamb kebab on the streets of Istanbul, I can assure you this is not it - even the German version of doner in Cologne has more flavor!  If you desire good middle eastern foods, venture over to Ravagh in the 60's - it is authentic and has the crispy texture that a real kebab has when it comes hot off the charcoal - give it a try and never look back... Only saving grace was the Croatian Manager who was thoughtful enough to try to re-make our plate, with similar results - even hot, the food lacked flavor and authenticity.  Waitress was equally thoughtful, but hard to correct for poor food. Thank you guys - an extra star for trying!
