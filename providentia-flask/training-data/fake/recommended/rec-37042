First time there tonight and must I say it was amazing! I started with gluten free bread which I usually don't like bread but I was starving so I ate both little pieces. Then I had a Caesar salad without the bread crumbs and the cheese was so tasteful with the perfect amount of dressing. Then I had the gluten free tortellini with butternut squash. I haven't had pasta in such a long time that I forgot how good it is! I've made some at home but this tasted so flavorful and cooked to the tea. Before I realized I hadn't taken a picture my dish was all gone. I ended my meal with the gluten free red velvet cake and a scoop of ice cream. It was so good! Four stats only because I was hoping for a larger menu but I think they might have a menu for every night.
