I've been coming here for several years because of the high quality, delicious food and the wonderful staff! The owner, her daughter, and the waiters/waitresses are always extremely lovely to talk to and very accommodating. Their pi√±a colada and Thai iced tea are quite tasty if you're one for specialty drinks. The Aroma sampler is a great appetizer that combines some of the best dishes and accompanying sauces (particularly the oh so delicious paper shrimp). My two favorite main dishes are chicken mee siam and pineapple fried rice (with shrimp, chicken, and cashews). I usually choose medium spice, as I enjoy a bit of hotness but don't want the other flavors to be overpowered. (You can choose no spice, mild spice, medium, or hot). Mango mousse is an awesome dessert choice, though the fried ice cream is also quite yummy. Ah, now I'm craving some Thai! They used to bring you hot towels to clean your hands and complimentary sauce and "chips" (not exactly sure if that's the proper term, but they were a nice addition to the meal). Not sure why they stopped that practice; ah well. (PS: different days of the week offer various deals - I believe Wednesdays are 1/2 off for women and Thursdays are 1/2 off for seniors).
