3.5, rounded up to 4 for a very special reason - Iron Chef House is single-handedly responsible for making me like raw fish. I used to be a simple "sushi" girl. I'd either get cali rolls or shrimp tempura. Basically, the fake sushi. I came here with a friend. Atmosphere is somewhat typical - low lighting, kind of modern asian looking. We sat down, she ordered a tuna appetizer with ponzo sauce, avocado, and mango. She got it. She told me to eat Â it - and I did so, very hesitantly. I loved the thing!!! I get cravings for it all the time now. Also, when talking to a few friends in the neighborhood, oddly enough, it turns out they all get cravings for this dish. It really is special. A bit busy, but amazing. I've since come back several times and tried various sushis. They have all been for the most part, very good, with the exception of the scallop - it was pretty terrible and rubbery. A word of warning. Service here is almost invariably crap, especially when you come at lunch, when it's emptier. There are a few waitresses who literally will come back every 2 minutes to ask your order, and I've had to be bitchy to a couple of them so I had a second to look at the menu and have time to decide what I want.
