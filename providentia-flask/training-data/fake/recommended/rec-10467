The Greek is just starting out to be fair, but they have a long way to go! Service was inconsistent: at first we had at least one server, but as the meal progressed we had to ask for bread several times, desert menu twice, and waited for a falsely advertised desert for 20 minutes. It also seemed like all of the wait staff were inexperienced, for example: chicken came out and we were still sitting with butter knives, we had to ask for heftier cutlery. All of the waiters were apologetic... no need to apologize, just be consistently attentive. Food: Tasty food, small portions however. For desert we ordered the "halva" - this was not halva by any standard definition. Halva is a sesame-based desert, this tasted like a toasted couscous w/honey sorta deal, served with white chocolate. Maybe this is greek "halva"? The food was the best part of the experience, as it should be, but I think the portion sizes need to be more clearly communicated (the appetizer portion of the Grilled Octopus w/ bacon vinaigrette came with 3 small pieces of grilled octopi) Music: too loud, too obnoxious. At one point "I'm Turning Japanese" came on - the playlist was essentially a "Shitty Top 40s List from the 80s". I'd suggest going to Pandora and typing in Shuggie Otis and let that play for the night Alcohol: Need a better beer selection - they have 2 beers in bottles: Alfa and Heineken - they are essentially the same beer by taste. Not sure about wine or liquor selection, though. I probably won't go back unless I see improving reviews
