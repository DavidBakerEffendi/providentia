One of the few places I actually enjoy coming after a long day working in retail on South St. I tend to be one of those bar loners after work, mostly because all I wanna do is decompress and shove some food in my face, and Mom's never fails to deliver. Half price drafts during happy hour rocks my world (as does the late night happy hour from 10-11, thanks for looking out for the retail crowd!). Their food is hella pricey for what it is but their weekly food specials more than make up for it (dolla tacos? 3 dolla veggie burgs? Hell yeah!). Definitely a great place to grab happy hour with friends or solo and if you've got a bigger crowd for the night, head upstairs for some pool or chill on the comfy couches. Knocking off a star because I never order food on any day that isn't Monday-Thursday, but catch their food specials and you'll be in a good place.
