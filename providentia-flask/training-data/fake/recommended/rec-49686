Omg. This place was awesome. Went before catching a show at the nederlander. Everything tastes fresh and home Made. It's not your typical 9th ace Thai joint. The duck stew was aromatic and awesome. The crispy duck with eggplant was spicy and awesome. The prices are great too! Only drawback is that they do not offer appetizers. However the entree was huge. So we def didn't need them.
