We stopped in here for lunch today, and it was good but not great. Granted, neither of us had their famous burger, so perhaps that was the problem. I had the chicken sandwich, and the chicken breast was cooked perfectly. But the roll was a little hard, and every time I took a bite, the whole chicken breast fell out. There also was an over abundance of cheese on it, and this is coming from someone who loves cheese! My husband had the veggie burger and said it wasn't one of the better renditions of a veggie burger he had ever eaten. We also got the duck fat fries with cheese sauce and they were delicious! They pretty much gave this place all 3 stars I gave it! They were perfectly crispy, and the cheese sauce was a great compliment to them. Overall a good experience, but like I said already, not great.
