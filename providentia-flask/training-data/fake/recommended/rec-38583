I love me some street meat. This Halal Cart is not to be missed. The combo plate Chicken and Lamb was all that. What they do right as other carts don't is the lack of gristle and weird chewy stuff. The new MoMA is across the street and I had a celeb sighting here. the main dude the one that was tied to the mattress from "The Hangover" was in the area.
