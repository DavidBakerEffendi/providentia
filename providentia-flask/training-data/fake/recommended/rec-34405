Fly by the seat of your pants and parked our butts here. Tuesday night at 7:30 and it was packed. Service was slow to get anything, but u know what? It didn't matter! Incredible Rocket Salad and Margherita Pizza. The crust was unlike anything I had ever had! Asked about the crust and I was fortunate enough to get a personalized tour of the "dough room". The owner is extremely proud of his place and you can tell he uses only the best ingredients. I learned a lot!
