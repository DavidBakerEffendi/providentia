Why yes, Virginia, there is a way to eat deep-fried flatbread and feel classy about it. Sweet gluttony, thy name is Eurotrip. So I made reservations here for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago. (Previously, I'd only had drinks at their bar.) They were amazing. My peeps and I showed up at our appointed time, and before I could even approach someone to ask about my reservation, a smiling waitress approached me and asked if I was Stephanie. Right on. Really, it only got better from there. Amazingly attentive service to our group, Â massive $3 Weihenstephans happening that night (my fav, coincidentally), some seriously bitchin' aforementioned Hungarian flatbread and a complimentary birthday dessert on the house. Badass mini-trip to the depths of Europe, indeed.
