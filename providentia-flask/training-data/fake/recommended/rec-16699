Great Mexican food! And they expanded their space, hopefully this doesn't have the Koy effect on me. So the main dishes are delish. Try the chicken mole burrito, sooo good. The quesadillas are good too! The tacos and the tamales are not good so stay away, thats what kept me from the 5 stars! Oh and its pretty cheap! Go ,eat, get fat, they have more room to fit you!
