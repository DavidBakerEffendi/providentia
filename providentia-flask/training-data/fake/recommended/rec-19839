Went for brunch today. Even when you make reservations, be prepared to wait a bit.  This is a nondescript bourbon bar.  Menu is a little over-priced with entrees ranging from $12-24 and drinks from $8-10.  Food was good, but not tastebud-blowing.  I had the goat cheese red pepper omelette, but the egg was more rubbery flat than fluffy.  The roasted potatoes were nice and crispy and the homemade hot sauce was flavorful, though lacking kick.  My $4 buttermilk biscuit side took the form of cornbread and was tiny.  Skip the fried cheese and meat appetizers...they are bland and meant more for curing hangovers.  The best thing going here are the courteous servers, and that will keep me coming back.
