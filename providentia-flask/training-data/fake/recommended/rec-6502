Definitely stands out amidst all the many local thai restaurants! With the chandelier, you feel like you're at a fancy restaurant. The servers are also generally very kind. Thai tea: generous portion served in a very tall glass as though you've ordered an alcoholic beverage Spicy tuna salad: Delicious! Reminds me why I love thai salads so much - the unique dressing they use on their salads is delicious-- and Room Service gets it just right! Pad see ewe: Perfection combination of sweetness/saltiness. I love! Would recommend Room Service's normal pad thai (not their expensive specialty one which I have yet to try) above Q2Thai, Breezy Thai, Wondee Siam, or Yum Yum. Yes, I've tried all those other thai restaurants. Honey pork chop: Very generous portions size here as well. A humungous pork chop (see uploaded photo) Blackened fish: Good and the mango goes great with the fish. Would go here and eat this dish again. I love the booth on the right corner in the back of the restaurant. Too bad it's tough to ever be seated there-- this place is very packed! I'd like to return for their lunch specials. Only $7.90/$6.90! Also, reservations are only taken for parties of 6 or more.
