I am always skeptical when I see a high rated sandwich place in NYC because 80% of the sandwiches in the US are bad. Greasy food, bad bread, plain cheese (gouda, cheddar, etc...) and boring meat like turkey, chicken, etc... Anyhow, to win my heart with a sandwich it has to be french or italian lol And this place did the job today!!!!! It is a small fine epicerie that does sandwiches, as simple as this. It has the 3 components you need: amazing french or itzalian bread, great meat option and cheeses of course. I couldn't resist to order the #20, the famous smoked duck, brie and cornichons. it is like heaven! All sandwiches are about $10 give or take for full size. Working few blocks away, it may be my new spot.
