I came here about two months ago with a group of six people. We had reservations and were seated right away in the back room. While the back room is nice and private, I feel like we were an afterthought to the rest of our server's section. The food came out quickly, but then we never saw our server again. I would have liked more dressing for my $17 salad, but I was never asked. I had to go out and ask for the check for the group and then I had to deliver it to the server after waiting quite some time. The food was good, but with tax and tip I paid $22 for a salad I could have eaten in 6 bites (not including my wine).
