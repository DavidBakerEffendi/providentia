Wow. We stopped here on the way to the airport before my flight back to LA. Considering that upon entering, you're welcomed with caution signs plastered on the door to not leave anything in your car, Â and the B rating sign in the door, my expectations weren't too high. Goodness, I was so pleasantly wrong. This might be the best curry I've ever had! I ordered the curry egg noodles dish... INCREDIBLE! Full of wonderful, mouth-watering flavors. My boyfriend ordered another noodle dish which we both thought was good, but he loved my curry noodles! It's an orgy in your mouth. I've dreamt about this curry everyday since. Too bad this place isn't in LA. Heavy sigh. I've got to say, I'd go back in a heartbeat despite the creepy caution signs on the door.
