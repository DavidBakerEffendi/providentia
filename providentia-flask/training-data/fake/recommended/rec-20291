The space and decor is really beautiful!  I almost felt underdressed for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  The tables a bit too close but heck its NYC thats whats expected! My friend did all the ordering since he apparently is a regular here but I must say all his choices were YUUUMMYY! Assorted Golden Fritters (yes the mama of appetizers), Spicy Basil fried rice, Pad Roasted Cashew Nut dish,  Basil Eggplant.   Really nice cocktails and no room for dessert!
