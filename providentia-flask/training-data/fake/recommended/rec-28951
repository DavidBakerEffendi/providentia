Cantina dos segundos was a great fund to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The food was delicious.  I had mahi mahi tacos, guacamole and tortilla chips with two different types of salsa.  Everything was really tasty.  The waitress was really friendly and their spicy margarita with cucumber and Halapeno is certainly to be recommended.
