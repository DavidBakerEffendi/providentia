We had such a wonderful meal here last night. The service is absolutely fantastic, and the food and drinks are awesome as well. We spent the whole night saying how it was a 5-star experience, but unfortunately dessert knocked off a star. We started with 2 cocktails (the Harvest and the Deep South). The drinks were so incredible, particularly the Deep South. I had the Harvest last time and thought it was better then, but still good the second time, too. We got the jambalaya special - phenomenal. Perfectly cooked blackened shrimp. Yum! I got the mac n cheese for my entree - small but rich enough that a small portion was great for my main course. It was INCREDIBLE. Bf got the burger because it was so good last time and again, it didn't disappoint. Fries were a bit soggy, but burger was awesome. We finished our meal with the whoopie pie dessert, which was a disappointment in my book. The fudge cookies were just SO fudgy they were overwhelming (and I didn't taste the filling at all). Again, I can't stress how great the service is here, and the food is just awesome. Their prices are very reasonable as well. I don't think we'd order dessert next time given that we've been disappointed in both of our desserts so far, but we can't wait to go back!
