I've been going into the city for the past 4 years and in that time, I have been able to try all of the finer cheesesteak establishments this great city has to offer. This being said, Geno's Steaks has never disappointed. The slabs of beef, combined with fried onions, and cheese whiz all on a delicious amoroso roll allows this cheesesteak haven to bypass Pat's, John's, Steve's, or any other of the hundreds of local steak sandwhich purveyors. If this is your first time in the city, this place is a can't miss.
