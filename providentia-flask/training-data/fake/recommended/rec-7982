I agree that West Callowhill is in dire need of more places to hang out.  There are plenty of spots popping up all over the Fairmount area, this particular portion of street is like a big concrete blank spot next to the awesomeness of Sabrinas.  Kite and Key is the first (of the more I'm sure will come) decent drinking spots over there.  We sat outside, which is slightly tainted by the emptiness of the rest of the neighborhood.  It was nice out, though, and the service was fast, friendly, and likeable.  Beers were cold and delicious, as was the wine.  My girlfriend and I tend to severely judge bar food on the basis of wings and calamari.  Two staples of the happy hour appetizer experience and no place of business should have any real excuse for not perfecting such traditional staples.  We went with the wings for our first visit.  The big complaint about them is that they are those creepy full body wings that look like fried bats.  I'm a carnivore, but it just skeevs me out to break apart the joints of a chicken.  And the celery was the type you would pass over if you were shopping for it.  It was obviously old and poorly stored.  It's mostly garnish, but....  My shrimp po'boy was pretty damn delicious, minus the overabundance of mayonnaise, and the gnocci was worth trying.  I caught a glimpse of the inside on my way to the bathroom and the interior looked nice.  I think once they iron out some of their shortcomings and get some company on West Callowhill to create a little street life and ambiance, Kite and Key will be a really good time.
