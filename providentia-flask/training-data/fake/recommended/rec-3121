Stopped by during lunch for their grand opening. Waited half an hour before being seated. There is currently no take out, makes sense since you want the burger the moment it's ordered. Had the Umami burger - darn good! only thing I liked here Truffle burger - the burger was cooked almost perfectly, not very charred (well it is the first day, let's see how long they can maintain their consistency), but i was not a fan of the truffle taste tuna burger - wasn't anything special truffle fries - too salty for my taste, like I said I'm not big on the truffle taste smash potatoes - this was okay tater tot - was given a tater tot while waiting on line, not a fan Great great service! I would only come back here for the Umami burger!
