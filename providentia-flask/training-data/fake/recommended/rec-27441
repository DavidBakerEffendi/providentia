I was craving guacamole and came across great reviews for Barrio Chino so decided to go check it out with my husband. The ambiance was super cute, but the positive review ends there. The guacamole came out very watery. My pollo tacos had the after taste of dog food (not trying to be dramatic, but that's all I can think to compare it to). It seemed as though they threw in some scraped up pieces of meat from a dirty grill. Very disappointed in my meal and definitely will not be returning.
