My choice for my pre-race dinner before the Philadelphia Marathon was Banana Leaf.  Sure, an Italian pasta carbo-load may be more traditional, but I wanted Malaysian instead. We were seated near the front of the restaurant, near the cash register, so we didn't have the best table, but at least we didn't have to wait.  I was really craving roti, so we got the Roti Canai as a starter.  It didn't disappoint.   We also got the Poh Piah, which was tasty, but not as good as the roti, in my opinion.  For our main dish we shared the Thai Basil Noodles.  It were spicier than I was expecting, so I couldn't eat too much. For dessert we got the Banana Pancake.  Delicious!  I could have eaten the whole dish myself. I enjoyed our meal, and the service was excellent.  Our waters were refilled without asking several times.  I think I liked Penang just a bit better though, especially the atmosphere.  But you really can't go wrong eating at Banana Leaf.
