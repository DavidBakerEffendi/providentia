As someone that usually goes for quantity over quality, I was pleasantly surprised at Perry Street.  Along with two friends we had the 3 course meal on a relatively quiet Monday night.  Starting with our amazing pumpkin soup to start then right into a beet salad.  I was already happy!  Then the main course of a veggie plate which was something for me at other restaurants is a horror.  The plate consisted of carrots, amazing mashed potatoes, etc.  A great selection of wines and the staff was great.  I would definitely go back there with family and special occasions/night out.  The food was amazing.
