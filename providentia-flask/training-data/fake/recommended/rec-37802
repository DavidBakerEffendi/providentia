Talula's garden is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Philadelphia. Not only is the food here absolutely delicious, the atmosphere is wonderful. Even though this restaurant is located in downtown Philadelphia when you are sitting in the garden, you instantly forget that. The outside seating is enclosed on the side of the restaurant, compete with plants and lights all around. You really do feel as if you are in a garden.  I can't think of any other place in Philadelphia with nicer outdoor seating. It's definitely worth the extra wait to sit outside. Once you get over the great atmosphere of the garden, the food here will continue to impress you. Everything that we ordered was cooked to perfection and extremely inventive with interesting sauces that added something extra to the meal without being to overpowering. When we arrived the waiter recommended that me and my boyfriend each get one small plate and then one entree. We decided to not listen to his advice and share a small plate and then each get our own entree and we found this to be more than enough food.   I had the sea bass, It was just the right amount of crispy and then topped off with sauces. My boyfriend ordered the chicken entree, which was very tender. Both entrees came topped with fresh vegetables. As for drinks, the white wine sangria is delicious, and the fresh fruit in the sangria is always a nice touch!
