So, I went here twice in a week. Both times, my pizza was spectacular, the service friendly, and fast. I had 4 different pizzas and they were just fantastic: I was amazed how fast they came out from the kitchen, and enjoyed the vibe of the place. The service? friendly, not pushy; The toppings? delicious, fresh and interesting. I spoke to the owner both times and he clearly loves his business. The crust on the pizza? spot on.
