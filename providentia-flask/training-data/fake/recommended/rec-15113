Really good cheesesteak for the first time there. Not going to Tony Luke's anymore after we were recommended this place. It's dining area is small but still worth the food. We got the rest shops time in day because a line was formed all the way to the door after we ordered our food. Good was coined fast and delicious. Taking all family visitors to this spot from now on.
