I really like this place. The customer service was great. The restaurant is very cute and casual. The only thing I didn't like very much is how the tables are way too close to each other, it kind seemed like we were having dinner with the couple next to us.. BUT the food was great and inexpensive. I had a Lasagna, that really tasted delicious for 16$, and my friends a Margarita pizza 12$. I would definitely go back!
