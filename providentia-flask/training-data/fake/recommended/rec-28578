Great atmosphere with excellent brunch options. Creative menu and wonderful service as well. I ordered the southern biscuit sandwich (chicken, bacon, egg and cheese) with cheese grits. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and pancakes. We both loved our meals. This place is a solid option for brunch. Also, do not be scared off by the wait. We were told that the wait would be 40 minutes and we only waited 11 minutes on a Saturday afternoon shortly after 12pm.
