A casual laid back bar and restaurant in the heart of Roosevelt Island.  Staff is very friendly, especially the owners who we've met several times on visits to the restaurant - very personable.  Weekday happy hours are buy one get one any drink until 7pm.  On weekends they offer a nice brunch and you can sit outside.  The scenery outside is lovely - a small park and city view.  If you are a sports fan, they have lots of big TV's and they offer game day pitcher specials.  The noise level can get loud sometimes, but fun crowd.
