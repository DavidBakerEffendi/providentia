After the Village Vanguard, we rolled by just to see what the wait was (despite our enormous late lunch at Ben's only 6 hours earlier).  At 10:40, they said maybe an hour, but we had a glass of great mulled wine (okay, two) at the bar (which had a nice pepper under kick) (surprisingly good), and we had a table by 11:10.  You have to love how everyone in New York goes out so late.  The place was hopping.  I opted for real gastropub fare:  calves' liver.  I know:  I like all of that weird New York food.   No one will eat it with me, and when I'm out with the b.f., we share everything, so things like liver aren't in the picture.  But at the risk of alienating my vegan dining companion, I ordered it, and it was great.  There were lots of things on the menu I'd order, and I'll definitely go back, knowing that late night really is the way to do it.
