This is not the place for vegetarians or people with food allergies.  As our party contained both, we explained to the waitstaff that we could not, under any circumstances, be served anything containing fish, meat, or egg.   However, when our vegetarian spring rolls were served, we had a tough time discerning whether they tasted like fish, unidentifiable meat, or simply garbage.  And, although they all went uneaten, they were cleared from the table without inquiry.  In fact, at no time did anyone ask us how the food was; it was obvously not a point of interest. The vegetable entrees were fresh, but covered in an unpleasant sauce-- the origin of which was difficult to discern...and forget: we all left feeling like we needed to brush our teeth and, days later, I still feel like there is a numbing film on my tongue.
