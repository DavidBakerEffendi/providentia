I'd probably give this place a four if it wasn't for the annoying ipod (typically filled with whatever corny music you were rolling your eyes at three years ago) being played way too loudly. You'd think the manager was looking to establish a party vibe-- except for the large number of four tops and lack of a dancefloor. Being a vegan, i'd expect to simply deal with things like this to sit down and eat what is actually a pretty good selection of animal free dishes (the vegan fajitas are absolutely killer; the vegan tacos are perfect for a late night bite; that's only the tip of the iceberg). Unfortunately, being forced to shout at my girlfriend in order to have a conversation at 8:45 on a weekday is really ridiculous. There are maybe two or three tables that "hide" from the pa system, but to be honest if the weather isn't suitable for outdoor eating, skip this place. Brunch, on the other hand, isn't as bad. Unfortunately, the brunch competition in this city is more than this place can handle. Verdict:  Good for takeout (especially if you don't eat animals).  OK if you're starved and in the area or it's a warm evening and you can find outdoor seating.  Otherwise, expect to feel like you're having dinner at Transit.
