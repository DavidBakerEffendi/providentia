I'm vegan and had been looking for a good vegan place for awhile. The universe heard my prayers... Beyond Sushi is simply amazing. I've tried several approaches to vegan sushi before, but this spot is by far the best. Everything is made to order and all is tasty and fresh. I've tried four of their rolls so far, and all were delightful. Their juices are also worth mentioning, so give them a try if you're feeling thirsty. Only thing to think about is the small numbers of seats... Share a table or take the food out and enjoy!!!
