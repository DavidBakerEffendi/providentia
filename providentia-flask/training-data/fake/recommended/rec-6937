This place is excellent! We were promptly seated and given bread and water, even though it was really busy. My husband and I shared the charcuterie Â platter, which was tasty and quite large. For my entree I chose one of the specials- pork osso buco over polenta. It was absolutely delicious. I am the type of person who always adds salt to my food but none was needed. The pork was tender and juicy and fell right off the bone. The sauce was really fresh and flavorful and the polenta was creamy perfection. My husband also had a special- gnocci with crabmeat and peas in a spicy tomato sauce. I tasted it and it was also amazing. He raved about it. They even made our 4-year-old some plain pasta with butter, but my picky little eater was gobbling up my pork! The prices were reasonable and the portions were huge. We will definitely be back!
