The problem with Hu Kitchen is not the taste or even the price. The problem are the portions and the way they nickel and dime you -- it's hard to escape the overall feeling that the place is trying to extract as much money from you while giving you the least amount they can get away with.   I don't mind spending $15+ on lunch. It's a sad reality in this city. But I expect when I get a PLASTIC to-go container, that they actually FILL it up.  Instead, you get 2 pieces of sometimes-cold meatloaf, very little sauce, and often half-filled side portions.  You can tell they train their employees to not give a full portion - no person being paid $9/hour cares enough to go out of their way to make sure they get a small enough scoop before putting it into the container. To top things off - when you get to the register, they ask if you want a bag and utensils.  After spending almost $16 on meatloaf and 2 small sides of sweet potatoes and vegetables, this should NOT be asked when it is a TO GO order. Word of advice to the owners of Hu Kitchen - a $16 lunch tastes much more palatable going down when I don't feel like I was cheated.
