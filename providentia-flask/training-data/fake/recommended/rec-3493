My suitemate and I were walking around Brooklyn looking for a place to eat since I was starving, so when we came across this place, we asked to see a menu and decided to stay. We were seated immediately at a table for two in the corner. The place is pretty small, but wonderfully decorated. It's cute and comfortable and quaint. Our server was also very kind. I ordered a La Normande crepe; it was amazing, I practically licked my plate clean. It's made with chicken and mushrooms in a creamy sauce, and a salad on the side. I will definitely be coming back for more! But next time I'll try something on the sweet side of the menu. Only drawback (or else I would have given it 5 stars) is that it's cash only. I understand the policy, especially since its a small place, but it can be kind of a hassle for a broke college student like me!
