Went here for Valentine's Day with my husband. We both enjoyed our meals very much. He had the steak with rice and beans but I ventured out and wanted to try something a bit more authentic to Peruvian cuisine and ordered the Tallarines verdes. The base I believe is cilantro or pesto; it was ok....wasn't AMAZING but i guess you have to have the palette for that. My pisco sour was awesome!!!!!!! Service was ok but what do you expect on a holiday. Would definitely return.
