I went to Cabana on a Saturday night and service was good. We were greeted by a friendly hostess. The waitress was also friendly and checked on me and my wife several times during the course of our meal. The restaurant appeared clean. We did have to have our water glasses replaced because they were dirty. The waitress gave us new glasses with no problems and was apologetic. The food was okay. My wife and I had the chicharron and white rice and beans. I felt the portions could have a been a little bigger and the beans could have been better seasoned. The beans were very bland and tasted as if they were taken from a can. The chicharron was crunchy and delicious. Overall, the food was not terrible but I have certainly tasted better and for a better price.
