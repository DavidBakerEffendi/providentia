First of all, the bacon corn bread was TO DIE FOR. The Meatloaf sandwich was a winner also. The Country fried steak was great too.... and they managed to make a simple roasted half chicken very tasty. We are definitely coming back for brunch. Brooklyn star is a nice, cozy place with ample spaces. Our server wasn't nice enough to replace my rice with a salad (not even for extra charge) but other than that, our visit was flawless.
