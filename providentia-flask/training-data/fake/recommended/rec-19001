I have been coming here for several years now and I consider Alta one of my top 10 favorites in Manhattan! Truly tasty food, helpful and friendly staff and the decor makes you feel warm and cozy. Try their brussel sprouts, spaghetti (it is not your typical!) even their BLT is not your average. Everything is delicious!!
