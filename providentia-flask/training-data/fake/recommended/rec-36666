Absolutely outstanding service and great food. I had gone in before for desert with friends but after my brunch experience today, I am a fan. We were originally told five minutes for our table but they came over and apologized at the bar and said it would be ten, no biggie. The bartenders were both attentive and very friendly. When we were seated they sent us over an order of the warm donuts to make it up to us even though it wasn't a big deal to either of us. It was a classy touch. You should try them even if they don't send them over, they don't disappoint. My friend ordered the croque madam, I tried a little, it was awesome. I had the short rib hash with poached eggs, there wasn't a crumb of food left on the plate. We also had some asparagus, which was perfectly grilled. Overall a great brunch experience, it is always best to have great food, but when you have great service to go with it, you leave a place feeling on top of the world. Everybody is a star at this TriBeCa institution, no matter who you are. Some of the finest service in New York from the hosts, to the bartenders to our awesome waiter Brandon. Thanks for making my Sunday!
