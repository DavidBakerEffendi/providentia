My wife and I get take out from here regularly.  The staff is always friendly.  I noticed today that the decor has been updated a little and everything has a fresh coat of paint. Surprising what a little paint can do. But that isn't the real story, the real story is the food. Always good, always fresh, and priced right. We usually get falafel sandwiches, cheese pie, shish kabob, and schwarma (beef). Always good. If you like cheese, and I do, get the cheese and cucumber appetizer. Or, for something a little different, try the Lahmeh Ajin.
