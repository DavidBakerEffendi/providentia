We get take-out here regularly. Always good. Decent prices compared to other Indian restaurants in the area. Staff is friendly. Restaurant is clean. There used to be a nasty smell over by the restrooms/register, but they seemed to have fixed that. Back when this place was called Sangam I proposed to my wife there.
