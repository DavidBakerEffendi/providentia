Mmm, mmm, mmm.  Food is delicious here and reasonably priced!  BEST tocino I've ever had---so tender and unbelievably tasty!  The girl who helped me is always so nice and helpful!---my receipt says her name is Karen?  Sad that I just discovered this gem as I've now moved out of NJ but my in laws will be making trips their as they love the pancit.
