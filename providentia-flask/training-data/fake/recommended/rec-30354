I'm giving this place 5 stars as much for the way it represents the best of what neighborhood restaurants in New York can be as for the food and service. All of which were top-notch on my dinner visit the other night. Granted, I had the bonus of a connection to one of the wait staff, which guaranteed a great experience on the service front. However, watching and listening to the scene unfold around us, I think that terrific service is a hallmark of the place. An additional bonus: my friend and dinner companion had made friends with the Cookshop team on Twitter after her first visit a few months ago, so we got some extra-special attention from the owners, who we had a highly enjoyable conversation with. On to the meat of the matter. We doubled down on duck, having the duck wing confit snack as an appetizer and then ordering an entree duck leg, as well as a pork dish they call Porchetta. Boy, howdy, that pork! Perfectly roasted, with a rim of crisp and crunchy crackling separated from the meat by a slippery, tasty, thin little layer of lip-smackin' pork fat, on a bed of tiny black beans cooked to a turn with just the right amount of seasoning. Nestled alongside the pork was a beautiful clump of ruby red grapefruit sections and greens, tossed with the lightest of dressings. The counterpoint of the cool citrus and greens with the meat and beans turned the meal into a sensual experience that make me purr with pleasure. Bill, our expert guide and waiter, turned me on to a terrific German white wine that paired beautifully with both the duck and the pork: Muller Thurgau Franken. I'll have to track down a source for that one, it's a keeper! Top-shelf experience, in an NYC neighborhood restaurant that attracts attention from far beyond the nabe. I used to live a few blocks away from the corner of 20th & 10th, where Cookshop sits. My old nabe still holds my heart, in no small part because it's still an area that grows and nurtures restaurants like Cookshop.
