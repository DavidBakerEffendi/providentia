This was one place I overlooked in the addiction that is Yelp. And now I shall place a review rehashing all 70 previous reviews. Its a no frills dark wooded pub, musical conversation abound, cheap mug beer flows like a continuously running toilet, and people are sitting, eating, drinking, cursing or drinking. My best friend's ex, before she was his ex, stayed in the city for a week and we decided to take her to corner bistro because well, its a good a place as any. She ended up getting hammered and tried to bring these three girls from this other table over to talk to me but they thought she was hitting on them. So that worked out okay. The other times I've been here I've either been debating how long it would take for the greasy goodness of the tasty tamturger to go apepoopy on my insides. Or I would strike up a conversation with a random stranger and say to myself, "this woman who i've been talking to doesn't know her shit, she said that Renee Zellweger was in Love Actually and that she knew a producer on Love Actually when really she's wrong because she's been in the Bridget Jones movies". Oh don't have two burgers here. you'll want to. But refrain. Your taste buds may want seconds but your arteries don't.
