I love this place and as previous Yelpers have written go for the pre-packaged meals way cheaper than the buffet plus free soup or salad! (choose the salad the soup is salty) 6.00 or less 4.50 shrimp with noodles, 8.00 or more buffet (they weighed Â it) Very friendly service clean, free water, only 'cheap' place I see that offers toothpicks as well as packaged wet wipes by the register, thoughtful and lots of choices + options of American to Korean beer :D
