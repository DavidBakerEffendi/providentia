This lonely block of East 39th Street needed a restaurant.   Yes, there's the uber-busy Park Avenue Tavern on the corner.  There's also a tamale lady who sells breakfast in front of the Mexican Consulate, and a daytime food truck or two.  Thankfully, the seedy Verona Deli on the corner of Madison recently closed.   So it was wonderful to see the brownstone that used to house the NYC clubhouse for Williams College lease its basement level for use as a restaurant and bar, The Shakespeare. We visited toward the tail end of The Shakespeare's first week, so management probably didn't have a good baseline from which to gauge how much food to order.  So no demerits for being out of both seafood options -- fish & chips and a crab entree -- when we visited at 10:30 p.m. on the Thursday after Christmas. The kitchen graciously substituted a fish sandwich from the lunch menu.  The breaded & fried flounder was fresh, and the bun and sauces were perfect.  The sandwich came with freshly made potato chips. It was pricey, at $17, but we have no complaints about the food. The room is loud.  Even with the volume muted on the wide-screen TVs displaying football, the din of diner banter above the bar's energetic music was really loud.  So this may not be the best spot for those seeking quiet conversation.   The staff is very nice.  From the greeter to the servers to the bartenders, care has been taken by the veteran restauranteur owners to hire a competent staff.  We had one miscommunication ordering a martini and it was promptly fixed without making us feel like toads. Welcome to the neighborhood, The Shakespeare.  Looking forward to sampling more of your writing, er, food and drink.
