Food: Cold noodle: Came here cuz craving for Korean cold noodle. A pretty big bowl has beef, pear, radish, cucumber, half egg and a bit red pepper in it. You can put vinegar, mustard and chili in it base on preference. I like the noodle a lot, it's chewy and cold enough. Perfect for the hot summer. But some ingredients in it like beef and cucumber are not that good: cucumber tastes a little bitter and beef is tasteless. Sushi: My partner ordered paradise roll, salmon roe and sea scallop sushi. It's pretty good! It's pretty fresh! Service: Most of the time is efficient except when we were abt to get the check. The staffs are nice, just they have pretty thick accents.
