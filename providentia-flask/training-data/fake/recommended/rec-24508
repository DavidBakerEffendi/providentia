So I was here on a business trip and I heard about this ramen place through my boss and BOY was he right this place blew my mind away. This is my favorite place to eat ramen. I love the decor and how they have authentic japanese people working there. I went during lunch hour it seems like they always have a wait so make sure you plan ahead prior to your visit. I got the lunch special Akamaru Modern Set and added an egg on top. It was like heaven starting from the salad dressing all the way to the last sip of the broth. Writting about it makes my mouth water. I can't wait to visit again hopefully in November. But yeah the lunch set is not bad it comes with the following:- salad- soy wasabi dressing (not the typical mayo dressing over in the west coast) small bowl of rice and chicken karage ramen-the broth was amazing different flavors and i love the miso paste with the garlic oil. I believe they make their own noodles there too because when I went downstairs for the bathroom I saw some guy stucked in a small room cranking those ramen noodles it was pretty impressive. I definately recommend this as one of the MUST TRY when you are in NY!!!!!
