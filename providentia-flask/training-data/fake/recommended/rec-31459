Not much to look at but seemed to be a local fave based on the patrons. Â I am vegetarian and ordered a veggie & queso dish in a lava stone --- delicious flavors and WAY too much food so I had leftovers. It was enjoyable for our large party - food came out quickly and our server was very friendly. I deducted a star because ambience is severely lacking and food was solidly good but not "best ever Mexican" in comparison to the eateries known for their authentic fare. Overall good food and I may return but not until after checking into some other local spots first.
