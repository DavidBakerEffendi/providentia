My favorite bar of all time. I love an unpretentious dive and this one is the best. Whether you are studying in the late afternoon with a cold brew (free wifi and power plugs at every table make this easy) or starting s 4 hour session with 6 friends and dozens of Sea Hag IPAs, you cannot go wrong with the big comfy booths at Anchor. Ask for Brian - his dry humor is the best.
