Little Italy was almost a ghost town on St Patricks Day but it was perfect for me and my bf to go in and enjoy a nice quiet lunch. We sat outside and our waiter was not pushy at all... just the right amount of friendliness and the bus boys were on top of our glasses being refilled and our plates being withdrawn in a timely manner. The food was reallyy classy and really good, oh and don't forget to try the tiramisu dessert there, it was delicious!! I guess the humorous part of the day was watching the guys across the street in a desperate demeanor trying to convince people to eat at his joint. Guy had like 5 angry cigarette breaks. Pellegrinos wasn't even trying and they were still getting a nice amount of clientele.
