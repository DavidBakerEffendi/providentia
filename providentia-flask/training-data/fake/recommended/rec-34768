Way over-hyped. Tried the staple chicken tikka and minced lamb, both were dry and unimpressive. The chicken was really over-charred. I had high hopes but both rolls were boring and left me wishing I went another place for lunch. Better kati rolls can be found at the Biryani Cart (at 46th & 6th) or Desi Shack (an absolutely delicious and healthier alternative, at 39th and Lex). I don't think I would recommend it or go back, unfortunately.
