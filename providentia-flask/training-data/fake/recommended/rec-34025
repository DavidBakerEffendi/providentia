As one of my friends said, "This [menu] seems like the kind of thing that happened when you were hanging out in college smoking too much weed; there was always that one guy in the kitchen putting some weird shit together... Here, try this." And yet, as all of us who were within earshot of her that night agreed, the guys at Do or Dine *do know* how to put together some weird shit, weed or no. See, if back in college someone told you they were going home to make baby octopus over deviled eggs with a side of tiny pickle shoved up the stem of a mushroom you'd be like, "What? Whatever. Shut up." Or if they invited you over and tried to pass off goose liver pate jammed inside a jelly donut (see: the much ballyhooed Foie Gras Doughnut) as a main course, you'd probably unfriend them for reals. Or if they texted you that they had just deep fried a deviled egg ("What *is* it with the deviled egg obsession," you'd wonder- "Although they *are* strangely delicious...") with cilantro and bacon and were going to chase it with a soup made entirely of pumpkins and peanuts you'd simply reply, "Wtf? Gross. Leave me alone." BUT SOMEHOW. This all works. As does the chosen soundtrack. Is this a political statement? I'm not sure. But I think when you decide to make nachos and substitute veggie dumplings for the tortilla chips you are probably saying something important about something important that has to do with upending traditional expectations or postmodern something free something. Again, I have no idea. What I do suggest is that you Do or Dine. And give peace a chance. After all, if a soft taco and an octopus can be friends and a pork tenderloin can rest happily on a bed of duck fat and wasabi apple gratin, then doesn't that speak to the reality that there is hope for us all? I think so. And let that be a lesson to us.
