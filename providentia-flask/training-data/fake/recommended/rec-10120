Hands down one of my favorite places in NYC for Peruvian food!   I grew up going to the Pio Pio on Northern Blvd in Queens and always loved it for the food and festive atmosphere (loud loud music , people dancing between tables, and someone's birthday every 2 minutes!)  But then I found Pio Pio 8... Pio Pio 8 is the Manhattan version of the original beloved Queens spot, but with a fuller menu and bar scene!  I always get the Matador Combo (2-4 ppl) and literally eat until it hurts!  The food is delicious!  And always fresh, fast and hot... I guess when you serve so much chicken, it's easy to get it right!   If you go with a date, try to get a 2-top on the upper floor balcony overlooking the restaurant.  If you go with a party, they have big tables on the subfloor that are perfect!  The atmosphere is great!
