i'd go for the veggie burger again, it came with pickled cabbage or something like that, can't remember-- and guacamole. I don't know if it deserves all the hype but the place is pretty stunning, if small. the drinks can easily be twice the price of an entree though. so unless you're pretty dedicated, you're sooner to drink yourself into a sorrow of how much you've spent rather than drink your current sorrows away.
