OK.  So, for the record the sandwiches at Banh mi Zon are NOT authentic.  Don't fool yourselves people.  These sandwiches are about as authentic as General Tso's Chicken is considered "Chinese" (boguuuuus) HOWEVER, that being said, these sandwiches are DELICIOUS (like General Tso's Chicken is).  Have tried the classic, and the grilled pork patties versions, and have found them to be a westernized version of Vietnamese sandwiches, in an oh-so-delicious way. For authenticity, you're better off going to the Lafayette (Sau Voi) street corner shop in Chinatown.  But for deliciousness, this place gets 4 stars.  5 if it were authentic :(   ALSO IMPORTANT, VERY IMPORTANT:  This is probably THE only place in the east village that serves up a GREAT Avacado shake.  100% better than Lan Cafe (which serves more authentic-vegetarian-styled Vietnamese food) as Lan Cafe's shake is like powdered-playdough gross-ness. The only thing I didn't like was their complete lack of jalapenos (apparently normal for this joint) - they're one of the reasons I stopped in in the first place!
