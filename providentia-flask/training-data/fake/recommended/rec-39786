Love, love, love this place. I love drinks and apps and sharing and this place meets all my needs. Get the meat skewers and the pomegranate mojitos. Also, get the plantain stuffed with spicy beef. Skip the crab cakes and the fried calamari. Great for dinner, drinks and warm summer nights with friends.
