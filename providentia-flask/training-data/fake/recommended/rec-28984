SO SO VERY not impressed with this place.   Short version:  If you like overpriced pretentious cuteness, this is your place.  Otherwise, avoid. Long version: Walked in on a rainy Tuesday night with a group of seven.  Since we didn't have reservations, they stuck us at this high top on these incredibly uncomfortable stools EVEN THOUGH the place was half empty.  It continued to be half empty the whole time we were there (not deserted but plenty of space), but no, we could not move to a regular table and chairs.  If we hadn't been there for a friend's birthday (her choice) I'd have walked. The waitstaff was slow, inattentive and clumsy.  I have never been in a restaurant where the crash of dropped dishes happened every 15 minutes.  And of course, after all this crappy service they automatically added 18% gratuity because our party was seven.   The food was decent but incredibly overpriced - $12-14 for a drink, $15 for a sandwich.  My dessert was ok but tasted like something I could have gotten at Friendly's in the burbs.  I know this is downtown, things cost more.  But at those prices, I expect the food to be amazing, not just ok.  And frankly I would have been a lot more ok with the high prices if we could have had our evening sitting at regular chairs with decent service.
