Don't let the wait time discourage you. As long as you put your name in by 11, you are good! Take the time to explore the neighborhood because they will text you when your table is ready! I say the wait is worth it because it's a small and intimate place where the food is heavenly! The candied bacon is literally to die for (one serving is more than enough). And the pancakes are both dense and fluffy. And you can't be Coca Cola Classic in a glass bottle.
