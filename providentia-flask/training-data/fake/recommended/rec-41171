a friend and i came here for dinner during the brief period of time when they were celebrating their anniversary by accepting reservations. obviously we were singlemindedly pursuing the burger, but the next time i go back i'll most likely order several non burger menu items and a side of the haystack fries, which were delicious. if you're like me and you hate blue cheese, i'd steer clear of the burger, since roquefort cheese is the only thing on it, and the taste is very overpowering. their deviled eggs are amazing, and i highly recommend the burrata starter. also loved the ramp champ, but it might have been seasonal.
