This place is as near perfect as  it gets. Many times you go to a celebrity chef  owned restaurant it is more hype than anything else. (Jeff, i love you but your staff is pretentious and obnoxious)   Chef Tom Colicchio. Hits it out of the park on service , quality, food,ambiance Etc. My Server Was well trained and very knowledgeable. All the staff was well trained and moved together like ballroom dancers,never missing a beat My girlfriend had octopus that was  so tender and delicious it made the one we had at a well known Spanish restaurant seem like rubber. I had the duck confit which eclipsed any confit I've  eaten at very good french restaurants. An Italian who can out Spanish the Spanish and out french the french on dishes they are known for, is simply a food genius. He knows the very essence of food and how it is best prepared. We did not have drinks but our server commendation of a sparkling   cider was just another example his extraordinary ability to pair food and drink under all circumstances. The desserts  were great as was the whole experience. Mr. Colicchio Two thumbs up.!!!!!!!!! PS I know Tom wasn't cooking, Chris Lavey is a rock star is in the kitchen Stephen Collucci the pastry chef is a culinary beast of sweets..
