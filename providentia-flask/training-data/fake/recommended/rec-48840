This is probably my favorite Thai restaurant on the UES. Food was great! Staff was friendly and fast. Everything my wife and I ordered was very tasty. One of the best Pad Thai dishes I have ever had. My only complaint would be that the dinner portion was a little bit smaller than most other Pad Thai dishes. The masaman curry was good, not great. Decor and ambience was very nice. I liked warm wood theme, the exposed brick, hanging lights, as well as the wrought iron look. Looking forward to coming back again soon!
