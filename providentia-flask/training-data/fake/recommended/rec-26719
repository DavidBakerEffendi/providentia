I like when places stick to one thing and try their best to do that one thing well. This place doesn't have shrimp tortellini, or burritos, or pizza; everything is meatballs. Don't eat meat? Hey, no problem: there are veggie meatballs. I got the BPV meatball sandwich with rabe, though I don't recall its name (they all have names). The meatballs were excellent and the bread was good, but it could have used some marinara. I appreciate that they're trying to showcase the meatballs themselves (and it was nice to try that), but I just need sauce. A quick trip up to the front though, and it was brought out to me, hot and fresh. It was a nice enough place inside, and I liked the music they were playing. They had bread pudding on the menu for really, really cheap. The prices overall were reasonable, I think, compared to other places in this area.
