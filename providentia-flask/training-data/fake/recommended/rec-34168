Hosted a graduation brunch for 25 and it was awesome! Reserving and planning couldn't have been easier. Â Good food, good service and privacy all convenient to the LIE and the subway. Even though we had a number of last-minute RSVPs and kids who needed to eat before the adults, the staff was flexible and responsive. Would host another event here in a heart beat!
