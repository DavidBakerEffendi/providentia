The Wishing Well is a great bar with great beer and food specials. They usually have several local beers on draft, and I can always find something I want to order. I have seen them pour red wine on many occasions and they seem to pour consistently huge glasses. But I tend to like beer. Usually when I'm there I find no issues with the beer; however, for the Long Trail beer week event last night the beer was warm.  And I mean every beer in the joint, not just the beers on tap.  In general during the happy hour specials I encourage you to order the buffalo wings and not the oysters, unless you like dried-out, seemingly old oysters. Also, they seem to specialize in frying food, so if you look over their menu most everything has a fried component. But they do know how to fry things well.  The calamari is delicious and unique, but the chicken tikka masala flatbread was way too meat-heavy to be tasty.  I have never been to brunch here, but apparently it's great. No matter when you go, you will walk away with a complementary fragrance.  This is why my friends and I call it The Wishing Smell. So don't wear your favorite dry-clean-only garment here.  Full Discloser: I have been influenced by the restaurant.com certificates I have purchase as well as game specials.
