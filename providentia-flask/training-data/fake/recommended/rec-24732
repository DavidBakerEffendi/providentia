Great restaurant. Enjoyable atmosphere.  Excellent wait staff who gave good recommendations. Loved the veal librettist.  Reasonable prices.  Pasta was tasty.  Bread was just ok...strange giant loaves with little flavor.  At the end of the meal as we walked out owner greeted us to find out how we like it.  Nice touch.  Best thing was they had singing in the bar and the amateur singer was great.  Will be back soon.
