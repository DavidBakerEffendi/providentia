Been to this diverse and unique little eatery in Bloomfield twice now and had a delightful time and meal each visit. I really enjoyed the overall atmosphere and design of this original little restaurant. Even if you aren't in the mood for dinner there is a great bar with a very provocative drink menu and some great local brews on tap. And if you are in the mood to eat, there are some very inventive and varied choices ranging from appetizers to main courses to personal pizzas. I had an absolutely delicious and spicy shrimp bisque with an equally yummy margarita pizza and for dessert their homemade "dirt " which this month (it changes each month to suit season or holiday) was a triple taste treat of gingerbread, sugar cookie and chocolate and peppermint. Second visit we had a great meal starting with the lobster bisque and then sharing an assortment of appetizers tapas style, the duck leg confit, manicotti and baked veal meatballs with a Cricket Hill lager to wash it down! A enjoyable pair of evenings at a unique little restaurant with a refreshingly original menu selection and a really nice atmosphere and style. Yes, the place can be a bit loud but the food and awesome drink menu make up for it and it is a lot quieter during the week. Compliments to Chef Francesco Palmieri on his cuisine and a cool little restaurant that... from what I hear... he designed himself.
