I've not been here in years and came here with a friend of mine with his suggestion. It's just a cookie cutter Thai American food with no real interest or flair. Ordered the spicy squid ink spaghetti which wasn't bad but the other "traditional" dishes were so ordinary I could've been at any other Thai place in the city and at a subpar one at that. Definitely not coming back here. Hit up Pure on 9th ave. just a few blocks up for more authentic fare.
