This is an upscale place.. lots of wine choices. Chris tge bartender was very nice. To be honest I just wanted a simple meal and this place is more of a small plate ego trip. I wanted just a simple grilled chicken salad. They could not add proteins to any salads.  The food was good, and for those prices it should be excellent.  Nice place to meet up and have a drink. I would skip dinner.
