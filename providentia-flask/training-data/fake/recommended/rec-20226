Buckwheat crepes, stuffed to the brim with goat cheese, figs and caramelized onions... and that's just the vegetarian option! There were at least 15 options of crepes from traditional ham, swiss, egg to Italian with prosciutto, etc. to modern American like the veg one I just mentioned. Very affordable bottles of wine from ~$28+, with quite a few in the $30-range. The dessert crepes were such a sweet treat. My dining companion had the nutella banana and I had a Proustian moment with my all time favorite crepe au citron. Just a little squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of sugar transports me to a time not so long ago when I would wander the streets of Paris after a night of revelry with one of these beauties wrapped in paper in my hot little fist. Le sigh. I am on a ROLL lately with Yelp rec's from reviews and friends...
