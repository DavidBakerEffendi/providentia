Lombardi's was recommended to us on our trip to NY. I asked just about everyone I met where to go and the answer was always "Lombardi's". Very glad we went. This was a great pizza, very honest with simple but high quality ingredients. The sauce and crust made the pizza great. There must have been 1000 pizza places on every street, I agree with everyone else... Lomabardi's was great!
