I have been here 2-3 times!  If you are seeking Jamaican food, this isn't the spot, but if you like food of Trinidad and Guyanese culture (strong Indian influence) stop in! I am not a vegetarian, but I try to be meat-free and they have good choices! Excellently flavored.  The food sits in the hot trays behind a glass display so it's great for quick point and take-out, but there are tables.
