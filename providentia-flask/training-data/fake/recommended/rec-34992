Came here today for brunch and was pretty impressed. Had the scrambled eggs entree, Mac n cheese, and a few mimosas. All were very good. Just wish the Mac had bacon in it!! Either way, we were a party of 6 and were seated promptly. Aside from the loud atmosphere I don't really have any other complaints! Good times and parking!!
