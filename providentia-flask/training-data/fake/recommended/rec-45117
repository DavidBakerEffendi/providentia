Excellent - really. Got there about an hour early with our friends and enjoyed cocktails from the bar - excellent cocktail list.  The Hell Cat has a nice burn to it if you like that from your drinks. The table decided to go with the tasting menu & wine pairings.  Possibly the best tasting menu with wine pairing I have ever had.  It was a solid seven courses - everyone at the table agreed that every course was strong and could stand on it own - no disappointment.  Highlights - salmon with roe, steamed summer vegetables with basil and pickled onion, and the fava bean salad with toasted bread. They accommodated a vegetarian palate at the table as well and seemed to take pleasure in severing the different dishes to our friend. It is clear there has been a ton of thought put into both the menu and the wine list... it showed and I will be recommending your experience!
