I remember anxiously awaiting Taphouse's opening my freshmen year - it's a nicer alternative to the normal Smokes' and Blarney's nights.  The drinks are pretty reasonable and they change the beers they have on tap every now and then.  There is always some cool even going on, especially during the summers (watermelon/crab/all you can eat/drink nights).  The food is above average as far as bar food goes.  The crafted sandwiches are tasty, I suggest the burger.  The brick oven pizzas and mussels (huge portions) make for great h'orderves to split if you're just out drinking with a friend. It can get pretty loud and overrun with undergrads on weekends, although I think Taphouse attracts more young professionals and graduate students.  The outdoor fireplaces are amazing and add more personality to the patio space.  Definitely worth stopping by if you're looking for a chill night of drinks and good food.
