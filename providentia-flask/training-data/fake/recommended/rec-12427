Location: 53rd & 6th ave Price: Cheap Quality: Not the same!   I remember driving all the way from Brooklyn during hot summer nights back when getting the 5 dollar jump off plates were amazing on the pockets and taste buds but  its not the same.  The quality of the meat has declined and well its just A-OK.  They are 'almost' like every other cart.  I can't see myself making a trip all the way to the city just to get a plate. I am still a loyal customer though and Yeah I would buy again if I happen to be there but its not my "go to" spot anymore.  Halal guys has become to me that type of relationship where you see a friend go through hard times but you still got their backs, hoping that they will recover.  I'm waiting for that recovery!
