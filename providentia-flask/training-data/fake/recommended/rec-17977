This place is ah-mazing! I went in on a Friday night, and was surprised it wasn't that busy, the food here is to die for, on par with Jean Georges. We were greeted by a sizeable wine list, and not one, not two but 6 amouse bouches! Each unique and so delicious. The prices were also quite reasonable for New York, and the Chef came out on occasion to ensure the room was enjoying his food. What an experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for high-end, creative and bespoke cuisine. I loved it, and can't wait to go again!
