This places is quite amazing! The food they give you is not only delicious, but the portions are quite generous; they even give you the option of an extra large bowl of pho. Speaking of the pho, this place is spot on with their offering. I usually get either the extra large beef, brisket, and tendon, or the beef and meatballs. This comes in a giant bowl with what may be around a pound of noodles and a generous serving of beef. The noodles and soft and slurpable while the broth, while somewhat neutral, is quite appealing; if it's too neutral, add in some of the wonderful condiments at your table. While the food is good, I have to be fair with this review and mention the cons. First, it seems that they have kept some of the bowls for a long time, as there is some wear and tear on the edges. Also, that crowded and not very clean fish tank make nervous for the people ordering seafood. Overall, I'd recommend this place to people in a hearbeat!
