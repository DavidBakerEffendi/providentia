Small, attractive Australian place with nice wooden tables. Best to visit between official meal times or you'll be squished. If you love burgers, don't feel guilty dragging vege friends with you - the sandwiches are yummy too.  Of more interest to us was the coffee as it is hard to find Antipodean-style lattes and flat whites in New York.  The drinks were good enough (the coffee fiend preferred Jack's), but Aussie lattes and flat whites are like NZ flat whites and lattes, respectively, just to confuse things.
