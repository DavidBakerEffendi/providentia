Absolutely delicious!  I was in Hartford for business and both clients chose this restaurant, so I knew it must be good.  It is in a convenient location downtown, the staff is extremely helpful and efficient and the food is outstanding.  My steak was one of the best I have had in a long time.  The martinis were well made.  All of the sides were delicious as well.  The absolute best part of the meal  though was the dessert...the deconstructed chocolate cream pie was to die for!  So good that I ordered it both nights!
