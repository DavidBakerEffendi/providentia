Frank Pepe delivers -- not to your house, but on the pizza. We had a tomato mozzarella pie with sausage. My pal Paul enjoys the simplicity, so I went with it. Â This was pretty much the ideal pie, crust was crispy and and chewy in all the right ways, bottom was burnt in all the right ways, sauce was sweet and tangy, and the sausage, presented in nickel-sized slices was tasty and just fennely enough to impart a really good zing. I'm sure the other branches are good, but from what I understand this is the orginal oven that is grandfathered in and cooks amazing pies. Fortunately my store is about 45 minutes away, so I can get up here pretty easily. As an extra bonus they were handing out samples of their summer special, a tomato pie, while we were standing outside on line. Even better, they started the handout at the back of the line (which, apparently, is according to tradition when they do this), which just happened to be where I was at the time. Awesome!
