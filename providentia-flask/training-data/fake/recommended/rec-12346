Upon first glance of this place's menu, it would appear to be just your average "Mediterranean" restaurant. But that moniker is misleading since the Mediterranean spans from the Iberian peninsula to the Levant and North Africa. Usually, restaurants that feature Mediterranean fare actually mean Middle Eastern cuisine, but, for publicity's sake, use a different name. #racist Miriam seems to fall into that trap. It's an Israeli restaurant through and through and a good one at that! We recently frequented this place for brunch and it was delicious. The menu is odd in that a majority of the brunch offerings are just $14. Dishes include Eggs Benedict in 3 styles (Classic, Salmon and Florentine), various omelettes, a Mediterranean Crispy Dough (aka Malawach), and more.  There are other items on the menu as well for an additional cost. My choice was the Burekas breakfast described as "Puffed pastry pocket stuffed with feta & olives, served with two eggs (any style), labneh cheese, Israeli salad & tahini sauce." It came out rather quickly and was a huge portion. Thank goodness because I was starved! I ordered my eggs poached and they were perfect. The salad was perfectly seasoned and the labane was creamy and savory. The burekas were good but not amazing. They were quite dense and not as light and crispy as I'm used to having them. The service was good and, from what I could tell, the others in my party were happy with their selections.   Overall, a good spot in Park Slope for brunch. I guess I'll have to try dinner there sometime.
