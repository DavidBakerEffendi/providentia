Heard lots of great reviews about this place so my cousin and I came to check it out.  Lost a star for making us wait 45 minutes.. I hate waiting.  AND they didn't have a caprese salad... what Italian restaurant doesnt have caprese salad? Claiming Tomatos were out of season... WACK.com The rest of the food was decent.  I had the SPring Pea ravioli, but I was still hungry after dinner... DESSERT on the other hand was AMAZING!! Some chocolate coffee concosion that although my cuzin said she didnt' want dessert... she couldnt keep her spoon away from this ting!  SO YUMMY! Waitress was real nice and helped give us suggesstions to what was good on the menu.  Music was random and loud.  They went from oldes to hip hop in a matter of minutes.  I would have liked to hear some italian music to add to the ambiance.  The crowd was real diverse and seemed like a popular hang out.  Overall, not bad at all!
