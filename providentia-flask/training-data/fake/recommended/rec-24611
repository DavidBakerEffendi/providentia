As we all no there is certainly not a shortage of mexican restaurants in NYC, but when you find one you love you typically stick with it. So when a friend suggested we try Fonda I was a bit hesitant at first but figured why not. The meal was enjoyable and was a great value for the amount of food you get. However, as we were finishing up our meal, the table next to us hopped up screaming. We wondered what it was and found out that a COCKROACH has just crawled across their table. If a restaurant can't even manage to keep their main floor clean I don't even want to know what's happening in the kitchen. Such a shame as the meal was so perfect until that point. Definitely contemplating whether or not my meal was supposed to have that crunch all along...
