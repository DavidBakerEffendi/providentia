It's an easy task to get five stars when you serve the most delicious cocktail ever.  Yes, look no further: the Southside is amazing. Ok, I only came here for drinks, so the five stars is a little hyperbolic, but my enthusiasm for the Southside isn't.  It's a magic concoction, brewed from gin, cucumbers, lime juice, a little mint....went down easy and left room for about ten more (which I did NOT have, though I wanted to). The place was empty at eight-ish on a Monday, but the service at the bar was amiable and efficient, and the place is a joy to sit in.  The dark wood, big bar mirror, and other little touches make it feel, yes, like a speakeasy of sorts, which is always exciting. Perhaps if I get a spike in income, I'll go back for dinner.  My friends stayed on and wouldn't stop talking about some fig salad....so, you know, I'll probably have to test their word on that. Give me another Southside.
