I have had several meals here while sitting with Pitzie and Cheppie.  The salads are quite good and my steak was cooked perfectly.  I really like sitting outside as there are lots of things to look at as you are enjoying your meal.  They treated my dogs great too bring water without me asking.  Only drawback are the prices, but I guess when you are in this location you are kind of paying for where you eat as well.  They have a very good selection of beers on tap as well.  Would recommend.
