I had dinner there tonight with a girlfriend.  What a pleasure!  The food was phenomenal and the drinks were tasty and perfect.  I hate when drinks are so strong I can't have more than one.  These were perfect....I had two drinks (which were made with such fresh ingredients) and thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The atmosphere was really lovely too.  Can't wait for a few summer happy hours!
