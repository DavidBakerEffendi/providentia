Interesting place. We arrived just after the Real Madrid and Barcelona game. Â Place was still buzzing. Not a typical restaurant , took awhile to get seated, service was a little slow but friendly. We were in ro rush so not an issue. Sangria was very good, food was very good. We had three tapas plates and a filet mignon which was also very good. I would go back next time in Ironbound. Prices were reasonable and more than fair given the quality.
