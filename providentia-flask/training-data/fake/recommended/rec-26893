Pros: - Open till 5am! - My taste buds are in love! - You can watch the kitchen at work. - Everything is made fresh...including the homemade dough! - Don't let the long lines fool you...the line moves pretty fast. Cons: - Indoor seating only for dining in for a whole pie - Bench outside that seats about 3 people is their only outdoor seating. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~­~ Prices: $4.00 - $4.50 per slice $24 - $30 for a whole pie Choose from 4 types of pizza: - Artichoke (my favorite!) - Sicilian - Crab - Margherita (that's how they spell it) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My Experience: I absolutely love this place. It's a great addition to Manhattan and no place like it. It's a family business which opened in 2008 and I've been a fan of theirs since existence. It's pretty entertaining to watch the kitchen at work. The place is simple...and the menu is simple. You choose from 4 flavors (Artichoke, Sicilian, Crab, Margherita). That's it. So don't expect 31 flavors, cause this ain't Baskin Robbins. You stand, then you order...that's just it. Keeping it simple. Don't expect seating. There's only a bench outside that seats about 3 people, 4 if you're hella skinny. I usually order my slice and walk on over to sit on the stairs at the Union Square park and eat my pizza while watching local skateboarders do their ollies and flips. My favorite is the Artichoke pizza. If you're not necessarily an artichoke lover or if you grew up as a child hating vegetables....you might actually  dig their pizzas here for a chance. It's full of flavor! Should I dare say, "a party in your mouth?" The white sauce is mmmm-azing! Whoa? When Hurricane Irene hit in August 2011, almost every store was shut down. The morning after Irene, I was so starved! I went driving restaurant to restaurant looking for a place to grub disappointed that every place that I wanted to eat at was closed for business. I prayed that Artichoke would be open (true story). So I sped on over to Union Square and lo and behold....they were open for business! Woohoo! Any one that rates this place lower than a 5 either grew up as a child hating veggies, allergic or doesn't eat cheese, calorie counters, or needs to see the doctor cause their taste buds are out of wack. As for as being healthy? No one claimed it's a healthy choice...it just tastes darn good. This place definitely deserves a solid 5. There's a big fat cup at the window that has written on it: "Only $5.50 for enough BEER to make your Grandma go blind." I'm sold! Haha.
