Food: 5 Service: 1 This place's saving grace is the food. Without the food, there's no real reason to go back. The current special of all you can eat blue crabs for 19.95 or the "Red, White and Blue Special" of 6 wellpoint oysters or 6 clams + house wine or PBR = $8?! Nice! Too bad that the day we went (Saturday, 6/11/11, around 12:30PM) the service was awful. When we walked in, only 2 tables were seated so that meant that we should be seated right away or that service would be very attentive, right? Wrong. We just stood there for about 5 minutes with the male server and female bartender (I assume) just conversing and glancing over at us. Come on, you see us, and you can't even seat us? I finally said, "Can we sit somewhere?" to which they replied, "Sure." Other great responses from the service today: Q: "Is the bathroom downstairs?" A: "Uh hm" Q: "Can we order?" A: "Ok" Q: "Is your gumbo already made? We're in a hurry." A: "What?" Q: "Can we get our check, please?" A: "Your check?" I would probably go back with very low service expectations.
