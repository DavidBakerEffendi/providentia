Tried Cubanu the first time with my husband for date night. Love it! The décor is modern and very warm and inviting. The staff is very courteous and helpful. We got the cha-cha sampler and had friend plaintains, empanadas and Cuban sandwiches. All three apps were great but I loved the spinach and cheese empanadas. Both the red and white sangrias are delish (but I prefer the red). The spinach salad with crab and avocado was my entrée (even tho it's a salad) and it was very tasty and filling :) The second time we went to celebrate my birthday with family, there was 7 of us. We ordered a lot of apps and 2 pitchers of sangria, one red, one white. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. We enjoyed our meals immensely. Each dish was very plentiful and we had leftovers. Will continue to patronize Cubanu because their food is delicious!
