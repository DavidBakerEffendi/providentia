A lunch staple in Princeton, you can always find a good burger, sandwich, or salad on the menu.  Sometimes the specials are hit or miss.  Not bad for after work either - spacious enough bar to hang with some friends and have a drink.  It can get crowded at times, so you may have to wait for a table.
