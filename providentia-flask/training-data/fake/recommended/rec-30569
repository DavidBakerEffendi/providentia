I live in NYC and sometimes head down to Philly just to dine at this restaurant. Brunch is amazing, dinner too. Margaritas are varied and fresh. If you have a vegetarian and/or a vegan in your party the menu will accommodate all happily. Oh - and its cheap - especially by NYC standards. Can someone explain to me though - why there are TVs in every restaurant in Philly? Sometimes, its ok to miss the big game.
