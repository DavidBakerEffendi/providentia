Fantastic! I had been wanting to try the restaurant as I have been ordering from their delivery/takeout location for 2 years now. I was not disappointed! Four of us had reservations for a Friday night recently at 7:45. It was a nice night and the place was packed - inside and out. I didn't realize how small it was inside so I am glad I reserved. We showed up on time and there was a wait for people with no reservations but our table was held and ready as it should be. We had salads, which were tasty and then 3 people had pasta bolognese, which all enjoyed. The 4th had pasta with mushrooms in a creamy sauce which was also delicious. Panna cotta and chocolate cakes for desert also received rave reviews. Service was on point - the fact that I don't remember much about it means that a) I had enough wine and b) it was as it should be - unobtrusive and attentive. The only drawback is how small the room is. Tables are on top of each other.
