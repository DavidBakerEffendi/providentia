Ordered a bunch of stuff here, but overall, I felt the square pizzas were better than the triangle slices. The one pizza that stuck out to me was the bread crumb and garlic. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had, and I've tried many many different pizzas. So delicious, crunchy, juicy.... Mmmm I want more.
