Great breakfast for lunch on a Friday.  Over an hour wait on Fri at 12:30, which is apparently nothing compared to the weekend.  It was very good, but I wouldn't wait that long for it very often.  Plan on putting your name on and poking around the area or doing something else.  At least they have an app to monitor your wait and will text you when it's ready. We had the huevos rancheros, the egg sandwich with tomato jam which usually comes on a biscuit, but I ordered on the 7 grain bread.  Both were great and I especially loved that 7 grain bread - hearty and delicious!  Potatoes that came with the sandwich weren't anything impressive though.  If you ask for jam, instead of the standard jam packets they bring you a pot of their fresh homemade raspberry jam - so good!! They're known for the pancakes, which looked great for pancake fans (I'm more of an egg girl).  $14 for pancakes still seems a bit much to me, but I know NYC is different than the Chicago prices I'm used to.   They had some samples of some kind of almond cake out by the front that we grabbed while checking in... wish I knew what that was and bought more because it was delicious!
