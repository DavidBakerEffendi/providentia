average.  ehh.  not bad. On our last day in NYC, a friend brought is out here for brunch.  i ordered the French Toast .  i am not a fan of eggs, so i tend to stay away from egg-tastic items.  as long as it doesnt taste like all egg, im good.   TMI, i know... atmosphere was elegant.  it was an upscale restaurant for a brunch place.  if you are into better dining, this may be the place for you.  i thought it was too much for what you get, but that may be just me.   There are soo many places to eat in Manhattan, especially the lower East side  not sure if ill be back.  but i didnt hate it.
