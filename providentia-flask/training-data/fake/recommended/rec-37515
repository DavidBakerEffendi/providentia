My husband and I were here only once and we'll not come back, for sure, food is okay- nothing else cannot say about it, but service was extremely terrible- our waitress was sitting near the entrance all the time, watching tv show. She came to our table 5 min later we came - was very rude- even didn't say "hello!" to us, than was yelling at me, asking "don't you know what is that ?"- you even can't imagine how her face looked like, her body language showed her disrespect . We're unattended - she really neglected us, when we're done- had to wait 15 min for her come to table- of course, much more important for her wad to watch that tv program...we left disappointed .
