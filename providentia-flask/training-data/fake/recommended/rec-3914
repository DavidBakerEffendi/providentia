My experience here is met w/ some trepidation. I say that b/c the service for me always makes the experience better. So i'm giving them a 3 star average.  4 stars for the food and 2 for the service. So to start with the 4 star experience of the food. 1st they had $5 brunch cocktails Steak and eggs were delish and my companion had the Persian omelette. We loved the meal even though we didn't want to and this is when I tell you about the 2 star experience.   We waited over 40 mins for food when they were only 6 patrons in the restaurant. How does that happen you ask... by never putting in the order. 3 tables of two we sat down 1st,  ordered 1st,  and got our food last.... ummm not cool. When ask 20 mins in when it was coming out we were told shortly . So 5 mins after that with tail tucked in server informed us that they forgot to put our order in.... and there was no formal apology. The look I had on my face was surely pretty scary b/c the server continued to look at my companion. My companion decided we would stay b/c if i got up i may have started flipping tables. Sadly our drinks weren't comp'd for the crazy wait which would've raised their star level to 4 for handling the situation. Yeah ... that's it...
