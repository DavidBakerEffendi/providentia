I've never had dinner at this place because I'm vegetarian and their veggie options are really limited for dinner. BUT! Their brunch is AWESOME. Two words: banana. pancakes.  I normally prefer eggs for brunch, but at this place I skip them in favor of these perfect pancakes. They aren't heavy, they aren't like those gross greek diner pancakes that just soak  the syrup up and become all mushy. These taste homemade and almost healthy. The egg scramble here is really great too. The menu is really different and a refreshing change from all the usual brunch pancake-and-eggs places. The place has never been super crowded for brunch, which is a nice change in Greenpoint, and the service has always been great. Really friendly and attentive. Hooray Selamat Pagi!
