OK the food is good, but the service kills this place. The bartender and waitress just do not care or remember anything. It took 3 tries before we got our second round of drinks and I am a very patient person. Also had to literally chase the waitress down any time we needed anything and even then it was a 50 50 chance. This place needs a good staff and a manager that's paying attention immediately.
