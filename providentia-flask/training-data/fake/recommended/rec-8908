I have to say this is one of our favorite spots in NY. Not only is the food phenomenal but these guys really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The chefs and staff are very helpful, friendly and accessible. The later one is a rarity since NY restaurants get real snobby after getting media buzz and receiving accolades. The rotating menu never disappoints and the ambiance is always just right. The have a great beer selection, fresh local food and what I consider one of the better collections if hip hop playing in the background to help bring it all together.
