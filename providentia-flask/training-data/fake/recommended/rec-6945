We ended up at Palermo III by default as it was a Sunday evening and our first choice was closed.  Food was very good; and, the service could not have been better.  I am in town from the west coast, visiting family and needed a fix of Trenton tomato pie.  A previous visit allowed me to enjoy the offering at the Rt. 206 location...also great great.
