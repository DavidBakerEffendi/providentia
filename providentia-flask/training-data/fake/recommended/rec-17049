L&B the pizzeria: L&B is my favorite place on earth. I am there every other day. (They actually know me by name -- even when I call!) The pizza is to die for, unlike any other pizza I've ever had in my life. It's all sauce with cheese mixed in. The round is good, too. But the square is what they're famous for so please get that. I always get a riceball parmesan and finish it up with the greatest spumoni in the universe. Delicious! The restaurant is very good too but I mostly go to the pizzeria section and sit down in their outdoor seating area.
