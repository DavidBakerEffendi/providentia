This place is owned by terrible management. I order from here very frequently, despite the fact that 30% of the time the kale in the salad is practically rotten. There aren't too many vegetarian options in the area and so I liked supporting it anyway. FORGET THAT! Today, I ordered a salad with spinach and kale chips. My delivery comes and it's a salad with tofu, no spinach, and I'm allergic to soy. Also, no kale chips!! No problem. I'm a reasonable person. I call them to inform them of this. The woman says they will send out another salad and the kale chips. When the delivery guy gets to our office, he did not bring his ID and was not able to come to my floor. This is an inconvenience as I'm in the middle of a call with a client but I run downstairs so that he doesn't have to wait. I did not remember to bring back the other salad with ingredients that I am ALLERGIC to. I apologized for forgetting and the deliveryman said it's ok. Sure enough, the manager calls me 20 minutes later to inform me that they will be charging me for that additional salad. This is terrible, terrible business practice. I tell her I am a loyal customer and order all the time. She said, "I know that", so clearly it doesn't matter? There are plenty of other places I can order from with nice people, good management, and fresh kale. That's the last time I order from this place now that I know the unfriendly, enterprising management that's behind it.
