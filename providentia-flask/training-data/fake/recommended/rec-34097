I've been here twice. First time was with 3 friends where we just cared to have some good meats, cheeses and pizza. My Trifolati pizza was great and so was the night. So then I put this place to the real test last Sunday-- a birthday dinner for my dad and I where my grandma would be in attendance. She's tough. She wanted scampi (not on the menu) which they happily accommodated. When she then said it was too salty, they obliged and sure enough, quickly, she got a less salty dish. Then she asked for cheese (I cringed knowing it would add the salt she just asked to negate) and sure enough they were so kind and gave her the cheese. She and the rest of the family were super happy with the experience. My Branzino was superb (that mushroom risotto... bananas) and so were both apps, calamari and rock shrimp special. I love when a restaurant has more patience for my family than I have. Thank you, Salute.
