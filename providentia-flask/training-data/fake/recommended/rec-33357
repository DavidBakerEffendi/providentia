My boyfriend James (not his real name) and I went to Heidi's House over the weekend, expecting a sensational meal based on the rave reviews at this charming neighborhood spot. Its sidewalk chalkboard menu and glittering red window lights reel you in from across the street, and we were like hungry fish to plump worms on a fishing rod. We ordered in our usual fashion: James ordered the lighter healthier omega 3 stuff (seafood), while my meat-eating-medium-rare self opted for my norm (hangar steak). Over beer and Montepulciano, we laughed and smiled and chatted easily as if we were on a promising third date (although we recently celebrated our first year anniversary) while waiting for our appetizers. The shrimp tacos delivered well: spicy with cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Then arrived our entrees, and our hearts sank with each bite. James' paella was stir-fried rice with soy sauce, seafood, and dried out chorizo. As any ninny who doesn't even know their spaghetti squash from spaghetti knows, a real traditional paella has at minimum two things: sofrito and saffron. And love. Lots of love. This "paella" didn't. As for my main course, I had a huge beef with my beef (overlooking the fact that I got rib eye steak). It was both overcooked and flavorless and yes, the freshly grated horseradish root on top helped a bit, but it didn't replace what a few pinches of salt and a couple grinds of pepper could. We walked home, hand in hand, a happy twosome, but not with happy stomachs.
