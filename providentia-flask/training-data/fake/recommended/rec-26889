WOW! Disclaimer: I have a bias because I always order the same thing when I go to this place- blackened salmon or blackened scallops salad. But I can't help it! It is so good that I can't get past it. What was that? It's just a salad you say. Not! It is a delicious medley of mixed greens and fruit topped with perfectly cooked seafood. The dressing is minimal. Just enough to moisten the greens without overpowering the taste. Love this place!
