Let's face it: Midtown is a touristy shitshow. Aside from the Garden and some places in K-Town, it doesn't offer much to me. As a result, despite my love for craft beer and the city, I had never been to Rattle n Hum before last week. To be honest, I only went because a friend was visiting and needed to stay close to Penn. Rattle n Hum is an unassuming bar on E 33rd. If I wasn't looking for it, I may not have even known it was there. Despite getting there around 5, it was busy but not terribly crowded, and I got a seat at the bar while waiting for my friend. The bartender handed me a draft and bottle list. The bottle list was quite extensive and organized by beer style. The draft list was smaller, as there seems to be a regular rotation, but organized the same way with price and RateBeer score. Also, since it was Tuesday, they had specialty drafts (Tuesday, evidently, is Tap Takeover night where specific breweries are featured). That night, there were a bunch of drafts from RJ Rockers (SC), which was exciting since I had never tried any of their beer before. I had no problem picking a beer but my friend, upon her arrival, needed a little help. The bartender was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful in picking one she would like (and she did). My friends were more than happy with their food, which came out rather quickly. I only got curry fries, but the curry gravy was tasty. We regretted not getting the awesome-looking nacho tower like the guys next to us, though! There are a few TVs above the bar and the bartender had no problem honoring my request to turn on the Ranger game at 7. All in all, the service, food, and draft list was enough to make me return despite the location.
