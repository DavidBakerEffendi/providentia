I was in Princeton for 24 hours for work and could not have gotten luckier - one of the best meals I have had in a while! The ambiance/seating was beautifully designed. The restaurant has a wine system that allows them to sell nice glasses of wine, so being in a small group/alone, you can have good wine without buying the entire bottle. I started with the tuna tartar which was perfectly made. Then I had a scallop special that was to die for. I finished up with their chocolate trifle and could not have been more pleased. If there is one restaurant in Princeton to go to, this must be it. If there's another one that's better, I will have to plan another trip to come back.
