After a weekend of bar-crawling and terrorizing Philly residents, this was definitely my hands down place to drink! Super atmosphere, crowd, and alcohol. The bartenders were so friendly and chill. I loved their beer glasses, and they described all the infamous Philly residents on them. If you go later on the weekend, like half the place changes into a club..? Fewer tables/bar space available but still fun. Definitely don't miss!
