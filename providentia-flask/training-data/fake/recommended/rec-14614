I braved the wait and got myself a falafel and rice plate. It was cold, I kept getting the steam from the cart in to my face, there were plenty of tourists who were around me that were obnoxious and asking me if I "was a real New Yorker who liked this stand"... No buddy I am on my lunch break and I just want some food. But alas, it was my turn to order, the guy was friendly enough for working at a cart, but I was more impressed with the efficiency and speed they all work in. I ordered falafel, rice, white sauce, hot sauce (extra hot sauce), and 5 or 6.00 and a 20 minute wait (not bad) later I was on my way. I got to my desk and opened it up, dug in, and it was in fact delicious, I suppose in a lot of ways it was better than other halal carts, but I don't know if it is enough for me to continue waiting in that line. I would say go here for sure, I would say I am probably going to go back, but I wouldn't shun your other favorite halal carts quite yet either.
