This is the second year in a row a large group has made the trip to Hen for dinner on the Saturday after thanksgiving.  Our table was ready upon our arrival and soon menus arrived.  Brief explanations were given, everything on the menu was available and we took that as a good sign. My rye manhattan was expertly made (in fact, the Bourbon selection is quite impressive!) and the waiter suggested bottle of wine was perfect to satisfy all the variety of food that had been ordered. The cheese plate is expensive, but worth it. The cheese menu features an amazing variety that will likely satisfy even the most demanding cheesemonger.  The oysters were wonderfully briny.   The kitchen graciously added several small plates to our initial round of appetizers including two orders of a fantastic roll with fresh butter, a plate of perfect pork speck, and a ham dish that was also fantastic. Main courses were all very good.  I personally had the chicken with a side of fingerling potato.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and I was able to cut with a fork.  The potato's, likewise, perfect.  Crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked inside. Deserts.  Well I'm running out of of positive adjectives to use.  Again, all beautifully executed.  The apple crisp was the right balance of sweet and tart. Our entire party was looked after by a wonderfully professional staff.  They always seemed to be there when we needed but never intrusive.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about all of the food offered and made several worthwhile recommendations. As I mentioned before, the drinks were all very well done.  Be sure to check out the bourbon selection which includes Pappy van Winkle (though at $50.00 per serving it's best left to the true aficionados)  I personally enjoyed an after-dinner whistle pig. There isn't much else to say other than this is among my top 3 favorites in New England.
