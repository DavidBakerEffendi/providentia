One of our favorite outdoor spots in Upper West Side. They have a large outdoor, self-serve seating area affording great views of sunsets over Jersey. It's a nice place to stop by after a bike ride or a stroll through the park. We like their burgers (veggie and beef) and seasoned fries. The sangria is delicious and the beer options are good.
