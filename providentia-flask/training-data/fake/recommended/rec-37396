WE finally returned to "The Windsor Diner" formally "Dan's Windsor Diner". Dan is now gone but the bad food remains. We stopped in on Black Friday morning and sat at the counter. Ordered the "Hillbilly Benedict" which was 2 sausage patties on rye w/ 2 poached eggs. What I got was all pre-made. The only thing fresh was the eggs. The sausage was precooked, the hollendaise was as well and tasted off. The home fries were terrible. Partner got blueberry pancakes. Those too were really bad t hat he did not eat even half. He said that they tasted like paste and the blueberries had soured or turned. Also the place is dirty. It needs a good scrubbing. Much of the stainless steel has dirty greasy hand marks. I knew we should have continued on to Stella's in Hartland.
