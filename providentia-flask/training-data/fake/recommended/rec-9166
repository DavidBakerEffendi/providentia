the shishito peppers, trying it for the first time, was really novel and exciting. ramen... maybe i'm not being fair, but they're not even as good as the ones i've had at Narita's food court.  noodle type wasn't my cup of tea, either, though foodie sister claimed that was also "authentic".  it's cool. other foods, was presented nicely and tasty alright. price... NYC range, it's not too bad. the wait... yeah. you know it. but it's seriously a little too dark and too loud inside. all things considered, just can't be a "fan" (i.e. 4-star rating) because i would be quite reluctant to line up that long again for a "been there, done that", especially when there is an abundance of restaurants in the area, offering similar or other cuisines.  is all. no hard feelings, ok?  it's not personal.
