NY's best bahn mi! I've tried the pork belly, veal meatballl, skirt steak and shrimp - all delicious, but the porky belly is really my favorite. The Asian pickled pear really sets it off! Cash only and limited seating upstairs, but always worth the long lunch line. They are strict on their no substitutions or changes rule, which forces me to pick out the cilantro, but it's that good - I'm willing to pick it out.
