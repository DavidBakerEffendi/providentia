Don't be overwhelmed by the crowd, locals and tourists in the know go here for a reason - kimchi fried rice.  The buffet is pay by the pound so don't let your eyes write checks your wallet can't cash.   It's bus selling so where there's a seat, take it.  They have a ready made section which is outstanding.  Overall, this is a great, quick lunch spot.  But, if you have time, they have great sojourn.
