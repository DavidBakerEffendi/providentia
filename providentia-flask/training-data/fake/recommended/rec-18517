I've been eating here regularly since it opened, and it's never disappointed.  I've tried most of their tacos, and they're all delicious, but I'm partial to the pork and fish tacos.  The chicken flauta plate is also great - you get three crispy flautas, rice and beans, and avocado and crema fresco, all for about eight bucks.  I've also tried the carnitas torta, and it's my new favorite. I like that everything tastes so fresh and they give you large, but not crazy, portions.  You'll leave feeling satisfied, but not uncomfortably full.  And everything is so cheap, you can afford to try several different dishes.  I will say that I'm not a big fan of their margaritas - they're a little too lime-y for my taste, but that's just me.  But I do LOVE their guacamole - it might be a little heavy on the onions for some, but I love that. The space is small and fills up quickly, especially on weekends, but it's worth the wait.  I find the staff attentive and helpful.  Definitely a must-try if you are in the area.
