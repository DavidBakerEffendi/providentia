I came here to meet up with a group of friends and thought it was OK. It was quiet enough for talking and we were not rushed. I wanted to try the Laotian food since I have had plenty of Thai.  I had the "Laah" with chicken which I could describe as chopped chicken mixed with scallions, herbs and it was a little tart with lemon or lime juice. I would say it was interesting but I did not love it and would not order that again.  The laah came served with "sticky rice" which is just as it sounds. The rice came in a little bamboo container which was cute except that they lined the container with plastic to keep the bamboo clean.  I don't really like eating food in plastic.   The rest of the group seemed to enjoy their food. The things that looked interesting to me were the King Soup (came in a giant bowl!) the Triple Flavored, and the papaya salad. They offer an early bird special Mon-Thurs which comes with a small cup of soup, a few small satay skewers and a main dish for $15, a good deal, especially as it is BYOB. Overall I would say this is a decent place and probably one of the best options in a neighborhood not known for its cuisine. I would recommend it if you happen to be in the neighborhood but not if you have to make a special trip.
