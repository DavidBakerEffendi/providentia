Big love for this place. Yummy and expansive menu... With so much to choose from, there is truly something for everyone, meat eaters and vegetarians alike... Organic and gluten free options; juices, and smoothies all offered here. Additionally (and quite importantly) the servers are friendly, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the restrooms are clean. My only complaint is the sign out front... I yelped to find this place, but when I walked up and saw the sign, I almost decided not to go in... It didn't really fit the nature of the restaurant, I don't think. I'm super glad I went in anyway! Sorry, guys! Just one person's opinion...
