As good as it gets.  Best service i've ever had in New York.  Matty and Chris have been my servers every time I've been and have been great.  Food is fresh and delicious.  The owner is there all the time and helps make that place what it is.  Favorites are the crab cakes and the clam entree.  Reasonably priced and delicious.
