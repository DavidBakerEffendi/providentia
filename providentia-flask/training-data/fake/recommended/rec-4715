Loved it, had a great experience.  the waiter was spot on, knew his stuff, recommendations were perfect.  we got 4 different dishes, I loved the Mongolian Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, egg rolls were so crisp and fesh tasting, very delicious, we also got the calamari (was a tad chewy--only complaint) other than that I loved it all!   The ambience was very nice with a huge ancient art canvas curved around the ceiling expressing early ancient Asian art (I was formerly a student with 2 art history classes so it was a pleasant sight to see)  I will go back again the PF Changs in the future.
