Disappointed... For so many reasons! Came here on a rainy Saturday evening. It was on the early side - maybe 6ish. I knew we'd have to wait but was heartened when the hostess said 20 minutes... ONE AND A HALF HOURS LATER... We're finally sitting at the bar. We ordered the pork buns and the tuna and avocado... That was all OK, but nothing to really write home about. And then the piece de resistance - the RAMEN!... Was BLAND! I couldn't believe it! I ordered the Chicken and Pork Paitan Ramen and I would only rate it as OK. And then, exactly 20 minutes later, our check was in front of us and we were being encouraged to finish up. With Ivan Ramen's Slurp Shop and Ippudo as neighbors, I see no reason to ever come back here again.
