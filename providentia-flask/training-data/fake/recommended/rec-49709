Kofte Piyaz is a wonderfully charming and delicious place for dinner or lunch. The lamb sausage is amazing as is the almond pudding, which I could eat all day. The coban salad and red lentil soup are top class. As a one person production, sometimes the dishes at Kofte feels a little pre-made and then heated up. But this is still a restaurant with fantastic meat dishes. A wonderful gem and highly recommended!
