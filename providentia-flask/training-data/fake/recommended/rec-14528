If a New Yorker asks for a pizza recommendation I direct them to Rubirosa. The ambiance is cool and it has a full bar and menu. It is better suited for those than have been there and done that when it comes to Lomardi's.  The pizza here is comprised of a scrumptious thin crust and a perfect sauce to cheese ratio.  A family recipe dating back 51 years - originating at Joe and Pat's pizzeria in Staten Island. I'm glad not many know about this place as there is usually a table available.
