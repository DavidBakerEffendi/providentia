So, based on the service alone, it is clear this place is not actually Japanese run, but where they lacked in authenticity, they scored in freshness and flavor. And, when it comes to raw fish, freshness is about all that matters... The Monkey Roll is incredible. Crispy shrimp tempura. Creamy avocado. Drizzled with a couple tasty sauces. Delicious. Delicious. The Deluxe Platter was also a hit. Fresh tuna rolls, Caifornia rolls, and a handful of nigiri sushi. Very refreshing on a hot summer night.
