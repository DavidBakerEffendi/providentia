If you're going for the Sunday brunch get there early as it gets packed pretty quickly.  But that makes sense because the food is amazingly good.  I had the cactus omelette (can't remember the menu name for this) which I'm glad I took the chance on.  The service is really good too, which is extremely important to me, as is the decor and atmosphere.  And odd is it sounds, the bathroom is dope!  LOL   I'm looking forward to going there for dinner one day as others had lunch entrees that looked fantastic.   It seems very accomodating to families as all the yuppies (and there are A LOT) in the area definitely congregate there. The drinks look pretty good too.  Maybe next happy hour?  Will let you all know.  Meanwhile, check out Chavela's folks.
