We were going to a Broadway show and didn't really have enough time to eat beforehand, so called to ask what time the kitchen closed. We were told 11:15pm. We'd found Room Service on Yelp and were really looking forward to eating here. However, after the play we walked all the way there only to be told (at 11:05) that the kitchen staff had just left! We said that we'd called specifically and were told that the kitchen would be open! They weren't at all helpful, asking, "who did you talk with?" and "why didn't you call at 11:00?" Uh, how about because you said the kitchen would be open?!   Sheesh.  The guy says, "there are so many restaurants around, why be upset?"  We weren't making a scene or anything, but we were disappointed - we'd been really looking forward to eating here. Oh well, we quickly checked Yelp and saw that Basilico, just a few doors down, was highly rated and we had a lovely meal there. Thanks for the save, Basilico! Room Service - you could really improve your customer service! Maybe start by looking up the definition.
