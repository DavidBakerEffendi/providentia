Had lunch for 4 here today.  Totally delightful experience, from start to finish.  Two of us had turkey sandwiches -- moist, fresh, flavorful meat on fresh fresh fresh bread -- simply delicious -- and ample portioned.  One of us had the cheeseburger, which he declared was the best he'd had all year.  It was beautifully done medium rare, looked great.  Nice wine.  Amazing sorbet.  Beautiful room full of great energy.  Impeccable service.  A truly enjoyable New York lunch!
