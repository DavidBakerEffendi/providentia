I've been in Philly for a convention for the last 3 days. I refuse to eat hotel food so I hit up a different local spot every day. Today was Paesano's and WOW THIS WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY TRIP! The food was AMZING! I accidently ordered a veggie sub "The Giardinia" but didn't miss the meat it was sooooo good!!! The cooks who were there were friendly, funny and nice enough to let me sample some or their meat dishes too! I can't understand how other places get the attention when their sandwiches are simply sensational! Living in Miami and coming to grips with the reality that this will be my last chance to sample these delictable delights, I ordered The Pasesano & Diavlo subs to take back home. Give these guys a try...if the food doesn't win you over I promise the warm welcome from the cooks "Ron & Flamur" will!! My hats off to the both of them for making this weary travlers trip a memorable one!
