This place is great.  I just moved into the neighborhood and I've been getting delivery from here a lot.  The food is really flavorful and they use fresh vegetables which makes a big difference.  I also love that they don't make the food too oily like a lot of Indian Restaurants tend to do.  Order anything because it's all good!
