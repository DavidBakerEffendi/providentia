It's with a heavy heart I write this review but I didn't think One 53 should be overlooked just because it brings me bittersweet memories of the past.  I came here with my ex-boyfriend FV.  FV lives in Princeton and this is one of his stomping grounds.  FV and I had talked together about my moving to New Jersey and put an end to the long distance stuff.  I was up for it, he was up for it until that fated night in Los Angeles when he broke up with me at Ca'Brea, out of the blue, crushing my hopes and dreams of making One 53 my favorite haunt and local.   The main reason I am all about this place is that it makes the BEST Margarita in the world.  And, I should know as I live in Dallas, have lived in Houston, visit Austin and California all the time.  Nobody had touched the quality of theirs!  This is a huge compliment from me as margaritas are only one of two cocktails I will drink and One 53 makes the best ones EVER. I actually haven't had much of their food.  FV and I sat at the bar and had some small plates, They were fine.  The food looks very good there on the whole.  I hope to come back someday.
