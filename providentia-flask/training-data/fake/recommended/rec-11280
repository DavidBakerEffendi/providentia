Have heard about Han dynasty and how good it was for over a year... Bf and I were super excited... But ended up being disappointed and a bit sick to our stomach after meal. First of all on a Saturday night we were in and out in 40 minutes, kind of a disappointing date night. Then there was the food. Dan Dan noodles were so hot my mouth went numb and I cleared three huge glasses of water and felt a bit woozy from the 1/2 gallon of water I now had in my belly.  The dumplings in chili oil had no meat in them at all, all they were empty dumplings soaking in oil!! Garlic pork was edible but not great. Salt and pepper shrimp was ok as well but everything was soaked in oil it was hard to enjoy meal. Maybe the fast service is to get you out before the stomach ache starts because by the time we got home (5 blocks away) I was doubled over in pure pain. It was  as if Dan Dan himself punched me in the stomach! Overall we will not return - too many better options for this Asian food lover! Skip Han dynasty and go to Chinatown. Vietnam or lee how fook... Two of the freshest, cleanest, most delicious places on 11th street.
