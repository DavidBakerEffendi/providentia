My one and only dining companion (i.e. boyfriend) have been planning to go to ilili for a while, and our expectations built up as our date approached. Well, ilili really delivered on all of our expectations! We grabbed a drink at the bar until our table was ready, then the hostess led us upstairs to our table. The whole atmosphere was very swanky, and I hesitate to label places as very "New York," but this place was very New York. Especially the bathroom. Do check out the bathroom. Our server (Megan) was so friendly and attentive and brought us a tasting of sauvignon blanc. We immediately picked our 4 appetizers from the Restaurant Week menu. Warm, fluffy pita bread was brought out, which we tried to dip in all our apps: the mouhamara (walnuts/pepper paste), sweet corn and cheese (served in a skillet), and octopus. The lebanese thyme salad, our rourth pick, was very fresh and light. One thing that really impressed me was that although we premedatedly Â saved a piece of pita bread for our dinner, Megan brought us more fresh, hot pita bread without us asking! We enjoyed it with our entrees of the farro rissoto and the gnocchi. I never knew Mediterranean could do pasta so well. The guy who brought out our dessert was really friendly also, making jokes as he poured the chocolate sauce over the ilili candy bar, which was chocolaty and rich, and definitely 1 portion, as it was difficult to share. Of course, we also shared our second dessert, which was a lebanese custard. It had a thick orange sauce on it, and against the liquidy custard, it looked like an egg sunny side up! It was a really playful take on a dessert, though Megan wasn't sure if it was supposed to resemble an egg. My #1 dining companion and I will definitely be back, especially since they extended restaurant week!
