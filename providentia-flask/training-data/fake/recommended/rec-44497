I went here for a work lunch. The restaurant had a nice, casual vibe with a lot of good conversation without being deafening. It seemed popular with both solo diners and groups. Service was a bit slow but overall average. I'm not a complete lover of lunch cafe fare (plain salads, heavy pastas and pizzas), but I was starving that day and welcomed carbs in all forms. The bread that came before our meal was cold, but the olive oil was delicious and drew table-wide approval with its fruity and peppery notes. An appetizer of eggplant parmesan was ordered for the table, but one serving is way too small for more than two people (or one hungry person) and it was odd trying to slice up pieces in the tiny circular dish it was served in. For my entree, I ordered the pacchari, which was very good and a worthwhile pasta dish for someone who doesn't indulge in it often. Pasta was al dente and the cheese and sausage were plentiful and very filling. A little pricier than what I'm used to for lunch. I'd recommend it for families or groups just looking for something casual and with food options for everyone to agree with.
