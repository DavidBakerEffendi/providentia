Erin and I came here for lunch today for the first time.  We read the great reviews so we wanted to try it.  The place did not disappoint!  We had the lobster roll combo and the crab roll combo, both we asked for without mayo.  They were amazing.  The fresh taste of the seafood was all you could taste, as rolls should be.  They were amazing.  Cant wait to have another!!
