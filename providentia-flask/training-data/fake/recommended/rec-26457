Needless to say, wasn't worth the money or the time. I'm confused as to why this place is so popular. -acoustic is terrible and music is loud; don't bother trying to have a conversation. - food's all too sweet. If you want real tofu, go to cho dang gol; Seoul Garden has better tofu too. - service is all over the place. Â Can't get attention. Trying to get out of there took too long. - price is higher than at other tofu places. For what you get, it's not justified. Overall, one of worst dining experiences recently. Will never go back.
