Healthy portion, but pretty salty.  Def no MSG, but they're covering something up with all that salt.  3 of us went for dinner, pretty casual place.  One thing that struck me as ridiculous was the fact that everything took such a long time to come out -- it's an asian restaurant, is that even possible?  It wasn't packed, there were people at every other table.  We also got there at 730PM on a Thursday. I think the whole think lasted about an hour and a half from being seated to leaving.  I wanted my food and then to leave within 45m; that's what I expect from an asian restaurant -- not that hard to stir fry, and dump salt. The decor was fine and it felt franchisey (I think it is a franchise), but I think the place fails horribly in terms of cooking.  No asian food should take the time it took -- pad thai, mango chicken, eggplant? Roti was good.  if you could, just come for the Roti and leave.  Unless you want elevated blood pressure.  I find it hard to believe that people gave the place five stars -- you like the decor and the staff, but it's a franchise- you thought the food was consistently good, but do you also happen to love salt? One last repeat -too salty -too slow = bad asian restaurant
