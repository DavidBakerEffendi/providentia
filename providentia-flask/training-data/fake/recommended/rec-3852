My husband and I were strolling down 5th ave to try new places for brunch and we came across Miriams. At first, the menu in the window left much to be desired, but when we sat down and they handed us a more detailed menu, I was sold. I ordered the poached eggs in tomato sauce..it came with tasty hummus, a warm pita and I ordered a side of lamb sausage....IT WAS DELICIOUS! The sausage was orgasmic, and the eggs with the tomato sauce was great. I've been craving mediterranean food ever since I left that culinary brunch heaven.
