It's a house, you will miss it the first few times you drive by it. It's really, really good so its worth going around the block a few times. Tiny on the inside, but a nice atmosphere regardless. The only thing I will add to everyone else's thoughts: Top 5 Pad Thai I've had. You get nearly 10 pounds (perhaps a mild exaggeration) for $8.60, and its good, to boot. That should be reason enough to venture to Parkville, right?
