I was just here for my birthday and I cannot say enough great things about this place! If you're looking for an amazing restaurant, this is it!! The ambiance is so beautiful, filled with nothing but cool lamps, flowers, and candles. I had specifically asked to be seated in the back with the retractable roof but it was cold out so they instead kept it closed and started a fire in the fireplace. The food was a bit pricey but it was all delicious! I highly recommend the goat cheese and tomato sauce dish, garlic and buttered shrimp, and the hummus toast. There was not one cocktail on the menu that we didn't enjoy; half the initial reason I booked here was for the drinks and I was not disappointed. The entire staff was extremely friendly and they went above and beyond what I'd ever expect. The hot bartender in the front made the best drinks and he was very attentive to us. And Donald, the owner, not only check in on us continuously to make sure we were taken care of, but he graciously walked my party over to the speakeasy next door and cut us to the front of the line. My night got started on the right foot because of Salinas - thank you, Salinas!!
