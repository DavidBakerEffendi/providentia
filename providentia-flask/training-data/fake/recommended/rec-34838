The amazing thing about the Edison area is this bizarre experience of feeling like you took the wrong exit off the Turnpike and wound up in a suburb of Delhi. This is the kind of off the beaten path local place that you could never find pre-Yelp. In a dinky strip mall behind the "downtown" of Iselin, it is nothing to look at. But the food totally belies its unassuming package. Everything was top notch - fresh and spiced perfectly. And all for a very reasonable price. The fast casual format is really not like anything else I can think of. It's billed as a quick bite restaurant, and I think that's a nice thing considering eating South Indian is often a belly buster. But the Thali, which we ordered, is a huge and filling meal. I think this will be on our short list of go-to spots in Edison. Its worth traveling to if you in search of a true foodie experience.
