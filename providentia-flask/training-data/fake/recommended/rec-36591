I tried to go there around 1pm on a Saturday and was turned away because I didn't have a reservation and all of the walk-in seats were full.  I called and got a reservation for 10:30am the next day, and there were significantly less people waiting outside when we got there. I got the Eggs Norwegian (like eggs benedict but with smoked salmon), which was delicious.  I tried some of the scrambled eggs and puff pastry, and the puff pastry was buttery good.  The french fries that Bobby Flay raves about on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" were good, but not good how he describes it.  He likes the fries because of their crispness.  Maybe the top 1/4 of our fries were crisp, but the rest were pretty soggy at the bottom.  I like all kinds of fries, so the sogginess didn't bother me - in fact I liked them better the more I ate them, but they just weren't how Bobby Flay described them. The sticky bun from the bakery is the best sticky bun I have had yet.  The pumpkin scone was like any other scone.
