My boyfriend told me told me this was the best pizza in Philly. I don't know if Philly has any great pizza, but my boyfriend told me this was the best. We stopped by the Spring Garden location said it didn't look as good as the other, so we ventured on. After all of the hype, I didn't think either pizza I tried actually tasted good. We had a slice of white pizza with spinach and tomatoes while we waited for our veggie pie +chicken. It was absolutely loaded with vegetables. The chicken was fresh sliced grilled. In that sense, I couldn't have been happier. The crust was thin and perfectly cooked, too. Â I really do wonder if it was the cheese. The customer service in the place is great, too. Really helpful, really friendly, really professional.
