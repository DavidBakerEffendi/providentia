Great drinks, especially the winter old fashioned!  YUM.  Good vibe.  I agree that the upkeep of the place could be better during busy hours, like the bathrooms and the tables.  But no complaints about the overall food and service.  It's nice to have a bartender introduce himself to you -- it makes you want to go back again and again and again....
