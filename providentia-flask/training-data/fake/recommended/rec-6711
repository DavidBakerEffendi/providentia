I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. Went here for brunch yesterday. Â The food was good but maybe not worth the wait if you're not drinking ($14 for eggs, potatoes, tea, and juice is a little steep in my book.) We had the crab cakes Benedict and steak skillet, along with OJ, a Bloody Mary, and a Bellini. Even though all I was drinking was tea and OJ, I never was offered my free refill (when I asked for another cup of tea they said I could just have more water. Seriously?) Call ahead or make a reservation and maybe you won't be so grumpy when you sit down.
