Don't skip this 5-star review - and I'm not talking about the quality of my writing. Scarpetta is great for their pasta and their effing bread basket. This is the best bread basket, ever. It's a great introduction to the quality of the food, and guess what, like most introductions - it's free. Duck Fois Gras Ravioli - Rich, melt in your mouth. Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil - Delicious but a little overkill on the basil side, leaving the tomato alone and forgotten in a dish that is supposed to highlight both. Linguine with the clams and such - Great, still herby. I'd put my money on the Duck Fois Gras Ravioli. Atmosphere was great, large restaurant but has an intimate feel. Date place solid.
