Last week I went back to Extra Virgin for the first time in about a year and a half - and I'm happy to say that I still love this place. Granted the wait can be ridiculously long for weekend brunch, but the spicy bloody mary's make the wait a little more fun. This is a perfect spring/summer time place also with the outdoor seating or even sitting by the window (like my friend and I did) with the sun shining in. They even cracked the doors open since it was such a beautiful day. My FAVORITE thing that makes me dream about this place is its french fries and gorgonzola fondue. It's not necessarily an outrageously unique thing either - but something about it is truly comfort food and every time I go back to NY they still have it on the menu (please don't ever stop!). Another favorite is their eggs benedict which they serve with crispy bacon rather than Canadian (I didnt have it this trip, but I assume they still serve it this way). I am an avid eggs benedict eater and I must say this is one of my favorites! So if you're not totally starving on a weekend and have a little time to spare, stroll on by for brunch and have a bloody mary while you wait! * Note - our server was very nice and had no problem splitting the check with two credit cards - always a plus.
