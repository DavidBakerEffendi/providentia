This is one of my favorite places to eat whenever I'm craving non-Asian food. My two favorite items by far are the hummus dish (an excess amount of toasty warm pita bread triangles with a HUGE amount of delicious hummus, plus olives - all for $5)... and the asparagus appetizer (again, a large portion of roasted asparagus drizzled with olive oil and seasoning - for $5).  These two items alone are enough to put down any one eater.  One time I got the meatloaf only to find out it was vegetarian.  Not a problem really... but the eggplant became a bit too much at the end. I've never seen a show here though, nor have I even been upstairs.  I tend to not really care about the bands that come through here.  I don't listen to too much ''hip'' music.  But I know Witch and Graveyard came through Johnny Brenda's last year, and I really wish I saw them.  Oh well. The downstairs booths are great, what with their glowing table lights and tiny box windows.  And the downstairs men's bathroom has always been sparkling clean and completely unlike what you'd expect - a nice touch. The beer selection is fairly deep.  Prices are average-to-high.  People like to rave about the Lionshead here, but... I'm from the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre valley.  And I'll tell you folks, Lionshead doesn't have much going for it (unless of course you like going to the bathroom every half hour), except that it's cheap.  I guess that's why people here like it. The best way to get here from center city is to take the EL eastbound to the Girard stop.  It's only a block or so walk from there.  Just be careful if you're planning on using SEPTA as a way back, as the last westbound train leaving Girard is usually about 12:16 AM.  So plan around that, or take a cab.
