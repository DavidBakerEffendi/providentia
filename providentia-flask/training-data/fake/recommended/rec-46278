Coolest place in NY. I am lucky enough to have an "in" so I get to go about twice a year. I have seen some really cool things in this place. Sports stars, politicians, billionaires, models, wall street tycoons, actors,wiseguys all just another night at Raos. The cast of charactors who work there are terrific. Once you are in they treat everyone the same, whether they are famous or not. People check their attitude at the door no matter who they are. The mood in here is great, everyone is there to have a good time and relax. If you are lucky enough to get in remember the table is yours for the night and it is cash only. Â There are no menus, but they will make just about anything you want, the food is soooooo good. This is typical meal for a table of four when I go. We start at the bar around 7:00pm have a drink and listen to Nick the vest tell stories. Next step Joe seats us at the booth and goes through the food offerings. It is all family style everyone shares. I usually start with roasted peppers, seafood salad, baked clams, and mozzarella en carozza. Then we have two pastas, a taste of shells in a red sauce and some with garlic and oil with sausage. Next the meatballs, they are insane best in the world!!. Then we go with some lemon chicken, veal parm and sometimes some steak.. Dont be afraid to save some room for cheesecake and homemade ice cream with your anisette and coffee. .
