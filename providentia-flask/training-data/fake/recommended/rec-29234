I was there last night with a group of 5. The food is good & the prices are even better. The one major issue I had was with our waitress. I don't know if it was due to cultural differences but she was all over me with ridiculous physical contact. When she came to the table she stood next to me to take our orders. Instead of moving to each person she kept leaning on me, across me, in front of me, etc. At one point she leaned over so far that she had my head bent to the side. It was ridiculous. When I finally said something she backed up but never apologized. EVERY TIME she came back to the table she managed to bump me. It was insane. It was a busy, loud, crowded Friday night but this was just over the top rude.
