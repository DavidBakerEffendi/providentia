Let's just say, for dinner one night, I had a hunk of their sourdough bread, some housemade white sangria honey and a giant chunk of Oregon smoked bleu cheese.  Sad but true and worth the 25,000 calories I ate that night.   Have also had a family dinner there, did the tasting menu and was not disappointed.  Got plenty of each dish for everyone to try, server was cute, attentive and informative and didn't feel pressured to give up the table after dessert.  Grabbed a casual lunch here (veggie sandwich was great), wonderful olive oil, cheese and dessert selections and really good whole bean coffee as well.  Great concept by Jose Garces.
