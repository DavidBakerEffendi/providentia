Now that I am somewhat of a local. I would rather eat glass then to eat at the restaurant. Pepe's pizza is really the best around, so now we only do take out. My suggestion to speed up the onset of heart disease....bacon pizza. So good and worth an extra day at yoga. We also get the chicken and mozzarella, and the tomato and basil when it's available. So pick up your pizza, and watch people stress out because they think you are cutting in line, and then smirk at them as you jauntily stroll past with your pizza.
