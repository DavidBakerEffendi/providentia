I went here a week ago and will definitely be going back. I have been to a couple of Ethiopian restaurants in the past and always jump at the opportunity. As have been said in other reviews, it is a coffee shop/ restaurant. I would have to say the latte I got was just alright and not spectacular. But the food was great. I got some spicy beef stew, which was comparable to my past experiences. The chef/owner was also quite a lovely and lively person to chat with. The only thing I would change: since I got my meal to go, the injera (bread) was quite soggy by the time I ate the meal. So next time I'd recommend packing the injera separate from the soup/stew.
