After being good about cooking breakfast/brunch at home for months, I finally gave in and went to Isabella's. I had heard about before, and it truly lived up to expectations. We arrived around 1:30pm on Sunday, thinking we'd be waiting at least 30 minutes. Instead, we were able to sit immediately in a cute corner table. I had the crab cake eggs benedict, and my friend has the filet mignon eggs benedict. Both were rich and tasty and sure to keep up us well-insulated against the cold weather for the next few days (err..maybe even months). The service was fast and friendly, with the staff ensuring that our water and coffee was constantly full. The best surprise of all, though, was the check: $30 (including tax) for two people?!? I've paid that much at crappy diners. I will certainly be back the next time I have friends/family in town.
