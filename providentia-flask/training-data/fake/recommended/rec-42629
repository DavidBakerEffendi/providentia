Went here last night with a reservation.Still had to wait because some big shot had our table and would not leave. Nice wine list that did not seem over priced. For dinner I had veal saltimbuca. It was good. Others had chicken cacicitori that they said was very good. One had a veal chop that was served with a parm topping. He liked it. All dinners came with a salad, nothing special. A family sized bowl of pasta was placed on the table to share. It was ok. Prices seem a bit high, but all in all not a bad meal.
