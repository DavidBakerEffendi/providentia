Went here for the first time last night with my hubby. We were seated right away, for a BBQ place it wasn't busy at all for a Sat night. We order fish tacos for starters and let me say it was blah. It had no flavor at all... it was just a piece of fish inside tortilla, and they give you a small thing of green sauce to put on the fish. I've had better fish tacos. My hubby order ribs with mac and cheese and beans ($26). I ordered chicken with mac and cheese and collard green ($15). When the food arrive we were like WOW it looks and smells amazing.... but, Looks Can Be Deceiving. My hubby ribs tasted like rubber, it was like chewing rubber.. seriously.. and it was medium rare when he asked for it to be well done. He didn't eat it at all, he only ate the sides. My dinner was just OK.. the mac n cheese was OK, it was very dry, the chicken was a bit burnt. The greens were terrible.. I had to ask the waitress to take them back and bring me some sweet potatoes fires (which was soo oily..omg). Â They give you four sauces so that you can try different ones. We only used one because all the other were very watery and had no taste/flavor. The food was disappointing... I was excited at first, but once we got our food... we were both super disappointed. Since my hubby didn't eat the food, the manager came over and asked if everything was OK. We said, No, he didn't like the ribs, he then went on to explain that the ribs are in a roaster for 20+ hrs and that is why it taste that way. Customer services needs work, our waitress came to take our order, then brought our food, and that was it. She never came back to check to see if things were OK. We had to ask another waitress to get our waitress for us. On that Sat night, they had a band playing, which was pretty cool. The atmosphere is pretty nice, wish the food was better
