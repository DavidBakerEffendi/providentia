If this place is really the "best of Little Italy" I suggest it changes its name to "Little What the fuck, apparently none of us have actually gone to the real Italy". Definitely nothing to write home about. The food was alright... I guess. Way more expensive than it should have been. Italian food is probably the easiest thing to get right. We regretted coming here, and we were in LITTLE ITALY. I've had better Italian in places without ITALY in its name. Plus, I hate walking down Mulberry street. Every place on that street seems way more concerned with getting your money than providing you with a good meal. I don't like feeling like i'm getting hustled when I'm trying to eat a meal.
