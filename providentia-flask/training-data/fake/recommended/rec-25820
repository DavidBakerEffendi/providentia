Don't be fooled by the overweight amicable owner who seems so "authentic" and the "cozy" "old country" feel of this place. If that's your thing, i get it. But it doesn't make the food any more than average. This place is like a cute girl with a great smile, but then you get her naked and her vagina has teeth that eat your masculinity raw. Does that make sense?
