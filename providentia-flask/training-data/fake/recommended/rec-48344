We came here because my fiance wanted to try wiener schnitzel.  My fiance ended up going with the Jaeger schnitzel, and I ordered one of my childhood favorites, chicken paprika.  The chicken paprika was disappointing, you couldn't really taste the paprika and instead of a chicken breast it was some drumsticks, making it difficult to eat with a knife and fork.  My fiance's Jaeger schnitzel was OK, but he said it wasn't worth getting again.  We did get an bread pudding for dessert, and that was phenomenal, worth coming back for that.
