This is one of our local go to Thai place. The pad thai is as good as everyone states. But to be a thai restaurant, you have to have good pad thai. The mango chicken is always good. And so is the Crispy Pork and Crispy beef platters. Friends said the vegetarian food is good as well. The staff is somewhat ok. We had a string of eating here for almost a week straight and we were treated like just some random first timers every time. But then again I go there to eat and not to BS with the staff. But if they did, I def would be going there more often. And please spice up the dining room a bit.
