FOOD: 4/5 Yummy! Beef shawarma was good and nicely displayed. We also had some delicious cheese balls, and the Kibbeh bi laban was absolutely delicious! Food and drinks here altogether were a bit pricey for Mediterranean food, but considering I judging based on Philly prices, my perception might be skewed. SERVICE: 4/5 Decent service! Unfortunately the bartender accidentally spilled some water on my phone; I haven't had a chance to go to the Apple store and assess the damage but it seemed that the power button was broken at the time. Regardless, the bartender and manager handled the situation with great professionalism and in the end, I was pleasant with the way they dealt with the situation at the time. Aside from this, the only disappointment was that we weren't offered to have our coats taken to the coat room and that I had trouble matching up my food with my order. AMBIANCE: Â 5/5 Came here on a whim so we got placed at the bar, but the atmosphere looked great. Dim lighting, loud enough where I can't hear the people next to me, altogether a nice, yuppies filled restaurant.
