Went there for takeout last night 4/4.  Possibly the worst chinese food i have ever had and i get chinese often.  Bought 2 combination plates. The egg rolls were soggy and almost all breading. The fried rice had no taste and very little pork. Also had chicken with mixed vegetables, the veggies werent badbut te sauce was very overpowering and didnt taste very good. The general tsos was not crisp and again bad sauce, worse than a jar.  The brocolli was good though.
