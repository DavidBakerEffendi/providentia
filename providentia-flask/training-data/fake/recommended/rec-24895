OK, this place is located right across from Rittenhouse Square. It's a high end place with a few tables located on the sidewalk. The scene is definitely high end trendy. Lots of movers and shakers, lots of good looking women. I did not have their famous burger, I was out with my buddies and didn't want to mix food and beer. It always screws me up. Anyhow, I highly recommend Rouge for an after work beer and burger.
