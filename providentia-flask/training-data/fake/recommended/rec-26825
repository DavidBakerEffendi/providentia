I went there for a business lunch and I will say first that I did not order any alcohol, so I can't speak for their martinis. I had the Cobb salad, which I was told is very well done there. With the salad being talked up by my colleagues, I was expecting something spectacular, but it was just okay. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the Cobb salad. Maybe I'll go back and try something hot from the menu, but I definitely won't be rushing back over there.
