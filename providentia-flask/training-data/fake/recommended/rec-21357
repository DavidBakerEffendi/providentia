Can be fun on weekends, a good spot for college students. The atmosphere here varies greatly depending on what day of the week and time you go. Trivia night was dead and as others said, everything started pretty late. The snacks were okay, but nothing amazing. The drinks are decent and the bar staff is helpful and friendly. Went there Friday night and there was a $5 cover. The drink prices in general seemed actually low. Mixed drinks for $5 all night? Wasn't sure if that was advertised or not. The dance floor is tucked away in back and was really jumping by about 11 p.m. Girls in skimpy outfits were holding bottles with fire/fireworks shooting off. Kind of neat. The pool room sucks. The tables are missing balls and have duplicates of other balls. There's never chalk, the sticks are broken and the machines don't always work. Bottom line, if you're a college student or just want somewhere to dance or grab a few quick drinks, this place is fine. Keep in mind that there may be a cover and girls there can dress extremely skimpy. So much so I don't think they'd be allowed to walk on the streets like that. The food and drinks are okay, but the pool room is, for a lack of a better word, ghetto.
