I also just can't get behind all of the negative reviews. This place was such a breath of fresh air and a great time. If you are starving and looking to get a table somewhere in 15 minutes or less, this place isn't for you. But if you want a good way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon - Brooklyn Crab can't be beat. We took the Ikea ferry from Manhattan and walked the few blocks to the restaurant. Got there about 3pm because we wanted an afternoon of drinking beer, eating lobster and playing cornhole. It was great. We played cornhole and had a beer while waiting the 30 minutes for our table. Had great lobster and plenty of sides. The lobster wasn't cheap but wasn't outrageous either. I am amazed at all of the people complaining that they spent a lot of money -- it's lobster! If you don't want a steep bill then order the burger for $8. Â Our waiter Fred was super nice and super accomodating. Honestly I think anyone reading the negative reviews should take it with a grain of salt. Sure it is a new restaurant and has some kinks to work out but it is definitely worth giving a shot.
