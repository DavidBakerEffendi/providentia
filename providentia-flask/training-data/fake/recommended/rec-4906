I was in town for a wedding, and my friend took me to the grand opening of Las Bugumbilias (which for full disclosure purposes is run by her niece). Oh my god, do they know how to cook! Really creative, complex flavors. No relation to tex-mex, think much more subtle combinations of flavors and textures. It was hands down the best mexican food I have ever had. I had a seafood soup which was full of flavor and and great and my friend had the cream of carrot soup which was also heavenly. I had salmon as my main dish, which came with a tomato salsa and rice, which was also perfectly cooked and moist and full of flavor. The atmosphere is really cute. Tables and dishes from Mexico, and the cutest salt shakers you will ever see. Vegetarian options are not so good, but they say they will whip something up if you ask. Definitely, definitely, definitely worth going out of your way for. Josh
