I came here on a Thursday night.  I made reservations for 4.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly.  I brought my wife and 2 kids (6 and 8).  We were seated in the back with another table with young children.  This was nice for us that there were other kids by us.  We mentioned that we had a groupon and they gladly accepted it.  We brought a bottle of our favorite wine for the evening since it's BYOB.  The wait staff was attentive and courteous.  We started with the pumpkin soup and ham croquettes.  The croquettes were hot and crispy and the soup was very rich and tasty.  My wife thought it was a little on the sweet side, but I loved it.  I ordered the mango chicken and she had the shredded pork.  Both dishes were good and the portion size was just right.  They also have a kids menu, so my kids split a chicken tenders and fries dish. They also had Shirley Temple drinks.  The amount was good for the both of them.  For dessert we had the coconut flan and the guava shells.  The desserts were yummy as well.  We weren't aware that they had a live band that night, but it was a nice surprise.  It wasn't overwhelmingly loud where you couldn't have a conversation without yelling.  It added a nice touch to the evening.  The place was filled and there were even people eating outside.   Overall it was a good experience.  I just have to warn you that the prices are high.  You can get similar food (although not as fancy) for less than half the price at take out places in Passaic, Kearny, Newark, etc.  What you're paying for is the atmosphere and the location.  Again, I used a groupon which made it worthwhile.  I like the place and will be back in the near future.
