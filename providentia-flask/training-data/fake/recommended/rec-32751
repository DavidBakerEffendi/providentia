I have to say, this is one of the BEST mexican restaurants that I have been to in a long time. They had exceptional prices, food, and drinks. Their service was awesome, servers were quick to come to the table! One of the best fish tacos I have had in awhile, and their happy hour drink menu was delicious. Although the drinks were a tad small, they were potent and delicious! Have already recommended Bartaco to many of my friends, and I will continue to do so! Cannot wait to visit again :)
