Been here several times over the last year with both large and small groups, usually on the weekends. Can get crazy at times but food and drinks have always very good. I mostly get the steak sandwiches (which are made with real steak BTW) and all have been great. My daughter usually gets a burger and she gives them a thumbs up. The wife loves the full NY strip dinner but it is a little pricey IMHO. Great selection of beers and tons of TVs to catch your favorite game. Can get a little loud but a very good choice for dinner.
