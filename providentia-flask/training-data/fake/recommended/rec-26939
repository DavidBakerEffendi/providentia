The real key to their success is the design - Song looks like a hip loft-like club in the meatpacking district. And that's a lot of fun because it's so cheap...and it''s in Park Slope. Â Unfortunately, some people do think this is the meatpacking district and come from Staten Island fully dressed up in their guido club gear and bad suits. Avoid on weekends!
