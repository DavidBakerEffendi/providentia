Stopped by philly and did the Genos vs Pats comparison. Both are epic fails. For those who plan to try or go out of their ways to do so; DON'T. IT's all ridiculous hype - PERIOD. Flavorless meat, cheese from a can and fails to live up to the worst expectations. Me and my friends were beyond disappointed. Pissed was more like it. Definitely have had far better cheese steak served to me from college dining hall at a cheaper price too.
