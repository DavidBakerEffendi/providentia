We wanted something light for lunch and came in here on cold Fall day. They have soup, sandwiches (cold or warm), wraps, salads, smoothies, juices, froyo, etc. Being from California, I love that they post their nutritional information on their menu. The employees here are all very nice and attentive. Two of them helped me select a vegetarian wrap for lunch which was really delicious! You can also customize it to your liking as well (no olives for me!). The shop itself is clean, has plenty of seating, good music, TVs, reading material, etc. Glad to have found a quick and healthy go-to lunch spot in New Haven. Can't wait to return!
