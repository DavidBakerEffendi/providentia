Jose Pistolla's is a dive bar- and I am not really into dive bars. So take this with a grain of salt. I went here after work this past Tuesday with a couple of coworkers. We didn't drink, and that made our waiter angry. Which I guess I can understand. The food was okay. We shared the cheese fries, which were very greasy, drenched in queso and sour cream and chorizo. Then I had the brisket burrito, which was okay. The tortilla was toasted around the fillings, which was nice. The brisket was really greasy and fatty, and the corn in the burrito was jarringly sweet. But the guac was a nice touch and the cheese had a nice flavor. Overall, this place is about on par, burrito-wise, with qdoba. Not bad, but not fantastic either. I might go back if, like this last time, I really want to go to Monk's but there is a 45 minute wait and I am starving.
