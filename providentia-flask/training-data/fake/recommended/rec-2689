This review is based solely on their smoothies. I love fruits. I love fruits that have been made into juices or smoothies.  It makes me feel like I can drink my vitamins, and enjoy a delicious taste, which is always a great lazy way to get vitamins.  B2 has damn good smoothies. They make them with dairy, yogurt, and nondairy (vegan) options.  I've only had the yogurt and the nondairy types, and they were both delicious. They have a variety of fruits from blackberries to strawberries to pineapple to oranges.   They are all decently priced, and definitely fresh.   They also have great space to sit and do work or study.  They are cash only so be warned.
