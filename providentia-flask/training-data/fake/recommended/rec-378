Sharkey is a down to early place. It on the edge of a quiet neighborhood so parking really isn't a problem. The food was great and fast with reasonable price! The servers were nice and friendly! It's a tiny place but it was packed! Â There are a lot of specials on the walls and definitely try Fried Ravioli and their wings!!! Way to go Sharky!!
