I like this place. All the ingredients are locally grown and fresh. It's definitely a healthy and tasty option. Also very vegetarian friendly. The lines can get pretty long but it does move fairly quick. Also make sure to deselect certain options on the pre made selections (I.e. remove the chicken if you want a different meat in your dish) otherwise it will be made with both. I've had the stir fry and the salad so the next stop will be the honey bar. Definitely one of my go to places for a meal.
