Prior to a Red Bulls soccer game I used yelp to find a new place to eat. With the help of yelp we ended up getting a traditional Brazilian meal it what felt like someone's living room. Food and service was great and you could not beat the price. Looking for a family traditional meal this us the place. The only warning is that the food was not Americanized so beware if someone in your party does not like Brazilian food. Although they Â did have great chicken fingers for the kids so you could bring the family.
