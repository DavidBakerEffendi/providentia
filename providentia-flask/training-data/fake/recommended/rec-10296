I'm feeling so many different ways about this place. Ultimately, I think they are trying to do and be too much, which is a frequent downfall for places in Hartford. What I liked: The server was attentive and friendly. She was open about what was available. When part of my order was not going to happen, she came back and let me know quickly. The bartender came over to ask about liquor preferences, and we were not at the bar. The truffle fries were pretty great. Not so much: Early on a Thursday night they were out of so many of the cocktail specials. Not just one, multiple. It seemed unprepared. The bartender offered some suggestions for similar alternatives, which I did appreciate. It somehow seemed odd though that a place selling Veuve and Belvedere was lacking in other ways. The bathrooms upstairs. Is that even ADA compliant? Is there a reason to have patrons do a potty walk of shame? This is in a newly developed mall, so...strange. Entertainment -- they advertised that entertainment was supposed to begin at least an hour before anything ever got started. This seems to say something about who this place is geared toward, and it's not my less-than-young-adult demographic who can't be up all damn night. So, live and learn. I just would return at an earlier hour for food and drink only. Verdict: I want them to do well. They seem to be trying something a little different and the drink I finally got (after several options were ruled out) was solid. The service was definitely better than what I've seen at many other establishments. I'll give them another shot, but maybe after the holidays.
