LA was all bout PHO. In NYC its all bout RAMEN. Nothing better on a cold winters night getting some hot sake and some ramen in yr belly. This place is a trip. Always busy -Reservations - are a must at this place. Nice ambience, cool vibe and nice healthy portions of ramen. yum yum. Unfortunately they don't serve the ramen with a raw egg like some other places and takeout and take-homes are non existent here. so you better come here hungry.
