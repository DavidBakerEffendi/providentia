Staff is friendly,  food is fresh and full of flavor,  atmosphere is nice and the prices are good for what you get. You can take out. There is a bar... delicious sangria. Calamari was good; however the sauce could have been better. The filet mignon in red sauce was very good. The stuffed shrimp is also delicious and so was the paella. Will definitely  visit again! Oh and they offer a party room in the back; however even though the restaurany has private parking, i can see it being an issue.
