I'm still upset with my fellow Texans-living-in-Brooklyn for not telling me about Gueros! I stumbled upon it with a friend after having a few drinks. First let me say that I lived in Austin, TX for six years. I cannot tell you how many times I've longed for a good breakfast taco or, well, any taco, but I had given up on finding any decent Tex-Mex in NYC. And then I found Gueros. I tried the fish taco and the fried avocado taco. Delicious! And the queso? The bomb! (I know nobody says that anymore. Still.) So I asked if they were affiliated with Austin Gueros at all, and they are! They're owned by the same company. This place is a slice of Austin, Texas in Brooklyn and it's about damn time! Check them out. You won't be sorry you did.
