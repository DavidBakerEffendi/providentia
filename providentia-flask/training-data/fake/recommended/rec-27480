Red Hook has been graced with this charming cafe/bar. I'm smitten with the place. I defy anyone not to appreciate the way they do things here. There is an emphasis on getting things just right without a whiff of arrogance. Good people serving good quality food and excellent beverages - Cocktails are lovingly crafted but even the seltzer tastes special. I take my hat off to the proprietor!
