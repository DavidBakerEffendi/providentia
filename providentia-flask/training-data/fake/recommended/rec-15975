Best sushi I had in usa period . Their quality is incomparable to even some great sushi restaurants in NYC. Hands down. The best!!! ( I'm Japanese and I'm impressed) all sushi chief were Japanese . anything they make is up to japanese standard and this is not your typical sushi restaurant in NYC at all. If you like Americanized sushi (California roll, spicy tuna, boston rolls etc) they don't serve that kind of sushi ....
