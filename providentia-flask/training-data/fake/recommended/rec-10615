The food at plum is good. The menu isn't expansive, but what is on there is very good. They also use quality ingredients. The interior of the restaurant is well-decorated. However, I won't be returning. The service was horrendous. It took a long time to take our orders, and it took 20+ minutes for us to get our food. We all ordered eggs. It really shouldn't take that long. Secondly, no one asked us how our food was. Our coffee was not refilled until the very end of our meal. Almost as an afterthought. Perhaps if the restaurant were busier I'd merely suggest they hire more of a wait staff. However, by the time we were there, the restaurant was pretty empty, so there was no reason for the subpar service.
