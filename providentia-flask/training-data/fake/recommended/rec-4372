Went to Osteria with a friend on Friday night and the place was packed! The restaurant's decor was gorgeous, and we were seated in the glass sunroom with a view of the church outside. We had two delicious cocktails and then ordered the famous Lombarda pizza for sharing. It was really decadent and the baked egg was luscious and made for some good dipping. We moved on to the pear ravioli, which was a small portion, but super rich. Next was the rabbit with polenta, which was just falling off the bone. Very good overall. Of course we had two desserts (three if you count the birthday ice cream that they brought out for me). The chocolate cake and the pear strudel were both delicious and came with almond/pistachio ice cream. I loved Osteria and I would eat there again in a heartbeat. I hope that this restaurant helps to give the North Broad area some love and growth opportunities!
