The staff is awesome, especially the one waitress (I am sorry I forget her name, a little on the louder side, but definitely awesome).  She was pretty helpful.  My boyfriend and I definitely enjoyed things such as the wings, the pirogies, and the Frito Pie.  We haven't been there in a while, but we'll be back for dinner, but that's about it.  Not really a place for us to hang out and have some drinks.
