Hmm... I'm not sure why this place is so well reviewed (perhaps because they grow their own herbs, which is pretty awesome.) I had the cuttlefish and mustard green salad. He had the pizza with ramps and pecorino. We both agreed that it was the worst meal we've had in a while. His pizza was burned, the ramps black, and yet doughy and uncooked in the middle. The cuttlefish had so much chili that I couldn't eat it. The mustard greens were literally impossible to chew, even with many minutes of mastication. The bill was 40$ and we barely touched the food, even though we were starving.  Such a disappointment! But we waited 45 minutes for a table at 11pm so something must be good here.  Other friends love it.
