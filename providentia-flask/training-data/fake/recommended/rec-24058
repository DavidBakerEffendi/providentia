The food was great and very authentic. Chili Szechuan is Â cheaper than Han dynasty, but the ambience is not as good as the latter. We ordered online and picked up two dishes; mapo tofu and cumin lamb. Both the dishes were spicy and delicious. However, as per my knowledge, mapo tofu is a preparation of tofu, ground pork and Szechuan sauce and I could not find any ground pork in that dish. Another point is that the spice level of the food was very high. Online ordering does not give the flexibility to customize the spice level-not sure if it can be done in the restaurant. Overall the food was really tempting and scrumptious. I will definitely go there again.
