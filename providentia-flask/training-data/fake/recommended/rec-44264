China First? More like China LAST. Placed an order for me and my wife two combo platters I was told the delivery would take 40 minutes and it too an hour and 20 minutes. I called up and asked politely where our food was and no apology was offered just "the driver was out and he should be there in 10 minutes" That was over 15 minutes ago. The food was fine for the money but they could really use a lesson in customer service. Won't order again.
