Visited today (3 Jan 14) after much anticipation. Turned out to be well worth the wait. I ordered "English fish and chips" while my wife ordered " Italian Frittada". Both dishes were extremely well prepared. The fish was fresh n melt in the mouth. The crust was perfectly crunchy. The dip tasted awesome as well. Coming to service - undoubtedly some of the most pleasant people who have served me lately. An absolute recommendation. I would go there again n again.
