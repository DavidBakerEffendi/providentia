This is an Australian gem in Soho! I hate waiting in line to be seated for food with a passion... if I hear a wait is 15 min+, I'm already thinking I would rather have McDonald's... but brunching with friends means that I have to endure the 45 min wait for a table of four (one of them is Australian!)... And this is the first time that the wait was actually completely worth it... Loved the food, the service, and even the small cafe feel inside. My fav thing on the menu? Banana Bread with Passion fruit butter. Mmm!!
