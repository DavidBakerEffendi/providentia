ruby's is in my nbrhood, and when there aren't people waiting to get into this tiny joint, i pop in at least once every few weeks for a great flavorful unique burger and australian beer.  the place is tiny, and the menu is small - but what to do make, they do it well.  ruby's reminds me of a tiny Father's Office in Santa Monica, CA, where you arguably debase the joint by putting ketchup on the burger cuz it doesn't need it.  but i do anyways.  an bacon.  cause i love them both.  and on these burgers they are extra fantastico!   ;D
