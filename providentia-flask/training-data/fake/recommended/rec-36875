I wish I had known earlier it was BYOB, because I felt really left out of the shameless boozing from all the other patrons at 5pm on a Saturday afternoon. Iced tea's got nothing on a nice glass of pinot noir. Tartine was not on the itinerary, it was more of a my-leg-is-really-starting-to-cramp-and-I-need-a-Â­place-to-sit-to- dress-my-wound-and-drink-some-soup-while-I'm-at-it type of refuge point. I thought it was awesome. The French Onion Soup was all cheese and no soup and the goat cheese croutons were like Bagel Bites but way fancier and much tastier. If I wasn't trying to reduce the size of my ass, I would have definitely sampled the yummy looking dessert offerings but unfortunately, my ass comes first.
