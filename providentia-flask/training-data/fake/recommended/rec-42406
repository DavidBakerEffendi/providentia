good food in vermont if you are a regular to vermont you all ready know great restaurants can be hard to find and expensive when you do.  one of my favorite types of restaurants to find is the "locally owned, somebody trying real hard and loves food" restaurant.  alice's is that kind of place. i promise, you will feel good when you go to alice's.  the atmosphere is very warm and inviting.  the owners are very sweet and they will be glad you are there.  the food is very good.   we have a few good, reliable dishes.  we had chicken marsala and a pasta dish, both were yummy on a cold vermont night.  i liked the salad dressings and the dessert.  the waitress was nice but not up to the prices. i don't like to just recommend restaurants.  if you have read my reviews you know i have a reputation for beating up restaurants that "underwelm" me.  that wasn't the case with alice's.  i just liked it.  i can see myself going back for years to come, bringing friends and hopefully getting to know the owners.  they are genuine and you can tell that they care.  i will go back soon and will tell my friends.   you should too.
