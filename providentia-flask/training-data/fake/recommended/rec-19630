this place is great! a friend and I were looking for somewhere fast and good to eat before rushing to a show. we stumbled upon this place and had a great meal!! we were greeted by a young woman who passionately described the specials of the day, sat us quickly and even pointed out that meal my friend originally ordered wouldn't be good if we were in a hurry. the roasted chicken special was the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I have ever had. I wish we had more time to sit and relax through the meal...next time, for sure!
