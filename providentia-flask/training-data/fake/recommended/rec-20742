i've already gone here twice in one week to eat the cold kimchi soba... the soba noodles have the perfect chewy texture and the kimchi was just right!  it's refreshing on a hot summer day and best of all, healthy and delicious! i like the soba tea afterwards, to be poured into leftover kimchi sauce, a nice way to end the meal.   green tea affogado was for dessert - highly recommended!  gotta go back and try the stamina soba next time!
