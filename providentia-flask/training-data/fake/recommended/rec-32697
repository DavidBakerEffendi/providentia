Really great bar and restaurant in West Hartford. Have eaten here twice and both times the tacos were outstanding. Sesame rib eye, pork belly, Baja fish, curry shrimp tacos were all standouts. Prices are very reasonable (both times the bill for two, plus kids quesadilla, came in at under $60) given the quality and amount of food.
