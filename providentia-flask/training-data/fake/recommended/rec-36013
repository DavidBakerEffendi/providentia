One of my Favorite Restaurants in the City. Always great service and the food is top notch. Luv eating here and as stubborn as I am I always have the Filet as it is cooked to perfection every time and the Horseradish Mash is Deadly(Awesome in Ireland we say Deadly) Never had the cocktails but I always appreciate how much care the bartenders put into making them Highly Recommend
