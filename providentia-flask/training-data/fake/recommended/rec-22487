After visiting Brauhaus Schmitz I honestly could not get enough traditional German food. Bratwurst, Wei√üwurst, Currywurst, all the wursts! I love it! So, when I heard that there was another traditional German spot opening up in Olde City I had to give it a try. I guess due to the relative "new-ness" of the restaurant we showed up at 7pm on a Friday and there were only two other seated tables. I don't mind not having to wait so this sat well with me. The beer selection was great. A good selection of German imports and interesting domestics. I started out with a Schneider Edel Weisse, which was refreshing as always and later tried a Weihenstephaner White Hoplosion which was also really good. The food was also quite good. There is a good mix of traditional German food and modern takes on the style. My fiance and I shared the bratwurst plate, some Piroggen, and "the German Burger". The Bratwurst was flavorful and the piroggen were crispy and not overly smothered with sour cream. The German burger, while somewhat overwhelming in size, was delicious. In terms of comparison to the other "German joints" in the city I would say this is a great place to go with a significant other and have a sit down meal with good food and beer. The food is better than Frankford Hall, but Bierstube doesn't have the raucous atmosphere or Frat crowd (yet!) that tends to frequent there. I somewhat prefer the food at Brauhaus Schmitz, but this is a great alternative for folks in north Philly that don't want to make the trek to South Street or just want to eat some place "in the neighborhood".
