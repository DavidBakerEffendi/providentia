3.5 Stars. I was working in the Metrotech area and got really bored of Panera, Cafe Metro, and all the other lunch places in the area, so I decided to take a walk and give Iron Chef House a try. I'm happy that I did. It's a solid affordable lunch place minus the crowd from the courts and other businesses near the Marriott. The salmon teriyaki lunch special was only $7.35, and it came with rice or noodles, soup, and salad. The meal could have been better. The teriyaki sauce was watery, which I think came from the steamed bed of veggies under the salmon. The salmon itself was a little overcooked, but then again, at less than $8, I don't expect too much. I chose the noodle option, expecting udon noodles, and was surprised when I found spaghetti noodles instead. Regardless, they were dressed in a tasty sesame sauce and perfectly cooked. All in all, I would return. The service is fast, and the staff is friendly and polite. I called in my order for pick up, and after a 7 minute walk, my food was waiting for me. If it's a nice day, take the walk - Â it is approximately 15 minutes from the courts and back, at a leisurely pace, and it's away from the hustle and bustle during lunch hour.
