The key to eating at Keo Ku is to eat the lunch specials!!! I've made the mistake of everyone else having eaten the BBQ and the sushi for dinner meals. To truly get the bang for your buck and have a fresh, server-focused-on-you experience is to go for the lunch. Bento boxes are the best. They include sushi, shumai, glass noodles, an entree, fruit, soup, salad, and the numerous cold dishes they serve. All that for ~$11! I've had lunch specials at other korean/chinese/japanese places and they also serve this style but not as hot off the stove as Keo Ku and not as big portions either. The regular dinner is NOT amazing. The BBQ is eh and the sushi can be better. The prices are sky high for dinner. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a nice Korean dinner.
