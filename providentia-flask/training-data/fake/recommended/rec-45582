Stumbled upon this place when El Vez couldn't take us in for 2 1/2 hours, and was thrilled with the staff, food, and drinks. Although the restaurant was packed, the host was very kind about keeping an eye on the bar until seats opened up for us. The decor and ambience were beautiful and fit in perfectly with the farm-food theme: think antique barn: wood planks, squash, and candles. My boyfriend and I ordered the fig and sheep's milk ricotta appetizer which was a hearty first course that did not fill us up too much. I got the house-made basil lemonade, which was delicious and strong. For dinner, WOW. My boyfriend got the stuffed quail (a special that we hope we can get again) which was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned and served with cannelini beans; also fantastic! I got the smoked pork tenderloin and potatoes with aoli...just amazing. I loved the size of the portions, they were not so big as to make me feel guilty for not finishing, but certainly enough to fill me up. The bartender and host were lovely and attentive. I'd say this restaurant is a must, and I will most definitely be back!
