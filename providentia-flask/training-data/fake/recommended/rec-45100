The food is good, not great here but the service isn't as great as one would expect. Cafe Cluny has great crowd-watching, lots of famous rail-thin models in the restaurant, but it takes awhile to be served and while I understand this is a popular place I am after all, me. That being said their organic salmon is delicious and my friend's hangar steak was pretty good, with a nice accompaniment of fries. Didn't order dessert but the wine, while nice, was tres expensive for a place like this. My advice: if Beatrice Inn is open (which it is not on a Monday) head over there, or down the street to Waverly Inn. If none are available this place will do, but it won't blow your socks off but may blow your card out of your wallet.
