My wife and i were trying to find a place for dinner when we stumbled across this place. We initially tried Marmont. But service was long so we decided to bolt and find another place. Boy was that turned out to be a good call as we came across this place 2 doors away. The beer mussel was what drawn us in and that turned out to be an excellent dish. I also tried the german burger which was just ok. Beer was excellent though and we'll be sure to stop by here again.
