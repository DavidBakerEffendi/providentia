VPB has always been a great fall back bar for me when I lived in Vermont and now when ever I return for a visit. Reading through the below reviews, I see most of the main areas have been covers, so I will focus on what I like about this place. 1.  Sit at the bar alone and you will not be alone for long.  From locals to tourists, this is one of the easiest places I have been to make new friends.  The TV's are always on some game, or ESPN 8.  in other words there are always sports to talk about with new people.   2. Music.   Great bands play here on a regular basis.  The sound is good, though conversation becomes difficult in the main room while they play.  But the times are well posted and if you are not in the mood for music it is easy to find another place for food. 3. Location.  being a block off of church street helps to stems the crowds, and makes it wasier to get a table outside while the weather is nice.  it is a short down hill walk to the water front to help burn off all the beer and burgers you just ate. 4. The service has always been friendly.  Maybe not prompt, but friendly.
