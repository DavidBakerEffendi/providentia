Excellent! Excellent excellent! The cocktails are fun and creative, the small plates are simply prepared and intense in flavor. I still dream about the country pate, and the tuna crudo.... and everything else on the menu. Its priced perfectly, so ordering 4 or 5 items is still affordable. This is a short and sweet review. The space is cozy and feels comfortable, the service is great, and the food is perfect! I will be back often!
