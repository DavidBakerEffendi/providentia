Beehive Oven is a lovely addition to the neighborhood. A charming and authentic experience with THE most delicious food. We had the Ruby, a gloriously divine culinary treat. The corn was a lovely sweet and savory side that should not be missed! The beer and wine selection should make this place everyone's local watering hole: beverages, biscuits and jezebel sauce, pure joy. Not to mention the lovely and genuine staff and owners. A truly personal dining experience. Go for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, stay for the at-home feeling and fantastic food.
