Right across the street from my former  elementary school lies this unassuming, unlabled Vietnamese sandwich shop. My love for Bahn Mi's is deep and I am out satisfying my Bahn Mi Addiction at least once per week in Chinatown. I figured giving Nam Nam a try with it being so close to me would be a great idea. The service is quick here. I walked in at  8:15 pm. I left by 8:23. I ordered a Pork Bahn Mi. Not Spicy. The sandwich isnt packed like the other and cheaper sandwiches I have ordered from other places. And its also a smidgen more than what I pay in Chinatown. The pork was tender. But a little on the peppery side. It was well played though with the house special mayo that they slather onto the bread. The bread was nice and fresh too! The place isnt bad and I cant wait to try their Pho. I will also be back to try the Chicken Bahn Mi.
