Amazing Italian food. This place is small and crowded, like any good Italian restaurant in this city. It seems to be a prerequisite. Owned by the Frank gang, you know what to expect (assuming you are already a fan). The pasta bolognese actually converted me from a vegetarian. It both looked and smelled so good on my boyfriend's plate that I squashed four years of anti-carnivorism to partake. It truly is amazing.
