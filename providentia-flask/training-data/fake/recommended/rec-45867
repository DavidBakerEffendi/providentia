This place is pretty good, the food was tasty and fresh. Which is what counts when it comes to sushi. It had a nice atmosphere. I was wondering the whole time if they had rooftop seating because it seemed like it would. They really do need a liquor license or something. I'm really getting tired of good restaurants in bayonne not getting them. No one goes to those "Budweiser" bars in bayonne. People want to have good food and good drinks. But I have I say deposited that I enjoyed my time there.
