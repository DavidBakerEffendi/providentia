Stopped in for an early lunch while visiting nearby museums. Food was pretty good (eggs Benedict with crab cake), service was mostly good, and decor was really neat. Â However, until a few more people showed, the staff had the music cranked up to late night club levels, including a couple of grating selections that set our teeth on edge and had us considering bolting out of the door.
