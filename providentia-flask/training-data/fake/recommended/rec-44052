Awesome low-key brunch spot on South Street. Cash only. Arrived around 1:30pm on Sunday afternoon and realized that I've never been before because they close at 3:00pm. (Sundays are often a late-start day for me.) I went with one other person who had also never been here before. I read the menu at home before I headed over to Ants Pants and loved what I read! Ordered: The Stack -- So delicious and includes a side salad. Great mix of flavors and the bacon was perfectly cooked. Definitely appreciated the fresh ingredients. Brekkie Platter -- Perfect eggs, bacon, mushrooms, and toast. I loved that it didn't come with cheese, too. Nothing green here, but my over-hard eggs were perfect. No complaints here. Single French Toast -- Had to try something sweet. French Toast was the best I've had in a long time. Not soggy at all and sprinkled with a little cinnamon and powdered sugar. Au Lait -- Delightful coffee with steamed milk. No sugar needed, because this was a perfect balance. Flat White -- Wake up espresso! Perfect with a pretty design in the froth too. Blueberry & Dark Chocolate Milkshake -- Now, this was FABULOUS! Perfect milkshake, and a delicious dessert, as it was ordered to-go at the end of our meal. The decor isn't very exciting, and the place is small, but those aren't things I really care about when I want a Sunday brunch. Bravo, Ants Pants Cafe! I'll be back soon. Oh, waiter was a space-cadet, but obviously I forgave him.
