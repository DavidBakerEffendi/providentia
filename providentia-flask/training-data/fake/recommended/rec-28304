You MUST come here for a cheap date-day adventure. The fried or steamed dumplings are nothing less than magical! Â And the scallion pancake is so good you could wrap yourself up in it like a blanket. No room to sit, but who cares? Go walk around the park or just around in Chinatown. I just... I can't. I want them now.
