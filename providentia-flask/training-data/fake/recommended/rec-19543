We went here for dinner on Saturday night. The outside was packed, but not the inside so we were seated inside. We ordered a pitcher of a white sangria which was really good and we really liked free chips and two salsa dips. Overall, the food was pretty good, experience was just ok, it seems like this place over hyped. The music and place were so loud we had to shout at each other. We may go back there if we are in the neighborhood, but I would go out of my way to eat here.
