I love this place, but they just wrecked it for me. I just took a cab from far away and showed up at 9:30. They said they're closed, even though Yelp and their website says 10PM. The guy was rude about it and said they have a very strict policy on not serving food after 9:30. I asked them to update their hours. If they do that, I'll update my review.
