Came with my girlfriend for brunch after the world cup match between Argentina and Belgium on a Saturday. (Around 2:00pm) The brunch menu had a couple of variations on eggs Benedict (crab cake Benedict, arepa Benedict) and some other traditional egg brunch options. I ordered the arepas Benedict and she ordered the "Three eggs any style with chorizo". Both were absolutely delicious! Pictures are posted. I will definitely come back to this place, but not too soon, since there are sooooo many places to visit in NYC! Five stars, but only because the atmosphere, mood, and food were all working in my favor.
