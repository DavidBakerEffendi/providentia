This is a Filipino "turo-turo" place (you point at premade food) not a restaurant like Max's which people rave about but I've been unimpressed with historically. Apparently I undervalue the experience of waiting 30 minutes for fried chicken and not having to carry your own food two feet to a table. The lechon kawali at Rowena's is amazingly delicious. I have dreams about it at night. The shanghai, BBQ, and fresh lumpia is also good but I really don't think I've ever had anything that was awful there. What I love the most about this place, and I've been a patron for over 10 years, is that the people who work there are ALWAYS friendly (don't get me started on the service at Fiesta Grill), the portions are good and well priced, Rowena herself has always been gracious, and they're accommodating with last minute catering orders. By the way, the people who are saying it's location is inconvenient are clearly not from Jersey City, where much of the population lives within minutes of West Side Avenue.
