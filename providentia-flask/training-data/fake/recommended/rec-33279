I spent the day in Brooklyn with my daughter and she recommended Olea for a late lunch. I had the Green eggs and lamb while she had the falafel crusted artichoke hearts. I loved the creaming cilantro dressing on my omelette and the lamb sausages. Food was out of this world. My tastebuds felt like I was transported to the beautiful Mediterranean. Finished off with a cappucino and chocolate croissants. The service is excellent - they do not rush you to finish. The food portion was just right, the price is right on. The ambiance was great - located in a nice, trendy, not so noisy part of Brooklyn. I am definitely going to find another reason to go back to visit my daughter so I can dine at Olea! I recommend this to anyone looking to taste something different from the usual Brooklyn dining places.
