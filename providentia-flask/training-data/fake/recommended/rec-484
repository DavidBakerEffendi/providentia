Ate here with a friend from Columbia once. I chose this place because it was the most well reviewed Thai restaurant in New York. I had the squid ink pasta which I thought was very salty. The decor is very unique and seems to have spawned a host of copycat places such as Qi and Viv. Prices are typical of NY Thai places and service was not good or bad enough that it made a lasting impression.
