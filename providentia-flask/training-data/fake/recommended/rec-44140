There are other carts in the city that I enjoy immensely for other reasons, but the combination of the experience, the sauces, and the method by which they cut up the chicken/lamb to avoid gristle and other no-nos make this a must-have experience for anyone not afraid to dine from an establishment that does its business on the side of the street. At least its a relatively classy street, near the tony shopping of fifth avenue and the Hilton which has helped me to locate this cart while drunk on more than one occasion. Now, I've noticed another reviewer mention the other locations: I myself just noticed that last night. But I do have to say the camaraderie and experience of waiting in the long line are a vital part of the experience. I hate to curse the other locations any more (they rarely have any sort of a line), but I think this location has got to be it. Most get the rice platter, but personally, I think the 4 dollar sandwich is the best. Of course I was raised by a man who looked forward to post-dinner leftovers for sandwiches more than the main course, so I might be biased. But the sandwich is the perfect post-bar meal, compact, greasy and flavorful. One final note, which I'll say as discreetly as I can.. don't go too crazy with the hot sauce, or you'll be reminded throughout the next day of what you had for dinner at 2 AM the day before.
