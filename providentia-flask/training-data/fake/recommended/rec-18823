In addition to being a fabulous wine bar, Riposo 72 has also recently started offering brunch.  It is fabulous!  I recommend the mixed fruit pancakes with strawberry butter, the prosciutto eggs benedict, and the smoked salmon with goat cheese and fresh dill.  But, those are the only things I've had so far so I imagine everything is good!  Check it out!
