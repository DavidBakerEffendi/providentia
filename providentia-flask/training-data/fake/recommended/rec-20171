All of our meals were delicious, as was the bread basket, but the clear star was the lamb shank.  Fall-off-the-bone meat and a huge portion. BYO is great.  This place isn't overpriced for the quality and portion of the food. "And they don't even serve wine?"   Bring your own and avoid a glass marked up to a price of 2/3 that bottle.   8 Thumbs Up from our table of 4. Our service was great (a chiller/ice bucket for our wine, even though it was red, because hey some people might want that and be embarrassed to ask?), the breadbasket was super yummy, the ambiance was delightful (quiet but not silent, dim lighting but not pitch black), all around love.
