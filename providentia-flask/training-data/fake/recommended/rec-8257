This is a divey bar, with lots of character and generally a good place to hang out in with your friends.  It always seems to be busy whenever we go in. There's seating at both the bar and at tables and we've always lucked in and managed to find seating. The staff are very accommodating for larger groups and don't mind if you push tables together. The place has sit down service, the staff are attentive and frequently check in to see if you are in need of anything. One of the times we went in and the waitress even remembered the drink I had the previous time. And of course like many, many of the previous reviews have pointed out before me, one of the highlights are the complimentary peanuts they have at the tables for customers to munch on.  The shells get thrown on the floor adding to the charm of the place. If sports your thing then there are several screens for your viewing pleasure. We have ordered food from here but only the once. It was bar food and nothing special, I think our expectations weren't all that high to begin with, so we weren't all that disappointed. Overall, I'd say definitely go for drinks but if foods what you're after then it's probably best to try somewhere else!
