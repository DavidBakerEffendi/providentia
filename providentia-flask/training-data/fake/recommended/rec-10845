I tried to make a holiday reservation for a party of 8 at Traiff. They were completely booked and suggested we try their sister restaurant with the same chefs Xixa. The entire experience from top to bottom made this such a treat. I lost track of how many dishes they brought out for the perfectly priced chefs tasting. We ate had fois gras, mole ribs and an exquisite hamachi. We also opted to add on the additional cornish hen for the table. The service was top notch and I want Alison our server to be my new BFF! Thanks again for the delightful experience. We will be back!
