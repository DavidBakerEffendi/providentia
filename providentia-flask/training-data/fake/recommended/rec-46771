The weekday early mornings here are usually quiet and not crowded at all so you can have a slower start to a busy day in the city. On many occasions, my friend and I ditched the 8:00am lectures to enjoy a leisurely breakfast here and we always began with latte art and oj. For a decent price, you'll get a hearty meal out of Caf√© Orlin and they get the flavors just right and their roast potatoes never disappoints (I'm addicted). Their burgers are also pretty on par with the burger joints in the city so it's a great alternative to brunch. Lastly, I've been here for breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner and I concluded that no matter how crowded or noisy this place gets, the atmosphere remains unchanged and that is - naturally cozy and comfortable, which is not offered in most places in the city. Too bad I don't have early lectures anymore.
