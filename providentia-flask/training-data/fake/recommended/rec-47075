I enjoyed the food (rustic, Italian-inspired), but I can't really rave about it and I'm not dying to go back.  This is a bustling, fast-paced restaurant and I felt a little cramped (I'm not claustrophobic, FYI).  If I'm going to dinner at a place in this price range (entrees are about $19-$28), I just want to like, and maybe love, everything more--the ambiance, food, experience in general. My server, Matt, was awesome though!
