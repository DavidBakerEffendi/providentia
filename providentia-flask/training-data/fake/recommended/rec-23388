Very fresh handmade noodles, simply delicious broth, and remarkably inexpensive.  The decor and service are pretty bare-bones, but the noodle soups are as authentic as any I've had in Flushing or Taipei.  Cash only--closest ATM is probably the Wawa on Arch St.  Depending on which cut of beef you order, it can be a little fatty.  Safest choice is probably #1.  The duck and seafood soups are also good, though not as classic as the beef broth.
