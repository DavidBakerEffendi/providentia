Here it goes... I was here about a year ago and I absolutely LOVED Moto. So much in fact that I made a point to return this time we were visiting NYC, even though it was very far from where we were staying... amazing food, awesome atmosphere. I thought it was a gem. Unfortunately this visit (for brunch) was such a let-down. The ambiance was still there, but the food was off. The espresso machine was broken, the card machine was down, the waitstaff seemed disinterested. My girlfriend did not like her food at all. Mine was alright, but not up to the level of amazing that is was before. It was also hard not to notice that the music playing was really quite bad, and that the country pop song "I need You Now" was played twice while we were eating. Huh? Anyway, what a let down! I'm hoping that this was just an "off" day somehow. I rarely leave reviews like this, but I was very disappointed.
