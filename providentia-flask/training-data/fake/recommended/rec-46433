This place is fabulous.  Searched every where for a restaurant to take a reservation for seven people.  Even though we had to put down a hefty deposit to make the reservation here, it was worth it.  They put my group in a private room downstairs (it was a bit small), but it literally felt like we were the only people in the whole restaurant.  The waitress was friendly and informative and the food was amazing!!  Would definitely make this place a regular spot.
