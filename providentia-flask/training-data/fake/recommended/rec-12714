Stopped in here with my mom and my aunt after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. I had heard about long lines, but the line was short was when got there and it moved fast, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. We were seated upstairs, the tables were tight together and it seemed like most of the people around us were European. Service was friendly and efficient and in a short time we had a lovely Margarita pizza and some root beer to wash it down. Was it the best pizza ever? No. Was it really good pizza? Yes! I love me a good crust and this pizza had it. The ambiance is what really makes the place here. Our entire meal came to under $30 dollars and was probably the steal of our vacation. I would definitely visit again.
