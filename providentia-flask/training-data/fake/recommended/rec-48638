My go to pho spot. Close to my house and sometimes that really matters. I wake up and find myself, most of the week, in need of a pho bowl and this place is it. The pho is on point, the spring rolls are my favorite in the city, BBQ pork roll is great. The bun is better than most I have had. To get down to the point this is a great spot to have around. I'm very thankful.
