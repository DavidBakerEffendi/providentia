I can't beleive there aren't pictures of this place up here. I will fix that Friday when I return. As you walk in, the entire left side of the shop is lined with display cases filled with confections. Cakes, cupcakes, canolli shells, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, etc. It's the best display I have seen in years. Then comes the fresh bread and rolls. Pies on your right. At the rear of the store is the deli counter. I come here for the $11 italian hoagie. What's so special you ask? Beyond the fact they make their own rolls and use the best meats, its FOUR FEET LONG. I'm not exageratting folks. They literally serve you 2 two foot hoagies for eleven bucks. Pickles are a dollar extra, so four one foot hoagies for $3 each. Other hoagies can be slightly more but they are still crazy cheap. Two flat panels show the ovens in the bakery rolling out hot bread. Panini's are $5, and the cuban one is pretty darn good! I'll get some pictures up soon as there is no way to truly describe all that is this great place. Oh, and to top it off they have a frequent buyer card, so my sandwich this week is free! Yay!
