This place is amazing. I'm not a vegetarian and normally would have never even tried tofu but they've got me hooked. Best sesame/general tso's anything I've ever had. It beats out most other actual meats too. Loved their miso soup as well and is hands down, also the best Miso I've ever had. Which is saying a lot... As for pricing, super great. Huge proportions for what you pay and if you're looking for a good filling but not super expensive meal, I highly suggest going here with a friend or two and splitting some of the main dishes. So great. Highly highly recommend to anyone, even my fellow meat-eater carnivore red meat loving fellows. Seriously, just do it.
