Delicious! Came with a group and tried four different kinds of chicken and all the sauces. I would definitely go back! It's fun to go with a small group or potentially get takeout, because there is limited seating in this small place. Be careful though, you will probably end up eating way too much. The chicken also goes great with whiskey:) Thanks Paul!
