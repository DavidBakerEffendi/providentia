I work in the area and stumbled across this place while looking for a new lunch spot. Soon as I walked in the staff was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. I didn't have to wait long at all. The sandwich was a bit on the pricier side considering its size, however, it was filling and very high quality. Many lunch spots in the city will charge slightly less for a sandwich that's been sitting around half the day so I don't have a problem paying $10 for quality. The bread had the perfect taste and texture, the chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned, and the potatoes really complemented the sandwich. I definitely will be going back! I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!
