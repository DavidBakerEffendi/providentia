What a nice atmosphere! The staff was so welcoming and informative, friendly without gushing. We never felt rushed but we also ate at 3:30 pm on a Friday.   We had olives, flatbread and soppresseta to start then ravioli which was good and the salmon which was excellent.  For dessert we shared the salami de papa, so perfect with coffee at the end of the meal. Our wine was perfect, including the muscat. The restaurant was not huge but it didn't feel cramped like many in NYC. Would definitely return!
