Very good variety and quality for this food truck that makes its rounds in New Haven and Fairfield County. Fries are obviously the centerpiece, and I tried the Andouille fries. Covered and smothered with sausage, lettuce, tomato, onion and "creolaise", these were really tasty and only cost $8. they also serve hot dogs (Hummel's - yay), burgers and other sandwiches. Their sodas looked really cool - will have to try next time.
