Zento is a great sushi BYO. Their seaweed salad is a delicious appetizer, and I highly recommend the angus roll (somewhat anomalous to have steak and sushi, I know, but it's so good). This place is very small on the inside and busy, so they try to turn the tables quickly. Completely worth it though!
