I had always wanted to try Riverpark, but never did because they only participated in Restaurant Week for lunch Mon-Fri and I was always working. So I knew I had to go here for lunch when I got MLK day off - coincidentally also the first day of winter Restaurant Week! I usually go to a bunch of places during Restaurant Week and a recurring theme is that diners are more often than not given substandard service. Not the case at Riverpark! I never once felt like I was not a "regular" diner there - the service was just that good! Our server was supremely friendly and attentive, our water glasses were always filled, napkins were folded on the table if we got up, and we were even asked if we wanted more breadsticks without asking for it ourselves - something we happily said yes to as they were amazing - hot from the oven and chewy! The food? Also fantastic! It was so hard to choose what I wanted, which was actually a big positive since Riverpark had so many options available - a positive contrast from most Restaurant Week menus, which only offer 2-3 options per course. For my entr√©e, I had the roasted arctic char, which was very similar to salmon. Wonderfully prepared right down to the fingerling potatoes! Capers added a nice touch too. For dessert, I opted for the black forest sundae - also quite delicious. However, the highlight of my meal was (surprisingly) the appetizer. I got the charred eggplant and goat cheese bruschetta, something I would have never gotten if our server didn't suggest it. I highly highly recommend getting this - the eggplant had this great smoky flavor offset beautifully with a touch of honey. Overall, an utterly fabulous Restaurant Week experience complete with a beautiful view of the East River. And for $24.07 (excluding tax & tip), a total steal!
