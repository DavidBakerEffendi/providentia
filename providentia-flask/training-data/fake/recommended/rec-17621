I've been going to Tops Diner for years.  There is sometimes a bit of a wait (especially on weekend mornings), but the line moves fast and the food more than makes up for it.   They keep your coffee cup full (definitely important) but what really makes Tops the tops are the red velvet pancakes.  That's something I haven't seen at any other diner, so I always order them when I come here.  The red velvet pancakes are delicious and they keep me coming back!
