A friend brought me here. I've been bringing my friends here. Friends have been bringing their friends here. And the cycle goes on. I'll never say no to Totto Ramen. We always order Extra Spicy Ramen with Chicken/Pork. The broth taste great, the Ramen's texture is perfect (not too soft). Add on some sides or appetizers if you like. It's doesn't have a lot of space, there is always a (long) line, and it might be very cold while waiting, but I always find my wait worth it. Conclusion, one hour wait, 15 mins eating, left happy and satisfied.
