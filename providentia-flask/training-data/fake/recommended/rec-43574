Literally among the best burgers over we had. They make their own blend of meats for the thick patty, ensuring the high quality and therefore allowing the burger to be cooked to a perfect medium rare. I got the truffle burger when I went, but I asked them to add caramelize a onions to it too- AHmazing. The truffle cheese is unlike any other cheese sauce I've ever had. And their house made sauces are to die for- I've never had a "homemade ketchup", but after trying theirs I'm hooked! The ketchup has an incredible authentic tomato taste, like marinara sauce almost, but with the texture of a thick shiny condiment... You have to try it! We also ordered the ahi tuna burger- seared to rare perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant!
