This place is outrageously great. We went in without a lot of time because we had to be at the airport 90 minutes later, so we sat at the "bar" - I put that in quotes because it's really a dinner bar, set up for people to eat, more than a drinking bar. Wine is definitely the order of the day rather than mixed drinks. Caleb, the Manager, seems to be touching every customer while the service staff is more than attentive. I had the Braised Octopus appetizer (perfect) followed by the Suckling Pig entree (ridiculously good). My wife had the Salumi appetizer (big!) and the Pappardelle bolognese (crazy rich). Followed it all up with 3 scoops of sorbet/gellato - awesome. Overall, this is my new favorite Philly restaurant.
