The food and the sangria's at Cuban Pete's are well worth it. My friends and I ventured here in the spring while visiting another friend who knew just where to take us. My goodness was it spectacular. We split a bunch of items off the menu and found ourselves completely stuffed after wards, we were also pretty sauced with the sangria since we brought our own bottles of wine for the mix. We had a bottle of red and a bottle of white and all I could say is we had the best of both kinds. My friend took us after the lunch rush would be over so it wasn't as crowded as it normally would be. The service was wonderful, quick, and very helpful. I wish I could remember what we had to eat because I assure you it was fantastic. I highly recommend going to Cuban Pete's and trying multiple dishes with friends so you can get a good idea of what you want the next time you come back. I'm def. getting my friend to bring me back here when I come to visit NJ again.
