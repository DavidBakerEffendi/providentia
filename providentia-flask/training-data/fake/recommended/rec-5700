I ate here once a long time ago (2009) and I thought the food here was good, but not outstanding.  The curry was barely spicy--perhaps we should have explicitly spelled it out.  But beyond this, it was flavorful but not really amazing or anything.  It also wasn't very filling. I came back here in 2013 and...wow.  Just wow.  It was like a completely different restaurant...the food was really subtle and flavorful and completely unlike any Thai food I've had before.  I don't know if I hit it on an off day before, or if I ordered a dish better suited to my tastes the second time...but I've since come back, and tried quite a few different dishes here and it has been consistently top-notch. This place is a little pricier than the average low-end restaurants that I like to eat at...it's hard to get out of here without spending $15 and it's easy to spend much more than that.  But I think the food is worth it. Service was a little slow and inattentive the most recent time I came here.  I found that somewhat annoying.  But the food was so good that I'd totally keep coming back.  I've had lots of Thai food, and even some Lao food before, and I thought this was an unusually good restaurant of its type.
