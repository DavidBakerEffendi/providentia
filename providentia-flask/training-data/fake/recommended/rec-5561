Wow, one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Preceded by an equally awesome honeydew & tomato gazpacho.  Great brunch menu overall, great decor, great service, several reasons to go back! Wait, what could possibly make this better?  How about 80s/90s soft rock playing in the background?  Yes please.
