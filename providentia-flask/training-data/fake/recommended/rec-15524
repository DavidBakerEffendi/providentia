Cute little place that is easy to miss when passing by. The acoustics were bad, so it was hard to hear my friend. Felt noisier than it really was. The food was good. Had the octopus and eggplant starters. The octopus was cooked very well, the chickpea sauce was different but not very tasty. The eggplant was very good. The different layers of flavor, and the arugula salad that came with it was a perfect combination to have the right contrast. Had the meatball tagliatelle. The pasta was perfectly al dente. Meatballs were veal, very soft and tender. The service was helpful and friendly. Overall a good experience.
