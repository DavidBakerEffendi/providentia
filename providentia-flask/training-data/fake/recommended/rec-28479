The patty is thick. Unfortunately, it's thicker than it is wide, as it doesn't fill the whole width of the bun. And, even with its girth, the burger was pretty small. Even after my burger, fries, and a few beers, I was still hungry. The burger was, however, very juicy, and it was cooked perfectly to order. The fries on the other hand, weren't all that memorable. The beers are cheap. $2.50 for McSorley's, $3.75 for Stella or Sam Adams. As others have mentioned, burger, fries, and a beer all for under $10. That is indeed a happy meal (for grown ups). Overall, this place serves a good burger, however, I wouldn't miss not eating here. There are too many other places that serve a better burger.
