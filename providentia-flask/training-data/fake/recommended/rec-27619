Not that the 60th review of this place will make THAT much of a difference, BUT, I was really impressed.  The ceviche was like a mexican bloody mary (I know, that may not sound exactly appealing, but it was REALLY good).  Mole enchiladas fantastic.  But by far the most novel, interesting thing that left me astounded was the jalapeno infused lime margartia.  They had a habanero infused grapefruit margarita, which regretfully, my decidedly non-manly spice tolerance refused to allow me to try.  Next time.   No reservations when we went, and we got the last table on a Sunday night at 7.  Go early, or be prepared to wait.
