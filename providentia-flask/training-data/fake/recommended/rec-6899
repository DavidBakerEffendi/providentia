I'm giving this a 4 despite a few hiccups because the staff was so friendly and I liked the space. We went for lunch on Sunday (10/13) and they weren't selling meat by the pound, only sandwiches which was really disappointing. Sure, I could have bought a sandwich and asked them to hold the bun but that seems dumb. The Jerk chicken sandwich was tasty. The Lamb belly Bahn Mi bun was waaay too much bread but the ingredients inside were fresh and tasty. The tiny cup of potato salad that comes with the sandwiches was really good. The collard greens were good and the mac-n-cheese was fine...nothing exciting but if you love mac-n-cheese you be happy. The bloody mary was good though not quite as awesome as it looks with a slice of bacon hanging off the rim.
