The first time I came here was for a friend's birthday. The waitress was great and the food/drinks were above average. Just went tonight and the hostess was unbelievably rude. Let me first say, friends are normal, polite, decent people. One friend arrived at 8:15. Told there would be a 45 minute wait. Went next door to have a drink. Around 45 mins later we got the phone call that the table was ready, answered the call and headed over. Upon walking in, we were told that the table had been given away because the call wasn't answered. Mistakes happen, no big deal. Admittedly it was awkward and we probably rolled our eyes. However, the hostess was extremely cold and repeatedly told us we didn't answer her call. My friends grew increasingly confused and annoyed. We accepted that we'd be waiting longer but then the hostess came back and sarcastically said that because of our "great energy" and being "awesome" we could have the table. We quickly decided that we weren't going to enjoy our meal after that experience and politely told the waitress we would be leaving. Don't judge this place based on our experience - I did have a good time once. Just be prepared for attitude.
