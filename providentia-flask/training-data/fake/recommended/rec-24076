I LOVE GREEN EGGS CAFE. Once the sting of a 45-60 min wait leaves your body, you are greeted by the best meal you will ever eat. For brunch anyway. I love a restaurant where they offer a lengthy list of daily specials such as cookie dough French toast, butterscotch krimpet pancakes, vegan Mac and cheese... and so much more! My favorite item on the menu is red velvet pancakes. They're the size of my head but OH SO DELICIOUS!! Green Eggs Cafe is the happening place to be for brunch in south Philly. I definitely recommend!
