After reading about Mr Chang and his cuisine in the NY Times and Wall Street Journal, I felt like I had to come here and try it. We came on a Monday night at 7pm and were seated immediately at the bar.  The pork buns we ordered were fantastic, as expected.  The duck entree was also delicious.  The real standout of the evening was the mussels.  Presented in a mason jar and picked with bok choy and onions, the mussels were some of the best shellfish I've ever had.  Fantastic! The service excellent as well, in no small part because the waitstaff is always in front of you to fill your glass, take your plate away and otherwise keep you happy.
