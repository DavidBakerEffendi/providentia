I'm sticking with my original score... this time it was totally different though.  The meat was saucier and more meaty, there were more veggies, but something about it just isn't as good as the upper echelon of banh mi.  Really not sure what it is.  Maybe the bread which I like is a bit too flavorless?  Ahhh I dunno.  But don't get me wrong... its good.  Definitely worth getting and definitely worth getting delivered.  Meh... hate the winter.
