i hate greek food. okay, no i don't hate it.  but i've only had a it a few times and have never been impressed.  it always seems to be a lot of spinach and cheese, pine nuts, chickpeas, and over-spiced lamb.  so i've generally stayed away from it.  and apparently i like to generalize in general.  my generally juvenile genome gestures the genesis of genevan jello genitalia.   anyway, i also don't really like to eat in basements either, and half the dining room is in the basement.  you new yorkers know that regardless how clean a place appears, basements in new york will all have roaches and mice.  BUT even with all this against me, i enjoyed the food.  it wasn't jizz in your pants good, but maybe slightly boner good.   so i recommend checking this place out.  i've never felt more idiotic writing a review.  and you are all now dumber for reading.  but seriously the foods pretty good.
