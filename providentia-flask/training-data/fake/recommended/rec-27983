Last year I bought a house in the Girard Estate area of south philly, having lived in the Rittenhouse/ Fitler area since 1993. I was disoriented for the first few months here, and I was despondent that there aren't the cool hangouts here that they have up in Newbold and East Passyunk. Then I went to Nick's. I can't say anything for the bar---which looks like a dive---but the dining room has great sandwiches and fries...a very local and welcoming place to get some serious cheap beers and meats in your face. Of course, it's not the healthiest food in the world, but don't come here for that. Also, since living here, I have discovered that the sine qua non of philly is not the cheesesteak, but the roast pork sandwich. Hard core locals will always talk about roast pork, not cheesesteaks. The best cheesesteak I have ever had---and I have had many--- cannot compare to the roast pork sandwiches I've had at nick's. Ridiculously juicy, flavorful meat...slather liberally with horseradish, follow with cheap pint of lager, and what else do you need? Truly a great local place, which I'm hoping no one else will find out about... uuuuh...oops
