This is a neighborhood gem of the West Village. While it is small, our party of 4 was able to get right in and sit down at a table for brunch at 10:45 a.m. on a Saturday in February. The older decor is welcoming and homey. The waitstaff is excellent -- this includes the bartender who told me that he poisoned my water because I am a Boston Red Sox fan (the hat gave it away). They were all attentive and had plenty of recommendations for various items on the menu. The French Toast Brioche was sweet, fluffy and filling - just what one wants from a weekend brunch meal. The side of sausage was a bit much for my taste in terms of quantity and flavor, but could definitely be shared with others. The Pork & Beans special might have been the way to go. One of the members in my party had it and the taste I got from it was delicious. It's currently a "Special", so I'd recommend getting it if it's offered. We were in a celebratory mood, so we started the morning with Bellinies. Ours were lychee-flavored, but apparently they change frequently. I will say this - you won't be able to have just one. Prices are slightly above what you might expect to pay for brunch, but the food is gourmet and excellent. I will absolutely come back - especially for the bellini and pork & beans.
