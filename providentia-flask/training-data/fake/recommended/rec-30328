Loved this place. The tofu appetizer was really good, and the vermicelli special was AMAZING. I'm not usually a fan of Vietnamese egg rolls, and the ones here weren't anything world changing. The service for lunch was top notch. The interior is surprisingly fancy given its unassuming location. Prices: right. It's a bit out of the way if you don't have much reason to be in the area, but worth the walk if you're a student at Penn. Highly recommend.
