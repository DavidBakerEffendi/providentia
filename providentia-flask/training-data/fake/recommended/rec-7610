Absolutely outstanding restaurant on the lower West Side. Found the place via Yelp, and the positive reviews aligned perfectly with our experience. We made reservations for 10:30 on a Saturday morning via OpenTable, and surprisingly the restaurant was not full. We were seated immediately. They offer fresh fruit and vegetable juices. And since it had been a rough night in the Village the night before we opted for some coffee, and a Campagnola, which was carrot, ginger, lemon, cayenne for $10. The Campagnola is the perfect hangover helper. For entrees my GF had Zucchini Frittata, which came with with roasted tomato, goat cheese and basil for $18. I had the Uovo Modenese with cotechino hash, spinach and tomato hollandaise for $22. Both dishes were absolutely outstanding. We will definitely be back to Locanda Verde (The Green Inn) the next time we're in NYC.
