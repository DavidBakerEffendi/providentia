This restaurant had every element of a good restaurant - attention to detail, local fresh ingredients - but the dishes were just poorly concieved.  The flavors in the dishes tasted bad together.  I thought it was just one dish - but they all tasted bad, aside from my artichoke soup, which was pretty good.  The desserts were shockingly bad!
