I can't even look at another deli sandwich anymore. Ham and swiss on run of the mill bread? No, thank you. I far prefer the imported serrano ham and manchego on a fresh baguette. Bouillon cube-stained chicken soup from the corner deli? Not so much. I'll take the homemade soups instead. Hands down the best sandwich/soup lunch in the neighborhood, possibly the city. Worth the line out the door.
