Dear me, I write to you today to remind you that this place disappointed you. Remember how you left the East Coast and wished for good ethnic food again? And how you remembered fondly the much-lauded Thousand Layer Bread from Rangoon? You were happy your frequent flyer mile award ticket to Europe required a long connection in PHL, in part so that you could get Burmese food again!  You even rationalized away the recent yelp review complaining about roaches here. Well, your memory was playing tricks on you. Here's how today's meal went: the shrimp lemongrass soup badly needed to be cleaned and deveined.  And the thousand layer bread came to you hot but greasy, as did the potato curry. You even took your napkin and soaked up some of the grease floating on top of the curry, and god knows you are not afraid of a little grease!  You could also taste the peppers in the dipping sauce. You don't like peppers, red or green or yellow. The Burmese tea, at least, did not disappoint, though you were too put off by the price of the $1.75 can of diet coke to order it. One of the things that bothered you most, though, was that they asked, on your $13.80 bill, to pay cash when you tried to pay with a credit card. Apparently the minimum is $15, though there are NO SIGNS anywhere regarding this. The waiter said as you fumbled through your wallet furtively looking for the money that it was okay, but you found and paid with cash anyway. You shouldn't have done that. The next time you long for this restaurant, don't look through the rose-colored glasses; remember all the grease instead.  If you want greasy food you have to pay cash for in Philly, cheesesteaks are much cheaper. At least the waitress complimented your purse. But you get that a lot. :) Consider yourself warned. Of all the places on the East Coast whose food you miss, this place does not deserve to be on that list. Feel free to keep the Reading Terminal Market on that list, though: that place rocks!
