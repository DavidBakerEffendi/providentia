I've put some amazing things in my mouth over the years. My first fudgesickle. My Mama Jo's potato salad. Then there was that certain neighbor boy with a Camaro, a forty of malt liquor and some Pall Malls. Unfiltered. But I won't go there... Where I will go again. And again. And again is Perilla. This was my favorite solo dining experience on my Culinary Comedian Foodie Adventure to NYC. Nestled in the West Village, this quaint and cozy restaurant is owned by a Top Chef winner. So I've been told. I don't care if the chef went to Hamburger Helper Academy. This food was solid, inventive and absolutely delicious. So good. And only in NYC. And only when dining at the bar...so good in fact my dining companions to my left shared their Brussel sprouts with me: Roasted Brussel sprout leaves, toasted nuts, dried cranberries and raisin. WOW! I started off with a local draft. Went perfect with my roasted brook trout wrapped around rock shrimp with horseradish creme fraiche, honey crisp apples and fennel. How could my entree top this? I'm sorry. Did I see duck breast and foie gras on the same plate. Winner! Dinner! Roasted duck breast with foie gras, mizuna, oyster root and huckleberry jus. Went with an amber ale on draft and man it was outstanding. I'm sorry. I'm tearing up. Step away from the keyboard Thomas. Step away...
