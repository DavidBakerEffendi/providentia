Awesome rice, cheap, avoid the hot sauce Just got chicken/lamb rice platter today for $5. The best basmati rice (i think its basmati) from a cart I ever had. They also had pieces of bread and a fried potato ball (not sure what the heck it was, but it was good!). Just avoid the red sauce (burning hot!). I down 1/2 a bottle of tea and my tongue was still on fire! I ended up only finishing 80% of and left all the meat and rice that was "infected" w/ the hot sauce. Damn, so wanted to finish it too...
