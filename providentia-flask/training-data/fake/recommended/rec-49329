Even on a weekend their lunch special is only $7.95 and includes an appetizer. Decent red curry, with great tofu. Not too creamy. The spring rolls were pretty disappointing, but they're the only veg option (aside from the sad looking salad). There wasn't much in the way of atmosphere, and the service was fair. It was not quick, but not too bad. They were really busy when I went.
