Love it. I've only been during the day time when there were fewer than 20 people in the place, and it is the only bar I've been to in the daytime, sober, that I never wanted to leave again. Come on, all the stuff in apothecary jars? Who doesn't like feeling like they're in the abandoned home of a nineteenth centrury scientist? Pros: the veggie burger (shredded veggies instead of a wannabe meat patty!); the French onion soup; the make-your-own bloody mary (everyone should have the opportunity to ruin their own drink by adding inappropriate amounts curry powder, fried onions, cocktail onions, a ton of horseradish, and Cholula to a drink with an Old Bay rim). Also the terraria. Cons: Can't think of any offhand. I found the service to be extremely friendly, although pretty laid-back and hands-off. Which was cool with us. I'm in Philly twice a year to see my family. I want to go here every time. It's transporting.
