I had a great experience at Calle Ocho with some friends. We ordered a pitcher Of Spanish Harlem Sangria, it was so good, we ordered a second one. I had a vegan Mushroom Paella, very tasty. others ordered seafood Paella and Pork, no complains. Busy atmosphere, good for groups. Pricey, so I would only go there on special occasions.
