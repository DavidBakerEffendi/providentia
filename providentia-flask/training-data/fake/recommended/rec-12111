What an experience this was.  The quality of the meat isn't the best but the variety makes up for it.  Sirloin, strip, ribeye, filet, lamb, pork chops/ribs, chicken and bacon wrapped goodness.  Service was top notch.  Downside for me was the fact that I couldn't grab both the salad bar while eating my steaks.  Maybe I could?  I just don't like eating meat after meat.  Sides were on the weak side as well (carmelized bananas, fried polenta and mashed potatoes). Definitely worth trying at least once in your life if you enjoy meat.
