My first visit to Joya was very positive.  I was surprised to have to wait 20 minutes for a table for 8 on a Tuesday night at 9pm... no biggie.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen area and I noticed they also have a cute little intimate outdoor patio in the backyard. We ordered a large fried calamari for our table and there were plenty to go around.  The chili dipping sauce was good and had a little spicy kick.  We also ordered mango salads which was refreshing for a warm humid night.  For entree, I had the fried whole sea bass and it was piled with Chinese broccoli on top of brown gravy served with white rice - no complains there.  The size of the dish was generous and very satisfying.  I also tasted the soft shell crab (thought it was a bit salty but overall the crab was big and cooked just right) and Woon Sen (very tasty but the glass noodles broke into little pieces).  For drinks, my friend ordered a lychee martini.. it was strong and not too sweet. For 8 of us, we ordered a large fried calamari, 2 mango salads, a chicken satay, 8 entrees and a drink and the bill only came out to $144 including gratuity.. that's only $18 per person for a lot of food!!  I would definitely go back to this restaurant based on the good food, affordability and decor.  I didn't see any of the service problems some of the reviewers mentioned... sure the check came a little slow but we weren't in a hurry.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit.
