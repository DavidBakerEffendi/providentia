So this is my second review for this place.  I believe in second chances, and this place really impressed me. Went with my sister for dinner.  Got the shrimp and grits which were phenomenal!  I mean I am still having dreams about it.  My sister got the burger (my boyfriend got it the first time I went) and she loved it!  I have to make sure to get it the next time I fo As I said before I really like their wine list (didn't buy any because I work in the wine industry and would never buy wine at a restaurant considering the markup) but they put a lot of thought into the list and have a great selection.  That is always a good sign. And who doesn't like a free cookie to finish off their meal? Readhead you are OK in my book!
