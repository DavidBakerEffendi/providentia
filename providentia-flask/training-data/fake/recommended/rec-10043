I have been to various Pio Pios in different locations and I am never disappointed. The pio pio in hells kitchen has a great ambience. We went here for my moms 60th birthday and we all enjoyed our food. There were 5 of us and we ordered the matador combo along with the grilled steak dish and the filet mignon special. All was delicious and the price was reasonable. We did order the fried calamari as appetizer and that was okay. Everything else made up for it. I definitely will come back. I wish they would sell their green sauce by the bottle.
