My boyfriend and I head here semi-frequently when we're in the mood for a few beers and some awesome snacks (shishito peppers and wings are to die for!!) but tonight's experience really set itself apart from the usual good food and good service. Our server was Bryan and he was awesome, he was extremely polite and professional from beginning to end. He had great recommendations when a few things we wanted weren't available ( totally understandable for a sunday night) and was great about checking in on us and making sure we had what we needed. He even went out of his way to catch us on our way out to let us know about a discount we could use for our next visit. I have never once been disappointed in the food or service here but tonight was definitely above and beyond.
