I went to Fare on a first date and it was a very good choice of venue because it was very quiet and we could hear eachother speak. We went on the hottest day of the year, for Saturday brunch. The restaurant was all but deserted. we sat there for 12:45 to 3pm and there were maybe 4 other parties over that duration. Probably people were just staying in due to heat. The brunch menu is small but varied. I ordered the potato cake (latke) with smoked salmon and some sort of yoghurt sauce and little salad. The salad was very flavorful. and the potato cake was crisp at the edges and ok in the middle. I think the sauce really caused it to uncrisp. It was a very tasty meal, just the right size too. My date had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and he Â said it was good. For dessert I had coconut ice cream which was so refreshing and he had the chocolate mousse which really looked divine. Service was very attentive and good, and the prices seemed very reasonable. I would definitely go to FARE again!
