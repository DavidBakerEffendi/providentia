now that the spring weather has finally kicked in, i'm starting to stray away from hot, soupy noodles and turning towards sandwiches that can be eaten in parks, so as to maximize fun time in the sun! i was intrigued by the reviews of the sandwiches at sunny and annie's, so decided to give it a try! from the outside, it's the most unassuming deli ever, looking exactly like any other deli down the block. from the inside, it still looks exactly like a deli, which fridges stocked full of sugary drinks and boxes upon boxes of processed foods. however, their sandwich counter is a WHOLE different story. i got the pho real sandwich and bbq chicken + kimchi sandwich to go. the pho real is FOR REAL. it's LEGIT. it is DELICIOUS. it is pure GENIOUSITY!! pho as a sandwich? whoda thunk it?!?! the sandwich is essentially, a bowl of pho. roast beef + bean sprouts + basil + onion + sriracha/hoisin sauce slapped between two slices of bread. all the goodness of pho, wrapped up in an easy, to-go package! just genius. the bbq chicken + kimchi hero was also delicious, as i love pretty much anything with kimchi in it, but paled in comparison to the awesomeness that was the pho real. i like my sandwiches saucy, with drops of sauce dripping out the sandwich and down your chin, carls junior commercial style. sunny and annie's sandwiches definitely fit the bill, and you best believe that i will be returning shortly to try some more sandwiches. recommended dish: pho REAL, son! pros: pho as a sandwich! cons: no sit-down space that allows for immediate consumption of the sandwich, so one must seek out a spot to eat, all the while being tempted by the delicious sandwich preciously hidden in the brown paper bag.
