Perhaps the last meal of the 7 meal day in NY, we were able to finish off the night of partying in Lower East side with this place that I've heard nonstop about.   "you have to get the chicken and rice cart" "You have to get it from 6th and 53rd" "make sure you dump that white sauce" "its soo good" yes, all those comments stirred up quite a curiosity for us Californians and there on that final moment, we were able to have our $6 ready for a purchase for the very first time, our chicken and rice halal coming beautifully in a tin pie looking container and a circle top with several cups of white sauce to take home with.  love that sauce.  And as we cabbed it back, even for 6 blocks, our mouths were getting watery from the smell of absolute perfect munchy food.  Even though it was the night after Peter Lugers, and our stomachs were begging no more, we sure devoured that chicken and rice till we KOed.  So was it worth it?  Perhaps.  Is it as good as everyone says it is?  In a way, but I think it may be overhyped in a sense.  Here's what it boils down to: I like it, I don't love it, its cheap, and I never had it, therefore I enjoyed my experience and am starting to feel my mouth water as I'm writing this.  dammit, I hate it when that happens.
