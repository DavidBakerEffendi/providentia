Came for the shrimp and grits and can only give my opinion on that dish, the service and the atmosphere. It's a tiny little place but isn't super packed like a lot of the trendy cafe's and brunch spots in Manhattan. It was so discreet that I passed it up when searching for it on the street. Their shrimp and grits were the best that I've ever had.  They shit on Red Rooster's shrimp and grits.  I like grits that aren't soupy, and these were definitely right up my alley.   Although the prawns in the grits were a great touch (I usually have shrimp and grits with the heads off the shrimp) the real star of this dish was the sausage.  It was so flavorful and unexpected.  Go ahead and pay the extra $1.50 for the fried egg in it too.  The flavor party with all that and the cherry tomatoes they throw in was awesome! The hosts were very warm, as well as the bartender, I was sat immediately and I didn't wait long at all for my food.   The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is because I felt so claustrophobic in the  small diner. Thank you Duck's Eatery!  Can't wait to try a cocktail and other menu items next time!
