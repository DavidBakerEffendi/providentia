Came here on a late Saturday afternoon. Service was great- we were greeted and seated right away in their back greenhouse area. Very cozy, bright and quiet. Had the house beer, which was perfect for the crisp weather that day, I highly recommend trying the house amber ale. So hard to decide what to get, but you truly can't go wrong - so order whatever you want without pizza FOMO. We had the Laura and the Burrata. Both were addicting and so fresh tasting. Only 5 minutes went by from the time we ordered to the time piping hot pizza was sitting in front of us. We also ordered the focaccia, which was chewy and delicious even when I reheated it the next day. Will definitely be going back here to try every single pizza they offer!
