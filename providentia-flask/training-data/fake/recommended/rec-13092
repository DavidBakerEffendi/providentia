I love this place and I am a regular. They have the best wonton soup anywhere. The wontons are handmade and have lots of ginger in them and the broth is great too. I hate to say that I don't know the names of things that I get because when I go in, I ask the man who is always working to suggest something and he never steers me wrong. It is usually chicken or seafood and spicy. Most of the time when I go in, someone is hand-making the wontons or different types of dumplings. There is no frozen stuff here, just great food. And I don't see what the big deal is about the Chinese menu. I saw it on one of my trips and the gentleman translated the whole thing for me because I was curious. He didn't think I would like it but he still took the time to do so. Give it a try, they are great! And on Sundays, I see lots of Chinese families having dinner and that is endorsement enough for me. If they could cook it better they would but they love it here too!
