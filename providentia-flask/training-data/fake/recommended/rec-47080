It took me visiting Sabrina's for dinner last week to appreciate my love for this place and decide to officially 5-star it. I usually go for Saturday morning brunch when I'm visiting from out of town. And Saturday morning brunch is when the other inhabitants of Bella Vista descend on this little restaurant tucked in between a charter school and the Italian market and turn it into a near traffic hazard. There's no reservation for brunch, so expect to wait a little. My go-to meal for brunch is the stuffed French toast and a side of scrapple. If I keep that to once every two months, I won't get a premature, although totally earned, heart attack. But oh, what a blissful heart attack that would be. This past visit was for dinner, as I mentioned above, and I wasn't expecting much. I mean, how can a "little breakfast cafe" manage to pull off dinner, too? I guess I was dead wrong in assuming this was just a quaint neighborhood eatery. I ordered the short ribs with sweet mashed potatoes and nearly fell off my chair when I took the first bite. Completely decadent and satisfying. The owner was there (or so I thought it was the owner, since he looked ownerish) and he offered to bring us new silverware and fill up our water glasses. Right on. When you completely nail two meals out of three, you're gonna get 5 stars from me.
