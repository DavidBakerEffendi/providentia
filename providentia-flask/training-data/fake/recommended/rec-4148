El Vez is one of my favorite spots in the city. A great place to go for lunch during work or when you're out for a night on the town. Recently, El Vez changed their delectable Macho Nachos from steak to chorizo. This was done due to feedback from customers at their new location in New York. I can't speak for the New Yorkers, but here in Philadelphia we enjoy high quality food. Chorizo is no substitute for delicious steak! You can substitute for shredded chicken, which is probably a step up from chorizo, but this macho man likes his macho nachos with savory hunks of cow meat. Overall, you'll love this place. Get a margarita and the original guacamole, then sit back and enjoy your day.
