Surprised to see another pizza joint open in such a (pizza)competitive area! especially with Lombardis nearby. Mainly a takeout joint, limited stool seating. Good find, pleasant addition. I like that they try to experiment with some of the more traditional flavors. Being that they serve slices, you cant expect to compare them to places that only serve fresh pies, but these guys do a good job. Try their spicy squares or their smoked mozzarella. Valkommen!
