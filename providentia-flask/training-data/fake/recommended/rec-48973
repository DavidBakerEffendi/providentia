I have been coming here 1-2 times per week for about 6 years now. The food is consistent and delicious. First, let me debunk some of these bad reviews: The guy who said that Cluck has the smell of curry engraved in it? That's not true at all. That's the smell of cayenne pepper in the sauces. When the sauce comes in contact with the grill it carmelizes and smells like curry. And even if it did smell like curry, that would make sense. The place next door is an Indian restaurant. So your review is just uneducated and silly. Some people are saying the food has been dry? In all the times I have been there that has not been a problem. In all my experience there, I have gotten the mini-bites almost every time with traditional sauce. Then I do the side of Fries with cheese & gravy. Â I recently started getting a side of ranch for the mini-bites and it is great. If I don't do mini-bites, I have the boneless chicken strips. Order 5, and get 6 or 7. There is a lot more meat in those, so they are more filling. The service is exactly what you would expect. A couple high schoolers working the register, they have never screwed up my, or any of my friends, orders. The food is consistent, and the location is very clean. The only problem I have ever had is the location is the parking. There is only 6/7 spots out front, but that has never actually been an issue. If those are taken, there are a handful of spots in the back always open.
