No No No!!!! Before going here i was told there was alot of celebrities the 'old new yorkers' from the theater world. Italian which i love, but i knew obviously in theater district so you know could be busy. WOW chairs and tables on top of one another, rushing to make you eat, rude service. I went with my aunt as well so it wasn't like a young group. She had been recommended it but HELL NO never again. VERY EXPENSIVE and no reason to be. we got the trio pasta .... they come over with a pan of pasta ... now i don't eat meat (odd occasion but not a lot at all) and do not eat fish and the waiter put both on my plate even after me saying no! then it took me 10 minutes to get the attention of the waitress to change my plate. wouldn't mind but in all of this we are sitting on top of a family hearing there whole life story. Do not recommend this!
