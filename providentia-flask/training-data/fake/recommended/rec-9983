Came here yesterday for my birthday and I had a wonderful experience. The decor was really nice small but good enough. They had a violinist playing along with hip hop and R&B tunes which I thought was cool. Now lets get to the food part.  I had the pecan crusted pork chops that came with collard greens,mash sweet potatoes, and a wine sauce which was was Delicious!!! I also ordered these wings that was so good made you want to order a second serving.  I had a glass of sangria which I didn't like at all it had a cinnamon or nutmeg taste to it. Since it was my bday you know I had to order dessert and I must say OMG soooo delicious.  I had banana fried wantons with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream it was heaven in your mouth.  My overall experience at SoCo was great and I will be coming back again real soon
