This is my first review after about 7 visits. They do everything right. Large resto with lovely outdoor patio, you never have to wait long to find a table whether you're a group of 2 or 8. If you must wait, they have a great bar with cheap beer, fancy whiskys, and everything in between. The decor is cool, if a little overplayed (industrial gaslight, reclaimed wood), but as with all great restaurants, the pizza is what will keep you coming back. Fresh ingredients and the best chewy dough/crust. A bit different from the standard NY pie, these are smaller, chewier, with a crispy bottom, and a thick layer of toppings instead of a meager distribution. The staff are pleasant and helpful. Great place for a group- split a bunch of pies!
