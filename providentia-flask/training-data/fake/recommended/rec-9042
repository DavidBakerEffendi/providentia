I came here to catch up with a friend and wish him luck on an interview. We had five small plates and some wine. I recommend the Slate of Crostini (three different toppings on three pieces of toast). The pâté was amazing and I kinda wished I could have had more of it in a separate dish or just had the pâté on all the pieces of toast. The Burrata (buffalo mozzarella) was also good -- creamy and flavorful. The Duck Banh Mi sandwich was simultaneously salty, sour, sweet and slightly gamey from the duck. An interesting mix. My Pinot Bianco (Alois Lageder, Alto Adige) was a single-note crisp white wine which allowed the food to shine without drawing too much attention to itself. Our server was friendly and helpful, not shy at all with recommendations on the food and wine. There's outdoor seating, and they only take reservations for parties of 6+. The atmosphere is upscale casual with wooden stools/chairs and tables, and very chill music.
