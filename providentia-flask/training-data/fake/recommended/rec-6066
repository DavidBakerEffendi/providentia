If you're looking for an inexpensive place to eat, Dim Sum is the perfect location. Walked in, and noticed how CLEAN the restaurant was. BIG PLUS FOR ME. Â We were greeted immediately and seated. The menu is simple but TONS of options. We oredered the scallion pancakes. They were absolutely delicious. We also order the pork soup buns and beef dumplings. All dishes were freshly prepared and you could taste the flavors. Incredibly good. Can't wait for more!
