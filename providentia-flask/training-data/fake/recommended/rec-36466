The decor/ vibe is very "quiet girls night out dinner" (restaurant patrons were about 97% female, 3% male), Â but the food is delish. The few guys having dinner at Penelope seemed to be on dates (and I'm guessing didn't pick the restaurant). The simple, country theme was cute and not at all overdone. All meals (except for the lobster roll) were about $10-12 and included a salad or fries, so the prices are great. I had the grilled three cheese with pesto and artichoke hearts, which I absolutely recommend. There was a bar in the back of the restaurant, but I'm assuming the people sitting there were either waiting for a table or opting to eat there instead of a table.. Peneople doesn't seem like the kind of place you go to for a cocktail. Everyone seems to be raving about their brunch, so I definitely plan to come back on a weekend (that nutella french toast is calling my name..). I recommend Penelope if you're looking for a quiet, affordable, delicious week day dinner.
