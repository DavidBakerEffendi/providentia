This place was a surprising find. I was looking for a last minute restaurant on a busy Friday night and stumbled upon this place on Open Table. While there weren't many reviews, the menu looked promising. Located in an alley, it was a strange but intriguing location. I was delighted to find a nice bar and restaurant downstairs. The food and drinks, even their $5 house wine, were delicious. I had their tuna tartar, which was excellent. It seemed like the chef had her own twist on fairly standard dishes. Overall the night was great. We had a group of eight, and the acoustics allowed us to be able to hear everyone without shouting.
