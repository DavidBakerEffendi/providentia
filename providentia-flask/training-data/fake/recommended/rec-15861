I love this place. It's a nice spot for getting food and drinks late night. The owner is soo sweet, and the workers here are extremely nice. Last time I came here, I got the ramen, and it was delicious. My boyfriend always gets hot sake here. It's a cute little spot to catch up with friends!! Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're craving Japanese food.
