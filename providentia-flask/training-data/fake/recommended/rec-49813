I always look for three things when trying a new Thai restaurant: 1. Thai diners - check...there was a Thai party in the back room. 2. Sticky rice on the menu - this means that they serve issan/lao food in addition to Bangkok style thai food and was another check 3. A waitress who takes your spiciness request seriously - check...after receiving a severely mild papaya salad I requested that my main dish be spicy and that is what I got. I have to compare this place to Zabb Elee because that's where the chef comes from.  The food comes more quickly at Zabb Elee and the decor at Larb Ubol is dreary, even for a person like me who usually only cares about the food.  The food is very good but my rating is essentially strictly a comparison with Zabb Elee.  If you can't make it down to 2nd Avenue this place will certainly get the job done.  I had pad kee mao and mussel larb.  Advice: stick with catfish larb.
