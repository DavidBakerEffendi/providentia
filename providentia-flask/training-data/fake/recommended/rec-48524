My hot dog at the hockey game was far better than what I didn't eat at chowder pot :( I don't know what has happened to the Chowder Pot, but it was depressing!  Maybe it is just the Hartford location, but even the chowder can't pull me back in at this point. The only good thing about our visit was the chowder.  We should have stopped there!  BUT, NO....we went on!   The service was slow, we were actually forgotten at our first table and had to request the hostess to move us (she wasn't happy about it).  The server was hard to understand, slow, and overwhelmed with the amount of tables she had. ALL of our food was dried out and salty beyond anything palatable.  My fathers swordfish was like a hockey puck, my wife's and mother's baked stuffed shrimp was also dried out (as if it had been sitting waiting to be heated).  My stuffed king crab (one of the most expensive items) was dry and so salty that I didn't eat it.  The waitress didn't even ask why I didn't eat my food, she just took it and threw it out because I said I didn't want it.  YES!  I know!  I should have said something, but at this point it was beyond repair for the Chowder Pot and I just wanted to get to the hockey game we were going to.   Sorry Chowder Pot, but beyond some miracle, you are now off my list :(  And I so loved you....you were even the first place I took my wife on our first date....so much has changed in 10 years.
