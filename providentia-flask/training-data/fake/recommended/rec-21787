Not sure why people have had good experiences here, but my experience could not have been worse. Actually I don't think I've had a worse experience at any restaurant in my lifetime. Was meeting a few friends for brunch and they had left a message they were running slightly late. So I am waiting on the sidewalk and haven't stepped in, minding my own business when some self important looking person wearing a pink sport coat disturbs me and asks me "If I was being helped". I tell him I waiting for a few friends to show up and start describing the party "Adults, kids etc." he rudely interrupts me mid sentence and says he won't put my name down and "Waiting time starts after your party has arrived". Never in my life have I been told that at a restaurant. First if you read this, you pink jacket wearing romeo, if you approach someone offering to help, you better want to help. If you don't, don't ask. Then I ask him how long the wait was. Â He says he cannot say. Meanwhile, some other guy walks in and he promptly comes out and he mentions to his party that the wait is "2 hours". At this point I realize this scum doesn't deserve my business. Oh BTW, there is someone else waiting outside for her party for two and seems like there is no problem putting her on the list. So I confront him. Of course, being the boor he was, he didn't get the hint that I had no interest in eating there I was just going to wait for my friends and go elsewhere. He said something to the effect "You should take your party elsewhere". Hey, your food could be good, but everyone who comes to your place has had better. So stop thinking I am or anyone else is dying to go to your two-bit restaurant.
