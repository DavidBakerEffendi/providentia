We normally order from this place and the food is good. But... Today it was horrible all around. Well... Where do I start. Waiter was rude, which was not normal. Then as the salad comes out my boss had a HUGE fly embedded in it(alive). The waiters response was "oh it must have flew in there" then he picked up the fly with a napkin and left the salad on the table. He then realized it and picked up the plate then.... as we were deciding whether we walk out or stay and give him one more chance. He spills 2 cups of soda on us. Lets just we will NEVER be ordering from there again
