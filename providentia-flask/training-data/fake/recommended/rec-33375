The food is really good - arepas are pretty small but very satisfying... for dinner one may need two arepas but still well worth it. The patio is great, music is nice and you get good service. When back in Brooklyn, I will come here again. The only problem I have and this is not only Caracas arepas, but for Brooklyn and New York in general, coming from Portland, I find the selection of beer quite poor.
