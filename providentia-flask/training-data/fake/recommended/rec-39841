This is my favorie afterwork spot for good food and drinks.  I've been going here for 2 years now and am never disappointed.  My favorite day is Tuesday because all tapas are half off and they have many drink specials until 8pm.  Their delicious sangria is one of the many things that has me always coming back.  Their menu is pretty diverse but I tend to order the same thing always.  Guacasalsa (best guac ever!), and churrasco with mashed potatoes.  Other favs are their yuca fries and pinchos variaros.
