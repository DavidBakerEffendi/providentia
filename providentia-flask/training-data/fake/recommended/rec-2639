Let me start off by saying I really like HoneyGrow. I like the concept, the freshness of the ingredients, and that you're able to customize everything to your liking. Okay, so on to the negative. I went to HoneyGrow today and got the Red Curry Lo Mein with chicken. Everything was great, except the chicken. It tasted...old? I know HoneyGrow has a high turnover rate, so it couldn't have been bad, but it just tasted weird. Everything else was good, including my fruit and granola from the HoneyBar. Will I be back? Yes. Maybe it was just an off day for poultry.
