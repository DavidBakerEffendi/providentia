I eat Indian food ALL the time in Manhattan mainly. There hasn't been anything in the Flatbush/Ditmas Park area that I thought was decent for YEARS, but I finally signed up for Seamless Web to see if there were any new delivery options in this area besides the atrocious Picket Fence. I notice that there was a new Indian restaurant called Gandhi/Agra Classic and I decided to take a chance.  Most of the Pakistani restaurants on Coney Island Ave. and the Bangladeshi places over in Kensington have all been very disappointing but THIS place was amazing.  I have never dined in but as you can see in their photos the restaurant looks fairly nice compared to all the Caribbean hole-in-the-walls here.  The food is always consistently great, the delivery is timely, and the food portions are great.  I usually use Seamless Web to order from them but there's been times when it didn't work and I had to call them directly.  They are very friendly on the phone and I always use those times to compliment them on how much I love their food (I really really do!)  To be fair, I'm pretty consistent in my order. I always get the Chicken Vindaloo (cuz I love it hot) and I get a side of naan or two.  I've tried some of their appetizers like the samosas (delicious) and one night for fun I decided to try the Chicken Liver Poori because there was an article written about it in the Village Voice. Read about it here: blogs.villagevoice.com/f… If you live in the hood and you want something different and delicious, please give them a try. Now is the time to support your small business owners and stop calling Papa John's.
