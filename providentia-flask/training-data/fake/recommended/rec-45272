I wasn't sure if I would like a trip back in time to The Argyle, but I am happy to say it was a great dinner. First, yes, you can still get their traditional Fish and Chips, and they are about the best that you'll fine anywhere. However this place has not stayed frozen in time, menu wise, and they now have healthier options, like broiled seafood available. They have added just enough variety to the menu, so if you arrive with a group in tow everyone should be happy. Great prices, and good service. A real Kearny institution, and there are not that many left.
