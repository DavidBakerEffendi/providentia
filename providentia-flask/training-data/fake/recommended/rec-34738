This place just rocks!  Lunch, snack, late night - the Kati rolls always hit the spot. My sister in law took me to this place and since then I make it a point to stop here every time I am in NYC.  I also love the old movie posters of famous Bollywood films from the 70's.  However, I go for the food and the chicken is my favorite but I also love the shami kabob roll.  Both are awesome and for vegetarians the paneer or chana masala are just a notch below awesome (only because there is no meat)!   The chutney and the onions only add to the taste of the rolls.  Its a good thing that I don't live in NYC because I could eat this everyday.
