I've recently been sampling local ramen joints and Chuko is now on the top of my list! We got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday night, expecting a long wait. The hostess took our number and said it would be around 90 minutes. So we went across the street to Weather Up and enjoyed some lovely fancy cocktails. At around 8pm the hostess called to say that our table was ready - perfect timing! I ordered the miso ramen and it was perfectly delightful, with just the right miso-y flavor and flawless noodles. My friend ordered the veggie ramen after confirming that the broth was indeed vegetarian, and she loved hers too. Highly recommend.
