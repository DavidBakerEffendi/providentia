I enjoyed myself. I went for lunch. The view is nice and not a lot of people; so you can really enjoy your food with out all the noise. I do see myself coming back. I had the LA burger with sweet potato fries (Med). It was a pretty decent burger, and the fries was crispy. A very good place to kick it with the guys or grab a fast bite when your with your lady.
