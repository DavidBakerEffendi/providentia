Let me tell you- I dont even like seafood. But the generous helpings, coupled with delicious taste has made me a fan. Go with a group. This place is best enjoyed where there are at least 4 of you- you cannot eat an entree by yourself- at least if you dont wanna be sick later. My experience- 5 of us, Jalea, Avocado salad, a plate of sausage and fries, and a pitcher of Sangria- 74 dollars!! We were full and still had money to go drink.
