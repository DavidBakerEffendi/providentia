I love this place.  The 3 roll special is an incredible deal and you'd be hard pressed to find better sushi for the price anywhere in the city.  You might think the portions will match the price but I always end up quite sated.  There's a good selection on the menu and there are always interesting special rolls up on the chalkboard.  The staff is always friendly too.  Space is limited so it's not the kind of place to go with a group of friends.   I've never actually eaten in but like to grab some sushi to go and feast in Rittenhouse Square when the weather is nice.  I work 3 blocks from Izumi in South Philly but when I have the time I'll always choose to make the trek to grab lunch from Vic instead.
