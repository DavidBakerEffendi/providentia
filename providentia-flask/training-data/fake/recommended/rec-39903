Holy Moly, these drinks are strong and delicious. I started my night with a mojito (that may or may not have had 1/2 a bottle of rum in it). It came with a sugar cane in it, I think, things get a little hazy. I then moved onto the capiroskas, which was mostly vodka (the mango is AMAZING) and ended up sleeping on the floor of my bathroom, hugging the toilet. Sadly, I don't remember the food, but my partners in crime promised me it was delicious. Minus a star because they wouldn't take a reservation for 8 and we waited quite a bit, granted it was at the bar and we drank excessively, but still.
