There is no other establishment in Philadelphia more apt and able to separate me from my money as you, Eulogy, and for that I raise my metaphorical glass and give you five luminous stars. But as we all know, love is a battlefield and thus my liver requires at least three days to fully recover from what I put it through after a night at you, Eulogy. That's not your fault, that's mine. It's not you; it's me... me and my complete lack of self-control when being looked at square in the eyes by your beer menu. Oh, and why is visiting you so similar to being caught in a supergalactic time-warp, Eulogy? Where does the time go? Who *died* and made you the Einstein of Philly beer establishments? Pun intended. I could keep going. I think I will. Eulogy, I hope you weren't as offended as I was by the patron sitting beside me the other night who ordered Coors Light. He wasn't with me, btw, for if he was I would have taught him a lesson.. like when my dad left me on the top of a mountain hiking trail when I was 10 and told me to find my way back by myself. That's how I became the adventurous beer drinker you know today. And you, Eulogy, are the perfect place for someone who's willing to step out of their comfort zone what with your bartenders who are more than happy to give spot-on recommendations & who appreciate the craft of beer making as an art form. Which it is. Shut up, wine drinkers, you know I'm right. Well, Eulogy, honesty is the foundation of any relationship so I have to tell you truthfully that I would dubbel tripel love you if you would only add some more vegetarian fare to your menu!! But dang, your grilled cheese is made out of heavenly angels and I could holla at your Salle Du Cercuiel til the end of my days. So I will happily endure the residual Catholic guilt that washes o'er me when putting down beers in front of that stained-glass window of yours. Until we meet again....
