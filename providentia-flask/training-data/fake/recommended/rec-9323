We were passing through Philly and wanted to get a steak sandwich, but we didn't want to bother with the traffic in downtown Philly for Pat's or Gino's. So, we decided to try out this place since, it's located off the beaten path on the outskirts of the downtown. The steak sandwich was delicious - the meat was cooked perfectly and lightly seasoned -- there probably wasn't much more than salt and pepper if that - and a nice amount of cheese (not overly cheesy where the sandwich is dripping in oil) & chopped onions. The soft sesame hoagie bread also made for a really good sandwich. The pork sandwich (can get w/ cooked spinach) was divine. The roast pork is seasoned well with spices, and the jus is added on top of the meat to give it extra flavor.
