First off, I should say that this is a tiny restaurant. Small even by cafe standards. With that said, I came on a Sunday evening and there was no wait and we were seated immediately. I can't speak for the entire menu, but the much hyped Bronte Burger was without a doubt one of the most unique burgers I've ever had. Now unique doesn't necessarily always mean good, but in this case, it most definitely does. The two elements that really made it stand out were the focaccia bun and the sweet chili sauce. Not what you would usually find on a burger, but in this case, the combination (along with a perfectly cooked patty) made for a quite a tasty dish. In addition to the food, the fairly unique beer selection was also a plus. All in all a pretty good dining experience. I expect to be back at some point.
