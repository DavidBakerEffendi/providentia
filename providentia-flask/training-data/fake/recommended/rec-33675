Rye still ROCKS! My wife and I finally took advantage of the Happy Hour at Rye - $5 cheeseburgers and Old Fashions. The Old Fashions were very nice and served with one giant cube of ice to limit melting / diluting of the cocktail. The cheese burgers were very good too and very filling. I was expecting something more along the line of "sliders" but they served full on cheeseburgers. We also split the Brussels sprouts side dish wish was very good too.
