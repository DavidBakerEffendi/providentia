It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't anything particularly memorable.  I found the beer to be a little bit bland and watery, and the food was just okay.  We also had to wait quite a while for a Tuesday night, although that is usually a good sign.  Overall, I think they do well because they're near a college campus, and college kids aren't too difficult to please as long as they have beer and greasy food.  I, personally, was left feeling a little underwhelmed.
