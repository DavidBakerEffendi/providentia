The Greek Lady is an excellent eatery. I'm not the biggest fan of Greek food, but I make an exception for Greek Lady because their food is some of the best Greek food I've ever had. I've visited this restaurant several times and always order either a chicken or beef gyro, both of which are always cooked well and delicious. The prices are very generous for the food they give you. The owners recently renovated the interior and is much larger and better looking than it used to be. The service is always great, quick, and mistakes are a rarity. Definitely recommend The Greek Lady to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.
