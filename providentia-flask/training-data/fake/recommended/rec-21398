Decided to hit this joint before a concert at Union Transfer. Its reviews were good and we had driven past it and noticed their outdoor area, which on a long summer night held a lot of appeal. Arrived at 6:30 and got an outdoor table no problem. Immediately smitten by the eclectic decor. Surprised by the cocktail menu (craft cocktails!) when all we were expecting were the basics. Had a great server (Chee, sp?) who was super- attentive, and this place knew how to deliver great food on the double! Our meal did not fail to impress. For drinks we loved the house mojitos and their Yardbird the best. Got the pork empanadas for appetizer, and the beet & goat cheese salad was delish. Their Angus burger on yummy bun came with fab housecut fries, but it was a bit overcooked. Ended the meal with a corn & jalapeno muffin that was just perfect -- not too sweet but its honey puddle on the plate provided the perfect dessert alternative. And a sidebar hat tip for clean potties. We'll be back to this joint fo shizzle!
