SO-GOOD. I can't explain how freaking-delicious a Bronte Burger is. I'll try. A toasty, dense ciabatta bun encompasses the juiciest burger you'll EVER eat with sweet-chili sauce for a tiny kick. There's cheese, it's mild but comforting to know that it's there. Best burger in NYC, best burger ever. EVER. There are two options for dessert, I got whichever one was floating in warm caramel sauce, I suggest you do the same.
