It's a really fast hole in the wall Chinese restaurant which is SOOO cheap and SOOOO fast! We only tried the dumplings and the won ton soup, but we got a lot of dumplings and soup for $5. Wish we had of tried the sesame pancake that a local recommended. Â Wish they had a sweeter sauce for the dumplings though.
