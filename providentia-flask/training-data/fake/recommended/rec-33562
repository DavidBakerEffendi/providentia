The review is for brunch only (although I look forward to revising it after indulging in dinners here as well ...) First, I'm grateful that CM offers a weekday brunch.  I also appreciate the way that they've creatively taken traditional brunch dishes and infused them with Moroccan/Mediterranean elements (ie: Moroccan Benedict, which was like a small helping of shakshuka on an English muffin!)  You might think this to be the obvious way to go, but I've been to plenty of Mediterranean restaurants that drop the ball here (see my review for Lokal). The combination of delicious dishes spilling with aromatic flavors and libations with a twist (try the blood orange mimosa) keep me coming back.  And thanks to my friends, I've tasted every single brunch/breakfast option.  Dishes are large and filling, leaving me sad when I can't lick the plate clean.  But alas, swimsuit weather is always just around  the corner... I look forward to having here dinner.  I'm a little too excited about it, actually.
