YUM! First got take out from here and loved it!  I had the Caramelized Fennel & Roasted Beet Salad.  A little fancy for an every day lunch, but absolutely delicious!  I added shrimp to it and the big succulent grilled suckers really hit the spot.  Also had Brunch here with two friends.  We started with the blood orange bellini pitcher (great choice for our hangovers).  As for food, I had the Country sausage eggs benedict and  had to hold myself back from licking the plate.  SIZZLER! rivaled the eggs benedict I had at Oprah's personal chefs' restaurant in D.C.  Great place, Great food.  Yes, a bit pricey, but worth every pretty penny.
