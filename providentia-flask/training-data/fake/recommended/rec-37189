I am always a bit skeptical about any drinking/dancing/partying spot with Buddha in its name. I mean, it gets old. But I have to admit this is not a bad place. It's got a long bar and an uber crowded little dance floor in the back. A group of us dropped in on a Saturday night at around midnight and it was jam packed with a mixed crowd. All in the mood to dance, we were happy to find the music to be pop and hip hop. The DJ of the night was also very open to song requests. I actually requested "Empire Sate of Mind" for my friend who adores New York and was about to move away. We definitely had a blast here, although I wonder if good company made our night that much better.
