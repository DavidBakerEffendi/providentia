I had a very nice experience at Cafe La Maude. The food was delicious & the atmosphere was friendly. Everyone was very kind and accomodating. I'm pretty sure I saw the dog in the paintings right next to us, too! That was very entertaining. However, the atmosphere in the other room, where the bathroom is located, wasn't so nice. It just felt eerie with its dim, white lighting and the set up kind of felt creepy like I was in a horror movie. The bathroom was not the same, though. I didn't feel intimidated to pee. It is a bit pricier than other cafes in the area, but it wasn't too bad. Would definitely love to go back again!
