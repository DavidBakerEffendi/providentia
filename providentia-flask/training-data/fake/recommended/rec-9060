Following in the footsteps of Little Owl couldn't have been easy, but this West Village spot from the same owners definitely stumbled out of the gate. Its main gimmick, the adjoining market, just feels like a lamer place to endure endless waits for a table. And though we liked some of the seafood dishes, the land-lubbing fare lacked inspiration. For a spot hoping to be a charming neighborhood staple, some of its dishes sometimes felt perilously close to chain-restaurant fare.
