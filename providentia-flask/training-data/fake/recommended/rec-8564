How refreshing! Passyunk is so crowded with Italian restaurants that having a Mexican place that is great to hang out in and caters to a wide audience is a welcome change of pace. It may not have the best Mexican food in town, but I love to go here to eat or for happy hour. The service has always been great. The margaritas are wonderful (get a pitcher). I'd also highly reccommend going for brunch. The food is really great at brunch and the momosas are a great way to enjoy a sunday.
