The minute I sat down, I was turned off by this place. The cover of the menu warned that there was a $40 minimum for each table. That's like putting your registry on the invitation, dear (just plain rude). First of all, $40 isn't hard to hit, even for a table of two at Shabu-Tatsu. Most people will hit it, Shabu-Tatsu, you don't need to put it on the menu and make people feel awkward and/or hate you for it. I did, however, enjoy their happy hour deal where, if you order the shabu shabu or bbq, you get a free drink (wine, soda, beer). I dine like an old person (ie extremely early) so I am always happy to be rewarded for it. The shabu shabu itself is okay; food quality was good, Sapporo was good, ice cream was good. Nothing blew my mind. I do, however, have to wonder what kind of shabu shabu would knock my socks off because it's the best restaurateur-friendly (and poor-cook-unfriendly) concept ever. "Hey guys, let's open a restaurant ... but let's make the patrons cook their OWN food!"
