Lunch special is now $12.5 ( was $11). My husband and I both got the first set: chirashi: 5 pieces of sashimi and a tamagoyaki (Japanese omelette) over rice. tempura: 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 broccoli over rice. cold soba noodles chawanmushi (steamed egg) miso soup All come in small portions and its a perfect combination for a day when you want to just have some varieties of Japanese food at once. The sashimi from the chirashi is pretty warm and tasted like pre-cut, which I was pretty surprised. Tamagoyaki was really good and well-done ( which is very difficult to make and I am sure they have a skilled team in the kitchen). Tempura was fried quite fair, but the sauce was already added-on ( have never seen this before), and if you don't eat it soon enough, they become soggy. Soba noodles came in the sauce (which looks more like a cold soba noodles soup) and covered by freshly cut big green onion slices. The flavor of the soup, green onions and seaweeds all together made it a satisfying dish. Chawanmushi is flavorful and silky, and miso soup is Â pretty authentic. As this price, we both were very happy with it. Also, this is a place obviously not one for children. it's small and during lunch time it is just packed with people work in the area. We brought our toddler and she was asleep in the stroller. The staff were very friendly and gave us a table for four to have stroller well-situated.
