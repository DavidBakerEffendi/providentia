This place was AMAZING! Even though I live nearby somehow this place had escaped my notice, but not anymore. The ramen was sooo good. I got the tan tan ramen and the subtle spiciness was perfect as were the noodles. You get so much for the price too. When I was so full I could hardly move the waitress thought I hadn't touched the bowl! I'll probably get another three meals out of my leftovers easily. I also had the takoyaki. I agree with everyone that there wasn't a ton of octopus inside (there was enough trust me), but it was still one of the best I've had and I would totally get it again. Staff was friendly and attentive and have all been trained to greet their little hearts out in Japanese. Ambiance was great and they played a great mix of J-pop, K-pop and top 40 (I think I also heard some Florence + the Machine in there somewhere). All in all, this is probably my new favorite Japanese place in Philly. A must see!
