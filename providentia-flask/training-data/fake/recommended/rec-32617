wow really elegant, really tasty the restaurant itself is really well decorated - young and modern. they give you a little labane and fresh crackers right after you order (love that) - which gets you started off the grape leaves, labane with artichokes, and roasted eggplant were awesome. Â the taboule is not the best - but still refreshing next to all the other dishes. apparently the chicken kebabs are also excellent.
