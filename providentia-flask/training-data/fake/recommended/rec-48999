I don't know, I like this place I think. I usually go in for lunch. The buffalo chicken pizza is pretty good. It's crispy and a little spicy. It's not over powering. The pepperoni slices are pretty decent. It tastes like really good and fresh pepperoni. It does get greasy though. I know pepperoni is always greasy when cooked but this was a bit much. The girl behind the register is delightful. Always nice and friendly. The regular pizza leaves something to be desired. My job has ordered from there a few times and it never seems great. I guess being from north jersey I'm used to a certain type of pizza.
