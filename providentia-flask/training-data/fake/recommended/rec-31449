I was hesitate to try this place out due to some poor reviews, but was pleasantly surprised with my experience! I like that the menu points out vegetarian, low calorie and paleo options - it really caters to call diets. I shared the seared scallops with pureed cauliflower, the Swiss chard salad, and the Margherita flatbread. All were very tasty and full of flavor. I definitely recommend stopping by.
