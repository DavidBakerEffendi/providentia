The Fin Raw Bar lives up to hype, which is a plus.  I ordered the New England clam chowder, Mussels, Calamari for Apps.  For my dinner, I went with the day's special which mimic the Woodgrilled fish.  From what I remembered, the fish has a lot of complex flavor and the wood grill gives it that smoked oaky taste.  I was too stuffed to order any dessert, but "I'll be baaack." Overall, there's great "seafood," service, and atmosphere.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafood.   Stick with my rule of thumb, don't order seafood at a steak house and don't order steak at a seafood place.  Enjoy.
