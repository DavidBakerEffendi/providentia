By far my favorite tapas restaurant in the city. Love the ambiance and they have a great menu of options that everyone can enjoy.  As others have mentioned, if you go you must get the crispy brussel sprouts. Others that I've enjoyed - fried goat cheese, avacado relleno, seared scallops and the philadelphia truffly surprise.   You really can't go wrong with what you pick.
