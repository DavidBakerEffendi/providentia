Our hands down favorite in Center City. No better place in Philly to have good food in a relaxed setting, especially when the weather allows you to sit at the tables outside and people watch. It would be impossible to pick a favorite dish, but the homemade veggie burger with spicy fries is outrageous, the grilled cheese with sliced apple & bacon, the mac and cheese with tomato relish, and the walnut chicken tenders with Thai sauce are all things I dream about. Don't even get me started on the desserts. On a warm summer night, the fresh raspberry mojito is dynamite. Go before 7pm to avoid the loud crowds. Early dinner is peaceful and the view from the bar upstairs is nice when it's too cold to sit outside. I've never made it there for brunch, but I hear that's fantastic too. Go!
