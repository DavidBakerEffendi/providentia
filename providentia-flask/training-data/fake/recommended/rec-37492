If I could use profanity I would. Overpriced, overcooked food. My husband ordered Sesame Chicken and shrimp fried rice. The order arrives wrong : General Tsos and NOT sesame as ordered and stated on receipt. Cool. No problem. We call back to let them know, the owner seemed nice until the driver appeared angry and unruly. He BARGED into our home demanding the food. In which, the owner told us to keep because we explained it was already on our plate when we discovered it was wrong. The driver literally stood in our kitchen arguing, uninvited for about 10 minutes. I have never received such rude service in my life. STAY AWAY, YOU MIGHT HAVE A STRANGER STANDING IN YOUR KITCHEN.
