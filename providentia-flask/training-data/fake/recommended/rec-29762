I found out about Umami after reading a article on Thrillest toting this as the next great hamburger place. Since it's fairly new, it's packed. My bf and I were smart to go on a Friday night after the dinner crowd 10 pm. I'm a veggie so it was nice to see 2 options I could eat on the menu. There was a vegan burger which came with sort of a pre set group of condiments, toppings and then there was the portabella burger which is basically their Orginal burger (parmasean crisp, shitaki mushroom, carmelized onions, roasted tomato and house ketchup)  I went for the Original but they could only do it with the portabella burger and not with the vegan burger which I was a little annoyed by. The waitress said the chef wouldn't do it because it messes with the flavor profile. Ok then... You really shouldn't put the words, "want it meatless or bunless, no problem!" on your menu if you don't want customers to change things around a bit. My bf got the Orginal with a meat patty. They ask you how you want it cooked which is nice. I got the fried pickles as a side and he ordered the truffle fries. They also have a bar and sorta ambient lighting so I suppose you could stay and linger over a few drinks after your dinner? Our food arrived.  We both enjoyed.  I will say the burgers are a little on the smallish side compared to like Bare Burger but they're very tasty. The sides I was not impressed.  My fried pickles were kinda just like a breaded spear. They weren't very crispy.  I personally like fried pickles more in the chip form. His truffle fries were good but also kinda small.  Very thin and shoe string like with this tuffle globby sauce drizzled on top. Price wise they are ok.  Similar to other upscale burger places.  I'd probably come back again to try the vegan burger but I think I like Bare Burger better because you can customize the toppings, with any burger (meat and non meat)
