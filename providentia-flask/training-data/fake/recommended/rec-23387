Why you so good to me? Oh Russet, I want to hug you. I was greeted by a sweet smiling hostess. Our server, Danielle was attentive & helpful (along with the rest of the staff. We even saw their cutie pie, Gus, for a split second.) Jeff the MOD even made us smile. We had table smack dab in the middle of dining room and it really was a great size (not too big, not too small, perfectly baby bear!) Simplistic and alluring decor, all in all, a very inviting space (the tables are MAGNIFICENT!) Our first course choices were: Borscht: beef shin & crème fraîche... the borscht was substantial enough to pick up with a fork. It was DEFINITELY not the cold beet broth stereotypical of poor Communist Russia. Potato Gnocchi Gratin: gorgonzola, & shaved black walnut (reminiscent of JAMES' truffled gnocchi gratin which was also insanely wicked... I highly recommend this.) Roasted Pom Pom Mushrooms: pink lady apples, local manchego cheese & claytonia: a delightfully unique dish Entrées: Crispy Pig's Foot: pinto bean ragu, cabbage & cider reduction. It was savory & sweet and definitely a winner Wild Striped Bass: beurre blanc and baby carrots (I believe) My friend could not stop eating to tell us how good it was (I highly recommend this dish. I know some places tweak recipes after a few night, but I really hope this one stays exactly as it is.) Capon Leg Confit: baby brussels, squash & German mustard. I kept slicing around what I thought was a bone, but nay, not a bone in sight. The rooster had been striped of it's bones (among other parts) and dressed with absolute scrumptiousness! Dessert: Blood Orange Sorbet: with shortbread that would put the Scottish (& girl scouts) to shame. Chocolate Ginger Tart: with whipped cream & cranberries: an unique yet gorgeous combo. My only gripe is that our water was warm, but that was quickly remedied with some ice. I can't wait to go for brunch. Everyone Go! Go now!! Stop reading my review and get your tushy over there RIGHT NOW!!!
