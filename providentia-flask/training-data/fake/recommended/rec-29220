We were in the area and a friend recommended Dalessandros. I got the Chicken cheese steak. It was good, but some of the chicken was a little dry and I should have put more hots, ketchup and cheese on the sandwich.. but that is no fault of Dalessandro's. Overall a good place, and you feel like a local when you walk in.
