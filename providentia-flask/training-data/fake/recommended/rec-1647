I agree with all the criticism about this place.  It is not the most friendly as they do throw the food at you.  It is not the most sanitary either as the condiments are left out in the open for some bug to come along and contaminate it all.  But with all that said it is simply the best cheesesteak you can buy.  Also you have to understand this place is in south philly.  this is a working class sandwich for a working class part of town.  If you are willing to venture down here for a sandwich then you should be able to handle a little tough talk and grime.  so quit your wining and enjoy your sandwich. Now to be fair I did go and try that other philly cheesesteak (Genos) and I must say that one was good too.  But if you were to hog tie me and threaten me with a hot iron rod to actually make a choice I still would choose Pats because they have a few more options and nicer condiments than that other place across the street.  That's my humble opinion, take it for what it's worth.
