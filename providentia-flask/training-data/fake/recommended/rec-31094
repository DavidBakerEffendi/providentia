This is my second visit to PYT. I had the vegetarian Calibunga burger with black bean soup.  I was pleasantly surprised. Both the blackbean soup and veggie burger were very tasty.  The prices were very reasonable and service was decent. The downside - we were seated in that back room, it wreaked of last nights spilled drinks. I wouldn't have been so bothered except I order vodka and soda that was more like just soda!  A great burger joint with good music and something for everyone.
