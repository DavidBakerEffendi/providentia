Authentically NYC. Speak-easy without the kitschy props, but rather, a more modern "speak easy." Patrons were all (mostly) the age-range of our party in attendance (25-35). After dining at Buvette, we headed over to check out this place. In an inconspicuous building, the curtain is pulled back, and it was like we walked into the heart of NYC. Almost on cue, Jay-Z's Empire State of Mind had just started playing. Really? The bartenders -- more appropriately "mixologists" Â -- were shaking, hustling and moving. And dare I say I had one of the best cocktails of my life that night: The Billionaire. Smashing. The ladies in the group seemed to really enjoy West Side. The crowd was mingling and the energy was buzzing. It was quite crowded, and the volume was a hair loud for sipping conversations (though the table/dining area was significantly more catered to that) but this place was so good, we came back the next night too. Definitely on my hot list. Good times!
