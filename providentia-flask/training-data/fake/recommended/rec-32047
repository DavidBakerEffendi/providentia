My wife and I dined here after a movie at the Ritz at the Bourse. The ambiance and decor was bland, outdated and old. The food was overpriced, over cooked, and underwhelming. Other reviewers have said the prices are high. If the quality of the food were better, I wouldn't have minded the price. We did enjoy our salads (Gorgonzola, Goat Cheese with Walnuts) and Sangria, but I wish we'd stopped there. The service was bad, too. I asked our server what sauce came on a dish, and she said red or white. When I ordered that dish, she didn't ask what sauce I wanted (my wife reminded me that I forgot to say white), and when she came back with (bad, store-bought) bread I asked for white sauce. She was very miffed and said: It comes with a red sauce, now I have to go tell them you want white. It was very odd to be treated like this. We will never go back.
