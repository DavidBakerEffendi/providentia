Took my kids there on a Friday evening. They enjoyed the decor of eclectic items on the walls and even ceiling. I was in the mood for a nice fresh big salad. Instead, I received a wilted with brown spots endive, walnut and pear sloppy mess for $12! The boys' pizza was fairly good - sauce was nicely flavored, fair amount of mozzarella, and decent crust. $3 for a can of Sprite was a bit much... The service was average. It felt very touristy once more people arrived. I couldn't believe a tourist joint existed in an East Village pizza joint, but what do I know? Probably won't go back...
