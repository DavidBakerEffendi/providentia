Definitely love this place. My coworker is Spanish and she's used to eating spanish, Portuguese, mexican food etc. She is very picky and even she loves thus place! I'm so glad I turned her onto this place. Their chicken is seasoned so well! I love their rice too. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving a really well seasoned rotisserie chicken.
