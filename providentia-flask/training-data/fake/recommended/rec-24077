Amazing! The food and specialty drinks were delicious. The waitstaff was friendly, attentive and good at suggesting dishes. Our party of 5 had the specialty cookie dough stuffed french toast that was a winner, more like dessert. 2 kids had the child portion of red velvet pancakes, although they didn't like them as much as I did (red velvet isn't sickening sweet & after they tasted the cookie dough dish they were sorry for not ordering those). I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict with added cheese grits and the dish was too die for, the grilled bread as the base really made it wonderful, buttery & crunchy. We also sampled the salted caramel latte both hot & iced & the whipped cream they topped it with was delicious. We got there a little after 9am on a Saturday & were seated right away. For the 5 of us it was $100, kinda pricey but a nice treat and the portions were really filling, enough for all of us to have leftovers. The only down side was the fish store next door had the WORST smelling trash; I don't think anyone could've enjoyed sitting outside in that particular day.
