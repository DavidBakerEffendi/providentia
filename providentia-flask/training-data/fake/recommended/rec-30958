imagine you are in 18th century Italy. Imagine that the hunting party came thru with something tasty... like a wild boar, or a pheasant or a hare... Â something that isn't in your supermarket... this is what you should order. in other words listen to the specials. chicken liver rigatoni was awesome, pizzas are very good -to-excellent. artichoke side unbelievable. northern Italian restaurant Philly should be proud to show off.
