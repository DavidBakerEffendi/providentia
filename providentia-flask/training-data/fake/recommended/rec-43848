First off, I really do like this place. Last night, it took them over 40 minutes (2 drinks) to produce 1/2 dozen oysters. I had to ask several times to a critically inattentive waitress. I had intended on having dinner there, but their time ran out. The restaurant was at two-thirds capacity and they were fully staffed. When I asked for the bill, another waiter came by with someone else's check. They comped me 2 oysters and a beer. I don't want free food. I want good service.
