We were fans of this place WAY before M v F. We originally went to Reading Terminal for the Amish bakery. I'm not a big cheesesteak guy, so when I stumbled onto DiNic's, I knew that I had finally found my Philly sandwich crush. The long lines suck. Nobody likes them and it takes like 20 to 40 minutes to get a sandwich if their rockin. Try to snag some seats at the counter, they turn them over pretty quickly. The roast pork with provolone and greens is the star of the show, but the brisket was quite excellent as well. Listen, you're gonna wait in a long ass line down at Pat's or Geno's for a weak ass sub. Take my advise and hit up DiNic's you won't be disappointed!!!!!!
