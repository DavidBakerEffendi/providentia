What a lovely place to eat. We walked right in without a reservation. We sat at the bar which was great. The bartender was very nice. She knew everything about the food and which wine to pair with our meal. The service was awsome! The food was delicious. Finally a good resto where you can eat healthy. The portion was perfect and the attention to details were a nice touch. We will be going back again!
