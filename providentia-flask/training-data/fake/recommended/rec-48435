i frequent this place for lunch occasionally. the decor is ok, the service is great, the prices are reasonable, and they have a good menu. my fav so far on the menu is the hot brown. so sinful yet so good. the fench onion soup is too tomato-y. it looked better than i thought it would taste. their "dish" specials are a great value and you get to try various menu items.
