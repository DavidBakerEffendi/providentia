I read the glowing reviews and tried this place out. I ordered to-go and yes, I received a large portion of noddles and broth and a side of sprouts and mint but here was little meat and it was mostly flavorless unless i got an onion in my mix. It was cheap $7, large quantity and I had very quick service for a busy afternoon. It was edible but nothing special I don't think I'd go back.
