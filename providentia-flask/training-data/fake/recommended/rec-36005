Balthazar was probably a great restaurant in the past but it's definitely now in the past. When we come to New York, I try to pop into Balthazar's but this is my last time. My girlfriend had the steak tartare and got seriously sick. She was vomiting for most of the night. The lamb I had was bland and poorly cooked. The decor is showing its years, worn down and poorly maintained. Many other great restaurants in NY, Balthazars is no longer one of them.
