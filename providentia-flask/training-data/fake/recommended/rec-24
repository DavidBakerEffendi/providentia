I think this is one of the best places I've ever been!  I'm hesitant to review it at all because I don't want it to get too crowded and popular, but it's amazing ambiance.  The music is great, the staff is great, the whole mood of the place is so great.  From the outside, you wouldn't expect it to be so much, but it was.  I had the Thai Curry Cod and it was just absolutely to die for.  I loved everything about it!  It'd be a great romantic date place for sure!  Happy eating!
