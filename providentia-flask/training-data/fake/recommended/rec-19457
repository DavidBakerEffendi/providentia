This spot has an interesting menu separated by Mexican and Texan inspired items. I got the two chicken burritos with plantains, bacon and chipotle. When they brought it out, it looked tiny. I thought, maybe I shoulda ordered the burrito gringo. However, I was surprisingly full after the meal. I could barely finish it. It was quite scrumptious and it wasn't a bad price. I went with a big party. We ordered some yummy pitchers of margaritas. I'd recommend those. Ok, Now, why did I demote this place by 2 stars? The service sorta sucked. She didn't really come by the table to check on us very often. My friend asked for some tabasco sauce, and they didn't have any?! What kind of place doesn't have tabasco sauce, let alone a tex-mex place. Lastly, you have to pay $5 to add rice and beans to your meal. That's a super rip off if you ask me. Isn't it usually included with every meal? or am I just a sheltered girl.... Regardless, the food was quite tasty. I may come back if I feel so inspired.
