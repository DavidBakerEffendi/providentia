Went there with a Groupon, the servings were huge!!!  We had the bbq combo platters.  The mac and cheese was out of this world....but the ribs were terrible!  How can you serve dry tough ribs at a BBQ restaurant?  I love ribs and was expecting them to be tender instead I had to saw through them with the steak knife and add extra sauce just to make them palatable. Huge disappointment!
