The worst service in New York and the antithesis of the type of service you receive in Vienna. We went in on a Monday afternoon for a birthday lunch. We couldn't believe the maltreatment we received by the waitstaff. First, we were rushed to order our food, when we clearly stated that we needed time to look at the menu. Â During our meal, we were asked if we were finished even though we had half of our food, and it was obvious that we were still eating. Three different wait staff members attempted to remove our plates when we already told them that we were not finished. The third time, our server, stated he just wanted to give us dessert menus - basically rushing us. He was extremely condescending and haughty. In the middle of our dessert, he wanted to take the plate away, again with no indication that we were finished. To end this "spectacular" service, our check was tossed to our table. As someone who is in the restaurant business, I always tip my server - however in this special case, I regret leaving a dime. While the food is good, the service really ruined it for us, and we will not return or recommend this establishment to anyone.
