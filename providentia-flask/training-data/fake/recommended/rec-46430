A bit overhyped and pretentious for my liking. Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, but I found Print to be a typical tourist trap within an nyc hotel. The menu is very exciting, prices are high, therefore my expectations are high... The apps were the star of the meal- tuna tartar and the gnocchi, both were perfect.  If I went back I think I'd do an app and a soup or salad. For dinner, our friend was craving and raving about the pork chop, which to his disappointment, they were out of. I ordered the scallops which by themselves were great however the mashed potatoes and greens had no elevation to them- the mashed potatoes were at the level of something I could make at home. My bf got the duck, although the braise was tasty it was chewy and tough in spots. My cocktail (their spin on an old fashioned) was awful. Loaded with fruit and watered down.  The guys' scotch was $17 a glass and nothing mind blowing (can't remember the name but it seemed to be all they had). Lastly, our waiter seemed annoyed at us for living and heavily pushed us to go drink more at the rooftop lounge- which is more pretentious than the restaurant. Although it wasn't bad, I can pay this much and be wowed elsewhere in nyc.
