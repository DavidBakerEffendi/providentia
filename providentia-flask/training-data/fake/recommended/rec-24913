Tommy DiNic's is a decent food place at the Reading Terminal. A friend and I spilt a roast beef and a meatball (we did not try the supposedly famous roast pork). I was a little more impressed with the meatball, which I thought had the perfect amount of sauce on the hoagie, as well as the right balance of sharp provolone. The meatball was flavorful and I'd be sure to get it again. On the other hand, the roast beef was just okay. Even though the sharp provolone on the sandwich made it very good, the meat was a little dry and flavorless. So food wise, I wasn't really impressed as overall I just thought it was good, but not great by any means. Â  We only had to wait in line for a few minutes, and the cost was about less than $10. Now granted while I didn't try their famous roast pork, I didn't feel like the place lived up to all of the hype I had heard about it. DiNic's is still a good place to go, I just didn't feel it was great or anything super special for that matter.
