WELL...since frying french fries requires no science I guess the only thing to say is that the best sauces I've tried so far are: 1.Vietnamese Pineapple Mayo 2.Curry Ketchup :) 3.Mango Chutney 4.Smoked eggplant...actually i dont remember the name but it had something to do with eggplant...either way the taste was delicious! :) the guys are friendly too
