I came here twice when I was in New Haven for the summer. Both times we came with a large group for half priced sushi. Any place where I can get a cucumber roll for $2 is fine by me. The sushi my friends all ordered also looked amazing, and the shrimp tempura was good. The other reviews criticize the service, but we had no issues. Our group the first time all got separate checks, and the servers were prompt and accommodating. The second time we all paid on the same bill and again the server was fine. No complaints.
