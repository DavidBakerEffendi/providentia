3 1/2 stars. Never had a CT Roll before so I came on by and gave it a try. It's really not bad at all. Definitely worth coming and giving it a try if you've never had a CT Roll before. If I had a problem is that this place is really out of the way. Closest subway is 15-20 minutes away by foot. But it was really close to the Comfort Inn I was staying in so that worked out. I would definitely come back again and give some other things on the menu a try. So definitely swing on by if you're in neighborhood.
