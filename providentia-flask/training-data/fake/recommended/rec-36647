Last night (Thursday) my two friends and i flipped a coin to decide where to get a burger. JG Mellon on the UES or the Spotted Pig in the West Village. As fate was in charge we grabbed a cab and headed to the Pig for one of their trade mark burgers. From memory we arrived at 8pm. Big mistake. The guy at the front told us it would be an hour and half wait. What the?? After downing a few ales at the bar an hour had passed and we were getting hungry and impatient. I decided to try and bribe the door guy. Probably not the best attempt or maybe i should have gone higher than a 20 but at the end of the day its a burger not a lobster or caviar. Finally we were called up stairs and we sat down. The waiter was fairly average but he did manage to get our oysters out to us relatively quickly. These were below average and for the cost ($36 for a dozen) i expected a lot better. We each ordered the burger that came garnished with shredded fries. The burger is amazing soft and full of flavor. They only use a heavy blue cheese and that certainly is enough. My friends on the other hard werent impressed. Does the place have a great burger? yes. Is it worth an hours and a half wait? Hell no. If i was to go back it would be for lunch or on a monday or tuesday night when the crowd dies off.
