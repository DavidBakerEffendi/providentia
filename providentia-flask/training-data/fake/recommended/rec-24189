After reading the less than stellar reviews of the service, I was a little bit nervous to try out  Green Eggs Cafe with my daughters.  I was expecting the service to be dismal.  Au contraire!  We went today and were greeted most warmly by Ilana - who even though it was blustery and cold standing by the door - happily and professionally greeted us.  She let us know there would be a 45 mintue wait.  Since it was so crowded, we went to wait in our car.  A few times we went back in to check on our status and everytime she was kind, and unassuming - NEVER making me feel stupid for asking or checking. When we were seated at our table, we were greeted by Brittny who was just as welcoming and warm.  The commaradarie with the staff was apparent.  It looked like the people genuinely enjoy working with each other.   We had the creme brulee french toast, the sweet potato bisque and the kitchen sink.  All of which were just delicious!   It was a really great experience and with the closing of Cafe Estelle, this will be my new favorite place to go.  I LOVE the committment to sustainability and the environment.
