On a whim we stopped in for dinner and figured we'd have a chance at a table based on the parking lot spaces available. We were seated immediately and a friendly, attentive waitress wasted no time getting our drinks and order. The bread was awesome, mentioned by other reviewers, and my Yelp-special glass of white wine was a treat. My grilled seafood medley presented well and tasted even better. The sides were tasty as well. My husband had the Carrot soup and the beet salad with chèvre and found both to be excellent. My son had meatloaf with mashed potatoes and was impressed with the taste and presentation equally. His Belgian chocolate covered locally made vanilla ice cream was massive and delish'. My Maple Creme Brûlée was awesome. We left very pleased with everything.
