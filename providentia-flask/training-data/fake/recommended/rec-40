Slow service and bad food. At least I had a decent beer while I waited. I also posted a picture of my meal. There is literally a PUDDLE of grease. I wish the picture showed better perspective but I got more grease than eggs. This is revolting, I have never seen anything like it. I made the mistake of giving Barrel House a second chance. The first time I when service was slow but the place was packed and I got some awful food. The second time I went there were literally 6 patrons in the place including myself and we still waited almost an hour for a burger and salad. How is this place still in business?!
