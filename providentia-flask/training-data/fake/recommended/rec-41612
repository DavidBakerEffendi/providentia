Old world Italian joint with waiters that sing opera music. If you had an Italian grandmother that cooked, this is what her food would taste like. That means the food is solid...but don't expect modern Italian fare. This is spaghetti and meatballs with no frills. If you're in the mood for unpretentious dining in a casual setting, this place will do the trick.
