Food was terrible and the service was even worse. The heart attack burger sounded good in text but the actual hamburger meat tasted poor and the cheese tasted like kraft singles. It took 2 hours sitting at a table before anyone came up to it and asked how we were. I moved to the bar when a spot opened up and a bartender took my beer glass. It took 15 minutes to get a new glass. I was over charged by 7$, the beer specials are cryptic (10$ pitchers actually means 10$ bud light and coors light only, yuengling was $15). They had a DJ come in during opening night for football. Seriously? Never again will I establish this establishment. I understand why this place is under new ownership every few months.
