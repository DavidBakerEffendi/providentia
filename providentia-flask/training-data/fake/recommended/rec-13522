After a crappy day, I decided to eat here with a friend. The thought of warm blueberry pancakes made it easier to forget about my troubles. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed by the over hyped quality of the place, and it did not do much for cheering up. It was a Monday night, not very crowded. Still, it took forever for the food to arrive. Though I was content about being seated right away, drinking water for 50 minutes grew a bit dull even if the conversation was interesting. All that was really on my mind, was indulging on delicious pancakes topped with powdered sugar and syrup. When the food finally arrived, I was really disappointed. The blueberries actually made the pancakes cold and soggy. Most of the fruit was clumped towards the middle, so I was safe eating the edges of the baked batter. The buttered maple syrup was too greasy. It dripped down my chin and was sickening sweet. My friend ordered the buttermilk fried chicken. I tried a piece. There was barely any chicken, only fried skin. Some of the parts of skin were burnt and tasted terrible. Maybe the chicken was anorexic. I don't know. I could easily make better pancakes at the cost of much less. I can serve them quicker too. With the numerous restaurants in New York and with better quality, I can say that I will most likely not be returning. It isn't a loss for either party though because this place is quite popular.
