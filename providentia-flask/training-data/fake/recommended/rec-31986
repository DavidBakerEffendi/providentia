I've had many halal in my time but as much as I'd like to, I don't think I would five star this. In terms of value, you get damn full for $6.50 but the halal isn't mindblowing enough to justify the super long line (I'm never waiting on the long line anymore;gonna go to 52nd st instead). The lamb is way way delicious. Succulent and some crispy parts to it make it my choice over the chicken. People really seem to like the chicken and I feel like its the more popular choice but to me, it just seems like 'chicken' when I eat it. Basically, I always am conflicted between getting lamb on rice or combo on rice and whenever i opt for the combo, I wish I had gotten the lamb. The white sauce is INCREDIBLE. I would baptize a baby in that white stuff. Hot sauce is insanely hot and should only beat eaten by spicy-experts. Also, white sauce with bbq sauce is an awesome combo and needs to be tried.
