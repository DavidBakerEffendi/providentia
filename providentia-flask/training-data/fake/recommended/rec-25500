What a wonderful place! I came in on a lunch hour, and it was fairly busy. Still, I got my order within 10 minutes, and it was amazing. II had the Keating wrap, which was chicken with walnuts, mandarin oranges, cheese, and more delicious things all in a Spinach wrap. All the other options looked delicious as well! Definitely worth a stop. And, if you're on a tight schedule, call ahead!
