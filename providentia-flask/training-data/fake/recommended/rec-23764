Rude and aggorant front of the house staff, more so condescending and mocking, than accommodating and inviting. Last night I pointed out to the busser that our table was extremely sticky, like all over. It either wasn't wiped or was done so with an extremely dirty towel. Anyway, thinking he'd simply grab a clean towel and give it a quick wipe, instead he gave me some story about the humidity. No, humidity doesn't cause stickiness to your table which makes you have to peel your menu from it. When I asked him to touch it himself, he did, then callously offered to put us back in line to wait for a different table if we didn't like that one. Sooooo you felt it was dirty too, aaaand thennnn... Passed the buck? Not really a home run with service. Also quite embarrassing when bringing two guests who'd never been after I'd raved about how great it is. I guess times have changed at the cantina. Also watching their front of the house manager (blonde lady) dancing around with her staff like an idiot while tables sit needing things and the place is dirty is ridiculous. Get someone in there who can professionally run a bar and up your service game. Minus one star for shitty attitude Minus one star for filthiness Minus one star for being slow and inattentive Minus one star for poor management Remaining star is for the food, recently the only thing okay there Save your energy and frustration and go somewhere else until they turn it around.
