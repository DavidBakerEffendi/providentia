I recently had jury duty, & my wife got me one of their roast pork samiches, which I've been drooling over since I saw this place on Man Vs. Food. She got me the version w/ their sauteed spinach, since I'm not a fan of broccoli rabe. All I can say is.....OH MY FREAKIN' GOD!!! This was the best roast pork sandwich I have ever eaten. EVER. The combination of the home-cooked pork, hand-cut sharp provolone, sauteed spinach & crisp Italian roll made for an absolutely mind blowing, mouth watering sandwhich that I can't wait to get my grubby mitts on again!! Put DiNic's on your bucket list!!!!
