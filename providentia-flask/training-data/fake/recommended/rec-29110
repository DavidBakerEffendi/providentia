You would never expect to find a great place like Masa 8 in a nondescript NJ strip mall, especially not next door to a pizza place called "Chuckles."  But as soon as you're seated, you forget about the whole strip mall thing and begin to feel like you've been transported to a trendy little spot in the city no one else has discovered yet.  The decor is dark and modern, but not sparse--a great place to make googly eyes across the table at your date (you'll both look better in the dim lighting).  The real star, however, is the food.  Comparable to Zento in Philadelphia, the sushi rolls here were both beautiful to look at and exceptionally delicious.  A modern approach using tasty sauces and even a blow torch (try the Volcano roll!) and inventive combinations like tuna with mango make this place well worth a visit.  BYOB
