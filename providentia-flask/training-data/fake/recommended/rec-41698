What happened to this place??!! The service has been on the steady decline for the past year. Just waited nearly 40min for catfish and it didn't come..so I left! It's a slow night too. Absolutely ridiculous! Not sure if I'll be back again. Yes, the food is great but that's no excuse. I could understand even 20min (still longer than a really busy night).
