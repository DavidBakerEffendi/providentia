This is the best restaurant i have ever been so far within the last year! The food is AHHMAZING! The staff are super cool and friendly! Specially Kosta and Mario! Best service ever, thanks guys! The place is very clean! And once again the food is extraordinary! The portions are huge! We took the leftovers home and after 5 days in fridge it is still so yummy and tastes fresh :P i wish i was living next door to it!
