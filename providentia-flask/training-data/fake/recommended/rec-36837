Everytime I go to Balthazar, I come out feeling very content from the amazing food. This is one of my favorite places to go.  I think the food is really good and for the price, it's not bad for the quality that you get. Their brunch food is sooo good. I don't like eggs benedict but I could eat theirs everyday.  I've eaten their for lunch too and thought their food was excellent. The thing that does suck is the long long wait.  I don't think there's been a time that I haven't had to wait at least 30 minutes to get a table and the most recent time I went (Sat at 3pm) they had stopped taking names because they were fully booked.  Even with that con, I still gave this place 5 stars because I love their food so much.  Definitely a good place to try.
