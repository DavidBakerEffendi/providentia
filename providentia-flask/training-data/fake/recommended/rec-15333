John's Roast Pork is down the street from Ikea. It is open something like 4 hours a day (That's an estimate. Probably hyperbolic, because I don't remember the exact hours.) Being near Ikea is a positive, good place to walk off what you ate wrong. The delicious food makes up for the lack of time it is open. I ordered a cheesesteak without. The staff there seems kind of imposing at first, but I found them to be really friendly and ready to make a joke at any time. It's a small shop so you get to hear everyone's business. Which is enjoyable if you are nosy. And, who isn't? The cheese steak itself is delicious. They use good meat and cheese to make a delightful lunchtime experience. One special thing about John's is their rolls. The rolls have seeds on them to create an almost nutty taste in the sandwich. Don't take that the wrong way! It is still delicious, but probably different than any sandwich you have had  before. That difference, in my opinion, makes this place special. I can't pick out a favorite cheesesteak - that's a fool's errand.  So, I cannot say that John's is the best. I can say that it is a great sandwich with that little something special that sets it apart. I love cheesesteaks too much to allow myself to try their other sandwiches. But, if I lived next door perhaps I would. Because, all of the other sandwiches look excellent as well.
