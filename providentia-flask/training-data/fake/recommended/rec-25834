The food is simple, no-fuss, delicious and high-quality. The service is impeccable. I can't say enough good things about how friendly the waitstaff are. When you're new to the West Village and still exploring restaurants, it can be tough to find an unpretentious, casual and cozy place like this. You can tell they get a lot of repeat business because most people that came in tonight were regulars who the owners and waitstaff knew. Always a good sign when there are tons of restaurant options in the area. In short, we will definitely be back! With regard to what we ate and what I can recommend...I had the gnocchi with tomato and meat sauce and it was so yummy that I ate the whole plate! My husband had lobster cannelloni in vodka sauce and he also cleaned his plate. Then, we both had dessert. I got the chocolate chip cheesecake. It was really good, but it's a really big piece split in two, so I recommend sharing if you get it. My husband had the tiramisu and it was so good that after I tried one bite, he wouldn't let me get at it for the rest of the night!
