We went to the Little Owl because of the highly recommended burgers. We showed up late and had drinks on the "perch" which is decorated with flowers and candles and the best wait I've ever had. We asked for a menu and soon realized that they do not serve their famous burgers on the dinner menu. Our host could tell we were on a mission and were very hungry and suggested the meatball sliders and fries to help get us our fix...they definitely did the job! Although this was an appetizer it was one of the best small meals I had in NYC. The service is great, the atmosphere is cozy, and it's a perfect place for dinner and drinks in West Village. Can't wait to go back on my next trip to the Big Apple, but next time we will be getting a burger!
