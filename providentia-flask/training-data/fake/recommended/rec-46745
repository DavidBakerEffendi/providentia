The real deal! Started off with a cactus salad that the four of us shared that was loaded with flavor and as fresh as it gets. Along with that and the awesome salsa n chips were margaritas that are very generous, reasonable and made perfectly! We have been to many Mexican restaurants here in new England and this one has the authenticity, quality, and portions all very reasonably priced for sure! Between the four of us we had fish burritos, chimichangas and steak carnitas Amazing! Â Refried beans and rice seemed like they were made to order that fresh! Ricardo and staff as always very friendly all with smiles and actually enjoying what they are doing. Come early bird during Happy Hour and enjoy this without the wait and experience great food, drink and atmosphere! Definitely a New Haven Favorite!
