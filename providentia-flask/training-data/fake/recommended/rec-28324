This place is awesome. It's always packed for brunch, but wait for the table. The service is quick and friendly. The food is fresh, portions are HUGE. My friend's mimosa was a REAL mimosa - served in a larger glass than some of the Greek cafe's around here, and my bloody mary was made with fresh tomato juice and spiced to the nines. There were also free refills with tthe brunch item, so an extra score. Great value for your money. Open 24/7 - next time I need a late night bite I''m all over it.
