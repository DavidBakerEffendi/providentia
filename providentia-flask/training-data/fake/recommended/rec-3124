delicious and cheap prices.  service was a bit slow, but family run and very friendly! i just had the pork chops with yellow rice and black beans... so good.  we noticed a lot of folks coming in for pick up, i think the rotisserie chicken is a popular item.  lunch for two came out to under $20.   do it!
