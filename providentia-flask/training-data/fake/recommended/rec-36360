You'll feel like you just stepped into Paris w/ a Manhattan crowd. Noisy, tables are close together, and if no reservation, be prepared to wait; but's it's worth the trouble and every penny.  Service-impeccable.  Water glass always full, wine glass never empty. Our Server was funny, cool and helpful w/ the menu.  Had dinner w good buddies and shared up the shrimp cocktail, and goat cheese app. Both very good.  I ordered their special: Steak frites.  Get it..but..Ask for a side of the au poirve sauce.  The waitress offered it to me when I was trying to decide which steak to order and it was the best sauce to accompany a steak that I've had.  My med well was perfect in the middle, a little pink. It was a Little tough on the outer edge, but that's med-well, to avoid that get it med.  I still ate every bite.  Friends had the trout and mussels and raved about it.  For a while there was no conversation, just collective chewing and "mmmm'ing". Highly recommend for a good NY meal.
