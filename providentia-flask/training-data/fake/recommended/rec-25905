Great setting, but just good burgers.  This place is dark, dingy, smells of stale beer - your perfect hole in the place.  But, the burgers are not worth the 45 minute wait to get a table.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium.  The bacon was just right, but the meat lacked any flavor and the cheese wasn't even melted.  What really turned me off was the fact that all the burgers were massed produced with any toppings added later.  It just seemed so impersonal. The beer is cheap and comes in frosty mugs, but I am not sure I would come back to this place.
