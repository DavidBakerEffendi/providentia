I'd heard from others this place was great...but I wasn't really impressed. The prices are slightly high (not overly), but more important, the service was barely ok. The food was also "ok," (come because there's no other choices) thus the 2 star rating. I've been here a few times, and won't return becuase of these very reason. I tried to like them..but uh ...No go!!
