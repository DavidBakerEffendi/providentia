Always loved this place - the whole experience and food is probably the closest thing that I'll find here that can make me feel like I'm living in Paris again. Although it's always busy, the waiters are always very attentive and great at giving suggestions if you're stumped as to what to order. In general, I love the paninis, and pastries (croissants, baguettes) from the bakery, and moules frites, salmon, bouillabaisse, ribs and steak from Balthazar's itself too. The soups are all delicious... I could go on and on raving about this place. Don't hesitate, just go and try for yourself.
