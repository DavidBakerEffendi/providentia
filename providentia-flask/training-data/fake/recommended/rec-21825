Went for brunch and had a very fine time. It was noon on Saturday so there was hardly any wait for three people, and I absolutely loved the cosy space. The service was attentive and helpful, and fantastic given the crowd. As for the food, it was plenty tasty but nothing really wowed me. A fried butternut squash sandwich is an interesting idea, but I could hardly taste the squash it was so thin! And honestly I don't think the cornmeal breading really added. After all, most of the crunch will be coming from the bread in any event. The french fries were very tasty, though they could have been a little crisper. And I got the cold apple cider, which I was absolutely not expecting to have nearly as much cinnamon as it did...but it was decent all the same. Maybe next time I'll try the french toast, which looked delicious going by the table.
