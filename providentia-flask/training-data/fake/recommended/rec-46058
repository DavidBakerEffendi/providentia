This is my favorite place to get pho tai in North Jersey.  I can't travel to Vietnam every week, so this is the closest I can get to the real thing.  The broth is flavorful (NOT salty), and they serve it with asian basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno's and even culantro.  I also love that the noodles they use don't taste starchy and packaged.
