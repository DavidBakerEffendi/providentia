A solid and authentic neighborhood Greek joint with very good service and food, this place is always rocking, which tells you something.  There are other Greek options nearby, like Greek Taverna and It's Greek to Me, but in my opinion, Stamna is better. For instance, where would you find an authentic rabbit stew on the menu? (Sorry, you animal lovers, I love animals too but rabbit is really pretty delicious).  Their grilled octopus will change your mind about that leggy creature:  it melts in your mouth.  Greek salad has a LOT of cucumbers in it (my husband doesn't eat them) so be warned.  Service is very warm and pleasant and when I go here, I am reminded of my trip to Greece so many years ago, and it makes me want to go back.  Very nice dining option and love BYOB places.
