When I heard there was a chicken finger spot I nearly lost my mind! So clearly, I had to try it! My friends and I went in on a Saturday night, pretty late, there was no line and there were only 3 other girls enjoying their delicious looking chicken over by the tables. We ordered and were immediately greeted by Paul the owner who is super cool. He started chatting it up and gave us some samples which were delicious. He also brought us a sample of EVERY SINGLE SAUCE. I can't even begin to think which one was better! The chicken fingers are perfectly crispy and freshly made. I ordered the regular ones since I wanted to experience the original flavors with the sauce. The other girls there were also super cool and we ended up sharing/tasting each others orders since we all had something different lol The only thing is that there is no space to sit really. Only 2 tables so if they're taken up then you are pretty much screwed... I took pictures of the food...I shall post soon...
