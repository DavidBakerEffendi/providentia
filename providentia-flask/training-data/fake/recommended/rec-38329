Been to this restaurant a few times. Excellent selection of Vermont draft beers and nice atmosphere. The food portions seem to be on the small side. We ordered sweet potato fries and the first order was almost burnt and dry. The second order was much better. When we compared our first order (the burnt ones) to the new ones, instead of offering to exchange them, the waitress just said, "I like them better that way myself". Philly Cheeseteak sandwich was small and just average. Much better places in the area for food but good for a couple beers.
