Q: Where to go with bunch of friends for a good time, great food and awesome drinks? A: VPB! A few of my fav foods there - Shepards Pie        So Good Here! - Fish & Chips        - HUGE portions, will barely finish ~ and Fried Oysters if you'd like! - Brew Burger        Because you can order it Black and Blue here w/o fear of getting sick) - Meatloaf        Sweet and Tangy - Appetizers        Nachos, Fried Clams, Fried Oysters, Jalapeno Poppers, Sweet Potato fries ! It's all good! Beers... how can you go wrong with a $4 beer? I'm not a huge fan of beer so I always order the Fruity "Forbidden Fruit", It's sooo goood! They also have Cider beer and Wine Spritzers. For Beer lovers, you're bound to find something you like! The wait on a weekend can go up to 1.5 hrs but it's usually shorter. They don't rush you to leave so once you are in, you are golden.
