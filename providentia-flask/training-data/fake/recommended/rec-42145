Walked past this place too many times before stopping in here last week. Had an extra sweet, genuine server who you could tell was workin' hard for her money. Overall, the food impressed me for what I always assumed was a mediocre joint. My S.O. and I got the Italian mixed greens salad (baller!) and the margarita pizza which had this awesome light, airy crust. Slices were enormous, and yes, we ate the whole thing. Thankfully our sever gave us a fat stack of napkins, it's like she knew we would inevitably wind up covered in sauce. We sat outside and at one point I watched a jogger slow down and literally double-take our meal. Yeah, it was that dang delicious. Absolutely coming back when I need to feed my carb cravings.
