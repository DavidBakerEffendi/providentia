Amazing place!!!! Came here for dinner twice so far and have not been disappointed! Incredible service and terrific super tasty food! They also have an extensive whiskey & drinks menu which is an added bonus. Who doesn't like some great whiskey? ;) Â They also were fantastic with accommodating me for gluten allergies. I loved all the dishes & apps i've tried there and will certainly be coming back for more! Oh and the atmosphere & ambiance are wonderful also! A++
