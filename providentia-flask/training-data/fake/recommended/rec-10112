We  joined the line, and waited for approx one hour , but it was well worth the wait! As out of towners, we drove by many options for pizza, but this spot was tge only one with a massive line at both their locations. We enjoyed amazingly good white clam pizza with garlic, olive oil and oregano!  The thin crust was charred not burnt to cinders like some other brick oven style pies I've tried.  The medium pizza was big as a large would be at other pizzerias,  but this didn't prevent the two us from devouring it.  The Pepe Salad was fresh and delicious as well.
