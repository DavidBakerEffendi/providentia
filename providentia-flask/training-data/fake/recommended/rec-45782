Sultan Wok has my heart. For Chinese, it's my go-to in the area for good reliable classics. I love their Lo Mein, their egg drop and won ton soups, and their dumplings are boss, if a little greasy. But such is that nature of a dumpling. Sweet and sour pork comes crispy and delicious and their chicken/beef with broccoli is always a good bet. My go-to, however, is not one of their Chinese dishes. The thing I get, more often than I am comfortable admitting, is their Japanese bento box. It's $12.50, which is a great price point for what you get. I always get the Bento D, which is 6 pieces of tuna/salmon sashimi, 4 little fried shumai in a touch of yummy teriyaki-type sauce, a teeny bit of kani salad, a teeny bit of seaweed salad, and a nice mound of sushi rice. Also, miso soup. For $12.50. Of course, when I tack on tax, and the tip and delivery charge to cover for my laziness in not wanting to pick it up, it ends up being a little more. But at base level, it's a good amount of food for one and I love it every time. Yay Sultan!
