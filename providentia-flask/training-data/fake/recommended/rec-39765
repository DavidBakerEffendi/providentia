I know this place is on a lot of burger aficionados' lists, so I had been meaning to try it since my move to NY in February. The perfect opportunity came about when a friend from out-of-town was visiting -- we were both on the West side and we were looking for an under-$10 meal. The bar was pretty empty (Thursday afternoon past lunch) so we were seated right away. If you are looking for a down-to-earth burger in an gourmet setting, this is not it. It is a bar that happens to serve really beefy standard burgers. You get a hamburger, a cheeseburger, or bacon cheeseburger for around $6. It wasn't the best burger that I've had since I've been here, but man it is a fat burger. The meat wasn't as juicy or flavorful as I would have liked, but I will tell you my 100 lb. self finished most of it and had to skip dinner afterwards.
