LOVE! I have had so many restaurants disappoint me lately, but disappoint Ilili did not. Thank you, Ilili, for allowing me to have an amazing dinner date again. So what was so amazing? The food, for starters. Usually my boyfriend and I (okay maybe just I) go a little crazy when we do tapas/small plates style dinners, but I'd eaten a large lunch and wasn't very hungry so we ordered 3 mezzas and one from the grill: the bok choy, mekanek (lamb sausage), spicy octopus & calamari, and a small/single order of duck kabob. The bok choy had this delicious sauce drizzled on top that was super tasty - definitely a fave of mine. The mekanek was FAN-TASTIC, probably the best part of the meal for me even though I didn't eat too much of it just because I didn't want to fill up on sausage. It didn't taste like your average merguez - it had a delicious flavor all its own and wasn't as heavy or greasy as I'm used to from most places. The octopus & calamari was heavy on the paprika (which I liked) and the sauce was perfect for dipping warm pita bread into. The duck was surprisingly my least favorite of the 4 dishes we had, but I also first tried it without any of the seasoning that came with it. My boyfriend fully enjoyed it, though. Our server was also very friendly and helpful. My one complaint would be the drink I ordered - the Phoenician Lemonade. It was a cocktail with a bunch of different citrus-y liquers and citrus vodka, but I'm pretty sure they also dumped in some extra sugar. I took one sip and sent it back for a plain lemon vodka + tonic. Additionally, the wait was over 20 minutes even those we were promised less than 10, and service in the lounge was pretty spotty as there was one server for the entire lounge section. A bit pricey for sure, but all in all, I definitely recommend it!
