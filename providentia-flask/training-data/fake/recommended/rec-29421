Got there around 6pm and this is a small place that had about 6 counter seat.  It is a very tiny place that seems smaller with spare chairs and tables pressed agains the windows.  Probably for placing outside during warmer weathers. Ordered a cheese, and mushroom with mayo on it.  Tasted ok.  most of the tastes came from the cheese rather than the meat itself.  They chopped the meat so small and they cooked it so long, that most of the fat was cooked out of the meat, so all you got was a bunch of tasteless dry meat.  They mushroom add nothing to the flavor or texture of the sandwich.  Tried dumping a bunch of hot pepper paste they had on the counter, but still didn't add anything to the sandwich. Kind of dissapointed considering how far we drove to try this out.
