Wow. Anything I've placed in my mouth, that has come from Empanada Mama's, has been so tasty I just have to smile thinking about it. In my short time back in NYC, we've already had it delivered to work twice and everybody raves. I have so many more of their empanadas to try, and I'm already plotting my next choices. Sure, it's deep fried, and totally junk-food, but it's oh so good. The pastry is great. The Stuffings are fantastic. I love their green sauce. Love, love love!
