Not really sure what to think of this place. The food was just alright. I forgot what I ordered but it was really salty, as was everything else my table ordered. Because everyone raves about this place I guess I should give it another shot. The waitstaff was hands off, which I appreciated, until they were TOO hands off and I had to wave them down (which is demeaning for the both of us). Also, the restaurant is deceptively large!
