This was probably the best dining experience in my life. If I could give 6 stars to this place I would. I must say I don't go eating out that often, but when I do I try to find a special place to visit. This was by far the best so far. Went there last night and even though we were seated downstairs (when making a reservation make sure to request to sit upstairs on the first floor by the fireplace), the food, the service, the atmosphere, and the wine were fabulous. We ordered regular tasting menu with wine pairing. 6 course meal was out of this world. I tried to keep notes on the food and wine but gave up quickly since it took away from enjoying the moment and the meal. Here are highlights: - Porcini Flan - nothing I ever tasted was so good. Crab meat was just perfect - flaky, smooth texture went down in perfect harmony with truffles. My wife didn't enjoy flan on the bottom but I thought it completed the picture flawlessly. - Organic Connecticut Farm Egg - I still can't describe how good it was. Simple to the core, the dish was absolutely brilliantly executed. - Rack of Lamb that I had and Duckling my wife had were top notch. Again, simple but impeccably executed. And lastly, in order to give desert its due justice I would need to spend days writing about it. Due to lack of time I just have to say WOW. It was amazing. We left the place barely able to move we were so stuffed with such good quality food that even this morning I couldn't eat anything to try to prolong the feeling of food ecstasy. One last point on the service - it was first class. Wine steward realizing that I knew a certain wine, offered me to try something completely different that wasn't supposed to be included and it was great. She also gave us extra glasses of wine to try on the house. The rest of the staff was very attentive and not annoying at all. All in all David Bouley deserves all the accolades and more for a brilliant meal I had last night.
