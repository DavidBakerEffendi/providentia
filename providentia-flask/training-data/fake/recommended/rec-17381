We waited 45 minutes on a Sunday night for a table, then it started raining and all the outside diners came running inside and took all the open tables, so we had to stand there and wait longer. When we finally got seated we all shared lots of appetizers, which were all very good.  We all shared the famous Sangria, which was Not good.  It just tasted like grape juice, and when we told the waiter what it tasted like, he replied "that's really what it is " because they do not have a liquor licence, and yet they claim to make famous Sangria?!?? For dinner I had the Churasco Steak which was the very Best I've ever tasted.  It was delicious and I do look forward to going back for this Churasco, (not the sangria).  The service was good, as they are so overstaffed with so many people running around, back & forth, so much, it almost looked chaotic, but they got the job done.  This place is very LOUD as all the noise bounces off all the walls so much that you can't hear the people talking at your own table.  To have a conversation, you have to yell at the people at your own table.
