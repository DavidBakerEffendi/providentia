This place rocks. Fresh, delicious flavors, cheap prices, quick service. The noodle with pork soy sauce is one of my favorite dishes, it sounds kind of gross but it's divine. I agree with Yelpers who say the servers could be friendlier, but as I see it that's just part of the authentic experience you're getting here.
