Disappointed. I love live uni and when I saw it on the menu I had to try it out. The uni did not taste fresh and for the price, I felt ripped off. I ate fresh uni many times and the taste was definitely off. I got some negiri as well. They were priced per piece, expensive and tiny. If it was good quality I'll happily pay it but definitely nothing spectacular. I felt like I can have the same quality elsewhere in philly for the same price. Will not go back.
