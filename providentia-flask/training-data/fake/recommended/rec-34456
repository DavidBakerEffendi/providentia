Coming from a 'city' that has a total of 6 Indian restaurants, "Indian Food" was at the top of my activity list for my weekend in NY.  Came here for lunch, and it hit the spot.  Everything is served as a wrap, and tasted wonderful.  A bit spicy, but not hot - ask about the intensity of different rolls if you're sensitive to heat. You definitely need 2 rolls, so it's not super cheap, but I didn't think it was expensive for NY, either.  Tried the chai, and it was good. Be aware that seating is limited, and the front section will be a bit chilly due to the door.
