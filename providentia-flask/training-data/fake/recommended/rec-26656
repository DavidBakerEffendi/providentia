definite pluses: 1. amazing papaya salad - crunchy green papaya, sweet papaya chunks and dressed with a very acid balanced vinaigrette, topped with creamy slices of perfectly ripe avocado 2. the carnita chimichanga was excellent! Â the crust was thin and crisp, not greasy at all and the meat was tender and flavorful 3. 2 kinds of delicious salsas with the complimentary chips that were refilled quickly once we had finished the first batch negatives: 1. it is quite loud; definitely not your intimate dining candle lithand holding sort of place
