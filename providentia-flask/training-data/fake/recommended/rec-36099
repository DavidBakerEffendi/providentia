If you will be in this part of New York at breakfast time, you owe it to yourself to make the trip to Balthazar. I can't imagine a more perfect breakfast spot. (This review is for breakfast only.) They seem to have every detail down perfectly. The style is Parisian. The waiters wear white aprons. Lattes are served in bowls. There are giant arrangements of real flowers. The baked goods are tempting enough to kill a low-carb diet. (I had the pain au chocolate and do not regret it!) But my REAL breakfast was the eggs en cocotte: eggs, cream, and thyme cooked in a ceramic mini-tart dish. (The menu identified the ceramic dish as a ramekin, but it was not what is sold as a ramekin in the U.S.) I want to have eggs en cocotte for breakfast every day from now on. My partner had the quotidian-sounding bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese, which, like everything we've tried there, was somehow better than usual. The service was wonderful. And just like in Paris, you have to request the check!
