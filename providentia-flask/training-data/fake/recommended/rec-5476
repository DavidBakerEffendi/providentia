Four stars for the awesome venue with reasonably priced shows, and awesome set-up. Three stars for the bar/restaurant- beer list is great, bloody marys and other drinks are on point. The food is good as well but in my opinion kinda overpriced. That said I like JB's as a place to hangout and grab drinks, and maybe snack.
