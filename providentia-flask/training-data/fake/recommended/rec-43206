This place is no joke. The menu fits on one side of an 8x11. The food is cheap, fast, and delicious. The cups of coffee are gigantic. What else do you need? Since I'm a food service worker, if I can see the food being made, you'd better believe that I'm watching it go down like a hawk. At Owl Breakfast, you can see the grill; the whole kitchen's practically behind the counter. Health code rating: clean as a whistle. I'd watch those guys cook all day. Killin it, Owl Breakfast. I can't believe you guys aren't more popular (my friends are always like, "never heard of it." It's at Broad and Cecil B for cryin' out loud!) I just wish you were open later. Like all night.
