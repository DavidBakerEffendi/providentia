Hands down one of my favorite places to eat & always a place to suggest to people. I can't believe it's taken me so long to review it. It's cute and quaint and charming and so simple. I've been here several times and every single thing I've ordered has been delicious. My favorite is the lemon/rosemary chicken crepe. All their other crepes are great too. Tonight, I went for the first time to have dinner. We dined al fresco, and ordered the duck salad to share before our entrees. It was fantastic. Grilled duck meat over a bed of spinach with apples and mangos and a balsamic reduction. Then I ordered the mustard chicken penne, which was awesome as well. This place is a must try, and you'll always want to come back!
