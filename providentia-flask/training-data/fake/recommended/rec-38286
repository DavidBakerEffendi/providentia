I feel bad for this place. It needs so much help. First of all, upon entering there was a strong smell of sewage? I'm not sure, but whatever it was someone was trying to mask it with air freshener. Next they seat us by what I will describe as a greenhouse window? (glass ceiling and wall) in 10 degree weather while there was a room of open tables. The hostess was pleasant enough and moved us when we complained. The service was very slow, we ordered drinks which seemed to take forever, also ran out of a type of vodka. Drinks finally came and one was spilled into and on my bag, she was very apologetic but ughhh... Now we had a couple questions about items on the menu, the waitress seemed inexperienced and had a hard time answering any questions. At one point looked at our menu and re read description to us. We placed our order and later learned they ran out of an item, the alternate she gave us to the fish special was some type of steak which didn't exactly seem like an appropriate substitution. Food was average. The chicken parm was ok......Get the bill, we give her two cards to split. she accidentally put the full amount on one, she came back and apologized and said she "thinks" it was voided but keep an eye on your credit statement....hahahaha. I don't think it will be a repeat visit for me. - (note: this review was for a dinner we had a month or so ago.)
