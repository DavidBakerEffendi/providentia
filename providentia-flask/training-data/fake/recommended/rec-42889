Great spot for good sushi. The rolls are creative and there are so many options on the menu that even if you don't like sushi, you can still dine there. I'm a fan of the tuna dumpling which is basically avocado, crabmeat and crispy panko flakes wrapped inside of fresh tuna (not your typical dumpling). My friends enjoyed the monkey roll and I really liked my NY roll. Can't wait to go back.
