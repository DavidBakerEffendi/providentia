These sandwiches are carefully crafted with love every time.  This place is a classic.  It's not the cheapest sandwich place and it's certainly not the quickest, but it might be friendliest and it's among the best.  They have a huge variety of sandwiches ranging from a classic turkey club or corned beef special to a hoagie of their creation.  It's not to be missed.  You'll wait a long time if you order in-store, even if there are only 2 people ahead of you, but you won't mind.  The staff is always friendly and always has a joke to go with samples of various meats and cheeses.
