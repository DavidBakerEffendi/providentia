I loooove their pork bun sandwiches... so light and delicious--YUM! I will be visiting soon for bo ss√§m (whole pork butt, dozen oysters, kimchi, rice) which I will need to reserve ahead of time. The place is trendy and will fill up quickly for both lunch and dinner service. Make sure to make reservations and request a bench seat. The bar stools are a bit claustrophobic and practically had a screaming war just to be heard across the table.
