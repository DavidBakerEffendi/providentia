I only attended for one meal with these folks but WOW! --- Yes WOW!! To start with the service was impeccable.  Absolutely, Impeccable! I took a group for a birthday dinner for one of our friends and we loved it.  A group of four people all whom ordered Filets and Fish, add bottled water and a great bottle of wine left me with a bill that was just a tad, as in five dollars, over $200.   The overall design of the place is cute and cozy with a professional feel to it.  The music is at the perfect level and fits with the decor. All I have to say is you need to try this location... the sweet potatoes put mine to shame. Now you ask why not give them five stars? The answer is simple, I have only been there once and everyone needs to improve -- they had run out of lobster bisque that evening so I was saddened. But try this place out!!!
