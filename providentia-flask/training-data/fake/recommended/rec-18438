Stopped into Reviver for lunch today on a work trip to the city and had the North Shore Mahi salad.  The salad topped with two pieces of fish was delicious and the perfect portion size while still filling me up.  My favorite part was the dressing which I was able to get on the side.  The dressing was fresh and very flavorful, you can easily taste that there are absolutely no preservatives in it.  Also, the staff was incredibly friendly and seems happy to answer any questions you might have about the menu. I love this place because it's a healthy lunch/dinner spot where you can pick up a delicious, quick meal that tastes fresh at a decent price.  I will definitely be back!
