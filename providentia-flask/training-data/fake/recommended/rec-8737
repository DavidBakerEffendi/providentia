Fancy but simple food with great flavor and taste. Food cooked well, amazing presentation of food, yet strangely casual atmosphere... In a good way i think. Dimmed lighting but not so dark you can't see your food. Attentive but not annoying waiters. Not too loud to have a conversation but not so quiet the neighbors could hear your conversation. Tables not on top of each other as much as some nyc restaurants. Open for food until 4am. That is how we ended up there. Which is awesome when you are late night and want to not eat McDonald's. Got the barbeque ribs which they brought out with a little flaming sterno thing to heat them on which was nice because we talked while we ate. Roasted chicken soft enough to cut with a fork. Drinks. Chocolate Bruno for dessert which was amazing. I dreamt about it. Only lost one star because i was asked not to use my electronic cigarette in the restaurant which by all admissions is against the law in nyc but rarely enforced anywhere unless someone complains. Perhaps a patron noticed and was irritated with it and i didn't know about that? Or maybe the owner/manager was not comfortable with it. Check was much lower than what were expected but we did not order the most expensive items on menu and only one of us drinking. Were there for longer than average but never felt rushed. Seems like it would be a nice date place. Enjoyed the experience. Might not return because not vape friendly... But overall would recommend.
