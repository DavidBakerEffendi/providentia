I resisted the hype.  But after a weekend of good eats spanning Michelin stars, celebrity chefs and TONY recs, this is still the meal that lingers on my mind.  Even if it required a long line in the falling dusk and sidewalk scarfing amidst July heat wave humidity which throbbed on undeterred.   Yeah, I'd do it all over again just for another plate of that magic.  It's weird: as separate elements, the chicken, lamb, rice, pita, white sauce, and hot sauce are just ordinary dudes (although the rice, lamb, and sauce should get special shout outs).  But together, they are DELICIOUS VOLTRON.   I'd get the chicken/lamb combo over rice, shuffle the pita to one side in order to properly drench the plate with white sauce, make sure to reach for the hot sauce not the bbq sauce, and not share.
