This place is a must for steak lovers! Ordering the Rodizio will allow you to have a taste of all of the different meats they have. I've been there 3 times and each time, the wait staff was very attentive (you won't be sitting around wondering where your waiter went). The selection at the salad bar isn't extensive which is fine because of the portion sizes! I'd definitely recommend making a reservation if going on a weekend. However; if you decided to go at the spur of the moment, the wait time will certainly be worth it!
