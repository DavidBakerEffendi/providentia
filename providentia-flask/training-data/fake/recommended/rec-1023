This place did not live up to the hype. The cheesesteak was too simple. It didn't have enough cheese to accompany the steak. Â There was nothing special about it that made it worth the 30 minute wait. I would not go back due to the fact that they had a sign that said "This is America, when ordering speak English" and because the cheesesteaks sucked. Being of Hispanic decent and seeing the Hispanic community right next door to this establishment, I was disgusted to see this blatant bigotry. Two clear reasons why you should not go to Geno's and choose Pat's instead.
