I think we have a new favorite street slice. Such a convenient location in relation to Times Square and shows. This is the real deal. Perfect pizza indeed. The name is well deserved. We get plain cheese. I'm partial to this style versus the margherita style pizza you find all over the city because margherita can be too crispy and dry. This however is luscious with the perfect amount of sauce and cheese. The crust is bendy and delish. Yummmmmmm.
