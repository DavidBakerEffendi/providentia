I had dinner last night, and I don't know how much of it was due to the fact that I hadn't had a nice meal in a while, but it was AMAZING. We both had the tasting menu ($80 for 7 courses - 5 savory, an intermezzo and a dessert) and shared a nice bottle of Gewurztraminer ($40ish?). I have to say, their wine list is quite extensive and goes across a wide range of prices, which is great. Poor folks like me deserve wine too :'( The tasting menu is basically smaller portions of items already on the menu, which was cool with me because I couldn't decide what to eat. (On the other hand, I thought a tasting menu would include off-menu creations? But how would I know, I've never done it before.) We had the duck meatball and duck breast (deelish), the swordfish (a bit too charred for my taste, not my fave), the mustard greens salad, the arctic char (my favorite fish done excellently) and the garganelli (like buttah). The intermezzo was a bay leaf sorbet-- pretty unique and tasty! A bit medicinal for some, I'll say. The dessert was chocolate souffle with a caramel sauce and it was perfect. Light and airy but still rich. The service was top-notch, the waitress was a pleasure and we never felt rushed. Our meal was 2 hours long! The only thing is that the tables are a bit close together, but I guess that's very typical of this city and there's little I can do about it. I will definitely be back.
