This has to be one of the best places to eat in midtown.  I go almost every week for lunch and the food is always very consistent.  I've tried most of the rolls -- all are great.  I've tried other places that sell Kati rolls, and nothing compares to this. Only downside is that the lunch rush can be a bit slow, so go before noon to beat the rush.
