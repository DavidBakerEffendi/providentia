Went here with 2 friends that lived nearby and had some great pizza.  We started off with the riva chopped salad and it was one of the better salads I've had in awhile.  Next, we tried 3 pizzas -margherita, wild mushroom, and burrata.  The wild mushroom was my favorite - the truffles made it taste great.  I also had a great Italian wheat beer - Stone R.  It was first Italian craft beer and I'll have to try more.  I'll definitely try this place again when I'm back in the area.
