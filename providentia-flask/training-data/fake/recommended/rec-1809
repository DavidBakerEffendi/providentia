My dreams are finally to come true, try a REAL Philly steak sandwich in Philadelphia. I have never been to Philly before so as soon as I arrive, I do a b-line to downtown. I didn't arrive into Philly till 1am so the pickings were slim at that time. So it was either Pats or Genos. Pats had better reviews so I came to see what the hype was all about. I have never been so disappointed and I wasn't alone here. I made my boss suffer through this sandwich as well. I don't know if it was a bad day, wrong time, humid air or what but it really was terrible! First the bread was totally stale. I went for it WIT onions and provolone and even these two ingredients couldn't save the bland flavor of the meat. What the heck PAT, how could you let me down so greatly?? The peppers were really hot but even they couldn't restore flavor to this sandwich. Next time I come back I am going to try Tony Lukes, all my new Philly friends say that is the place to go!
