I will start by saying I had high expectations. I went to the one in Chelsea and left disappointed. We ordered a ceaser salad and cheese pizza. The salad was the same as anywhere else and the pizza while good lacked the dazzling factor. What made this an eh visit though was the service. I had to ask 3 times to get my drink even though the place was nearly empty. I have been a server in the past and never would I leave my customer without a drink while I chit-chat with my buddy. That being said it also took about forever to get the check. Â The only thing memorable about the place was the terrible service.
