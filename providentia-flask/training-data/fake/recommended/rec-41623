Went here for petit dejeuner (light breakfast with bread, in this case a bagel). Bagel and lox were good. Beautiful room reminded me of places I've seen in Paris. It was a lovely early fall day, and the large windows were open and we had a wonderful view of Rittenhouse Square. But the service was poor. No I suppose one could make a case for leisurely dining without being rushed. But that would suppose the coffee and food had arrived for one to not be rushed over. The waitress disappeared and only returned when it was time to give me the check.
