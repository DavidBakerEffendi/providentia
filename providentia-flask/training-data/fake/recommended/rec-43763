Fantastic Urban Italian: Portions are at my size, not too much, not too little. Exactly the size of my stomach. So that I can enjoy all meals that I order. Cozy and smart casual enviroment. Always busy, go before your stomach rings you up. Have couple of drinks at the bar (if you are lucky to find a spot before the meal) Good service with pleasent cool staff. Totally recommended.
