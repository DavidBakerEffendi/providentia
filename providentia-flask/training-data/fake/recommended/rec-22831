Maybe the best dining experience ever. made reservation for my wife's birthday and food and dessert here made me speechless. staffs are very friendly and professional. explained well enough what the ingredients are for all tasting menu. 10 tasting menu is sorta expensive but well worth it for your special day. everything from the tasting menu was awesome. so no need to mention how the taste was.. you won't regret for your choice.
