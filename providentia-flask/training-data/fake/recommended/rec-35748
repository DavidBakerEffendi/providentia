I do declare that Village Whiskey is triumphant in serving the best burger in Philadelphia!  This is what burgers should taste and look like.  The patty is roughly the size of a hockey puck, perfectly round with beautiful char marks, fresh LTO and topped with amazing manchego cheese and smoked applewood bacon. And please don't forget to order the duck fat fries........you will not be disappointed.   The bar is chocked full of interesting and off-the-cuff whiskeys and bourbons.  My husband got a few "custom" drinks that were not on the menu....very creative, extremely tasty.....these are not your run-of-the mill frou frou drinks.   Be prepared to wait for a table.... this place is jumping!  Cozy up to a spot at the bar and order a libation that you wouldn't normally get.  The drinks, the burgers, and the lively atmosphere is addictive.......I am excitedly awaiting my return trip!
