Very small bar with an upscale-feeling kind of twist There are ~6 craft beers to choose from Despite being ridiculously crowded (bc this was part of the craft beer bar crawl) the bartenders were friendly and fast There is a small dining area adjacent to the bar that does not look like it was part of the bar because of how upscale-like it looked I did not get a chance to check out the menu but perhaps next time
