After coming away profoundly disappointed by Noodle Bar last year, I came to Ssam Bar with a bit lower expectations than I probably should have. Still, I had a great meal here and was reassured that I like Dave Chang for a good reason. Duck Liver Mousse: not quite foie, but still great. Tripe with chiles: tripe can either be totally delicious or absolutely fucking wretched depending on how it's cooked and who cooks it. Luckily, this was the former. Great texture, great spice. Shanghai noodles: probably my only real "meh" moment. Just not that exciting; no ingredients really popped out or excited me. Pork belly bao: compared favorably to my own personal favorites, the ones from The Chairman truck in SF. Chard and fried onions: veggie special the week I stopped by, and probably the best dish of the night. Great preparation - tasted of sesame oil and garlic, and the fried onions were a great touch. Trout with pistachio sauce: the sauce was a great touch here. Light, nutty, but not overpowering, it cut through the flavor of the trout well. Fried rice cakes and sausage: kind of a porky ddokboki thingie, but this one really stood out for me. I ate most of it, and didn't allow my dinner mates to get too much. I am a greedy pig at times. All in all, only the Shanghai noodles really missed for me. Other than that, great food, and it wasn't busy - that kept up my lucky streak for NYC this summer. For whatever reason I missed every rush and big line...
