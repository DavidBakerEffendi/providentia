So thrilled to have found such an adorable coffee shop near my apartment and with phenomenal espresso drinks too! The space is long and small, making it an intimate atmosphere. There's a good breeze that flows through the space & extra seating tucked in the back of the restaurant. They are in fact open on Sundays despite their yelp hours! The barista said they are planning on adding wine & more food to the mix too. I didn't try the food or pastries, but will definitely be going back.
