Best of ingredients, however, they need to provide the customer with a greater quantity of them. I swear that they must make about a dozen paninnis with a single 3 oz. can of Italian tuna. The female wait staff is certainly friendly enough but I don't need 4 or 5 of them to ask me if everything is ok, or if anybody has taken my order halfway through my paninni. The place is clean and efficient but too small. I don't want to be able to smell the deodorant, or the lack of it on the people piled on top of me. How can a desert crepe prepared 3 feet from my table arrive to me cold ? If you are a hearty diner trying to lose weight and just enjoy dining in public then this is the place for you. If you are uneasy with being stared at for 25 to 30 minutes by the 2 or 3 local loiterers, then you most likely will want to stay away to avoid the temptation of confronting the loiterers and creating a "scene". People will figure this place out and put it in its' place, and it is too bad because I was really hoping for this place to be a winner.
