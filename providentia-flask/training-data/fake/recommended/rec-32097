Our hotel recommended this resturaunt so we headed over there.  The staff was wonderful.  My water glass never got below 1/2 full and that says a lot because I drink lots of water.  We had children in our group and the food options for them was great.  My son had the chicken strips and I couldn't believe the portion that they brought him.  I recommend saving room for dessert.  I can't remember the name of it but it was vanilla and chocolate ice cream in a chocolate shell.
