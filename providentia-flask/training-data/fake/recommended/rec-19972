I love this place. The drinks are great-- although the beer selection could be better considering how well it would go with some of their food. The food is what really sets this restaurant apart though. Both times I've been Â here, my meat has been cooked perfectly, and the sides were paired really well. The steak and fried chicken are great, and the duck meatloaf is so good, especially for something so unique. Also, it's great to find a place that isn't afraid of a little fat, because it knows how to cook it right. If you get dessert, definitely go for the pecan pie sundae, it's awesome!
