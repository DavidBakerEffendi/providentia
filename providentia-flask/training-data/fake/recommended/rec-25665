I've worked in this area for the last three years and have bemoaned the lack of fresh, creative and healthy food in the area for that whole time.  Fork and Spoon opening recently was the best thing that's happened to lunch. They have so much great food- the variety is awesome- salads, soups, sushi to order,  noodles, and a hot bar that always has an amazing variety of healthy and fresh options. I honestly don't think I've eaten anywhere else since this place opened. The food is so consistently good, and creative and tasty, the presentation is clean and appealing and the place is always immaculate. Plus everyone who works here is incredibly friendly. Not much more to say- if you haven't gone, go. And to the owners and staff, thank you!
