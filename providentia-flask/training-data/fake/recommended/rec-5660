This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants that I ever been! The food is awesome - I suggest the sesame seitan and the fried tofu with cashew nuts. The price is very good, good amount of food, and I also love the jasmine with green tea that they serve with water. The service is good and friendly. They also deliver very fast. The restaurant has a good decoration and it is very clean. I've been in Philly for only 1 month and already went there about 5 times!
