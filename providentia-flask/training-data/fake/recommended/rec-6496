Yay! I'm a big fan!  Order the mixed salads...not because it is a bargain but because otherwise you would have to choose.  we ordered the eggplant (baba gahnou), labneh, lentils and bulgur, fava beans and beets, along with a merguez sandwich and soup. then we ordered more babganou.  the labneh was perfect on the merguez sandwich--and should be a topping for all of the sandwiches. You can probably order less and be really cheap, but why?  everything is so good you don't have to decide, just order what you want.   they really appreciate when you appreciate their food. at first the waiter seemed a little bored, but as we devoured the food and ordered more, he paid more and more attention--really nice to see they notice when you love their food. very homey in back--do not be deterred by the sign on the door or the door in fact--what looks like and is labelled a 'pita' place is indeed home cooking by a true home chef--one who takes pride and care in the preparation. can't wait to go back.
