This is one of these places that I have been wanting to go to for years. I finally did a few months ago and loved it. This is a place that food speaks for itself. I ordered a Bistro Burger. It was delicious and juicy. The burger was about 7 or 8 Oz's of perfectly cooked medium beef. It had melted American with a couple of strips of crispy bacon. The burger was a perfect explosion of flavors and crispiness. Outstanding. I sat at the bar and service was fast, efficient and friendly. Beers were $3 for Bud Light. This is not a gourmet burger place with exotic meats. This is a burger place were the Burgers speaks for itself. It is tasty and did I say juicy, very juicy. The menu is simple with 5 or 6 items. I love this place with the cheap beer, burgers and well place TVs. I only have the Bistro Burger and a few beers. There has been a couple times that I had a second one. They are so good. Yummy.............
