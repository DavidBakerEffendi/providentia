I love this place. I live in the neighborhood and just starting coming here regularly last year. The food is very tasty, and the drinks just keep on flowing. The waitstaff is terrific; they often have to deal with large noisy groups of folks, but both customers and waitstaff are cheerful and respectful -- it's just a laid-back, yet energetic, noisy, friendly place. I do have to comment on "Emily S.'s" "review" of her experience last night at the Ear. I was sitting there with my friend, eating my dinner, and this group of perhaps 20 people came bombing in to the dining area. The waitstaff was trying to accommodate them, putting tables together, etc., but most of the group just kept milling about, and, frankly, d--king the staff around. They got more and more loud and belligerent, and, finally, one "bro" climbed up on a chair and started bellowing! When asked by the waitstaff to please sit down, he began to hurl verbal abuse at her. I was absolutely flabbergasted at the outrageous behavior that "Emily S." and her group exhibited. The Ear can be a noisy place, but the vibe is always sweet and gentle fun. These folks definitely came in tanked with an aggressively bad attitude. Everyone there breathed a sign of relief when they took the staff's suggestion and left.
