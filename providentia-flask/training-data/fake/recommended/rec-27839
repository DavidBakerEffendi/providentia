Went to dinner here Friday night with a party of 3.  One of our guest was late, so we had to wait to be seated.  No problem, we ordered  a few drinks and had 6 oysters at the bar.  So far so good and the atmosphere was fun with music but not to loud where you had to scream.  Ordered the speck and mushroom pizza and Wild mushroom risotto croquettes as apps once at the table.  The pizza was amazing and had the wow factor.  Prob the best item we had in the meal.  My friend ordered the scallops and shrimp.  He noted it was great and perfect size after eating the pizza for an app.  I had the pasta with beef ragu which very good.  GF had the seafood pasta and said it was a little too fishy for her.  Overall Emporio had good atmosphere and nice dining space in the back.  They had a nice drink selection and plenty of wines. Food was very good and I would def come back especially for the pizza.  Our server was very attentive and on top of his game. The bartender seemed like she didnt want to be there and over charged me, but did correct it when I said something.  I give it 3.5 to 4 stars...
