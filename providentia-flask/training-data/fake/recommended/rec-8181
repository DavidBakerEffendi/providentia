any venue that will host the air guitar regionals is the place for me.   the food is rather tasty... from the baked mozarella to the cubano.  nice beer list (including doc's cider, which was perfect on a warm spring night). full of hipsters, but still quick and friendly service. the upstairs music venue?  awesome.  fun selection of bands.  the balcony provides an awesome view...and full of beer-throwing madness for air guitar shows. loves.
