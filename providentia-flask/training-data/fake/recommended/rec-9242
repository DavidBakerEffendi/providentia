Coming off a red eye flight, we come across this chic grandma's kitchen feel of a cafe.   Everything on the menu was divine. We ordered: - 3 eggs omlette w/ fries - pumkin waffles w/ apple butter - penny egg croissant sando w/ pesto, american cheese & ham - homemade granola w/ yogurt - french toast.....not so good b/c they use baguette & it was too chewy Service was friendly and it fueled us for a day of shopping b/c the price was just right. --------------------------------------------------­------------ *Update from 2/22/08: Another must....Irish oatmeal w/ brown sugar and crasins......so good on a snow cold morning.
