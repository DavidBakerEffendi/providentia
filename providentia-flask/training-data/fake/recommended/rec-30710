I am a connoisseur of biryani: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi… It is the food of gods, imo. I don't care what you think. Among the various types of biryani eaten by gods, Hyderabadi biryani is the creme de la creme. You only get to eat Hyderabadi biryani if you are the superman of gods... or something like that. It is the only food on this planet I will kill someone for. You just need to bring me Hyderabadi biryani and I'll get naked for you in a heartbeat. Wait, scratch that.... I'll get naked for you if you are cute, regardless of the biryani. A brief, but not comprehensive info about Hyderabadi biryani: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy… Properly prepared biryani is a rarity in the US. I am yet to find a restaurant in the US that makes Hyderabadi biryani as well as the motherland. Even in the motherland there are only certain places that are considered temples of biryani (because I claim it is the food of Gods, it is only appropriate to call these restaurants temples). Places like Bawarchi, Paradise cafe, Garden restaurant, and a few others in Hyderabad are the temples where you can get this kind of food eaten by gods. Now that I have provided the context, let's get to the review. Ali Baba is among the top 3 places in the entire country that come close to making an authentic Hyderabadi biryani. It is still not the same as I remember, but it is pretty darn good. The rest of the stuff from this restaurant is just alright. It is only the biryani that matters. Well, $hit! Now you know where to go and act all god-like.
