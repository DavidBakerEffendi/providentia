Upside:  Succulent pulled pork with LARGE pieces, not just threads.  Tasty barbecue beans, nice snap peas (which are incorrectly labeled as edamame), zippy slaw and pickles.   Inexpensive for a group if you order by the pound. Meh: Dry, under-seasoned brisket, forgettable chicken.  Everything improves with sauce, bottles on every table.  (I know, barbecue is better without sauce...but not here.) Lousy: Ran out of ribs, told us to get in line again 25 min later.  We didn't.  Awful high school cafeteria atmosphere -- terribly loud, people hanging over you like vultures waiting to capture your table.  Do NOT come here on a date or to have a comfortable meal with friends.  No wine, just beer.   Bottom line:  Some of the meats were enjoyable but overall not a great meal.  We might return to carry out the famous ribs, but would not dine-in again.
