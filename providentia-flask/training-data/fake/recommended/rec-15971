The atmosphere is romantic, cozy, cute, and vintage. The food is good/great.  I dined here twice and it seems as though the appetizers outshine the entrees.  Get the burrata and truffle flat bread.  I don't have an entree to recommend...maybe the ravioli.   Dirty martini was good as well.  And, the waitress was very nice and attentive.
