Place is a solid 10!  Great addition to the neighborhood a few years ago and has thrived ever since.  The bar is small so not much room to wait so be sure to make a reservation.  We have tried almost everything on the menu over the last couple years and nothing but good things to say.  It is a gem.  Also during the spring and summer they have outside seating which is good for kids...
