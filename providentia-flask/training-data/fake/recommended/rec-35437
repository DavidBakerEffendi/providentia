On my way to Paris, to avoid doing two red eye flights, I broke the trip in NYC and spent two days there.  My friend I was travelling with took me out to dinner at this quaint Japanese restaurant called Katsu-Hama.  It was heaven on earth. My first taste of Japanese food ever, eons and eons ago was Tonkatsu and ever since then, I would always order tonkatsu when I don't feel like being adventurous.  I have had tonkatsu from Japanese restaurants all over the world but I have to say that the Katsu set at Katsu-Hama was the best I've ever had. The pork was really yummy and tender, the shrimp was nice and the crab croquette was creamy and delicious it was to die for.  I ordered an apple shochu and also tried the peach one...both were very nice...party in my mouth!   I'm sure to go back to this place next time I am in NYC.  Simply the best!
