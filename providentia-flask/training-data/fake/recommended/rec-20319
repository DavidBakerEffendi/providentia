I read all the rave reviews about this place and went there for brunch on Sunday. I dined at the bar and ordered a bloody mary which was very disappointing. The bartender was extremely rude and gave poor service. The pancakes were great but the biscuits were dry and had no taste. Overall, it was okay. For such a pricey menu, I expected more.
