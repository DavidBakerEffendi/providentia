I love this place.  It's a riot.  If you want a cheap but massively huge buffet with everything from fried chicken to dumplings to every color jello imaginable, this is the place for you.  I went with a group of friends...one ended up feeling sick and lying on a bench outside, but the rest of us gorged ourselves.  You might feel sick for days afterwards, but it's worth it.
