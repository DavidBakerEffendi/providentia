My friend and I came here on a whim after extreme hunger and dehydration at Summer Stage. Zooey Deschanel stole all the dewey glow in the atmosphere, what can we do? We came in 20 minutes before the kitchen closed, and despite being made aware of this several times, the waiters were not TOO pushy about it and let us still look at the menu. We ordered the steak sandwich and the steak eggrolls. Both were delicious. Service was friendly enough. The vibe is great for midtown manhattan. And the price is not too bad at all either. Definitely recommend for something in between a dive bar and a fancy place.
