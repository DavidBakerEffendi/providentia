I went for a Saturday morning brunch and wish I hadn't.  This was the second time I had visited this restaurant and was as unimpressed as I had been the first time.  The food is decent; however, it was so overly crowded and our waitress was not friendly, almost seemed annoyed to be serving us.  Maybe it is better for dinner, but it is sooo overpriced and underwhelming as far as brunch goes.
