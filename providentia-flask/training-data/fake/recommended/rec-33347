This place is amazing. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic, and the service is beyond personable. The owner came and chatted us up for a bit, sent over some dessert, and made us feel like we were in his own home. Not to mention that the food is DELICIOUS. The menu is heavy on the pasta and doesn't have much seafood or meat, as you would expect in an italian restaurant. However, the few items on the menu are made to perfection that it doesn't even matter. Every bite was heaven. I cannot WAIT to go back. This place is special.
