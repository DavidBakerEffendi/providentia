Chicken parm. , gnocchi and the rice balls are what I get all the time because they are just a step up from the other Italian restaurants I've dined in. The bread is so hot and fresh with the oil!!!!  The prices are very reasonable and it's a byob!!!! The only thing I might complain about is that they are usually busy and the lean staff is running around so service can be spotty at times.  The place is not big so it can get loud because you are packed in.  However we keep going back because the quality of food makes up for it in my opinion.
