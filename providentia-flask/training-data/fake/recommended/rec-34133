Very nice! Interesting menu, great location, some cool New Haven trivia to go along with the name and location, good beer selection, friendly and attentive staff. The "fire alarm" chili was outstanding! The "Naughty Nurse" beer was great! The upstairs bar was not open yet (grand opening was going to occur the week after our visit), but Tom Carbone (manager/owner) gave us a tour. Will definitely be back!!!
