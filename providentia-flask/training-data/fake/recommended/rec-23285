I am so happy that Philadelphia has started to get into the Ramen trend, and Terakawa Ramen is the best of the Ramen places in Philly.   I always end up getting the same thing because it is that good.   Their house specialty, aptly named the terakawa ramen, is absolutely delicious.  The broth is wonderfully flavored and slightly thicker than a normal broth.  The pork is tender, but last time I went I opted to swap out the pork for the chicken breast, which was also very good.  The mushrooms, bamboo, and ginger are all flavorful.  The half boiled egg is the icing on the cake...the yolk still soft and a little runny adds a fantastic creamy element.  And if you like spicy - which I do - ask the waitress for some of the spicy chili oil on the side for you to mix into the ramen.   Additionally, the price is completely reasonable.  A bowl of the terakawa ramen with all the toppings already included is only 9 dollars!  The lunch special is also a great deal.  For only 2 dollars more, you can get an appetizer of gyoza, chicken curry, or charshu.   The gyoza are my personal favorite of the three.  Finally, the staff and ambiance is always friendly and welcoming.     I cannot wait for my next visit to Terakawa Ramen...especially since writing this review has made me hungry!
