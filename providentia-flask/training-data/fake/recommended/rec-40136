My friend Kimberly took me here for brunch when I was visiting Philly for the first time. The place is amazing. It has a really creative and unique atmosphere with interesting artwork and devices everywhere. It's a perfect place if you're looking for somewhere a bit different. The only problem we had was that it took about an hour to get our food after ordering. The service on drinks was quick and they made sure to keep the fresh tea coming while we waited. I had the French Toast, which was some of the best I've ever had and almost made up for the wait. I will definitely check this place out again next time I'm in town.
