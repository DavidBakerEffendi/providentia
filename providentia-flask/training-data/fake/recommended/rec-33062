This place has really good food.I love all the different curry dishes.Lunch is the best time to go.The prices are lower and includes soup or salad.I like the salad it has a really good peanut vinagrette.Siam in Lambertville is by far my favorite thai restaurant so thats the only reason i can`t give it 5 stars but i do really like the food at Ploy siam.
