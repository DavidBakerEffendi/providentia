I can only repeat what has already been said: I expected more from the Guild/Farmhouse group and will chalk this up to growing pains. I am totally surprised they don't have this thing "down" by now, and that there are growing pains at all. Server had no knowledge of the menu. Food was over priced for what you got, and bland. Pizza crust and sauce both unremarkable. Add-ons and special requests were apparently too much for the kitchen to handle. I sent my food back twice before throwing in the towel. Pleasant environment / tables, etc.
