Two words: VEGAN SAUSAGE! This is great pizza for anyone. And especially so if you're vegetarian or vegan! You know how pizza places often assume that vegetarians want gross oily roasted vegetables on everything? With no creative thinking whatsoever? Not here! They have lots of amazing options, including...vegan sausage. It's delicious - flavorfull, no weird soy aftertaste, not too dry. Even the meat eaters at our table loved it! We arrived the minute it was open. The restaurant filled up immediately, so anyone arriving 10-20 minutes after it opened would have to wait for someone from the first seating to leave. Very friendly service, fantastic lighting and atmosphere, and of course, delicious pizza. Go!
