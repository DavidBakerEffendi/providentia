That's my favorite place! They do it all 'with a soul', as we say in Russian. Seems like nothing special but those tiny details will show you that the owner knows and loves his job. I usually take freshly squeezed orange/grapefruit juice, panini with prosciutto ($12, expensive pleasure) and cappucino. What else does one need? And they have a bench outside on Madison. And a spacious restroom. If you guys arrange a changing table for babies, it will be the best place in NYC. And some salads or smth.
