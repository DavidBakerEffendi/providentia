Took a group of friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. Some of them rave about this restaurant to this day. The set menu for parties of more than four or five is an easy order of huge portions. Enough to go around. We have tried to recreate some of their dishes. Highly recommended! I think they shot a scene here for the movie The Switch.
