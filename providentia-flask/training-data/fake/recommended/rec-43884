What a wonderful neighborhood restaurant!  Paulie Gee is so old school and Brooklyn it warms my heart.  While my fiancé and I waited for our table, he was jovially chatting away with a mix of regulars and first timers hanging at the bar. Paulie eventually worked his way around the whole restaurant to check that every table was satisfied with the food and service. I was further impressed  when he stopped by our table later that night. This is the first time I've seen that kind of customer engagement in any New York restaurant. EVERY restaurant should do this. Now, onto the food!  My fiancé and I ordered the specktacle and the hellified porkpie white. Both were delicious as expected but if I could make the hellified pork pie even better, I would have asked for the honey on the side. Don't get me wrong, the hot honey pairs wonderfully with the pie. Either ours had a little too much or I just have a sensitivity to sweetness. After scarfing down the two pies, my fiancé and I started to  plan our third (we were so hungry after not having eaten all day). Until suddenly sour table was graced by Paulie.   After some friendly chatter, he noticed all the burnt crust on my plate, and insisted that we get another pie on the house. I, not feeling comfortable with being treated to something free, said "no it's okay. The good part of the pizza wasn't burnt. We are going to order another anyway. " all the while my fiancé who is out of paulies line of sight is rigorously shaking his head for the free pizza. The last pie was by far the most delicious (and not because it was free. Ha!). Paulie recommended the Hellboy which fixed the whole sweetness issue we found with the hellified porkpie.  It was finger licking good down to the crust which we dipped into the fragrant hot honey! This was just an all around feel good experience. I love the decor, the ambiance, the staff, the music, and most importantly the food. Will come by again when I am in the neighborhood.
