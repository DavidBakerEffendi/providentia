While I find that this place usually has a good brunch and I would usually give it 4 stars, I stopped in today for lunch and was unpleasantly surprised.   Although there were less than five tables seated (not including us) it took over ten minutes for us to place our order (which was a little irritating because the waitress basically ignored us and was leisurely cleaning tables while the bartender stared off into space).  I ordered the "yum yum" sandwich (and shuddered while saying the nam), which came out relatively quickly, which was nice. However, the yum yum did not live up to its name. The bread was hard and burned, the chicken was tough and dry, and the pesto tasted old if not off. I am willing to understand that we came in an off hour, which could explain the slow service, which is why I am averaging this review against my other experiences- but the food quality was sub-par and disappointing.
