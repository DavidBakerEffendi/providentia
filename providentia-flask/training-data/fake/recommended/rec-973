Carmines consistently has great food. Only downside is their reservation policy. They take reservations for large groups, who regularly sit at table for hours, even after dessert, still talking and dilly dallying.  Tonight I saw a party of 8 on dessert when I arrived and after my meal an hour later they were still sitting BSing with each other. While a table of 4 would be in and out in an hour.  Usually it's the opposite., large parties need to wait while smaller parties can be seated, served, and turned over quickly. Otherwise food is great if you can get in.
