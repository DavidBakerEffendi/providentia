After reading the great reviews I was looking forward to trying this place. I ordered a farmer's bowl and some sushi rolls for pickup. My biggest disappointment was the temperature. The fish was so cold it hurt my teeth (even after a 10 minute car ride) and the rice was extremely dry. The rolls felt like Whole Foods rolls that have been sitting on a refrigerator shelf for too long. The rice on the bowl was so dry and hard it did not mix with any of the other ingredients. And the spicy rolls were not spicy. The simplicity of the menu was a surprise. At first I thought "less is more" but after trying the food I realized this was not the case. I give it three stars because the fish seemed to be quite good but I'll stick to my cheap Japanese where I know what to order to be satisfied for a lot less.
