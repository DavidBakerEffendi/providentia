What a great idea that is executed horribly. I love the idea of an eco-friendly restaurant that serves great food. Too bad they didn't stick with the tested solutions to ordering and serving food. The place is horribly organized. There are no real signs and simple roped lines would work wonders, once you order you hand deliver a ticket to the cooks, who seemed to lose one in three orders. Whatever happened to waitresses? Or even an organized system for getting the cooks the orders and checking if the correct people pick up the order? The food was good, but not worth the pain in the ass.
