i am SO so happy to say that i have finally found a legitimate mexican place in New Jersey. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. I couldn't have asked for a better divey place to get my mexican fix. I ordered a tamale, chips & guac, a torta, and tres leches cake to go because I have no self control! The tamale was delicious and they give you a bunch of sauces to put on top. It was nice and moist, not crumbly either. The chips are home made!! and soo crunchy. Their guacamole is amazingly creamy and they will adjust the spiciness for you. I got my torta with al pastor (so happy they had it) and it was a nice mix of the rich avocado and cheese with sweet and spicy port on top. The bread tasted really fresh, sometimes tortas seem like theyre made on bricks! One of the workers recommended the tres leches cake and I finally ate it today. It is literally one of the best desserts i've ever eaten! Sweet and creamy with a nice spongy texture and the icing isn't too sweet. The place doesn't have a lot of frills inside but it doesn't matter because their food is the most authentic mexican I've found in NJ.
