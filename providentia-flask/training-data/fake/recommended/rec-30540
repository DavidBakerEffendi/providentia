Guess what?  Another glowing review of Sunny and Annies, the absolute GREATEST sandwich place in the Alphabet.  Best part? It's not just a deli, it is also a mini grocery store.  Sure, the assortment of treats and staples are oddly assembled and the aisles can barely allow a man of my stature, but the curiously disguised deli counter makes it all worth while.   My favorite hero?  The Pho Real.  Yes, everyone else says the same thing.  Does that make me a follower or does it verify it's deliciousness? Roast Beef.  Bean Sprouts.  CILANTRO (yes!).  Avocado.  Tomato. Lettuce.  HOISIN/SIRACHA sauce.  Add a dose of friendly faced CASH ONLY service, throw in a B&J HalfBaked froyo, and merrily saunter home.  Repeat once a few times a month. Anyone who has followed my direction to 6th and Ave B for a deconstructed bowl of Pho reconstructed in a sandwich has thanked me.  After you try one for yourself, you will too ;)
