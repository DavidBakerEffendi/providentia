Went the first day they opened to the public. It was good...nothing amazing, but really good.  it's a great addition to vanderbilt and i think it will do well. They don't give you much ramen especially considering it's $12, but it's all pretty tasty and i was okay with the portion size. I got the chicken with soy broth.  it was tasty.  could have used a little more salt. My friend got the pork with pork broth.  the pork was almost like thick not-salty bacon.  I had a bite that was okay.  My friend really liked it.  I think it could have used a little more flavor. The peppers appetizer was really good. a little too salty but I think it's supposed to be like that. The chicken salad appetizer was great.  I really recommend that one.  The chicken was so soft. The place seemed a little overstaffed but it still took a while to order and a while to get food and a long time to pay.  They just weren't paying that much attention to customers.  But it was their first day.  I'm sure it will be a lot smoother soon.  They were extremely nice when they did pay attention to us.  They also comp'd us the chicken salad because our ramen was taking a little long. I will go again and I recommend it especially if you're a big ramen fan.
