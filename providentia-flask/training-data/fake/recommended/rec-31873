Best vegetarian banh mi in the city hands down. Unreal soy marinated mushrooms with tofu, the classic pickled veggies, cilantro and a light peanut sauce all on a perfectly toasted baguette. Certainly not the fastest prepared, but if taste is the name and vegetarian is the game then this is your spot. Really nice owners to boot.
