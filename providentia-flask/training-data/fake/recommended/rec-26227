this spot is SO undeserving of the number of reviews and stars that it's gotten. maybe there's something wrong with my taste buds but i prefer many other late night drunk spots over 53rd + 6th. i mean the the white / red sauce is crack, don't get me wrong... but 4,000 reviews... really? i wouldn't call this place a must-see tourist spot so much as a drunken destination that obliterated people in their 20s go to for some quick/cheap munchies after a night out. if you're here visiting NYC, i recommend venturing out of manhattan for pizza in brooklyn or asian food in flushing (queens).
