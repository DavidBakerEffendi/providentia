I love Table 87's food, decor and service.  Dine in or take out, the food is always on point.  I don't know why I haven't been coming to this place longer - it is of the best pizza I've ever had in any borough. What's makes 87 unique, is their classy menu and garlic oil accouterments. This stuff is out of control.  It makes me wish there was more crust to spread the garlic on.  Everything we had was great.  The salad was crisp and not over dressed.  The calamari was tender and not over breaded.  The pizza... I mean - wow.  Piping hot, cripsy, cheesy, fresh ingredients.  It was a symphony.  87 is great for dine in or take out.  What's neat, too, is that we got a parking spot across the street. The service was attentive and warm.  I will definitely be back.
