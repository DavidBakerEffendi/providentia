My boss took me to this joint a year ago as it is located near our office. I was really curious about the food, as my boss would rave on how fresh the food is. Hence I decided to try the Spa Salmon Fillet Salad and sure enough, you can't get any fresher than this. The fish and vegetables looked and tasted fresh and good. Unfortunately, I wasn't starving that day as I really wanted to try more of their dishes. The space is pretty small but wasn't full for lunch on a weekday, around noon. I'm okay with small intimate spaces as long as I don't have to wait for a seat. Also, both owners run the restaurant themselves as one works at the back of the house as the chef and one works at the front as the host/ server. After eating here, I really felt the passion of the owners having their own restaurant to serve good reasonably priced food to its patrons. Unfortunately, I don't stop in the area as much as I don't work in that location anymore. I guess the only thing I wish they did was open an hour earlier for lunch (they open at 12pm) as we where there at 11:30am and had to wait a bit for them to open and set up. But it was definitely worth the wait and I can't wait to go back!
