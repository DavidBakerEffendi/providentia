Absolutely delicious! We had the chicken satay and roti canai as appetizers and both tasted delicious! If the roti canai was crispier (like most Malaysians love it 'garing'), it would be even more perfect. The beef rendang tasted heavenly and the sauce, I had every single drop of it. Prawn noodle was delicious, good broth. Service is friendly and fast, love the decor of the restaurant, trendy and clean. The only down side is they do charge you for the rice ... even though most restaurants would only charge if you ask for additional rice.
