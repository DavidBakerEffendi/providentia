My feelings for Walter are what you can describe as tepid. It's not good but it's not bad either. The menu hasn't changed since it first opened. You can almost always rely on their sandwiches--the french dip, the lobster roll, and the hamburger. We love the Fried Chicken, too. However, every time we order our staples, something in the preparation and presentation changes, too. For example, the Fried Chicken we had yesterday night looked half the size of what we used to get. What used to be an inviting plate of comfort food is now lackluster and uninviting. They skimped on the mashed potatoes and also forgot the advertised white gravy. The Tuna Nicoise Salad, although good, barely had any salad on it. As my bf said, it hurts when you know you are paying the same price for half the food. Anyways, stick with the staples and try to forget how generous they used to be and you'll have a good time at Walter.
