Used to love this place but lately the food and the service has been subpar. We ordered food for takeout. Half an hour later we arrived (when they told us to come pick up) but the food had yet to be cooked. 20mins later we took home our food only to find dirty, unshelled shrimp and unseasoned soup. I probably won't be going back.
