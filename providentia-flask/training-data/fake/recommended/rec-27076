I always get the Southwest Mac, and it's always delicious. But be prepared for a long wait time. I know they have cook it and make it right, but the interior if the store makes you think this is a quick order and go type of restaurant. They should redo the whole interior, get rid of the aluminum chair, and make it feel like a sit down restaurant with a wait staff. That way people expect a 15 - 20 min wait on the meal.
