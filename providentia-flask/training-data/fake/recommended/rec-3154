One of the best places for Thai food. It was actually my first introduction to Thai food and every other place I've been for Thai since has not compared. The atmosphere is relaxing and quaint with a nice outside area for a nice day. Inside there is a spot for a DJ that will sometimes play. It's not loud and obnoxious either. Everytime I go I have to start off with the Fried Spring Rolls - love the chicken, but the vegetable ones are delicious as well. The Pad See Yue is my favorite dish. Chicken, flat noodles, broccoli and egg sauteed in a brown sauce. It's to die for. I did try the Pad Thai and it was really delicious as well. The drinks are so good and the service is great. The best part of it all is the price! It's extremely affordable! Perfect place to bring a date for either lunch or dinner. Or to just grab a drink. Definitely check this place out!
