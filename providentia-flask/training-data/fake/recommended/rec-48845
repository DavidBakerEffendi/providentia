Love the food, the presentation is lovely, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  I do look forward to going back there again soon. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the place is so tiny and has so few tables that I felt that I had to leave as soon as I was done eating so people could have our table.  Other than that, the place is fantastic!
