As I go in and out of the 'Big Apple' more times than a 'Camouflaged as a Caucasian' al Qaeda operative looking for a soft target - on one of my many voyages to put Political figures through my version of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' I find that after the draining 'water-boarding' process I use on them, I often need to find sustenance quickly and without hassles - as it can all be a soaking experience. When a Colleague first told me of 'Extra Virgin' - a Mediterranean eatery located in the West Village - my mind flew immediately to memories of the Greek Islands I love so much - So I put on my best 'Shirley Valentine' outfit and made a booking. I imagined I'd either find rows of exotic first extract cold pressed Greek bottles scattered everywhere, or at the very least, a sign saying, 'Madonna ate here!' But no! Instead, after waiting my turn for brunch (It's popular) I found a very reasonably priced joint (under a MORE than edible decor) that had such a delightful and pleasant variety of Mediterranean gourmet delights, served I might add, by lovely happy young things (nearly as nice as myself - which could mean, they were actually 'real' virgins) But, seriously, the food, particularly the Maine Crab Cakes and Grilled Atlantic Salmon tossed down with a dreamy Greek styled Salad, was so delicious, I seriously considered sending the Chef a naked photo of myself with an invitation to serve me breakfast in bed the next morning at my Hotel in the Village nearby. Needless to say, I resisted the temptation and decided it best to leave the heat in the kitchen, just in case I wanted to return with an unsullied reputation. Which, I might add, I have done time and again - not my reputation, silly! So fellow Brunch-seekers who want the best and can wait a little while when it's busy, it's certainly worth the trip and the wait. As for the Chef, I never got to meet him. Who, for heaven sake, really wants to spoil a good taste bud thing over a wandering hormone or two.
