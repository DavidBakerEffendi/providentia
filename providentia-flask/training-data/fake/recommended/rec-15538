A really romantic and also authentic Cuban restaurant. My wife and I just got into town for her birthday and wanted to grab a bit to eat late in the evening. This place was certainly the right place. They are known in the area for their sangria, which we tried and can confirm is great! We ended up getting a couple of tapas. See pictures of the dishes but they were fantastic! Would highly recommend this place.
