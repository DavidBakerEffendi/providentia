Love this place! Stopped in for the first time over the weekend and this place is the spot. Their Jerk Chicken Wings are on point, and they have a wide variety of beers to choose from. The service was good, the bartenders are super friendly and quick to engage you in conversation. And last but not least, the prices are very affordable. Make it a point to stop here.
