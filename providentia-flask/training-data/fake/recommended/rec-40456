I thought the staff and food was really good! The window tour of the meat consumption/preperation was informative and astonishing. I wasn't blown away by the wings (wish they were barbecued), but I should've known better... I should have gotten more of the pulled pork--YUM! The burnt end beans and French fries were great! The fries could've been amazing if they had mayonnaise!!!
