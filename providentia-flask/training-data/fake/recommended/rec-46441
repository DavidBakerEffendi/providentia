Hands down. Everything was perfect. We had to wait 30 min to be seated, but the sommelier apologized us very politely with a glass of wine and we had a great time while waiting. If you want to impress your date, this place is the best for the value. I had one of the best dining experiences here. I want to go back and try their tasting menu as well.
