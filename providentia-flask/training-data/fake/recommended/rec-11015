I have been going to this restaurant for the last 15 or so years.. The food was so so and the waiter was bad. We were seated upstairs and had to ask for utensils, bowls, etc. Ordered many dishes, stuffed grape leaf were burnt, pork wonton did not have hardly any pork, the sea food soup was not the best. Usually bring extra food home, but this visit, did not bother to bring any back home. Not sure if I will go back Will try the restaurant across the street.
