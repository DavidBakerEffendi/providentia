This place looks the part, but once the food started coming out, things went downhill quickly.   My wife and I came here with the Groupon for an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert.  We got the warm root vegetable appetizer, which wasn't terrible, however there were sauces all over the plate and none of them were particularly good or even tasted good together. My entree was the fish and chips.  The fish came in three ~6 inch long pieces, two of which were less than half an inch thick.  It basically tasted like I was just eating the cornmeal breading, which had a very unpleasant gritty texture.  Again, there were at least 4 different sauces on the plate which didn't go well together and definitely didn't enhance the taste of the breading.  The fries were good, but there were only 6 of them (they were thick cut steak fries). My wife had the pasta entree, which was pretty good, nothing to complain about. For dessert we got the brownie.  This is easily the worst dessert I've ever had in a restaurant.  There was some kind of chocolate sauce that tasted like soap, the brownie was a weird texture and the ice cream had some unidentified substance crumbled over it.  After the first bite we set out trying to identify what aspect of it tasted the worst.  It was a difficult task. Two stars because my wife's entree was decent and the service/ambience was good, but I will never be returning.
