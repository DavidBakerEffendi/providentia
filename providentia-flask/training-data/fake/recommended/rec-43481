We ate here recently with friends and each of us left the place completely satisfied. The quality of the food was very good and the service was friendly and helpful. What we ate: Beef ragu-filled rice fritters (crunchy outer layer with creamy rice and a flavorful meat center), raddichio salad (dressed lightly and everything fresh), bruschetta, Salmon, pork cheeks (braised - oh, my, I love those cheeks!), bucatini with guanciale, and flat iron steak. All of the dishes were prepared properly, were tasty, and were sized so that our stomachs were full but not stuffed. We finished the dinner with rice pudding - a lovely end to this delicious meal. it's BYOB, which adds to the appeal.
