A solid four stars for this much-discussed burger spot downtown. Yes, you will be waiting for a table, but once you're seated the food gets to you really quick. Though you do have to pay for a side of fries (why is that a thing now) Beers are reasonably priced and the burgers are delicious and melt-in-your-mouth good. Pro tip: Ask for an upstairs table, it's way less crazy there.
