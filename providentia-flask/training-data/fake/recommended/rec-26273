This place has fantastic pizza and the BEST garlic bread. Get the cheese plate (which comes with a massive helping of garlic bread) and any of the pizzas. The arugula pie is great as is the artichoke and smoked pancetta. The place is dark and cute and wood and lovely. A worthy spot if you're in the area.
