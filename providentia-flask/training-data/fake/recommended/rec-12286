This place was definitely worth the two hour wait. It's a tiny little place, so that explains the scary wait time. WAIT IT OUT. I'm telling you these were the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. If I could live on one food forever it may possibly be these pancakes. They're incredibly light and fluffy. And the syrup. Oh my god the syrup is out of this world. I don't know what's in it but I could drink buckets of that stuff. Waiting outside in below freezing for two hours was very difficult, but an hour into the wait someone came out with a plate of pancakes to sample. That one little tiny pancake dipped in that crack syrup convinced me to wait it out.
