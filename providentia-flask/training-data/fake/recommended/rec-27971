I take my wife here every year for Valentines day. The dining room is cozy and perfect for date night. The food and service are top notch. I usually order a pasta or veal dish. My wife usually orders BBQ. We always make sure to save room for desert and love when we see Ice Box Cake on the menu. The staff is attentive and friendly. We always leave with a doggy bag and enjoy our dinner again the next day. Skip the chain and try real food at reasonable prices. I guarantee you'll be back!
