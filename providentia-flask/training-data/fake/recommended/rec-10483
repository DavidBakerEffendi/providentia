Came here with my buddy Liam several years ago after attending the showing of Brotherhood at the Tribeca Film Festival.  We posted up at the end of the bar and camped out for a couple of hours and had an amazing time. I forgot about this place and stumbled across it the other night.  It is another perfect NYC bar, and one of the oldest dating back to 1817...just my style! Service was quick and we were well attended to the entire time we were there.  Very cozy feel.  Cool matchbooks with two blank music bars in case you feel like composing.  Also has a huge ship mooring hook outside...makes for a cool place to set your drink!
