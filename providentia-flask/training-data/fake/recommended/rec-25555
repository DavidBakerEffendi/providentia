Paisano's is very good but over priced. I have been in the food service business for over 30 years and I have read the reviews. While some are valid, there are some that are posted by people who obviously know nothing about how difficult it is to run a restaurant. I am positive that given the opportunity they could NEVER handle being a server. There are rude customers and those that think they are the only ones in the restaurant. They have no concept of what goes on behind the scenes. I agree Paisano's should not close at 10 on a Saturday night and it was extremely rude for them to tell you they were closed. On the other hand, you as the customer should realize that these servers have worked 12 hour shifts and want to go home. If you want to sit and chat, invite your friends back to your house and you can sit until the wee hours of the morning. I'm sure if the shoe was on the other foot you would not like it. The other suggestions is to go to a restaurant that opens late.
