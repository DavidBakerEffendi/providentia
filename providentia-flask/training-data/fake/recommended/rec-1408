I've always wanted to try this place because most of my friends told me great things about it and whenever I passed by, the place was always busy and bustling during peak meal hours! Finally got the opportunity to try it just recently with a friend of mine after work. The whole atmosphere of the restaurant/bar is lively and warm, so it made things feel very comfortable the second we entered. Our host was very friendly and helpful in his recommendations, although he seemed distracted sometimes. I don't take it to heart though, it was getting a bit busy when we arrived. My friend and I shared the El Vez original guacamole dip, and it was absolutely delicious. The chips were a bit on the oily side for my taste, but still good and crispy. The guacamole dip came in a much larger portion than I expected, which is wonderful because it was so pricey! Fresh, chunky, and full of great flavor, that guacamole really hit the spot and really got me excited for the main. We ordered the Black Bean Enchiladas and the Crispy Mahi Mahi because they were the cheaper options on the menu. Although the portions weren't big, they were such full of flavor! Enchiladas are often overdone by restaurants with the cheese and overly rich ingredients, but these had the right amount and it was very enjoyable! The Mahi Mahi was cooked to almost perfection and the Chipotle Remoulade worked so well with it inside the tortilla that was also nice and soft. Overall, a great eating experience. It is a bit on the pricey side for me (poor college student problems...), but I would definitely like to come back again to try more options from the menu! :)
