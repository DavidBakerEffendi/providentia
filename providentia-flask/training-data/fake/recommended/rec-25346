I hate giving mediocre reviews to places that have so many positive reviews. It makes me feel like I'm either completely missing out on some component or am just ultra critical. But I think on this occasion, I just chose a bad night to come. For super late dinner, I left my hotel on a summer rainy night Â at 11pm to come here to pick some food up. It was probably because of the gross weather, but there were definitely a lot less people waiting than the normal lines I hear/see pictures of, and probably resulted in their over-preparing food... resulting in lots of cooked meat waiting on the grills. It was basically a large amount of rice, meat, and lettuce for $6. I got chicken, but after trying my friend's lamb, I would've totally gotten that--or half/half, which is an option. The white sauce definitely made up for the dryness of the chicken meat (which may have been a fluke that night? I don't know). It kind of reminded me of a Chipotle burrito bowl after a while. Not the best meal I had in NYC, but definitely the best deal. I'd recommend here if you're watching your budget and/or want to see what all the hype is. Maybe you'd have better luck than I did!
