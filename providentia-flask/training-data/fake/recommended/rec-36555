A must have when visiting New York.  I was told that wood fire ovens are banned in New york, with the exception of this place and some other place that I can't recall. Traditional NY thin crust style pizza cooked in a million degree wood fired oven, there's no substitute. If you do go, the default order is a pizza margherita (basil, mozzarella and tomato sauce).  The crust is thin and crisp with a hint of smokiness from the oven.  We also had the pepperoni, which was also solid.
