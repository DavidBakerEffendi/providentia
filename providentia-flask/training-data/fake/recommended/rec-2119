So came here on a double date with an 8 o'clock reservation. Got there at 8:30 because apparently there is street parking by paying the muni-meter but there were no muni-meters in sight! It was the oddest thing and no it was not my first time parking in the city! Anyways we get to the restaurant and I talk to the host and apologize for being late but he says no problem I will get you a table in 15-20 so we waited by the bar. A lil more than an hour rolls by and finally we are seated! My friend I weren't too happy because I could of easily gone somewhere else where the ladies didn't have to wait. Anyways, we sit down and immediately start perusing the menu and quickly come up with some dishes since we were all famished and only had a couple black and coke's to drown out the rumble in our stomachs. We had ordered 2 orders of the Spicy Basil Noodles (one w/ chicken, one w/out), an order of Pineapple rice w/out raisins and to start an order of chicken satay as well as the curry puffs. All the food was excellent, well prepared and delicious but nothing unique or to rave home about. The chicken satay however was not worth ordering, kind of dry, no sauce on it and barely any to dip it in. Aside from the barely mediocre chicken satay the service was pretty non existent, no one checked to see if how we were after we initially got our food or if we wanted a new drink or anything. Also, although the decor and ambiance is lovely, I wouldn't come here on a regular date because the seating is very close to each other and the place can get a tad bit loud for conversation.
