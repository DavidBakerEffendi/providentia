Been here a couple times for their dinner menu and red/white/blue deal.  They have recently raised their price a little.  The red/white/blue deal with the half dozen of oysters weren't on the par, clams were quite good though.  Appetizers and other dishes were good too but nothing outstanding and memorable. Seafood quality is so so, atmosphere a-ok.  Convenient location in west village is a plus.  The HH deal is pretty sweet so this is a 3 star.
