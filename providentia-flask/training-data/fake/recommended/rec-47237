This is a lovely place to spend a warm evening at, especially if you get a table in their back garden. It's intimate, quiet, almost serene. The food is superb, particularly the slow rendered duck breast, which had the texture of filet mignon, as well as the beet salad with goat cheese. Here's how to make The Grocery work for you: 1. It's not a "neighborhood" restaurant you go to twice/week. The portions are small and they add up (dinner for two is about $150 with tip). 2. Come on a week night, especially if the weather is nice, before 8 PM. It's almost impossible to get a table on weekends. 3. Four to five dishes are sufficient for a party of two. Leave room for dessert!
