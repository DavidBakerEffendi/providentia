Upon stepping into Room Service, I could feel my blood boiling.  It looked a bit too chic and swanky, and I was beginning to feel like I was about to pay far too much for standard thai food.  And few things piss me off more than paying too much for thai food. Much to my relief, and eventual serenity, the food was affordable and delicious.  For $9 you can get all sorts of fantastic dishes, and everything I tried was flavorful and spiced well. I've been back and was impressed with the Squid Ink Noodles, and chowed down on my tamarind chicken. Check it out, have a few cocktails there, and head down to Rudy's for some post dinner beers.
