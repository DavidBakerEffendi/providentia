I love, love, LOVE this place!  The ambiance is so very mellow and intimate.  Best for one-on-one time with your best friend or your signif other.  Very attentive service if they are not busy.  There can be a wait since the place is pretty small. The food is excellent.  Small portions but each bite is extremely tasty.  I love how the flavors are perfectly balanced.  They had an entire meal for $17 to $20.  If you go before 7 pm, you can try their afternoon special or afternoon tea special.  The first is a rice bowl with some sort of protein (salmon, chicken, unagi).  Rice is sooooo good.  Comes with Genmaicha.  The latter seems to be English-influenced with two types of sandwiches, baked goods, sample of desserts, and choice of tea. Happy hour from...4 or 5 to 7 pm.  Buy a drink and get free appetizers. Believe me, you're going to want to go for lunch...and dinner....and afternoon tea....and late-night dessert....
