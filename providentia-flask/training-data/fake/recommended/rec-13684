I have never in my life posted a review about anything, but this place was so awful that I just had to do it.  This place has been recommended to me by many people and after reading the reviews on yelp, my boyfriend and I finally decided to go.  After waiting for 1 hour and 15 min, we were expecting the most amazing brunch ever.  Not so fast.  The pancakes were ok, but deff nothing to rave about.  Kind of tasteless.  I ordered a biscuit egg sandwich, which came with some strange spaghetti sauce that I didn't even touch.  The eggs themselves came with  hard cheese on top that looked like it was melted on last night.  I would only go to this place if I was super hungover and there was nothing else in the area.  So many wonderful brunch places in the city, I don't understand why people waste their time waiting for this diner quality food.
