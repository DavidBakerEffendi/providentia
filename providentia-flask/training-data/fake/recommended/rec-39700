I just walked out of Gaia... all i can say is AMAZING! The panini bread is crisp and delicious. I had the Bubi which is mozzarella, basil and tomato... it was mouthwatering, I'm already planning my next trip there to work my way down the menu!!! PS- I had an Iced Latte that was to die for! perception in a cup.
