They fit our party of 8 into a reservation about an hour before, so we were happy. Good service, nice atmosphere and attentive bartender while we waiting. Most of the group ordered streak, a few different cuts, everyone seemed happy. I had the roasted beet salad with some kind of incredible goat cheese, sounds typical but it was delightful, followed by the meatloaf sandwich, which was so good that my fiance (on one side of me) and my best friend (on the other side of me) took turns stealing huge bites. It was succulent, rich, sweet, well seasoned, and on wonderful bread. I will DEFINITELY go back just for this sandwich. Only problem was at the end of the night, our waitress told some of our table the tip was included (20% grat) and others were not aware, so some over-tipped.
