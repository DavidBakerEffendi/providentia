So, the storefront is nothing to write home about & I'm not even sure if this place has a printed menu- but neither of those things matter.  For the most part, I don't even LIKE thick crust, Sicilian style pizza.  That doesn't matter either.  This pizza is astounding and CHEAP!!!  Also, I can't get over that they actually deliver fountain soda.  How cool is that?  Oh, and did I mention that the Pizza is probably better than most in Philly?  So so so worth a try!
