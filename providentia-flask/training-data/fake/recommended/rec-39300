Two friends and I went to The Grasshopper for Sunday lunch today and enjoyed our meal.  Each lady each had a different sandwich from the extensive menu and they were tasty and well-served.   The waitress was attentive and pleasant and stopped to chat with us.  The comfortable atmosphere is tavern/pub-style, neat and pleasant. The menu has a wide choice and the prices are very good.  We will definitely be returning.
