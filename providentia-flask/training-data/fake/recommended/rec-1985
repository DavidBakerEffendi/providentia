IF you want good food that has fresh ingredients that have natural colors and flavors come here.  This is the best truck on Temple Campus and believe me  4 years and 30lbs later I have tried every truck on campus.  This truck never lets me down  even though I may be forced to eat the crepe as fast as possible before the thin crepe begins to soak up juice and fall apart.    The chicken is always grilled and fresh and the truck owners will cater to your needs.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Bottom Line-  cheap but satisfying,  may not be the quickest lunch on a truck but deff worth it and can get a little sloppy so be prepared to have a few extra napkins.
