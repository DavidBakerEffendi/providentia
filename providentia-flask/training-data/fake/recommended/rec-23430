We came here last night and we had a very pleasant night. Daniel served us and he was nice and very attentive. We had the spinach dip , buffalo wings and kobe beef sliders it was all good. We were not disappointed. My favorite part was the pita chips with the spinach dip. My husband had a beer delirum, he enjoyed it. I work close by so it was nice to see there are good places in LIC.
