I went recently and it took about 10-15 minutes to get my food. It was during lunch time on a week day so that's not bad. It got much more crowded after I ordered. I found a seat inside but it was very full. I enjoyed the burger and thought it was DEFINITELY better than Five Guys (which make me sick). I go to 500 as well, and this is just a different kind of burger. I did not like the fries at Shake Shack and I had a strawberry lemonade, which was ok. I would return but I would skip the fries.
