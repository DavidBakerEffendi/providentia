In the city of Philly Cheesesteaks and a beautiful bell casted in the 18th century, this little place is a treasure in the rough. Thoroughly impressed with this restaurant and second time eating Burmese food. We started the night with Thousand Layer Bread with Chicken curry for dipping as appetizer...wow it's exceptional! Amazing flavor! Then for the main meals we had the Southern Burmese Noodles, Tomato Curry Seafood, and the Lemongrass beef. All were light and not too heavy, but full of flavor. Don't expect too much spice as Burmese food is on the not too spicy scale. Then to finish the meal off we ordered Farluda, which is rose syrup, milk, ice cream, pudding, raisins, tapioca, and jello. Definitely a must! Overall, if you find yourself in Philly and want to try something unique, stop on by Rangoon... I'm sure Commander in Chief Washington would have stopped by too.
