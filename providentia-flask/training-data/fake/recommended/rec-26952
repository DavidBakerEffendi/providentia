Just like its East Village counterpart, Terrior Tribeca has an amazing wine selection and the service is exceptional. The staff beautifully treads that line of being attentive without blatantly trying to upsell you or disturb your meal. They have a great happy hour special of $6 for a variety of wines before 6pm. Atmosphere is wonderful - a welcome change from most of its neighboring after-work spots. Enjoy! The address information on Yelp is wrong. It's 52 Harrison Street, not 25.
