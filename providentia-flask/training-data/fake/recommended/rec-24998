Sunday - April 21 - What this restaurant needed was adult supervision. There was a very nice young man working the bar who was also managing the flow of persons into the dining room. He was clearly over-stretched and ill-equipped to handle the job. All around the bar were dirty glasses that were not cleared as he tried to serve the bar, answer the phone and seat people. Once seated, one waitress initiated contact with us. We made the mistake of giving our order to a second waitress. We now became orphans as no waitress seemed to take responsibility for our table. We were never offered coffee or dessert. We were given the check and credit card of a couple next to us. When we pointed out the error, the waitress took the check and credit card away from us and never returned with our check. After some effort, we received our check. It then took even greater effort to pay the check. In the meantime, the one busboy that was working couldn't keep pace in the dining room so tables were not being cleared and reset so the place looked slovenly. If there had been a dining room manager on duty maybe things might have flowed professionally. Instead it was like a bad sitcom. Blue is very pretentious. It presents itself as a restaurant in the best traditions of Manhattan. Tonight any decent diner in Staten Island had Blue beat. The owner should be embarrassed that he allowed his restaurant to run on autopilot tonight. Newsflash - while on autopilot your restaurant crashed big time.
