ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Went here last night on a recommendation from a friend. 3 of us sat outside and enjoyed well-made cocktails to start. Fresh baked bread with butter was a nice start. I ordered peppardelle with pork ragout and it was perfection. Freshly made pasta swimming in flavorful sauce. Perfect portion. One friend had cod and the other chicken, which were equally delicious. Will visit again in a heartbeat!
