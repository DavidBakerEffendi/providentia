This was my second visit to Clinton Street today, 13 July. About a month ago, got there at opening time on Sunday, and the line was already out the door with a half hour wait. Sorry, not that patient, not knowing the area, Katz's a few blocks away was where we ended up. Today, after a really delicioius brunch at a restaurant a few blocks away, we decided to go get some pastry for takeaway. Again, got there about an hour after waiting, huge lines out the door but takeaway was walk up. Had to pay cash - just more greed on the part of the Clinton Street owners, don't want to pay the fees to Visa. Nasty. From their limited selection of Â pastry, two kinds of scones and a few muffins, we chose a blueberry muffin, and a chocolate scone. The muffin was not memorable, though a bit tough. The scone was inedible - they obviously used baking soda because that's most of what you could taste. The scone was also good for a doorstop or street hockey, as it was really tough. I don't understand why anyone wastes time in line for the food here. It's not very good and the neighborhood's full of better places. I think its mostly clueless NYers sheep-yelping along with the crowd. I won't mention the other place we went to for breakfast as it's good, the pastry fresh and made in the shop, and the savory dishes interesting, tasty and filling. But, to keep it easy on you lot from NJ or wherever you're coming from, if you want to eat better than at Clinton St without the wait, there's a Dunkin Donuts west a few blocks on the other side of Houston. For a really excellent and high end food experience, for dessert, try Il Laboratorio across from Katzs for killer Bluebottle coffee and gelato
