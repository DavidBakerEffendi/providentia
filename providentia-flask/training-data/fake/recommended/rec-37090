Dinner here was delicious but overall I'm knocking it down 2 stars because of the mediocre drinks. Food: 5 stars Duck was amazing, the rice it came with could easily be a staple side dish on the menu alone it was so good. Duck was perfectly crispy, full of flavor, and rich. Blueberry compot wasn't overtly sweet and added a nice balance, sweet but savory dish overall. Drinks: 3 stars Drink selection isn't very balanced, all are very sweet and smooth. I guess that's appealing to some but you gotta have some sort of variety for those of us that actually like to taste the spirit we're drinking and not drink straight up simple syrup.
