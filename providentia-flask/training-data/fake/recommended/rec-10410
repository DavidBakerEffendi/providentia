This place is a waste of prime real estate. Being situated next the hudson, it probably hasn't been renovated since its inception which is god knows when. The place smells like it has an asbestos problem. The wood is rotting. The beer taps are not clean so beer tastes like crap. The food is meh at best, but the service is horrible with an attitude to boot. Do yourself a favor and find any number of bars nearby to go to before checking this shithole out
