Solid food. Amazing fries. Good beer selection. Gets very loud on the weekends (but I guess that's part of the appeal for some). I preferred the divey ambiance of the old Rudy's, but the new (now not so new as its been a few years since they moved) location is larger, more restaurant-like, and has a much more complete menu, so I guess I can't really complain. Some other reviews have criticized the fries. Do NOT believe these reviews. Rudy's has some of the best fries you can get. Period. The New Haven Burger is a good side order for these fries.
