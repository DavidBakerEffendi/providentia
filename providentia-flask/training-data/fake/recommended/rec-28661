Geez, I thought I found a new spot in Soho until I searched for them on yelp....they have multiple locations in NYC and a food truck prowling around?  Wow, not quite the discovery I thought I made....oh well. What I liked/loved.... The falafel in a whole wheat pita was boomin!!!! I love that you get to pick from three different types of falafels...that sets this place apart right off the bat I love that both hummus AND tahini sauce come with the falafel--most places screw you out of the tahini and put that tzeki sauce or whatever it is called. I love that my pita didn't get soggy even after a 20 minute cab ride...good "to go" food is my friend I like that fact that everything seemed relatively fresh and you could see the variety of toppings right in front of you. I like the fact that the falafel was very filling and it was less than $7...score! What I could have done without: I could have done without the cramped quarters.  I know that is asking a lot for NYC but this place was just cramped...I had no choice but to hover over other innocent diners and I hate that for them.   I could have done without the fact that they offered smoothies.  I just find that annoying because everyone in NY seems to be offering smoothies with everything now.  The crepe place I went to offered a smoothie selection, tons of yogurt and smoothie bars, pizza and smoothies, etc.  I just don't get it.  There wasn't but 4 or 5 options so why even bother.   Overall?  I wish this place was a grand discovery on my part but it wasn't.  However, it was very, very good and I will be back.  From all the vegetarians, this is a great place for any time of the day, they are opened pretty late and like I mentioned earlier...you can always get it to-go!
