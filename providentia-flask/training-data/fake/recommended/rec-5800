Okay, my boyfriend is putting the pressure on me. He called me and told me he had dreams of being in BBPs eating another burger and then described all the sauces to me and I have to admit, my mouth began to water. If you want something that is similar to it in MD, try The Burger Joint in Bethesda. Those Burgers are of the same quality, but dont offer as much sweet sauce choices.
