The place was excellent. We got there about 7:45 and it was perfect timing. The place can get pretty busy and seating is limited, but the wait is worth it! We ordered the veg moma for an appitizer along with the avocado salad. both excellent. My friends ordered the lamb and chicken and i ordered the bean thread noodles with veggies. Everything was great. It is also BYOB with no cork fee. The staff is friendly and you can see the food being cooked. I recommend it! Â It is CASH ONLY
