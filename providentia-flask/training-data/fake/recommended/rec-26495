I am deliriously happy that this place has finally re-opened, and look forward to getting soondubu again many more times in the future. That having been said, my first experience at the new BCD didn't knock the ball out of the park. The broth of our steaming hot stews was amazing, but the seafood in my soondubu tasted as if it had come straight out of a frozen bag of mixed shellfish (minus one legit piece of shrimp). My boyfriend's pork soondubu didn't have the tender fall-apart pieces of savory meat that I remembered from back in the day. The banchan left something to be desired, while the normally fleshy, deliciously crisp fried croaker served at the beginning of the meal was oily and over-cooked to the point of being basically fried skin. The music was characteristically odd (epic Titanic and Last of the Mohicans theme songs), but that didn't bother me. I'll definitely be back there for the soup, and am holding out hope that our over-fried fish was an aberration.
