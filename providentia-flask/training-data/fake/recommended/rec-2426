i remembered seeing this place on the travel channel once so i decided to dropped by to eat  at this place during my 2 weeks trip along the east coast last year and i must say they make one of the worst steak sandwich i have ever consumed in my life.  i would rather go to subway or quiznos to get my sandwich fix than to ever go back to geno's. i dont know about the other place across the street tho, i think its called "pat's" ,  but i bet its equally bad judging that both places are packed with steak sandwich fans in which till this day i have yet come to understand. maybe its just me but i dont think i will ever understand the hype for these two philly cheese steak joints.
