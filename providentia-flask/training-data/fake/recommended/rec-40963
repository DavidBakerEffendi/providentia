This dive bar is a staple in New Haven. If you haven't been here, you haven't experienced what New Haven is all about. From the intimate armosphere, friendly staff, and funky booths and rooms throughout the place, you can't go wrong. I've been to Rudy's many-a-night for anything from a quick drink or two, to hours of socializing. Everyone (from patrons, to staff) is friendly and laid-back, which is what makes Rudy's truly unique.
