Amazing amazing amazing amazing sushi and such a cute little place (keyword little)  I'm not a huge guy, but I definitely bump shoulders when going in here, but for the sushi that's not a problem at all.  For 7 dollars you can get 2 rolls, and tea which is a great deal, and it's oh so fresh.  If you love sushi come here, you won't regret it. *note  Like other restaurants they close mid day (like 2) and open again at 4, so make sure you call and verify they will be open before you make the hike.
