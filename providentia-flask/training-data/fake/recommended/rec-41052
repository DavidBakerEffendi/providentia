Simply the most phenomenal food, ambiance and CUSTOMER SERVICE! All of those things combined is why I would give this place a ten star, if I could. My boyfriend and I went last night for date night and we ordered the three meal combo for restaurant week. Not only was that some of the best food I've had (especially the guacamole, which was ordered separately from the RW menu), but our waitress was very attentive, which truly made our experience there an amazing one. I will definitely be back!!!
