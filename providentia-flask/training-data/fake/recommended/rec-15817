This place is good, but not as good as Taim.  I really want to give it a 3.62, but feel it is better to underrate than overrate with a full blown 4.   If you are in the mood for Taim, this will suffice nicely as a temporary replacement. The service was friendly and efficient. The food was good and met expectations.  I don't think the falafel was that phenomenal, but it was neither too greasy nor too dry.  The hummus was a little disappointing.  It tasted suspiciously similar to the kind I buy at Costco. As far as the whole wheat pita, it really was just that, a whole wheat pita.  Nothing fancy.  I would say the selling point was the cabbage.  It was nice and crunchy, and not overly sauced. For those wondering about calories, I ordered mine without tahini, and would guesstimate the calories to be around 450, with a high fiber content and little to no saturated fat. As far as the interior, yeah it is small...but this is Manhattan, so move to Montana if you want sprawling "kick your feet up" wide open spaces.  It is cheerful...and in NYC I will take cheerful in any way I can get it.   I will be back.
