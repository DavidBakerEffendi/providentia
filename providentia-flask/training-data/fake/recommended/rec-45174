Dare I say it?  Best.  Pizza.  EVER.  My boyfriend and I got into town after 9 from Boston and were staying at the Doubletree further down Stone St.  We were tired from the trip and just wanted to grab a quick slice.  I popped on to Yelp not looking for anything gourmet, literally just a decent place for pizza nearby.  Well, you Yelpers did not let me down!  This place was delicious!  It is nestled into a small row of restaurants like a tiny hidden gem, packed with college age kids it seemed but not rambunctious or overly loud.  Service was fast, pizza was amazing- we split a large and had leftovers.  Thick chewy crust, delicious sauce that must have been homemade, perfect amount of cheese.  I WILL be back!
