Went with my family last night.  What a terrific spot on the very lively Upper East Side.  The food was excellent, service spot on, martinis yummy.  The outdoor dining is enclosed during the colder weather and very pretty.  Inside is brick and trendy.  If you're not hungry sit at their beautiful bar for a drink.   There's a wine cellar downstairs for larger parties too. Check out their website for photos.  FYI - I called the restaurant directly to make a reservation because I couldn't on open table.  Can't wait to go back.
