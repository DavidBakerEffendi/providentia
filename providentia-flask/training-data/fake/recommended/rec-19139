I always feel very New Englandy here and I see I'm not the only one, not that I've ever really been to NE, but that's another matter entirely. On to the food! I've been there for brunch and dinner and they are equally tasty. The jam is fresh, coffee strong, and I love playing staring games with the little kiddies. Not everything is a winner but I do feel good about supporting a certain food ethic and since they do have a seasonal menu there's always something different to try. Cocktails could definitely be a bit cheaper! Oh and the bloody mary is spicy as hell.
