food is pretty good .  it is fresh tasting and reasonably priced.  atmosphere is fun and low-key, but can be crowded.  the service  is almost always lacking.  but, it is the best (only?) place for cuban food in new haven. the sangria is delicious, and really does taste like juice.  however, it's not very strong (and i'm a serious lightweight).  if you want strong sangria, go to chow.
