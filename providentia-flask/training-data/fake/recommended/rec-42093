One of the best gems in the neighborhood! Absolutely hidden. I'm actually pissed Yelp let me down and never reported it's existence. My girlfriend and I happened upon it and fell in love. Atmosphere is spot on. The staff is fantastic. The food is really cheap and most importantly - delicious. I like being adventurous. So I ordered the tripe soup and Oxtail. Both were stellar. Felt very home cooked and delicious. The only thing I'd love to see is some signature drinks, and they have mounted fridge with beverages that has fluorescent lights that interfere with the atmosphere and have got to go. But other than that, place is spot on. Worth seeking out in my opinion.
