Good pizza, mediocre service. Got a table right away on a Friday at 7, but then waited a good 30 minutes for the ONE waitress (I feel for her, one person is not enough to cover the amount of tables they have) to take our drink and food orders. I'm not a vegan - or even vegetarian - but my boyfriend is so we tried the vegan sausage and it was pretty good. The food came quickly, except they forgot to make one of the pizzas and we had to remind them. Paulie Gee's is a good solid pizza place, but it's not worth a special trip.
