I made reservations on opentable because I had heard it gets really packed.  We went around 6:30 and it was pretty empty but it filled up pretty quickly around 7. We ordered the khao soi, mango chicken salad, sizzling sisig, pork belly adobo and the halo halo. We also ordered some drinks but didn't really care for those. I love pork belly and poached egg so I was a fan of this.  I was hesitant to try the sizzling sisig because it's pork ears but because of the reviews we decided we had to try it.  The mango chicken salad and refreshing and it balanced out the heaviness of everything else and the khao soi was really good. It had a strong coconut and curry taste but I loved it.  The halo halo was so good esp the ube ice cream and the condensed milk.  We left feeling so full. All in all great meal.
