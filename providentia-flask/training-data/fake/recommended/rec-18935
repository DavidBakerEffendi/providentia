The beautiful French speaking waitresses made up for the flimsy plastic high top chairs and tiny table space of our sort of homely makeshift terrace spot.   The faded peach and light blue striped umbrellas outside were like an ugly Nice tourist trap, where inside was like a more cottagey French bistrot.   We were craving a cheese plate and this place on an off side street was nicely quiet for prime time dining time on a Friday night.  The place seemed very "college" but in that category - very good.   We just had the cheese but the menu looked good with many offerings. Good value with Euro vibe gets the fourth star.
