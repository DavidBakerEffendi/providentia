This place is a hidden gem. Stumbled in here on the way to meet friends for drinks at Teatro Bar (another awesome place!) and was shocked at how lovely everything was. Split the spinach salad (spinach, pecans,fresh Parmesan) and truffle pizza. Portions were HUGE, service was super friendly and the ambiance cozy yet energetic They sent over a Tiramusu on the house, and the two bites I had were heavenly. When the bill came and split down the middle it was a very reasonable $23.00 each with tip. A huge fan!
