I woke up in the morning feelin' like P Diddy, so I decided to check this place out on my last visit to NYC. LOVED ITTTT! I am a huge cheesecake fan so I ordered some sort of huge chocolate cheesecake which tasted like heaven. The food was great too and the atmosphere was pleasant and classy. This place made my trip fab!
