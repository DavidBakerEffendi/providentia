I used to eat spicy beef noodles for breakfast and lunch almost every single day while living in China. After a bit of yelping, I trekked over to Lao Bei Fang with high expectations, but found the noodle soup (beef and tendon, #27) disappointing. Service was fast and you get a HUGE portion for $5.50, so the price is right. Unfortunately, I could barely make it halfway through before feeling like the grease was congealing in my stomach. I have no problem with grease when a dish is worth it, but the broth itself was pretty flat, with little dimension beyond the initial saltiness. They were generous with the toppings but the beef was average - reasonably so though, considering the price. Same with the noodles, fresh and homemade, but far from the best I've had. TLDR: Come to this bare-bones joint if you want to fill up on a hearty meal and free tea, but don't go out of your way expecting a culinary epiphany or hole-in-the-wall gem. I'll update if I ever come back to try the dumplings!
