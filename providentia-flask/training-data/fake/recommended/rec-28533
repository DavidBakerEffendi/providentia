Omg, this place is so good ! I honestly forget that I'm eating gluten free. I came on Tuesday to try their buffalo wings, and wow they were great. I almost felt guilty, but then I remembered they were not fried in a big pot of oil. I got their chicken parm today with the rotisserie pineapple and cashew cream, as suggested by the guy behind the counter. Everything was amazing, but the pineapple with the cashew cream made my day. The Turkish key lime pie was lovely as well. The only thing is, why is it so pricey?! I guess you have to spend a lot for good quality food.
