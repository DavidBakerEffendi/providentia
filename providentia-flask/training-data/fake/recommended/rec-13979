3.5 stars Be forewarned that if you're review-surfing & drooling over 'Nutella French Toast,' it is only served on their weekend brunch menu, NOT their weekday breakfast menu (M-F 8am-11:45am.) It was somewhat of a letdown to my party of three when we showed up on a weekday morning & that item was not available. Wait time was about 15-20 minutes. Penelope's weekday breakfast menu has all the basics covered: oatmeal, pancakes, waffles & egg dishes. I ordered: -- penny egg sandwich ($9): scrambled eggs, bacon, American cheese, & pesto on a croissant. Heavy, as breakfast croissants tend to be, but sustained me all afternoon long! -- raspberry sour cream coffee cake ($5.50): the cake portion was dry & did not have enough coffee cake flavor, but the sweet topping of raspberry & sour cream was delicious! Dense & tasty...would've been perfect with coffee... The space is cramped, but completely charming. Adorable details of sketches on the wooden tabletop (see pic), baby blue color palette, & quirky decor is a pleasure to behold. Service is attentive in spite of waiter being busy. A-OK breakfast spot in Midtown East, but I'm not likely to return only because there are so many other breakfast & brunch spots to try (hell, even five star joints aren't guaranteed my repeat business in Manhattan...) Try Penelope if you're in the area & have some time to sit for a leisurely first meal.
