Came here for brunch this past Saturday and I ordered the fried egg sandwich. I usually don't order sandwiches, but based on all the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try...and true to words, it did not disappoint. My husband ordered the short rib hash, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The restaurant itself is really cute, romantic and intimate. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.
