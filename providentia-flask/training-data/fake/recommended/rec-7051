Great food - I only had a biscuit with bacon and fried chicken, but it was massively delicious.  Can't wait to try the red velvet cake. Wonderful atmosphere - Beautiful decor, fun, airy, colorful, with lots of beautiful wood.  Tables are wooden with bright, colorful, happiness-inducing washes, but not loud or garishly colorful.  Very skillfully handled.  Great benches too.  I thoroughly enjoyed soaking up all the furnishings.  Soft, luminous light when we were there around noon, I felt like I was in a food or architecture magazine.  Very comfortably spaced seating too, not cramped together like a lot of places in the area.   Affable owners -  John and Treva chatted us up from the bar for a good while about Texas, wildfire photography, and chicken fried steak.  Super friendly people, as was our waitress.  Just the kind of people I would want in a neighborhood restaurant. Really glad they're in the neighborhood!  It's a total day-brightener!
