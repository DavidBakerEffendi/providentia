Finally a brick oven place with great pizza and great service.  First time in last night, nice salad special and margherita pizza.  perfectly crisp with right amount of sauce, cheese, basil and seasoning.  My GF got the artichoke special pizza.  She said it was the best pizza she ever had and then chef came to table and suggested to squeeze meyer lemon on it and her eyes almost popped out of her head.  Best pizza got even better.  Definitely going to add this place to the dining rotation.  And Dawn G., you are missing the entire point of this place.  If you need to stuff some regular pizza in your face, go somewhere else.  If you want to enjoy a bottle of wine and have a great Naples-like experience, set an hour or hour and a half aside and enjoy yourself here.
