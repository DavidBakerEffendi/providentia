As good as this food was going down, it was not awesome an hour later. I think it is important to remember that this is "street meat", and you can not base your experience on the aftermath. The Halal Guys are actually awesome.  I got the lamb and rice with extra white sauce no hot sauce.  They give you huge portions and have cute matching outfits. I see a lot on here about bad attitudes, but I have not experienced that with them.   If you are standing in an awful spot for them because you are trying to eat your food, then they might say something.  Remember they are extremely busy making food for everyone and their moms all day so it is OK for them to be cranky. There is usually a huge line for these guys, so try to not go during food "rush hour."  With this said, I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for my food.   There is limited space to eat around the truck so plan on a place to bring it ahead of time.  Most importantly, enjoy your street meat!
