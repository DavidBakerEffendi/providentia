I've never found a sushi restaurant that offers different chirashi dishes, which seem to be their specialty. I ordered the Fisherman's Bowl, it's as awesome as it looks; bonus is they use REAL crab meat. No alcohol served but I over heard the owner say BYOB is allowed. I'm really excited this place is in Crown Heights. Look forward to coming again!
