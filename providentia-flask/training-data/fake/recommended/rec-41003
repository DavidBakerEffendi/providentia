I contend this is the best new place in the neighborhood - especially now that they serve beer (and sake coming soon!) and they have nice outdoor seating. Why is this place so great? Let me count the ways: 1. Lovely service - the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. You can also tell that they work super hard and that this food is their passion. 2. Fresh food - the sushi here is first rate. I also love their bowls, miso soups, and side salads. 3. Interesting and innovative options - they have interesting sushi roll combinations, bowls or cups, and sides. They use some ingredients that I've never even head of - but that were so good. They also have a lot of vegetarian options which are just as good as the fish based options. 4. Nice outdoor seating - for the warmer months, they've placed about 6 tables outside so you can people watch up and down Franklin ave. So in conclusion - this is my new favorite spot in the area. I can't wait for my next trip there.
