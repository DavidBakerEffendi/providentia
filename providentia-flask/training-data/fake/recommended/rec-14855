I'm the Duke (as of the date I write this ) and that's for a reason. My wife and I stumbled upon this pseudo-dive about a year ago while we were visiting Philly and deciding whether to move here. We walked in and I was blown away by the beer selection. Whoever chooses the tap rotations is a certified genius/ nutball. This isn't a place for PBR fanboys. This is a bar that serves beer for adults. Hard to find nationally renowned beers. The best part is that they have growlers to go of anything in tap. This is a welcome respite to Pennsylvania's otherwise arcane liquor laws. And if you don't like drafts, they gave a wonderful bottle selection as well. The ambiance is interesting. They keep the bar so dark that you need the candles on the bar to read the ever changing tap list. The music crosses a ton of genres but feels like you're in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Also, the hostess that works weekends looks like Daenerys Targaryen. So you can't go wrong there. It took a few months before I even knew they served food- some of the best BBQ I've ever had (Sorry, Austin) even their vegan options look delicious - I've only looked, so I can't say for sure. I can't recommend this place highly enough.
