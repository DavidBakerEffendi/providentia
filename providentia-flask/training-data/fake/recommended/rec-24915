It was like the manager read the Yelp reviews and decided to improve the customer-service for the restaurant. When I went again another time, they replaced the bitter-looking waitress who rarely smiled with another who was much more approachable and friendly. Though again, I Â was thinking that maybe the waitress had trouble conversing in English... The reason why I deducted a star is because I usually enjoy getting a plate of spicy pig ears. They are delicious. I introduced the noodles and pig ears to my boyfriend and he said that the only reason why he goes back is for the pig ears. The portion of the pig ears have decreased and instead, they put a lot of the marinated white radish and carrots on the bottom so that it seems like there are a lot of pieces of the pig ears... when in reality, there isn't. I still like my noodles and marinated pig ears, but it'd be great if they could have left it at the same portions!
