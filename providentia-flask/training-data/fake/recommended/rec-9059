Reading the reviews, I expected go be wowed and maybe that didn't happen, but overall a positive experience. I had the catfish ... very tasty. My dining partner had trout and was turned off to see the skin still on it ... the resulting black cloud spoiled the fun just a little. Also, the Bone Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade ... well, let's just say I don't get it. The oxtail is very flavorful, but the Bone Marrow is just fatty. For me, it's a dish to tell your friends you had but you don't order it again. Though that's just me; plenty of folks were ordering it. Dessert was great. Service friendly and never lax. Scene is cozy. By the way, they take reservations only for four (or five?) people or more. Parties of two are first-come, first-serve. We arrived at about 6 p.m. on Sunday and waited 15 min. Nothing to sweat about as there were seats in the bar area.
