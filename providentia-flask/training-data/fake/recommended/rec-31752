Awesome margaritas and food is good but the rudest servers ever! One literally tried to use non-verbal gestures for me to move (May I add he was coming from behind me) and then stared me down walking away. Gabby our server was nice, polite and made it better. I'm wondering though in the interview process if they only go for dirty hipsters?
