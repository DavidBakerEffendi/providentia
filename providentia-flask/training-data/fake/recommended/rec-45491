If you are looking for the textbook definition of "bad value" look no further than Big Fish.  This restaurant offers 4-star prices for 2-3 star food and service which is only so-so.  Clearly, the overall average for Big Fish is pulled up by those raving about its happy hour (i.e. not really rating it as a restaurant).   I can't break any new ground in my review.  Big Fish has a way of charging more than $20/entree for what amounts to Olive Garden level preparations.  We can say, without hesitation, that Macaroni Grill is as good for 30% less money.  And we're not even big fans of Macaroni Grill but it doesn't pretend to be a 4-star restaurant either. Therein lies the problem with Big Fish- I think someone actually thinks they are running a fine dining destination.  They're not.  The menu lacks the creativity to stand out on that score.  The dishes also have the feel of a kitchen run by a line cook and not a chef- just read up on what Food & Wine says is hot and put that on a plate.  No thought or technique involved. So if you are looking for a great night out, keep looking.  For something run of the mill go to the Macaroni Grill or similar.  For something special, there are so many other options out there that (even if they ddi cost a bbit more) are well worth it.
