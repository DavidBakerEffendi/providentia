This is my favorite jewish deli. Its delicious, dependable and convenient. You really can go wrong with any of the sandwiches (especially their breakfast sandwiches). You also can't beat their breakfast specials (I think it's $5 for coffee eggs toast bacon and hash browns). Service is quick, the coffee is hot and the food is amazing. If you are looking for something sweet, their German chocolate is the best I've ever had!
