Went last week and it was great.  Server was so nice and food was light and perfect.  More middle eastern than I expected but great.  Place felt good and had a beer that was something new I never had....sorry I forget what it was.   I will be back to try the rabbit for sure.  Group next door got and said it was amazing.  We had the lamb croquettes and the fish dish and a salad.  All winners.
