AMAZING. Their sandwiches are fresh and delicious! You can choose from a variety of meats (lamb, chicken, beef), and to add another kick to your meal, you can pay a little more to make it "lebanese." The flatbread that holds the sandwich is crispy and chewy at the same time. I tried their lemonade and mint tea. The lemonade tastes very fresh and not too sweet. Their mint tea is just that: mint tea. No frills or covers. If I lived in Philadelphia, I would probably come here every week...
