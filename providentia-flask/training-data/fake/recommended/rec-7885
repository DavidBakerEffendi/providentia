Stopped in for takeout lunch.   Chicken and rib platers with rice and fries plus a pulled pork sandwich.   Food here is OK, but not impressive.   It's a lot of food for the price.   Chicken is tasty.  Ribs were tough.   Not sure how they keep everything warm before service. Nice dining area and nice service.
