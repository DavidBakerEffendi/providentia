This is one of my favorite spots in the city... One of the owners is almost always there and it shows.  The vibe is a perfect mix of rustic (worn, dark-wood tables/bar/chairs/floor against exposed red brick walls) and swank (sparkly chandeliers dropped from a steel paneled ceiling) and hip (interesting photography along the brick wall hung from a wire line with clothing clips) and quaint (antique-looking mismatched tableware, some of which I'm sure I remember seeing at my grandparents house growing up)... The food is all fresh and light.  The wine selection is small but very good and well-priced.
