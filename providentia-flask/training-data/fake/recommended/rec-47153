Went here for late dinner with my girlfriend and her mother that landed from Miami for a visit. We looked for a good Italian place and for our surprise we found it near Times Square. I personally try to avoid the crowd but I was surprised to find this little piece of Italy there. The service is super good! Everyone were so friendly and welcoming! We ordered the caprese for app and it was fresh and delicious. For main we each got a different pasta and we all loved it! I had the veal bolognese and it was really good! For dessert we had cappuccinos and the fresh berry with whipped creme which was also superb. Definitely recommended if you in the area and want to grab Italian dinner
