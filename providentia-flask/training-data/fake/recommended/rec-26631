Decided to check out this place as it was recommended from a worker and the hotel shuttle driver. Few co-workers and I arrived around 5:30-6pm and the place was kind of quiet.. from the outside we almost thought it was closed. As we walked through the doors, the hostess (whom I think might be the owner) and the staff were very welcoming and quick preparing our seats - the service was good throughout the night. As the night progressed, the place began filling up and by that time we were finishing up our dinners and I could tell why the place was filling up with customers. Started the table with an order of their beet salad and a combination platter of their clams, mussels, portobella mushroom, shrimp and calamari. The beet salad was delicious, the beet was well cooked and sweet. The seafood platter was good also.. the grilled calamari - yum! For my main course I had the Salmone Piccata ala Eccola [Medallions of Norwegian Salmon Saut√©ed with Asparagus, Diced Tomato & Capers In a Lemon Butter White Wine Sauce] yummm, my mouth waters just thinking about it! The salmon was pan friend just right and was moist, the asparagus was tender, and the sauce with capers topped it off. I didn't get to sample anyone else's food, but they all truly looked delicious.. I would definitely return when the chance comes.
