Had a lovely and delicious meal here last week!  A friend and I came here for a meal, and we shared just about everything: Starters - -Hand cut tagliatelle with escarole, aged pecorino, and wild boar bolognese.  This was delicious - the pasta had a nice "bite" to it, and the boar was extremely tender and not gamey at all.  You could tell it had been braised for ages.  Delicious! -Edamame falafel with lemon tahini sauce.  Wow - gorgeous, gorgeous color, great flavor, and nice and crisp.  What a great idea to make falafel from edamame!  Very innovative (want to try and make this at home)!   Mains- -Wild Bass filet with lomo, fennel/cucumber salad, gooseberries and almonds.  This was spring on a plate!  All the flavors worked together nicely, and the fish was cooked to perfection.  Some of the almonds on the plate were green almonds (which I had never had - they tasted like huge cucumber seeds - cool!).  Really enjoyed this. -Grilled hanger steak with sunchoke creamed spinach, shallot puree and jus.  This was delicious also.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and everything was well-seasoned.  Nothing ground-breaking, but a solid dish. Dessert- -Kaffir lime tart with yuzu souffle.  Delicious!  I love citrus anything for dessert and this did not disappoint.  Excellent flavors and textures coming together.  Ate every last drop! -Passionfruit tres leches with passionfruit sorbet.  This wasn't my cup of tea, but I don't like passionfruit.  My friend loved it! Though on the smaller side, the wine list is diverse and well-crafted.   Our server, Eric, was delightful and knowledgeable.  He brought out two wine tastes for me so I could decide what to pair with each course.  He was perfect the whole night - just attentive enough, but never over-bearing. Overall, a wonderful experience, and a great dining value.  Recommended, and I will return next time I'm in NY!
