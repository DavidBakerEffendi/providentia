The new management have outdone themselves with Sushi House 21! We had not been to this restaurant in quite some time and was pleasantly surprised to find a totally new dining experience. All of the ingredients are FRESH. Even the miso soup is a delight. We will be visiting Sushi House 21 frequently and recommending this spot to all of our friends. Another plus is the beautiful murals painted on the exterior and interior of Sushi House 21. The new owners and chef are very friendly people and care about their customers' satisfaction. It is great to have another wonderful place to eat in the Ironbound. Recently, I ordered the miso eggplant from the hot tasting menu--it was superb! The lunch box is a great meal with includes salad, egg roll, california roll and an entree of your choice. The mango mousse is a delightful dessert!
