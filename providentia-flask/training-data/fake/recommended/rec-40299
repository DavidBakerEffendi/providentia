When I used to work at 1 south broad, we pretty much lived at McGillin's... for lunch and happy hour. How can you go wrong with $5 bud light pitchers? The upstairs is a nice getaway if you want to avoid the karaoke singers, but if you are up for karaoke, downstairs is a great place to catch an eagles/philles/flyers game.
