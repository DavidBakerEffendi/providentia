Our vegetarian friends brought us to a meatball shop, yes I said it and it has become one my absolute favorite places to go! The one on Stanton is kind of small but I've rarely had to wait any longer than 15 minutes to get a table. You pick your meatballs or veggies balls, sauce, sides, sandwich, however you want it. My particular favorite is the smash with classic beef meatballs with spicy meat sauce which is basically a small meatball hero with a side salad. Move onto dessert and you can make your own ice cream sandwich, pick the ice cream and cookie, what's not to love about that??!!   Note, if you're looking for a full bar, you won't find it here, only wine and beer.  Also don't hang around in front on a late night as they have some annoying neighbors who like to tell on you if you are anywhere near their door making any kind of noise.
