I have only been for lunch, but they are usually pretty good.  The quality of the na'an has declined over the last year - maybe less ghee? (I like my fat).   The waitstaff is plentiful and attentive during lunch, despite being a buffet.  I would highly recommend to anyone pressed for time in New Haven, but still not willing to go to fast food.
