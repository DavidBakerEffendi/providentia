I wouldn't have come here hadn't the final scene of the sopranos was shot here. I just thought of starting out writing a review while am sitting here waiting for the food. I was glad I should say for being some 10 minutes before, coz this place got crowded pretty fast. As I type, I can see a waiting line ahead of me. Food - I didn't get my food yet that was ordered some 25 mins ago - and that's a cheese burger that I ordered Ambience -- yes, it's almost same as shown in the tv series, but few things have changed I guess. Also I feel I am getting a little bit of headache now, considering the amount of people around. There are around 30 people right around u a few feet away. And relaize the amount of chatter, children shouting, they clapping, and different kinds of sounds is now nauseating. Service is good, but as I read in other reviews, there are only a couple of waiters who I guess are overwhelmed with the amount of work they got. All this review I wrote without tasting the food. I will do that once it comes -- In 2014 for sure . And then after a long wait, after about 25 mins, the food came. The food was pretty simple, some fries, a burnt patty and the rest. The food was didnt taste that great as was expected. I would give a 5 as sopranos chose this place 2 -- for the delay in food (25 mins for a cheese burger) 2 for the amount of chatter and noise ( I guess it depends from person to person). 1.5 for the taste of food. 4 for the hard work of the waiter. There were only 2 waiters i could see and around 20 tables. How many can she take it too. A total average of 1.5 star would be my rating towards this glorious not so worthy restaurant. If Sopranos hadnt happened here, I would have saved 15 dollars and would have spent some where else.
