Bartenders are friendly and willing to offer suggestions on food and beverages. Although this may seem like an obvious characteristic of bartenders, it's not seen at all places! They have a good beer selection and although I didn't get any food, the menu looked really appetizing. There's an outdoor space that looked really pretty, I plan on checking that out next time.
