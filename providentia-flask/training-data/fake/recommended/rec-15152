We were in search of the quintessential Philly Cheese Steak sub. Donny's fit the bill! Â Easy to find and indoor as outdoor seating. Great taste of local fare. We ordered the onion rings would have preferred a lighter batter. The fries were good. We ordered four subs. All with cheese whizz. One with onions two with pickles and one plain. Our family hobbled them all up.
