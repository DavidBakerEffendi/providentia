I stopped in Sabrina's last Tuesday to kill some time before a job interview. They just opened so there wasn't the usual brunch crowd that everyone loathes. The hostess encouraged me to sit at the counter and grabbed me coffee and water right away. Â After agonizing over their breakfast and brunch specials I decided to stick to a half portion of their stuffed French toast since I was about to go on an interview. Even though I wasn't eating much I received excellent service. Everyone from my server, to the hostess who chatted with my about my interview greeted me with a "hey!" or offered drink refills. Their stuffed French toast did not disappoint and I devoured every bit of it. It's as amazing as brunch go-ers rave about and the stuffed french toast was the perfect portion (I couldn't believe it was only half!) Overall Sabrina's did not disappoint and I will definitely be back. When my server picked up my check he wished me good luck on my interview and I even got a fist bump and a good luck from the hostess as I left! A + for Sabrina's
