What a fabulous place for a romantic dinner! My husband and I were in Midtown Manhattan for a conference, and our hotel was very near Pierre Loti. They have comfortable outdoor seating and excellent service. Probably some of the best servers I've had anywhere. We ordered wine and a cheese plate. One of the servers asked if we wanted other food as well, which we did, so he recommended other small plates that would pair well with our cheese. Everything was delicious...deviled eggs, charcuterie, hot tapas, and the assortment of cheeses hand selected for us. We were in the city for 5 nights, and this was definitely our favorite spot. I would recommend Pierre Loti for couples looking for a quiet, romantic evening with delicious nosh and excellent wine or cocktails.
