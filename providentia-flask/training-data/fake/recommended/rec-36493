Where do the 5 stars come from????  Did I order the wrong thing? Was I wearing a "kick me sign?" I visited Balthazar on a Sunday, going solo as I was traveling for business.  I was fine sitting at the bar, but, while I waited for a seat to op up, they made me stand next to a couple eating in a booth which I am sure didn't make the happy and was uncomfortable for me. It took 15 minutes for the bartender to recognize me and take my order even though he seated me.  I ordered and was delivered a decent meal, but calling it a meal is a stretch.  Order toast and coffee.  I had to ask for butter for the toast, who serves toast without butter. And, I had to ask for cream for the coffee, which took another 2-3 minutes to deliver. On top of the crappy service, the bill was over $30, for one person!  The tip reflected the quality of the service.
