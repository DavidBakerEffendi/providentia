We had a great meal here. Take out, though they deliver. I have been to Bangladesh, and I have to say that Star of India will give you authentic spice if you ask. They ask how you want your food. They are really nice and responsive. We had tandoor chicken tikaa, Bangalore vegetables, pickled mango chutney, roti, and rice pudding. They were all great and spicy (we asked for it spicy). I definitely recommend the rice pudding to cool the palate. Looking forward to going back. Especially for the buffet!
