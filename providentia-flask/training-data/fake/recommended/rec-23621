One of my favorite restaurants in the city. It's a simple down-home diner. You really can't go wrong ordering anything from the menu. They have a special menu that you should always order from. Their specials are delicious. Pete the owner is very nice and you will often find him in this location. I used to live in the building where this restaurant is and I would get frequent deliveries. Now that I live closer to King of Prussia I miss little Pete's so much.
