Order anything, order everything.  Everything is delicious here.  We rolled out of this place, having over-ordered.  But it was so worth it.   Our one complaint is that it was SUPER steamy in the porch area.  However, it was Labor Day weekend, which ended up being mid-90s...so can't really hold that against them as they can't do much about the weather ;) Will be back next time we're visiting our friends in Brooklyn.
