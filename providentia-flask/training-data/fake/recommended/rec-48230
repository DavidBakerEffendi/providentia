This is my 4th trip to Mamoun's and with my prior 3 visits being after 3am and drunkenly not remember a thing, I decided to this correct and coherent for lunch.  Mamoun's was great then, and it is just as good now, if not better - sober or drunk.  It was so good my soberness decided to go back for dinner, on the same day. Yes, I ate there twice in 6 hrs. Food is cheap with a ton of flavor.  It is a well-made Pita Sandwich.  Whether it's falafels, baba ganoush, shwarma, chicken, kefta, or kabobs, you can't go wrong.  Yes, I've had them all and can vouch for every single sandwich on the menu.  Oh yeah, let's not kid ourselves, that hot sauce, say what?!? It's in my top 5 hot sauce of all hot sauces. Lastly, it's stupidly cheap.  I spent more $ on my cab ride from East Village to SoHo than my tally @ Mamoun's.  Keep in mind I ate their twice in the same day! This is an automatic "every time I'm in New York I have to......."
