The line at Red Hook Lobster Pound in Red Hook is virtually non-existent compared to the line at the Brooklyn Flea. The line at RHLP is considerably shorter and faster than Luke's Lobster in the East Village, but Luke's Lobster is way better, IMO. Not to say RHLP wasn't good, it was just slightly less better than Luke's, like 1% less. Hence the 4 stars. Upon entering, you will notice the two big "hot tubs" filled with cold water. Â I like to refer to these as the luxury pools for the lobsters. The lobsters here are alive and well... as fresh from Maine as you can get considering NY is a few states away on the map. They treat the lobsters as if they were Wagyu lobsters. In lieu of beer and massages, the lobsters get to roam freely in a non aquarium like setting. And then they are hacked. Hacked, warm, and with a touch of butter, the Connecticut style lobster roll is very good. The meat is plenty, sweet and tender and the bread is almost like the toast on a grilled cheese sandwich. One that is proper, buttered on both sides and crispy. The pickle and chips seem like filler and the whoopie pie on the counter is both frighteningly massive and enticing. I have yet to ever eat a whole lobster roll on my own since I always share with someone but the few bites I always have seem worth it. It's a darn expensive snack but one that is pretty luxurious.
