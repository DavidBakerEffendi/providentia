It's about time someone entered the scene with emphasis on organic, delicious, affordable food! I came here on my lunch break and was pleasantly surprised. Inside the decor is very welcoming, and the staff greeted me at the door, along with the intoxicating aroma of fresh ingredients being cooked to perfection. A coworker of mine ordered the Persampier salad (AMAZING), and I ordered the ginger scallion noodles (also, amazing!). Both of us were really impressed, and the emphasis on ingredients is what sets this place apart. Everything tasted fresh, and the combinations of flavors was truly exceptional. Â  Beyond the food itself, the actual experience from start to finish was something that I found to be very enjoyable. You are greeted by a very user friendly touch screen interface which shows you the entire menu and the options available to you. However, this is far from overwhelming and allowed expeditious movement of the long line of customers. I was literally in and out in under 10 minutes. Every staff member had a smile on, and was eager to assist anyone. Anyone looking to get a REALLY good meal complete with locally grown fare, great service, and an even better atmosphere should head over to this place. Don't pay attention to the haters below, they clearly missed something! I will definitely make this a staple of my weekly diet, and I can't wait to introduce my entire office to this gem! LONG LIVE HONEYGROW!
