Great food, especially if you eat Paleo or Gluten-free. While it might be on the pricey side for a cafeteria style restaurant in New York, I wouldn't say it's out of line when you consider the kinds of ingredients required for this kind of healthy cooking. I especially appreciated the market area that sells desserts, snack foods, spreads etc all targeted at people with dietary restrictions. I picked up some snacks for my flight the next day. I will definitely come back here!
