What would have been a perfectly bland brunch experience became abysmal due to the incompetence of the entire FOH staff. It was like having brunch in the middle of American Apparel. I sincerely hope that the hostess and waitress go find jobs at the DMV, because they are obviously not happy working in a restaurant.
