i was pretty skeptical when i heard of this place and wondered if it would be a super trendy "hipster" kind of place and was definitely thinking that was the case when we got the restaurant, which looked super dark and looked "edgy." but everyone was nice and there was no attitude, not especially friendly or warm but not unfriendly at all. i was happily surprised by the pizza though. the crust is perfect and though the toppings are definitely different than your traditional pizza places the taste definitely lives up to the hype. the crust reminds of the kind of pizza you can get in Italy. thin chewy and delicious on it own. we really liked the hellyboy and definitely want to go back to try different things. definitely recommend, though expect a wait.
