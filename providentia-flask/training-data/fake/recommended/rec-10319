I went here last week with three friends because I had a Groupon. We were the only people in the bar, we ordered cocktails to start; two of my friends ordered draft beers which tasted flat,  I wonder if the taps are properly maintained.   The food was bad.... just bad, we ordered chicken nachos and a sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were good, but other than that every thing else ate tasted like it was frozen food reheated in a microwave, dry, bland and flavorless.   All in all the place had potential, the theme is nice and the place itself was nice, but it has a lot to be desired.
