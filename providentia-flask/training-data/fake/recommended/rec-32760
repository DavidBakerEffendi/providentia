Pick and Mix popped up in a small shopping center near my house - it replaced a small salon adding to the plaza's other food options. I would say this establishment is offering a much healthier option than the others. Food: The menu is simple. Bibimbap, chicken wings(bone-in or boneless), soups and Â salads. The bibimbap is definitely my go-to item: White or brown rice or sweet potato noodles, a large selection of veggies and your choice of protein. They are generous with the toppings and it all gets stir fried together and comes with a miso soup. The soup leaves something to be desired, in the way of miso, but is a nice palate cleanser. I have ordered the boneless chicken wings once - they were crispy and a little too sweet but were just as satisfying as any other wings I have ever had. My regular order: brown rice or sweet potato noodle, all of the veggies, egg, chicken or tofu and teriyaki sauce with sesame oil. Price: Not exactly cheap-eats but for the amount of food you get - it's worth the $9. Atmosphere: Simple decor and furniture. Bright. Plenty of seating and they will serve you at your table after you order at counter. Remember to add a little tip to the bill if you are planning on eating in. Staff: They could not be more friendly and accommodating. You are always greeted with a "Hello" and a big smile and they remember regulars.
