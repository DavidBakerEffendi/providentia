Happened upon this stumbling out hungry from First Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum, and it was a nice find in this neighborhood. Simple menu, done well. American cuisine - grilled hangar steaks, cod, roasted chicken breast - you get the joke...excellent small selection of artisinal beers on tap. Definitely Washington Avenue is getting trendy when this kind of restaurant starts popping up here and there.
