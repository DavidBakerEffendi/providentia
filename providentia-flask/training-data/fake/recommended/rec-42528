My mother, father, and I ate at La Sirene on Saturday night for dinner and had a phenomenal time.  Our waitress, a young woman named Isabel or Isabella--I'm not sure which is correct--was charming, energetic, friendly, and altogether lovely.  She steered us toward some of the most delicious food--a creamy goat cheese appetizer as well as a tangy mussel appetizer dish--both of excellent portion and flavor.  Our duck entrees were like eating dessert--although the dessert menu stands on its own--and we left completely satiated.  An adorable restaurant with a very sweet server.  Thank you!
