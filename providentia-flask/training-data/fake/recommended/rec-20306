We came for dinner last weekend and it was one of the better meals I've had in a while.   Highly recommend the lamb chop and breast entree.  Pumpkin fritters and roasted beet appetizers were also very good.  Chocolate torte dessert was probably a miss as it was way too rich without any sauce or other addition to cut it. One caveat, and the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars, is prices seemed a bit steep for what it is.  It's very well done unfussy food, but with entrees approaching $30, it's probably not the best of values.  Also, the service is much less formal than what one would normally expect for restaurants in this price range.  I don't mind this at all but some people will.
