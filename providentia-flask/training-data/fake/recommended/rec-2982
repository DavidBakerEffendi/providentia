Best Italian Food In Philly! I am a big fan of Giorgio's. Foods Fantastic. The place is well lit. It's a BYO. The owner is great. I've been here four times and was never disappointed. I was always well accommodated whenever I came alone or with my girlfriend or with a group. Can't wait to come back next time I am in Philadelphia!
