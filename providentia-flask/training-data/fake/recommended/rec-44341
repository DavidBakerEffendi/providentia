Overall a pleasant experience. Service seemed a bit rushed, and apparently you must order apps/entrees all at once.. and probably best to make reservations ahead of time but they will still accommodate you! Cute cozy spot.. its asian downstairs and italian upstairs.. the food was impeccable 4.5/5. We started with the burrata appetizer.. excellent and perfect to split amongst two people.. a couple of nice sized burrata cheese balls, brown buttered dates some cherry tomatoes bread and this basil pine nut lemon compote thingie.. it was delicious! paired with some red wine .. recommended by the server. We split a pizza - wild mushroom truffle oil mozzarella, it was delishhhh!!! Also split the fusilli pasta with grape tomatoes and home made mozzarella.. it was a little dry, could have used some spices/flavor, but a little crushed pepper flake can make it all better!!!! pretty good place, definitely worth going.. won't disappoint!!
