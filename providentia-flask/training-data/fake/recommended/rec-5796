All I can say is that it is only $5 dollar.  Better than the damn footlong at subway. These guys got it right.  Today, I walked over to check out the street vendors on 52nd and Park Avenue.  Saw a huge line and decided to jump in. I ordered the rice plate with the combo meat (chicken and lamb) topped with white sauce.  The dish came with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese.  Yum yum yum.... And, did I say that it only cost $5.  Yes... I assume the $5 includes tax too... This is awesome!
