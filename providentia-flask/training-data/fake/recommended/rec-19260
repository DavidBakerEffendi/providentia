It was about 7pm; I was a couple liters of Victory Mad King in at Frankford Hall. I had an early start to my day. We went to the 1pm Phantoms game at Wells Fargo and tailgated prior. By this point, I was dying to stuff myself with something delicious. I can be pretty stubborn about where I want to eat sometimes. I was standing firmly on the idea that my meal, wherever we went, needed to come with French fries. We almost stayed at Frankford to order because of me. Thank god I eventually came to my senses and took my friends up on their idea to go Fette Sau. This place was amazing. I ordered the half chicken, 1/3 LB of ribs, 1/3 pulled pork, and the mac&cheese for myself. It was more than I could handle, and I needed help finishing it, but everything was perfect. It was one of those eating experiences where I forgot about everything else in the world and went into an immediate food coma when finished. I'm normally pretty frugal about how much I spend on food (usually a 4:1 ratio of booze to food) but I didn't even care that I dropped $40 on just food alone here. I will be back.
