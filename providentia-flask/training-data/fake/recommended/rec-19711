It's very cramped inside. They have a few tables for outside seating or you can try to stand inside and eat your food on the tables against the window. When my friends and I came here they were extremely busy and the service was slow because there was only one person making everyone's orders. You can clearly see how they make the wraps and what they put in it Â right in plain view so that was cool to see, and it helped your eagerness during the wait. I ordered their Brother's Grimm wrap. It's chicken wrapped in chestnut & chili dough with pickled shitake mushrooms, raisins, plantain chips pickles, and chipotle aioli (via the menu description). The wrap was huge. Not gargantuan, but definitely not a pip-squeak. There was a hefty amount of food in the wrap that just tasted delicious. I especially like the raisins and plantain chips.
