Fantastic place.  Right next to the train station so I pass it everyday when I get on the train to go to work.   The food is heavenly, and for the quality and creativity that goes into their dishes, it is CHEAP!  Their bacon, egg, cheese, spinach on flatbread is AMAZING. It is definitely NOT your average basic breakfast sandwich thrown on a roll. I also got their burrito once that was also fantastic!  The portions on that was huge and I could only eat half, saved half for later. Ironically, I never had their cheesecake, but I can't resist leaving without a red velvet MUFFIN!  Yes, they have these amazing muffins made with red velvet and chocolate chips in it!  Get it toasted with butter, you will never forget it. It makes me super happy to see a small business like this just simply get it right! I really appreciate all the creative options on their menu, like the items with goat cheese and other non-regular ingredients.  It is what makes me eat there instead of the dozen other small places I pass everyday.  I feel like I am getting something extra special, not your typical run-of-the-mill menu. I would really like to see them open for a Sunday Brunch special.  Maybe like a small limited menu of like only 4 or 5 options, a drink, and a coffee all for one inclusive price.  Or a small buffet or something.  Sunday mornings are so charming, just like Anthony's Cheesecake!
