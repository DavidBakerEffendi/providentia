As delicious as it looks. The decor is spectacular: candles that Â are individually lit and places in hanging votives, Dia de los Muertos skeleton family on the walls, hand made water glasses... and I could keep going with the detail that transported me to Mexico. But this is really about the food, so I'll get to it. We began the meal with some traditional margaritas (5/5 stars) yumm... they're tasty and classy. And washed those down with some chips and guacamole (6/5 stars)- the guacamole was buttery and had generous chunks of avocado, it melted in your mouth and sent you to hass heaven... I ordered the Molcajete de pollo (5/5 stars) and shared with my mom since the plate is -huge- (we couldn't finish it between both of us). It comes in a large lava pot with some tortillas on the side, so it's like a genuine fajita (you can get it with chicken or beef). The service was extremely attentive and as usual, it never hurts to speak Spanish ;) it always makes it a lot more home-y for me to be able to speak and joke with the servers in my family's mother tongue. You'll have a great time, I'm sure you will- it's an ideal location for large parties or an intimate dinner.
