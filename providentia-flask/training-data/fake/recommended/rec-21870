We sat at the kitchen counter twice and did the tasting menu. Second time we had planned to order a la carte, but the chef mentioned a giant squid from Japan as part of the tasting menu, plus our first tasting experience at Prospect was superb, so we went for it again. Great experience and awesome food from start to finish (desserts are delicious, too). Truly appreciate the chefs' love of food and ingredients, highly recommend the tasting menu at the kitchen counter.
