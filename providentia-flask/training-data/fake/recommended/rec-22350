Great Thai restaurant. My 2nd favorite restaurant in New Haven after Caseus. Better than the other Thai restaurants I've tried closer to Yale. True, it's a couple dollars more expensive than most Thai restaurants, but the food is superb, and if you order just water and a $10 entree you'll be happy and full. They don't even have my favorite thai dish and I still love this place.
