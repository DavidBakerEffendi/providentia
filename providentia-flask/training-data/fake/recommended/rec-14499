I didn't get a chance to eat here, only hang out at the bar upstairs for my friend's birthday.  He said it would be my new favorite bar.  It isn't. It's decorated AWESOME.  They definitely did a great job there.  The downstairs bartender was cool, and they had a couple scotches to try.  But they were a bit pricey.  And I didn't find the place very social... more of a "hang with your friends" kind of bar. It definitely is out of place in the neighborhood, and I could see myself going here once in awhile if I lived in the area.  But I'd rather just go to LES and go to similar bars that aren't so expensive there.
