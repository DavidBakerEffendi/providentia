When I'm hanging out in an airport, my expectations are set just about as low as it gets.  I've been through plenty of airports, and even the places that look half-way decent usually end up being terrible, with service to match. This place will not bowl you over.  It will not make you fly more places just to get through security to visit the GSC.  However, compared to other airport eateries?  Atmosphere, service, and especially the food are all truly remarkable.  Maybe I liked it so much simply because my expectations were so horrendously low, but either way, I walked out happy, full, and wishing I had a more active metabolism to throw down a shake!
