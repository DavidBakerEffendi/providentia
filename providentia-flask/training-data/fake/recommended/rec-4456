We went on a Monday evening for the hot pot, which is nice in a cold winter night.  It is $10 for the soup base (you can choose all spicy, all mild or half and half, the last one is in a pot divided in to two compartments) and $19 for a basic combination of pork, chicken, beef, lamb, seafood, lettuce, vercemilli noodles, and tofu.  We got the half and half hot pot and ask them to change the lamb and seafood into some other meat.  It is good in the sense that there are not many places in this area have hot pot but the meat quality is so-so.  The amount of food is fine for two but if you come with more people you might need to order more food or meat.  The service is fine.  I will go again maybe next winter.  The spicy side is not as spicy as some people mentioned here.  Maybe I am just more immune to spicy food.  But it is quite greasy with a lot of hot pepper oil.  The mild side is very brothy and nice to drink at the end.  We ordered two sesame sauce ($1 each) but we didn't use much of it at the end.
