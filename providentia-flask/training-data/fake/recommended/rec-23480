It is almost 2 am on Monday night and I just got home and had to sit down and write this review. I have been meaning to try this place since it opened I don't live very far and walk by often. I have heard nothing but great things and the only reason I haven't gone earlier is because I am a snob when it comes to waiting to sit, I know that's a good sign, I just hate it. I read this horrendous article that came out about this spot and I needed to experience it for myself. I just couldn't believe it. I didn't go for dinner but me and some friends went for a late night drink and were pleasantly surprised to find a small and delicious late night menu which is incredibly lacking in the neighborhood. I had a Gin cocktail and a delicious corndog. In reference to the article and his attack on the kind of people that frequent this establishment and the vibe of the staff well let me tell you the women... are merely gorgeous walking pieces of art, angels dipped in ink. The men also mostly covered in tattoos and engaging in beard competitions. When they are not competing it seemed they were enjoying their food and drink and talking about business, music, day to day stuff etc... Joshua David Stein (the writer of the article) I understand how being in a room full of beautiful people that boast confidence can make you feel like you are worth nothing but to defend the history of a group of people by insulting another is hypocrisy at its finest. We don't appreciate hypocrisy in Bushwick. Think hard before coming back. I will be returning to MTH with PLEASURE!!
