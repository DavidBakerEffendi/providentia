My friends and I were so excited to have dinner and a few drinks here for happy hour. Our waiter was so rude to us that we ended up chugging our drinks and running out of there. This guy was snobby and rude as soon as we walked in the door. Its a shame because this place has a great atmosphere and $4 house wines for happy hour. Sadly I won't be coming back here.
