Friday night. Made reservations through Open Table on Yelp and seated promptly on arrival.   The atmosphere was very cute.  Perfect for a date but also for a group.  We had a party of six.   The staff was mixed. Some friendly. One server was very impatient and snippy.  Our friends really enjoyed the food.  I thought the food was good but certainly not the best.   Calamari Grigliati-  arugola and tomatoes seasoned perfectly with a citrus flavor. The grilled calamari was good but was missing something and slightly overcooked.  Well cooked calamari should still be easy to cut, not rubbery. Carpaccio di tonno al sesamo-  really really thin and delicious. Covered with lettuce and a tasty sauce but overpowered the flavor to a point that the carpaccio was masked by it. Sogliola alle erbe-  the yelp pictures looked soooo good but this dish was my biggest disappoinment.  It's advertised as herb crusted filet of lemon sole with tomato vinaigrette and basil oil served on a zucchini ragout.  sounds delish, right?  well, this was served with a pumpkin mush (i guess this was the ragout).  Oh man, oh man. I know it's fall. But I don't like pumpkin on my fish. No sir. I prefer pumpkin in desserts. I don't care for it in my entree.  I really wish they would have advertised this new fall change. Pappardelle al ragu- I really enjoyed the few bites off my husband's plate. So tasty. This is a pretty good choice if you're wanting a tomato based pasta dish.  My hubs thought it was a bit on the salty side but I really liked it. Overall, this is a pretty good restaurant for the price.
