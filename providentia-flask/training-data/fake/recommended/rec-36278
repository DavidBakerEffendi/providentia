We went here for my wife's 30th birthday whilst on Holidays in NYC. I ordered the Steak Frites and I if I have had a better steak i can't remember it. Definitely justifying the 30-odd dollar price tag. Beers were cheaper than Yankee Stadium so that's another plus. Service was excellent for the most part, although they said they were going to get us some bread which never came. The place has a really relaxed yet mixed atmosphere. At one table you will see holiday makers with bags and bags of shopping, at the next you will see dudes in suits, then next couples on dates. the place is loud so it doesn't make for perhaps the most romantic date night, but the food more than makes up for it. We made a booking, which definitely recommend. We arrived pretty much right on time and were shown straight to our table. When we entered I overheard a couple being told it would be at least an hour's wait for a table. I can't get used to the whole 'bathroom attendant' situation. I understand that the USA is built on tipping, but giving a bloke $1 for handing me a few pieces of paper towel is a bit ridiculous.
