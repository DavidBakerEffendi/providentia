Giving it 3 stars. Very nicely decorated all around but that's about the only highlight here. Went to meet buddies for a few post work drinks. Staff was okay, nothing special.  Only issue I had was that I ordered a gin n tonic thinking they would give me the cheap stuff but when I got  my tab they banged me out for Bombay Sapphire! The bartending shifts changed so I couldn't really argue with the guy.
