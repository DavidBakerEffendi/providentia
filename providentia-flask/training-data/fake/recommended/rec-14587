This is an excellent beer bar. Everything that they have on tap is top-notch. The bottle list is also nothing short of superb. I had Stone Enjoy By and a Brasserie de Franche Montanges Square Root. They also had things from Trois Dames on tap. The bottle list had Jolly Pumpkin, De Dolle, and Brasserie de la Senne. The atmosphere is pretty good, but not really what I would consider outstanding. The food is generally pretty good. The Coconut Club sandwich my brother had was quite good and quite vegan, while my Portobello Mushroom grinder was also quite tasty, with very good provolone. My girlfriend had a pork sandwich, but she thought it was too salty, and after trying it, I would be inclined to agree. The waitress that served our table was quite nice and knew the beer menu rather well. However, one of the bartenders was a little rude to my brother and my friend, when they tried to take their beers out to the beer garden. The bartender told them that they could not take the beers out to the beergarden, but that they were welcome to defecate on one another's chests. While this was sort of funny, it was also quite off-putting. Overall, I would certainly come here again, but I would hope not to converse with the aforementioned bartender.
