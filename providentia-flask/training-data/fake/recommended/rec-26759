In the area needing a cocktail and some food BADLY. Quick Yelp check tell me this place is 1. Not a chain and 2. affordable. SCORE! We walk in an are greeting by the adorable bartender who tell us we can sit where ever we like (the place was pretty quiet) so we sit at the bar. Since I am not one to let an adorable bartender go to waste. Cocktails are ordered, food is ordered. (there was only an hour left of brunch so we just got cocktails separately) I got the Grand French Toast is was AMAZING. My friend got a savory breakfast of some sort (I forget the menu name) but she also was very pleased. As I mentioned before the place was quiet when we walked in but picked up as we sat and ate and drank. The service never suffered. Cocktails were refilled, smiles and jokes were made. Exactly what brunch should be. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to stop in the area.
