We've only been there once, but my husband and I loved it.  The cappuccino and dessert was awesome!!!  And the owners/staff are so great... so polite and nice.  I had the gnocchi and sauce and it was excellent.  I left fulfilled and happy with energy to go... not that heavy feeling that over-processed food can give you.
