This used to be one of my favorite places however the last several times I have eaten there I have noticed the meatballs have completely gone downhill. At first I thought they were having an off day but it has been consistently not great for a while. Owners/chefs please take note: your meatballs are way to dense and hard. They should be light and fluffy. You are called the meatball shop. That means your meatballs need to be nothing less than perfect. Fix this flaw please!
