GF pizza Branzino I do love that they have a lot of GF stuff, but the Branzino skin was too soggy for me.  It is just a simple delicate fish that doesn't need more work than a little salt and pepper with Olive Oil - the soggy skin on the fish is one of my biggest pet peeves!  It was just overpowered with the lemon sauce is was accompanied with. The service was very friendly and they did get very lively for a Thursday night - so make sure you go early if you do.  It had a more family feel and not as intimate and romantic as I had hoped.
