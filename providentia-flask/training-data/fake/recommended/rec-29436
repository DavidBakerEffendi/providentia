Easily a 5 star location. The staff were friendly. The food was cheap. The Cheesesteak was the best I have ever eaten. They had a great selection of drinks and a few beer specials with sandwiches. The cheesesteak, while delicious, needs some sauce, so be sure to get mayo, mustard, or even pizza sauce. We were the only out-of-towners there, and it wasn't touristy at all. Genuine experice. I highly recommend Dalessandro's.
