The place seemed nice enough and the staff was friendly and attentive. Ordered 3 panckakes, i ate one that was under cooked.  The pancakes are so thick that they are not enjoyable. Eating one is like eating a small cake.  I ate one, gave one away (he didnt care for it either) and threw the other one away.  I have heard such nice things about Sabrina's so i will try it again, but i will never again order the pancakes.
