This placed lived up to the hype (and the long wait).  There was something so good about the fried zucchini- that home style taste with the extra kick of- we did it better then you ever remember! Also got the stuffed chicken- which yes, I know chicken is boring- but I went against my typical habits to order lamb when in Greece- and I was not disappointed!  It was moist and tasty.   My only suggestion is to make a reservation.  I walked up as a single guy- was told 10-15 minutes- and people just don't leave this place very quickly. So thats fine- not a knock on the business.  But be prepared to wait- or get a reservation (and still be prepared to wait).
