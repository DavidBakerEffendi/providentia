Took a group of 15 people which was stretching capacity there, but worth it. I was worried about accommodating the large group, but I placed the orders all in advance and they came out in rapid succession. The chicken wings,curry puffs, Â beef larb, green papaya salad were all hits as well as the penang, yellow curries which I ordered mild and sriracha on the side, the shrimp pad thai. The pork with shitakes and snow peas was decent, but popular. Also since it was BYOB they had ample wine glasses. The consensus was the same, everyone enjoyed it and many in the group got takeout for their spouses.
