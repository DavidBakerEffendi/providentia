A customer service person contacted me on yelp to follow up, so I decided to give them another chance.  I took a date there to get to-go for a romantic meal at home. As usual, the hostess was awesome, making eye contact, greeting me outside on the sidewalk when I was 10 feet away, and gracefully ushering me inside without my having to break a stride. This was a bustling Thursday night but despite the crowd the to-go cashier was engaging.  Woah, I thought, I'm going to need to upgrade my Yelp review.  My date was hungry, so we ordered three orders of meatballs and a side.  He diligently read the order back out loud.  My date and I looked at each other and nodded that he got our order exactly right. After getting home, opening a bottle of wine, lighting candles, and opening the bag we found....only two orders of meatballs instead of the three we ordered.  Anyone trying to impress a date should know letting your date go hungry at dinner is the last thing you want, but that's exactly what happened here thanks to The Meatball Shop. Despite that, I would upgrade them to 2 and 1/2 stars if I could because at least the service was not rude and aloof this time around even if it remained ineffectual.  I'm still hoping someday the service will get into shape because the meatballs are truly tasty.
