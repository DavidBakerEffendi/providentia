I had the pleasure of finally checking this place out and was extremely pleased with the email I received. First off, this restaurant does not take reservations and yes Yelp reported this right. However, if you're in the area, I would recommend just calling ahead and seeing how busy they are. I did this and we were promptly seated. This place has a wide selection of paninis, crostinis, and mirrors. Seriously, one wall is lined with mirrors. Myself and three other people went to this restaurant on a Saturday night and it was a bit busy, but the waitress did manage to stay on top of us. I had mortadella panini. It was pretty light and wasn't as crazy as some of the other paninis. My girlfriend had the special which involved dirty fries and Â chicken I believe. it was very very good. I also had a guava mimosa, which looked really unusual served during dinner, but I didn't mind and it was quite good. There was a mix up in which my friend was given a panini that he didn't order but they allowed us to keep it free of charge. For dessert I had the peanut butter rice krispie and my girlfriend had the chocolate truffle cake. I loved the PB rice krispie, it was super rich however, so don't get this unless you have a sweet tooth like myself. The chocolate truffle cake was rich as well but still quite light, allowing you to eat quite a lot of it without feeling like you're going to give birth. Honestly, I have been dying to try this place out and was completely satisifed with my meal. It came to be about 20 bucks and change with the tip and I felt full and satiated. Seriously, check this place out, it is deeeeelicious.
