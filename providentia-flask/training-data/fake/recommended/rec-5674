Came here with a friend to get a little drink and grub after a hard day of resisting the urge to cudgel annoying Williamsburg hipsters to death. Started with a Havemeyer cocktail: tasty but didn't blow my mind.  That's fine.  At least it took the edge off my murderous impulses. For appetizers, I ordered a crab croquette and my pal got the duck rillette.  The croquette was a crispy ball with a soft crabby center on a tangy remoulade.  Like the drink, it was well executed but nothing that I would run home and Yelp about.  The rillette, on the other hand, was sublime and made my dining partner keep mumbling and then cooing about how he needs to eat like this more often.  Well done, chef. Moving on to dinner, I ordered the meatloaf sandwich, which was the main reason I had for visiting the place.  While meatloaf may not conjure gourmet memories for most folks, it does meet my main criteria for restaurant food: something that I am just not going to make for myself.  And even if I did, it wouldn't come out this well.  The loaf had a little crunch, and then unctuous umami deliciousness in the middle. My frugal friend decided to keep ordering off the happy-hour menu and got two plates of sliders as his entree, totaling three short rib mini-sandwiches and three pork belly ones.  While pork belly may be all the rage in foodie circles, we agreed that the winning plate of sliders was the one of short rib.  The meat was tangy, savory, a touch of sweet, and as moist as the hurricane that hit the city the next day. Now, I thank god that I don't live in the neighborhood, but if I did, I would soothe myself with meatloaf and cocktails at Rye all the time.
