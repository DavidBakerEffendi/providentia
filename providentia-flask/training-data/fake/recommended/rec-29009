We flew into Philly on our way to Central PA for Thanksgiving. This was my first time in Philly and we stayed in a hotel just a few blocks away. It was cold and rainy that night, but we liked the menu and reviews, so we put on our coats and walked over. The place is tiny, with tiny tables really close together. We decided to sit at the bar. There were only a few other couples, but the bartender looked friendly and we preferred a little more wiggle room. We had the olives and the meat and cheese tasting plate. Everything was delicious. They shave the meat to order, so nothing is dried out or extra chewy. Our pizza was super delicious, and we had not problem finishing it. We enjoyed our Fall Fashions and have decided it's something we definitely need to recreate. The in-house made, spiced simple syrup really made all the difference. Â  The staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and informative. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Philly!
