My boyfriend and I came here for the 5-course tasting menu a little while back.  With a LivingSocial in hand, it was a steal - for $50, we got two 5-course meals and a bottle of wine of our choice.  I think it still would have been worth it at full price, but I also don't think we would need to order as many courses on our own, so this would be a reasonable place to go for a nice dinner.  The food itself was very good.  The smoked salmon over potato pancakes was quality, the sulmaneria plate with assorted cured meats was huge and came with a delicious fig jam, my short ribs were perfectly tender, and after a few courses, I had to pack some things up to bring home and ask for dessert to go.  Our waitress was friendly, and our meal was well-paced.  We were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time, but it didn't feel too awkward, and our waitress seemed to know exactly when to come out to check on us.   Based on the food and service alone, I would probably give the place 4 stars, but I have to knock my rating down a star for the owner's note before you enter the restaurant website.  (I checked today and the note is still there.)  Clearly in response to some negative Yelp reviews, the owner writes, "If you are a would be critic and your only intention is to point out the negative in an establishment please pass us by...there are 100's of other potential targets for you to hit to make yourself feel important."   I found this comment to be a really off-putting introduction to his restaurant, and it made me a little nervous about making a reservation.  I find restaurant reviews to be useful, and I don't think most reviewers are writing to make themselves feel important.  The owner's negative attitude might be the reason why we were the only ones in the restaurant, or why the atmosphere felt a little cold.  Thankfully, the only member of staff we met during dinner was our warm and welcoming waitress, and we were still able to enjoy a good meal.
