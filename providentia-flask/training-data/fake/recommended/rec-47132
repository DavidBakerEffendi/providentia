Waited way too long to try this place on, but with no reservations on the weekend, took the midweek route to ease into a most delectable meal. With its focus on simple Tuscan flavors, the appetizers are were simply solid, but oh did the entrees deliver. To boot, the location offers one of the city's most unexpected people watching corners. Only downer - these folks love the A/C, and it was cranked high enough on an otherwise pleasant autumnal eve to cool our meals soonafter they arrived. That said, visit two will probably hoist this into a fiver. Stars, that is.
