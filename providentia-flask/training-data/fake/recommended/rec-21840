After walking past this lovey little store front day in and day out on 5th Ave. my boyfriend and I decided to give it a hot for bunch. The decor is a lovely mix of shabby chic and rustic farmhouse. Cookbooks along the shelves and wathered chairs and tables create a nice morning ambiance when living in the middle of BK. The downside of this place is the service and the portion size. Host is akward. Her timing is off or something. She seemed confussed about where to seat us, even though there were only a couple of other table taken and one server on. She didnt know how to ask if everything was okay. I don't know, just be confident and friendly. (Maybe, I'm being mean...) Portion size is tinsy. For a $14 breakfast sandwhich I expected something rich, greasy and big but instead a recieved a small brioch that was over-toasted and an unseasoned fried egg, barely any cheese. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly and loved it but we both left hungry - like full-on hungry. I will say they served French Press Intelligensia and I could not have been more excited about that. Being from Chicago and finding the beans harder to come by than imagined in New York, this was a definate highlight. Even though we were dismayed with brunch here, we have been dissappointed at a lot of places in New York so far so, we give them a pass. Dinner looks to be rustic and cozy each time I walk by after sunset so we plan on returning and comparing the two experiences. Some restaurants just can't do brunch.
