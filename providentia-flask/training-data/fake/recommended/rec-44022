I love Mood Cafe! Hasan not only makes all his chaats with care, he takes the time to interact with all his customers. If the food alone isn't enough to put you in a good mood, he definitely will. I've tried several varieties of chaat and while it's true that the differences between each variety are pretty small, no matter which kind you get you'll have a different experience in every bite. Sometimes you get a bit of fresh fruit, sometimes you get the creaminess of the yogurt, sometimes the punch of hot sauce...and all with those delicious little crunchy bits. Chaat is like the perfect food for people with short attention spans (like me). The lassis are also delicious; fig is my favorite. If I lived or worked closer, I'd be there all the time!
