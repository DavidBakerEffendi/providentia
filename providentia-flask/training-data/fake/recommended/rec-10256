Do not be scared by the item on the menu that says, "dry noodle with miced pork sance." There are no mice in that noodle, at least not intentionally. In fact it's my favorite thing on the menu - yes it's a little sweet but as a real Taiwanese I like my food a little sweet. They also have the best beef noodle soups I've had in Manhattan. Others have described in detail how the man kneads and pulls your noodle to order, which is good entertainment and more importantly produces a good bowl of noodle. At the price of $4.50 a bowl, this should be a Chinatown 5-star gem. I took a star off for all the litter that is on the floor - they should at least sweep it and pick up trash (tissue, chopstick packaging) a couple times throughout the day. It's not that much more work compared to the noodle pulling...
