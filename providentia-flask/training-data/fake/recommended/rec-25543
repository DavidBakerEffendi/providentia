One of the better happy hour spots in the city.    Food is decent, but their bar area is what really seems to draw people consistently.   Alcohol prices are reasonable, and there are usually happy hour specials on apps.   They've tried to have outdoor seating, but it kinda feels like you're right on the street.   Their menu definitely got better over the past year or two.
