I adore Rabbithole. They have crafted what I consider the perfect brunch: baked eggs with carmelized onion and arugula on toasted baguette slices, all topped with a delicious cheddar sauce (perfect potatoes and salad on the side). And they serve brunch late - til 5! Â Sweet options are always good as well (including the best scones I've ever had - yes, hyperbole is impossible here), and dinner is just as successful. Also perfect for a cup of tea to warm you after a windy walk across the Williamsburg Bridge.
