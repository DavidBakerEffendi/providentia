The ambiance of this place is something out of Anna Karenina novel :) Very imperial Russia (i.e. dark wood panels on the walls, crystal chandeliers, marble floors, fireplace in the middle of the dining room, grand piano in the corner) even though it is an Austrian restaurant. The food was ok, but I mainly came here for the apple strudel, which did not disappoint. Bonus, there is an art gallery in the same building which at that time was featuring Gustav Klimt.
