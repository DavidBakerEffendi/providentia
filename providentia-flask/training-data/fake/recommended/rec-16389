I have been in this areas for a few months and just decided to try this place.  Oh my god the tuna burgers are amazing. I try to have it once a week with the oh so amazing sweet potato tempura fries.  I am sure there are other lovely things on the menu but I can't seem to get past the tuna burger.  The wasabi mayo is soooo good! My job buys us lunch every month and this place is one of our selections and half the office gets something from here!!!!
