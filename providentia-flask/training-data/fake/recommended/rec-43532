Good Dog is my favorite place to go for drinks and food. They have an ok beer selection, good food and a chill vibe. My favorite is the grilled cheese. The bread is buttery and flaky and the apple slices and bacon go nicely with the cheeses. Their sweet potato fries and chipotle mayo is freakin addictive! The only downside about this place would be that it can get really crowded. If you want to grab a bite any nights or weekends be prepared for a long wait.
