My God... This is it... Roast pork Mecca, and it's right here in Philadelphia. I've been waiting to write a review on DiNic's for awhile because I cannot properly articulate how delightful the sandwiches are. The experience is truly ineffable. Roast pork with sharp provolone, broccoli rabe, and hot peppers is absolutely sublime. You would be doing yourself a grave injustice if you do not at least try this sandwich.
