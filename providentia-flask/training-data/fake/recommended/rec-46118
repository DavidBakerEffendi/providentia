While the pizza my fiance and I ordered-- a medium margherita-- was deserving of four stars, Luna loses points because it's overpriced. $20 for an eight slice, thin crust pizza with basic toppings is excessive by most standards. We ordered a house salad to share, which was basic but reasonably priced, and one drink each. Our total was around $45, including tip. Given that we were only two people, didn't order a bunch of appetizers and drinks, and Luna is a glorified pizza pub, I felt a little swindled. Our waitress was friendly and competent, and the service was prompt. If not for the fact that the pizza was so expensive, we'd probably make a return trip.
