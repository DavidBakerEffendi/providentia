We had "brunch" here because they had lots of outdoor seating. It seems this place is quite popular for groups of girls having their Saturday brunch and who don't care that the food is so so and that the service leaves something to be desired. They gave us a brunch menu and after 20 minutes, they decided to come back to take our order, only to tell us that they are no longer serving brunch and gave us a lunch menu instead. Now I'm not one to give just one star based on an isolated, bad experience. The 2 stars is based on the food itself. Bland, boring, basically something you could get anywhere. Come when the weather is nice since the outdoor seating is wonderful for people watching but keep your expectations low so that you won't be disappointed.
