The menu was so full of tempting options that we couldn't choose.  We ended up getting 4 appetizers and a couple of soups so that we could try a bit of everything.  The crab martini was to die for and the tuna appetizer we had was just right.  I can't wait to go back!   If I have one complaint it was that the restaurant was a bit small and so it was also a bit loud, but I can live with that when eating such great seafood!
