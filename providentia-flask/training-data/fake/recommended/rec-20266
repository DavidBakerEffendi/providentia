3.5 Overall the service was friendly and efficient - our meal came out quite quickly. The portions were huge but delicious so the leftovers were happily welcome. Despite the wait it was worth it and although the entire place was packed it wasn't too loud and didn't seem too crowded or squeezed at all. My mom said she would be content to come back here every Sunday but her sole complaint was that there were no pancakes on the menu. What kind of brunch place has no pancakes on the menu? It's a bit blasphemous. I would suggest the restaurant and even go back for lunch, since it seems they have an inventive chef who puts interesting twists on classic dishes that turn out deliciously and at a perfect price.
