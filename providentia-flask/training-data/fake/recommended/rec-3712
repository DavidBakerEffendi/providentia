Donde esta El Gato es my Bonita y Frio? Im so bilingual!  As you can tell I don't know a lick of Spanish,  but I know Spanish food. It's the California State Cuisine (you learn something new everyday) I was strolling down Franklin looking for something to eat,  and I stumbled upon Chavelas. It was PACKED. Thankfully I was by myself and I copped a squat at the bar, where I happened to meet my new friend Porcia. Porcia recommended the fish tacos and im glad I took her advice.  Babbbbbbbbyyyyyyyy,  them fish tacos were great.  They were finger licking good, literally. I also had a few drinks.  And the bartenders were amazing.  I love spicy drinks,  so they made everything spicy for me.  SCORE. Lovely interior,  great service,  and a happening crowd.  What more could you ask for?
