Somehow I've lived this long (and that's a pretty long time), and even honeymooned in Vietnam, without ever experiencing the yummy deliciousness of a banh mi.  Thank goodness Hanco was here to relieve me of my virginity.  So good we dined here three times during our stay in Carroll Gardens - and we felt oh-so-cool when we were informed that Hanco's was the subject of a This American Life piece recently.   The banh mis were excellent, served on warm, fresh rolls with the freshest of fillings, and the vermicelli salads were light and perfectly seasoned.  Everything is made to order, and they have a great selection of magazines for those who decide to dine in.  If I lived in the nabe I'd be a regular for sure - and now that I've been turned on to banh mi, I can't wait to find the Hanco's equivalent in SF.
