Doing my usual McDonalds crispy number 5 and Tap House combo and in about 15 mins. Time to get this day started. But before I go, let me fill you in on what I think about Tap.. After I woke up from my daily half an hour nap at my Banking Job one day, a co-worker happened to mention Tap House to me, since I value quality beer over pretty much everything on this planet. And he is a good man. I hope he and his family succeed in every endeavor they pursue. I love the intricacies of beer, how it's poured, the aroma.. how it makes me syntactically incorrect. But most importantly, I love what it makes me think about -- things like middle eastern politics, the lack of flaming lips concerts in Philly and why i'm always the lone black man in these types of places. I digress. Tap house gets four stars from me because my god, is it excellent.  As soon as you grasp that beautifully made door handle, you instantly know the **** done got real. And that's even before you whipped out Friday's paycheck!  Ohh yeah. The beer list is no where on Eulogy or Monk's level my fellow alkies, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't frothing at the mouth.  I think I had a tear in my eye when I drank my first beer, the Fatty Boombalatty. In my goblet. With my smug grin. I'm forced to go alone, since my friends refuse to step up the venue game,( palmers, corner bars etc)  or just feel completely uncomfortable being around tons of white people, so I cant really comment on how a group experience would be, but I'm sure that it'll be  memorable with the relaxing outdoor space, friendly environment and incredible food. Even though I love Tap House, I wouldn't say it's a fun place to be, really.  It's the perfect date, intimate conversation, pre-game or chill spot in West Philly. Make Tap your first stop and then cruise down to Rittenhouse/Old City for some fun. If you go to tap on the weekends after 8PM and stay till closing, then my friend.. You're just pouring Jelly on yourself.
