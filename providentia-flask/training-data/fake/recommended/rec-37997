This place is quite deceiving. They are trying very hard to appear super trendy. However, the atmosphere is cold and uninviting. Â  The food was not impressive. Presentation, on the other hand, was way overworked. It seemed that they tried to make their dishes to look as pictures in food magazines. I ordered skate. The fish was overcooked and dry. Looked great, though. My husband ordered the lamb. His lamb pieces were not a good cut of meat. Parts were inedible. But, again, the dish looked great. In short, Blu was a big disappointment. We will never set a foot to that place. It was expensive, and the food was very pedestrian. There are plenty of great places in Montclair, and I doubt this one will still be here in 3-5 years.
