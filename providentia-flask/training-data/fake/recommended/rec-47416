David Chang's creativity is really special. His restaurants get a lot of hype, but it's well deserved. We started with the "pickled things," which were quirky and set the mood for the meal. Though I don't eat much meat, the famed pork buns were worth the exception (so savory and juicy!). The newly added Lomein was also delicious, though my favorite dish was the scallops. I didn't love the pate (a little over-salted) , though that was never my style to begin with. The desserts, as expected, were incredible and unique at the same time. I tried the new Cornflake cookie, which was perfectly crumbly yet satisfying. The milkshakes were way too sweet though - I felt like i was drinking high fructose corn syrup. Overall trendy atmosphere and truly creative dining experiences make this east village hot spot a must.
