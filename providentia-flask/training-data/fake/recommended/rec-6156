I heard a lot of great things about this place.  In fact, it is legendary for its white clam pizza.  We were hungry and ready to eat a really good pizza, so we placed a to-go order.  We came to pick it up and people were standing in line (always a good sign).  We picked up 2 pies: margherita pizza and (what else) white clam pizza.  We came home and were stunned to find that both pies were burned very visibly at the crust.  I don't mean well toasted.  I mean charcoal burnt.  We ate around the burned part.  The dough was good, the sauce of the margherita pizza was good too.  The white clam pizza was ok, but very salty.  All in all, we were highly disappointed.  This place did not live up to the hype it is so famous for.  We should have opted to go elsewhere.
