Their picante sandwich, when I first had it (about a year ago), well I was quite happy with what I was eating.  I've gone back about six times since, going out of my way each time. There are a couple seats at marble counters, and I have perched there and eaten the picante sandwich, usually with something less than my standard regard for how I appear to strangers.  What I mean is, I don't care if a piece of chorizo ends up on my lap, or if I have to tear at the ciabatta like a hungry/angry mountain lion.
