Finally got around to trying Wheated, and was not disappointed! I like the space, and the staff was welcoming and attentive. Since we were going to share a meal, my friend and I had a salad to start, it was fresh, flavorful, and the portion was very generous. We shared the Sunset Park pizza with hot sopressata and it was delicious. Add some cocktails to the mix, and a very helpful server, and it made for a great evening. We'll be back!
