Ooookay. I had to see what the hype was all about and being an avid pizza lover I found myself at Paulie's. I ordered a salad which was not good at all. It was romaine, random noodles, bacon and chickpeas. Quite an odd combination, it just did not go well at all. I must say that having that bacon was a real treat. I forgot how salty, but delicious it was. I was starving so I finished it. I contemplated on whether or not I should get vegan or regular pizza, but I just couldn't resist ya know? I opted for the Hellboy. To be completely honest, it was good, but short of amazing. I was expecting so much more. I have never been a sauce person, but if it is one thing I am particular about it is the sauce of my pizza and it was not really there for me. Maybe the hot honey took away from the pizza and overwhelmed it more than enhanced it. It wasn't really "hot" either, I asked for the chili aioli which helped on the spiciness level. Overall it is just alright, I did not mind the trip because I am always down to hunt for the best pizza. Maybe I just ordered the wrong one? They offer van leeuwan ice cream too.
