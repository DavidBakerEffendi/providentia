We had a late Saturday lunch here, but even at 2:30, the place was still mostly full. The decor is really cozy, the service is quick and friendly, and the food was wonderful! I had a spinach and feta omelette, which came with home-style potatoes, toast, and a nice little salad. My daughter had pasticio, which is like a Greek version of lasagna - pasta, sauce, and ground beef, baked into a round dish. The top layer is kind of like a cheese souffle though. Yummy! We both had enough to bring home half for dinner, so it was a very cost-effective meal too. Â I would definitely go again!
