I was very impressed with the quality of the fish and the craftmanship of their sushi chef.  The Oh Toro and the Amber Jack ( a type of yellowtail) came enveloped in a very fine delicate seasoning and melted like butter in my mouth. We had the Izumi roll which had freshly roasted seaweed that were crisp which enhanced the taste of the fish. The yellowtail and scallion maki rolls were also delicious. We ended of meal with house made green tea ice cream that had just the right amount of bitterness to give it a kick. The fact that it's a BYOB makes it so much more affordable.  I'm definitely going back for more.
