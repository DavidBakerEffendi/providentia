Either I am too old or this place totally sucks.  Went here on Thu night at 6, oh man, it was so damn crowded, literally, not an inch to move, the noise level which is a combination of music and everyone talking at the same time is awful, the servers were nowhere to be found, two bartenders on the second floor barely able to serve a huge crown of people, I had one drink and left in half an hour.  Did not try the food.  Maybe I am just not the bar type of a girl
