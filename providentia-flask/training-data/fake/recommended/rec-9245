I thought the address was on Old Fulton St? I love thin crust, and I usually love it on the crispy side.  A previous visit would have been rated a 6 out of 5 stars, but last night they were a little disappointing.   The pizza came quickly, obviously had good quality ingredients and fresh taste, but the crust was really really chewy... almost like it had been made and baked earlier in the day, then topped and heated up when I ordered.  The mozzarella wasn't even thoroughly melted... I was also charged more on the bill than the menu listed.  It was only $1 difference, but inaccuracy loses points.  I didn't make a stink over it, but it came off the tip (sorry, I felt bad doing that). I'll give them another try, since I've had such a great experience in the past... and hopefully I can add stars to this review. Service was friendly and quick.  A first-try of this restaurant would have been 1 or 2 stars based on this experience, I'll give 3 because I do want to go back and give them another shot.
