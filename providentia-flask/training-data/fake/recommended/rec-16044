To start off with a caveat, I'm not a huge 'foodie'... I typically decide if I like a place based on the atmosphere/feeling, service, and whether they have a "decent" menu / food. I loved this place! Not pretentious at all. VERY friendly and helpful staff!! My waitress was amazing. And, even the host was lovely (hard to come by in this city). Â Cozy yet cool feeling. And, good food (at least for this non-foodie type). I will be back... very soon... and I can't wait.
