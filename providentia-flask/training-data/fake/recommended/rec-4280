Fat Salmon I wanted to like you. Your reviews seemed so promising which I why I chose to visit you... I was just here yesterday evening with a friend, to catch up & have some good sushi. They have a lot of options on their menu however, when you read what is in some of there special sushi rolls, it doesn't sound too appetizing. I saw bacon as on of their ingredients in one of there rolls. Bacon doesn't belong in sushi... I ordered the shrimp shumai as an appetizer, it was ok but, it was a little cold. For my entree I ordered the Lost Rainbow Roll & the Spicy Tuna Roll. I didn't like the flavor of my rolls. The spicy tuna was a little too spicy & salty. The Lost Rainbow Roll, I didn't like how crunchy it was & the sauce they used inside the roll. They also don't bring out appetizers & entrees together. You get yours as soon as it is prepared. If you go out to eat I feel that you should be served at the same time. Its rude to eat while someone else is waiting for there food and its awkward. They also took away our appetizer plates without, asking if we were done and I was still eating as our plates were being taken away. Wow ! I guess they had decided we were done with our appetizers at that moment. Then it took forever for my friends entree to come out & then they forgot the sashimi that she had ordered. When she reminded them they did bring it out, & told her "it was on the house." Which was nice. I did like the ambiance of the place & the modern decor. I did like the dim blue lighting, very calming.
