Now I am not Asian, so I can't tell you the authenticity of these dishes but I can tell you they are delicious! Especially if you prefer spicy. The building is absolutely beautifully and probably my second favorite thing about this place! The third would be that the prices are extremely reasonable and they are generous with portions. I recommend the garlic chicken.
