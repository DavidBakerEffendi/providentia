Amazingly affordable. It's nothing fancy. But I just love the feeling of authenticity. The waitstaffs don't speak English well, but they are very kind. But there hand-drawn noodles are amazing in both affordability and taste. I also love stir-friend noodles with pork. I highly recommend this place.
