The pizza was fantastic! Clams tasted fresh, thin crispy crust, etc. I'm not from NH, so i can't compare to other local joints. But definitely great pizza. However, the service was terrible. Inattentive. Bringing wrong things. It wasn't crowded, and it was late afternoon. Lots of folks working, and many empty tables. No excuse.
