The food was wonderful but the wait was a circus. Pushed around, elbowed, run over, crowded and forgotten :: and we were told it gets worse in the summer. Tip to Owner: Â I'd soooo suggest you Sign up for one of those noWait apps and get a bit more tech savvy so customers aren't being abused just to get the chance to eat.~ an iPad for your hostess and a txt msg when your tables ready would solve this problem in one day.
