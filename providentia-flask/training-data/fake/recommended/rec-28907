I haven't had a single bad or disappointing expiernece, I though 4 stars at first but I can't think of anything bad. Food is excellent , limited menu but that should never bee a negative factor in a Resturant. They can't all be cheese cake factory with 150+ Kraft food items. So appreciate that they only put items that they are going to do well. Had the duck jambalaya excellent and shared some brunch items. Cesar salad really nice, what makes it different is the corn bread croutons. Coffee is excellent and service is just the proper amount of friendly, not to overly hyped where its awkward. Nice enough to just find if our experience and day has been good which I appreciate. Lunch is cheap too, bill can add up with dessert, coffee and apps but then you just had awesome full course lunch. Pastries are cute and not overly sweetened, professional.
