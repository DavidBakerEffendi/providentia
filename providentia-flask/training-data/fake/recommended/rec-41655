What a gem! A friend had come here on Friday night and his review had been so enthusiastic we came on Saturday, around 9:30, to check it out. We were able to sit right away. Go now before this place is packed with hours-long waits! Incredible, honest food. We started with the leek and goat cheese terrine. The leeks were perfectly cooked and the slice of terrine - swirls of leek packed together with goat cheese and probably some other bits of tastiness, and then sliced - was quickly gone. We also tried the smoked blue fish on toast with horseradish- this didn't have the typical oiliness of blue fish, it was very well balanced, served on charred toast with radish. The market salad with blue cheese was highlighted by small bursts of rhubarb that had been salt cured to take the edge off the tartness. (We had no idea what they were and had to ask). The hangar steak was delicious. We ended with a generous pour of the last of the wine from the host and a slice of apple tatin served room temperature with cardamom creme fraiche. We sat at the bar. The space is tiny and was a refuge from the chaos of Saturday night on Orchard. The host and chef were attentive and gracious. Not pretentious at all- they seemed as happy to serve you a Modelo in a can as a glass of Bordeaux. What a great spot!
