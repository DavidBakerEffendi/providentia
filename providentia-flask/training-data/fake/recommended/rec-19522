Great time, great food, and super wait staff! We started off with being offered the "Rapture" drink special and, although we declined, we got some great beers instead. Also seemed to have good game-time specials. Server was very cheery and helpful, even when her food orders didn't get printed and therefor took longer. Food was good - mac and cheese and edamame burger totally at the top of the list! The Quesadilla and perogies were also tasty - would totally go back to try my hand at the Wall-of Shame Burger!
