Since my initial sandwich taint waxing here quite some time ago, I've been back periodically.  I must say, they've got some killer ideas.  I dig their predilection for putting deep fried toppings on sandwiches.  The turducken sandwich with the cranberry sauce and fried hash brown on top was genius.  Although seasonal, one of the best sandwiches in the sandwich capital of the world. Also, them panko-ed fried onion husks - boom - i need a statin.  The best peice of deep fried onion I ever put in my mouth.
