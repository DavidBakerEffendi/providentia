I am shocked it took me this long to write my review! My husband took me here for a belated birthday/early anniversary dinner. We showed up at prime time on a saturday night, about 6:30pm, so when we arrived, there was a 2 hour wait. We put out names in and walked across the street to the super trendy bar/restaurant and had a few very tall beers. Just when I started to get hungry and tipsy, we got the call that our table was ready. We started off with the cheese and meat tasting. we got 2 meats and 3 cheeses and they were the MOST delicious cheese plate my husband or I has ever had. The brandied cherries and mustard were perfect accompaniments. Because it is a rare occasion that we go all out in this manner, we ordered an app as well. We got the grilled octopus salad, and I would have to say it is one of my favorite dishes...ever. the tenderest octopus, with arugula, and all sorts of Mediterranean flavors, lemon, roasted peppers, capers and olives galore! So happy with this dish. For dinner; the scallops for me, absolute melt in your mouth perfection, risotto was perfect as well. My husband ordered the filet. He was very happy with the quality of the meat, but I felt like the brussles that came with it had been sitting in the oven a touch too long. It really didn't matter though, the waitstaff was wonderful, it was very quaint and not too noisy at all. We managed to have a very romantic dinner and our bottle of wine with out ever feeling crammed into the little restaurant. It was just a great night!! Can't wait till next year to go again!
