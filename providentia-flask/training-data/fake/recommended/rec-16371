This place is amazing! They have fresh food made daily for the price and speed of fast food. How do they do it? I'm vegetarian and their veggie udon noodles are superb. Their veggie burger is also unlike any other burger I've ever had - truly a delight. If you go for their sushi menu keep in mind their portions are rather large so you probably only need one roll here. The spicy sauce that comes with the spicy cucumbers is delicious - but keep in mind this is pretty much just cucumbers and a dipping sauce so kindof not worth it. Overall if you work or live in Chelsea and haven't been to Kobeyaki yet - what's stopping you?
