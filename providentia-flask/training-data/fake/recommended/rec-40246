Glad i asked my tour guide where I should eat while in Philly. She recommended Reading Terminal and I was a little unsure about it at first but boy was I pleasantly surprised. They have some many options for food it is close to impossible to decide. Look around before you make a final choice. For desert have Bassett's ice cream it's the BEST!!!!
