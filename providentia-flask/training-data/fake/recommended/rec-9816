So, here's the thing.  I've had Pio Pio before but it has been delivered to my office.  The food is fantastic...great chicken and great sides. I was not sure what the actual restaurant experience would be like.  Unfortunately it was not good, and to top that, they have received a "C" health rating from the city.  I was taking some family who were in town to visit and we walked about 20 minutes to get there...if it was just me I would have gone somewhere else due to the rating but I didn't want to do that to them (and they didn't catch the C rating anyway). The service was really poor.  Had to ask multiple times for things and there was no checking in / refilling of water, etc.  In NYC I guess I have come to expect a higher class of service and you just won't get it here.  The food also took a very long time to come...much longer than a couple of entrees and a salad should take.
