Went there for brunch while visiting a friend of mine who lives down the street. I had the grilled cheese with white cheddar. They made the damn thing in a waffle press. a WAFFLE PRESS. It was the most perfect grilled cheese i have ever had, honestly - haven't had it with the smoked gouda, but i'm assuming it's just as good (if smokey cheese is your thing). Unreal iced coffee, great service, and allowed our dog (take note that there are only a few small outdoor tables, though).
