I have eaten at the Toloache in the West 50's and loved it.  But dinner at the Greenwich Village outpost was mediocre.  I adore suckling pig but their version was as hard and dry as a hockey puck.  If the quesadilla contained the promised huitlacoche I would be very surprised.  Likewise the truffle.  It was just boring.  We decided to pass on dessert and got some very good baklava at Mamoun's.
