I am fortunate enough to live nearby, and have visited this restaurant a few times, all of which were pleasant experiences. I find the waitstaff/bartenders to be friendly, and since they know me, always come over to the table to say hello. I have brought my family here, come with friends and even my dog likes to pop his head in the tiny kitchen window to say hello to the chef. Food has probably gotten better with each visit - I have tried the roasted beets and sea scallops for starters; the butternut squash risotto, the grilled pork chop, the pan-seared cobia and the smoked chicken ragu as mains. Â All fantastic! For their cocktails, I have tried the 'Short Song' and 'Sterling Place' - both of which are strong, strong, strong. Love it! They've a wine selection that's spot on - not too long, but you'll find what you need. Great neighbourhood vibe, friendly people, lovely food and gorgeous interior decor.
