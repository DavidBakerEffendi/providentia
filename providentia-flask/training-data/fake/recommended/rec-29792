This place is hands down one of the best brunch spots in nyc in my opinion. The restaurant is super cute and with outdoor seating and indoor which makes it ideal for dining in both summer and winter. The brunch menu here is fantastic and very creative. I highly recommend the burger Â which is not something Id ever normally do, but here it is really something special. My only negative ( no fault of the restaurant )was that while i was there both me and my gf sat directly in the line of sight of some chick (believed to be Argentinian )eating ketchup on a knife out of the bottle. We wanted to throw up. wtf?
