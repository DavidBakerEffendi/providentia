So there's this whole rivalry between Geno's and Pat's (very Jets and Sharks), and when we were visiting Philly we ate at Geno's because I'm not exactly a Cheez-Whiz fan (apparently Pat's sticks more to the "original" cheesesteak, which comes with Whiz). When you order a cheesesteak, you don't want to come off like a total tourist. So if you want it with onions, you just say "with" and if you want it with provolone or whiz, you just say either "provolone" or "whiz." Pretty self explanatory, no? So for example, I wanted a cheesesteak with onions and provolone, so I would just walk up and say, "With provolone" (or "provolone, with"). If you just wanted Whiz on your sandwich, you would literally walk up to the window and just say, "Whiz." Don't be a doucher and just say "with," because, hello, it's a cheesesteak -- you're supposed to get some kind of cheese on it. Anyway, the cheesesteak was meh. Also, it's outdoor picnic-style seating, so it's not very clean, but who cares? You're eating a greasy sandwich with fake cheese on it. Bring hand sanitizer.
