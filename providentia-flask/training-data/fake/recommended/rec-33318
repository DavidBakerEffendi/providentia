The food at this restaurant tastes great. I loved the lamb kebab, as it was tender, and served over kale and caramelized onions. It is definitely different from any mediterranean place I have been to. Â It is mediterranean food for refined tastes in a way. The place is fancy and nice for a date. The service is excellent, and prompt without being overwhelming. I rank mediterranean places by how the hummus tastes. I must say that in this case, I was disappointed, but Ilili made up for it with the overall experience. I will definitely come back.
