Love their lunch special! Everything is very authentic. It is just like having lunch in Tokyo or Kyoto, wherever they are from. My friend loves their skiyaki. It was a bit expensive $27/person but worthwhile trying. Very clean, zen-like soup of beef and vegis. Their udon is great, too. Those who work in the area are fortunate to have lunch there. Whenever I have chance, I tried to take lunch there even by myself. If you go there around 2, you can be seated in 10 min. Too bad they are not open during weekends.
