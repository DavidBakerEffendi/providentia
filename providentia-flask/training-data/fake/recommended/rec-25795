My family's favorite place for authentic, delicious, homemade Italian food. We've been going here for 10+ years, and it's consistently excellent. Run by a fun, friendly family of 4, it's 10-12 tables are almost always full. Even though it's small, it's good for groups and perfect for celebrations. There were 3 birthdays the last time we were there. The menu is large and it's all amazing. Portions are large, but we always finish them because it's so good. They take reservations and do their best to honor them, though last time we were sat at 8 for a 7:30 reservation. Call far ahead to avoid disappointment.
