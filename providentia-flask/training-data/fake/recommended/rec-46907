Sabrina's is one of my favorite Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch places. Every morning and early afternoon you can expect a long line. I come here once a month on the weekends to try their weekly/monthly specials. The specials change from month to month. The specials are always creative and have catchy names. Specials range from specialty tacos to sandwiches to breakfast items. The "must-try" breakfast item are the stuff French toasts. They are always packed and filled with something sweet and creamy. Even their healthy selection of food taste great. I love their sweet potato fries. I can come here and say with confidence that everything here taste great. During the summer and spring, the outdoor seating area is perfect. Plenty of shade and room. They have a separate room for waiting. Expect an hour wait on weekends from 9am - 1pm. They have a friendly staff that is very tentative to your needs. The portions are large and very satisfying.
