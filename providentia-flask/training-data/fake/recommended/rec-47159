Hostesses too busy eating steak off of their friends' plates at table next to us to send a waitress over, then when asked to, it's clear they've been drinking the past hour of their shift.  Disgraceful behavior.  As we get up to leave we hear "oh they wasn't feeling us?" - try Morandi, Bluestone Lane, Yerba Buena, Oaxaca, Tartine, Diablo Royale, Empellon, Bar Sardine....anywhere but Extra Virgin.
