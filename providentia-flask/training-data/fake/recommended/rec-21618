This place has a good reputation for a good reason - it rocks!  Went here recently with a friend on a Friday night and the line was out the door onto the street with nowhere to even stand inside and get a beer.. so we went elsewhere got a pre-din din cocktail and came back. Yowza those burgers are good!  I got a bacon cheeseburger, I mean, why not go all the way, right?  Cooked to perfection & juicy.  Fries were good - not my favorite but good enough, buns were toasty.  One of the better burgers I've had in the city.  Yummy mugs of beer for decent prices, yes please! Not the fanciest of places, or the cleanest, but it has loads of character.  The service was quick and some of the bartenders seem to have been there for years and years.  The whole getting a table process is very organized and patrons just seem to know how to line up, not cut, get in and get out - nice!
