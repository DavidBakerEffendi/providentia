I believe I was food poisoned here. Went Tuesday night 9/17/2013 with my gf and we had the hut sampler, she had the falafel and I had the gyro. It was enjoyable going down but at work the next day I became violently ill. First came the nausea, then the bathroom where I experienced vomiting and diarrhea. I left work early and went home and for the next few hours was in the bathroom alternating between diarrhea and retching, awful, vomiting until there was nothing left in me. Here I am 36 hours later and feeling better but still somewhat nauseous with a tight uncomfortable stomach. My gf became ill as well, we at first thought it was the lamb on my gyro since I was sick first but she experienced the exact same vomiting and diarrhea. I don't know what else it could have been but the food at Falafel Hut. The only other things I had to eat after was my usual cereal for breakfast (mini-wheats), then later a fruit shake made of frozen fruit from home. Â  Needless to say I will not be returning to the Falafel Hut.
