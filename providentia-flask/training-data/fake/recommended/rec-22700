I gave this place another shot after a terrible experience the last time ( long story )----- and I'm glad I did. Stopped here a weekday morning at about 10:30 with my girlfriend --nobody was here( Highly recommend an early lunch here) and we actually got attentive service. The food was top-notch and the Veggie Burger was truly excellent. The crab-cake sandwich that my GF had was also on-point. Â Sweet potato fries & Asian noodle salad were exquisitely prepared. I'd give it 5-stars but this place is a bit on the pricey side so if you're on a budget this is def not the place for you.
