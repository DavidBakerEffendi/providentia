If you're in the mood for Italian, Uva is the most authentic Italian restaurant on the UES.And the backyard garden is so cool!The scenery is  cool.on the other  hand the wait is kind of long.But I keep my  self busy  by looking at the outdoor scene.And the service is nice and sometimes funny to us.so I would recommend this restaurant.
