I went on a Sunday morning at 11.  No line, pretty empty.  I didn't have much of an expectation and it turns out, the burger was just okay.  The bun was soft. Waitress was very friendly and offered us many useful suggestions.  I got the truffle burger and my companion the original. We also got cheesy tots and a side order of fries. Nothing I had was anything I would go back for, let alone wait an hour or two on line for. The most horrible part of the meal was the Goodwich ice cream sandwich.  What a waste of money for $8. After $60 spent on a burger meal, I wouldn't go back. I'd rather have Shake Shack for $10 which includes a burger and fries.
