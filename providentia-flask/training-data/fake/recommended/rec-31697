Breakfast lunch or dinner I can't complain everything has been A plus OK.  I would admit that my favorite meal here is the chicken kebob platter with veggies and/or rice.  Their soups are always top notch and they have the best wait staff that is fast and friendly.   THe Manager always comes to the table and checks if everything is okay...  My friend loves the chef salad there and the portion is HUGE... TRY IT you won't be disappointed.
