Maybe I'm just not a big halal person, but I thought this food was good and nothing more.  Certainly enjoyed it, but didn't blow my mind.  For $5, though, the chicken and rice is a fine deal, especially in the hustle and bustle of the Avenue of the Americas.  The red sauce is super spicy, which I love.  Beware if you have a sensitive tongue. As street fare goes, you could do a lot worse.  I imagine this place is EXCELLENT drunk food, but I haven't had a chance to test that theory.
