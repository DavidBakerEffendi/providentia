Beautiful decor, friendly staff, inexpensive gormet-style food and good selection of booze. Â They can bump up their game a little on the food to really stand out from the other neighborhood selections, but they are already the best pizza at Drexel. On top of that they offer real Italian and Greek specialties you'd have to travel far to get elsewhere. Really a good time anytime I go.
